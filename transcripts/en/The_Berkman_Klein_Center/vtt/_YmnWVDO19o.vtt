00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.420
 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.620
Hello, I'm Terry Fisher.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.420
This is the seventh of
12 lectures on copyright.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.500
We're just past the halfway
point of this lecture series.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.550
By now, you should be familiar
with the rules governing

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.660
what types of creative works are
subject to copyright protection, who

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.980
owns the copyrights in those things,
and how one secures and transfers

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.750
a copyright.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.530
In addition, you should
feel comfortable with three

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.070
of the four major
theories of copyright--

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.590
specifically, the fairness theory, the
personhood theory, and the utilitarian

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.520
or welfare theory.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.970
We arrive, finally, at the
heart of copyright law.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.330
In the next three lectures, we'll
examine the principal rights

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.440
that a copyright owner enjoys
and the corresponding limitations

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.620
upon those rights, designed to
accommodate the interests of the public

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.400
at large.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.350
Here's how my presentation
will be organized.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.490
In this lecture and
the next one, I'll be

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.340
examining the economic rights
enjoyed by a copyright owner.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.290
As you'll see, there are four
clusters of such rights-- first,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.480
the copyright owner's exclusive right
to reproduce the copyrighted work;

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.420
second, the exclusive right to make
modifications of the copyrighted

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.490
work, commonly known as the
right to make derivative works;

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.290
third, the right to control
the distribution, exportation,

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.870
and importation of copies of
the work; and fourth, the right

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.800
to control public performances
or public displays of the work.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.590
Today, I'll be examining the first
two of those rights-- the right

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.890
of reproduction and the
right of modification.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.730
Next week, I'll take up the
third and fourth of the rights.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.180
And the week after that, I'll discuss
the major exceptions and limitations

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:08.020
that copyright law imposes
upon these exclusive rights.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.300
During this tour, I will focus, as I
did during the first half of the course,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.310
primarily on the law
in the United States.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.470
But I will also identify some respects
in which the law in other countries

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.060
parallels or differs from US law.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.970
As usual, I'll be
supplementing my presentation

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.550
with various audiovisual materials,
one of which is in front of you--

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.980
a map of copyright law, the
current version of which

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.510
is available on my
homepage, tfisher.org.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.300
 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.910
So let's begin.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.260
Section 106 of the US Copyright
Statute confers on copyright owners

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.070
a broad and seemingly
unqualified set of rights.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.590
Here they are.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.570
Section 107 through 122 then
carve out of those rights

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.930
a long list of exceptions.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.030
Some of those exceptions are
very specific and narrow.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.840
Others are broader.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.590
The broadest of all is the fair use
doctrine, embodied in Section 107,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.840
which we'll discuss in two weeks.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.740
As you can see, the introductory
clause of Section 106

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.400
makes the rights it creates,
quote, "subject to" end quote--

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.100
in other words, qualified
by-- Sections 107 through 122.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.260
The result of this structure
is that, to get an accurate

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.540
sense of the scope of a copyright
owner's exclusive rights,

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.420
you must oscillate between the generous
grants contained in Section 106

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.369
and the myriad exceptions contained
in the following provisions.

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:44.660
And that's what we'll be doing.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.810
 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.200
The first and simplest of the rights
conferred on a copyright owner

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.750
by Section 106 is the right
to reproduce-- in other words,

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.740
to copy-- the copyrighted work
in copies or phonorecords.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.420
This entitlement is commonly
considered the core of copyright.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.310
The name of this entire
field suggests as much.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.520
The heart of copyright is
the exclusive right to copy.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.650
As it's used in the law,
the term "reproduction"

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.200
has three independent dimensions.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.660
To prevail, a plaintiff
must satisfy all three.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.420
The first pertains to the way
in which the defendant generated

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.960
the allegedly infringing things.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.570
Only if he did so by copying
is the defendant liable.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.770
The second pertains to the character
of the allegedly infringing things.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.390
Only if they constitute,
quote, "copies," close quote,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.360
is the defendant liable.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.480
And the third pertains to the nature
and amount of the material the defendant

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.290
took from the plaintiff.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.420
Only if it rises to the level of, quote,
"improper appropriation," close quote,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.590
is the defendant liable.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.090
We'll consider them in that order.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.130
In patent law, as some of you know,
independent invention is no excuse.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.850
A defendant cannot escape liability by
showing that he dreamed up, on his own,

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.950
an invention that happens to
match the plaintiff's patent.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.800
Not so in copyright law.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.100
There, independent
creation is an excuse.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.250
Suppose, for example, I write a poem.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.350
Later, you, never
having seen mine, write

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.670
and publish exactly the same poem.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.790
I have no claim against you.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:38.230
You infringe my copyright in
my poem only if you copy mine.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.280
So what exactly does that mean?

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.680
The clearest type of copying
is mechanical reproduction.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.020
If you make a photocopy of the piece
of paper upon which my poem is written,

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.600
you have copied it.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.200
If you rip a CD containing a sound
recording, which, in turn, embodies

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.430
a musical composition, you have copied,
specifically in a phonorecord, both

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.090
the composition and the sound recording.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.070
If you replicate a CD-ROM
containing a software program,

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.840
you infringe the
copyright in the program.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.250
None of this should be surprising.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.250
But as used in the
law, the term "copying"

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.130
is not limited to
mechanical reproduction.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.620
It also includes having the
copyright work in mind when

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.330
making a substantially
similar embodiment.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.290
So if you read and memorize my poem and
then write it down, you have copied it.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.720
If you listen to a performance
of my musical composition

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.620
and then record your own rendition of
my composition, you have copied it.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.050
If you watch a movie and then
write a short story containing

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.620
an identical plot, you have copied the
audiovisual work embodied in the film,

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.220
and so forth.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.940
 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.820
The most intriguing cases
in this area involve

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.710
situations in which the defendant
is exposed to the plaintiff's work

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.990
and then, sometime later,
creates a very similar work

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.150
without being aware that it
mimics the plaintiff's work.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.820
In other words, the defendant believes
he is being original, but he's not.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.000
The law governing such
situations is harsh.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.480
In the 1924 case of Fred
Fisher versus Dillingham,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.080
Judge Learned Hand summarized
the relevant rule as follows.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.600
Quote, "Everything registers
somewhere in our memories,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.390
and no one can tell what may evoke it.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.840
Once it appears that another
has, in fact, used the copyright

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.420
as the source of this production,
he has invaded the author's right.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.220
It is no excuse that, in so doing,
his memory has played him a trick."

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.220
Close quote.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.850
The most famous case of this general
sort involved the following facts.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:01.130
In 1963, The Chiffons, a popular
quartet in the United States,

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.890
released a recording of
"He's So Fine," a song that

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.610
had been composed by Ronald Mack.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.170
Here's a brief excerpt.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.753
[MUSIC - THE CHIFFONS, "HE'S SO FINE"]

00:08:10.753 --> 00:08:41.059
 

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:46.910
The Chiffons' recording was a hit in
both the United States and in England.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.730
George Harrison heard
the song, but forgot it.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.920
Six years later, he composed
and performed "My Sweet Lord."

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.572
Here's an excerpt.

00:08:56.572 --> 00:08:58.238
[MUSIC GEORGE HARRISON, "MY SWEET LORD"]

00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:30.810
 

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:35.600
Bright Tunes Music, the
assignee of Mack's copyright,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.440
brought an infringement suit
against Harrison and prevailed.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.550
Both the trial court
and the Court of Appeals

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:46.050
credited Harrison's testimony that he
was unaware of The Chiffons' recording

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.930
when he made his own song.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:52.470
However, they ruled, Harrison
could not escape on this basis.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.650
Here's the key passage in the
appellate court's opinion.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.620
Quote, "It's not new law
in this circuit that, when

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.160
a defendant's work is copied from
the plaintiff's, but the defendant,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.970
in good faith, has forgotten
that the plaintiff's work was

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.890
the source of his own, such
innocent copying can nevertheless

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.230
constitute an infringement.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.380
It's settled that intention
to infringe is not

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.460
essential under the Copyright Act."

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.000
The court then went on to
suggest a possible policy

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.230
basis for this seemingly
unforgiving rule.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.960
Quote, "As a practical
matter, the problems

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.850
of proof inherent in a
rule that would permit

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.070
innocent intent as a defense
to copyright infringement

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.920
could substantially undermine
the protections Congress

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.480
intended to afford copyright owners.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.360
We therefore see no reason to retreat
from this Circuit's prior position

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.600
that copyright infringement
can be subconscious."

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.610
The rule announced and applied by the
court in this case bears emphasis.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.680
Innocent copying is still infringement.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.330
In this special sense,
copyright infringement

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.470
is a strict liability offense.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.330
 

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:08.650
The final, perhaps non-obvious,
aspect of the scope of copying

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:11.620
is that it encompasses translation
of the plaintiff's work

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.190
into a different medium.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.800
So for example, an unauthorized
motion picture version

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:22.350
of a novel, a doll that mimics a
cartoon character, a still photograph

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:27.210
of a ballet are all covered.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.890
So to summarize, a
plaintiff, to establish

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.070
that a defendant has violated
the plaintiff's exclusive right

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:36.900
of reproduction, first must
show that the defendant, quote,

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.290
"copied" the plaintiff's
work, which means either

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.910
that the defendant
mechanically reproduced it

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:47.024
or had the plaintiff's work
in mind, even subconsciously,

00:11:47.024 --> 00:11:48.190
when making his own product.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.810
 

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:55.180
How, then, does a plaintiff
prove copying in this sense?

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.550
There are four techniques listed
in the map in front of you.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:04.020
First, the plaintiff can introduce
direct evidence of copying.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:09.090
Surprisingly often, evidence survives of
a defendant's conscious intentional use

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:13.180
of the plaintiff's work during the
course of his own creative processes,

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.090
and that evidence turns up in discovery.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:21.460
Second, the plaintiff can show that
the defendant had access to his work

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.710
and that the defendant's
work and the plaintiff's work

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:28.100
are sufficiently similar to
raise an inference of copying.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.370
For example, the plaintiff
may be able to show

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.580
that the defendant had the
plaintiff's book on his bookshelf

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.910
or received the plaintiff's
screenplay in the mail.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.670
More commonly, the plaintiff may be
able to show that his work-- say,

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.050
a song or a movie-- was
widely performed in areas

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.290
and at times that would
make it highly likely

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.140
that the defendant heard or watched it.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.920
So for example, few people, at
least in the Western hemisphere,

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.220
can plausibly contend that
they've never heard a Beatles song

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.780
or watched a James Bond movie.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.900
When the plaintiff can
demonstrate access of this sort,

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:08.089
all he then needs to demonstrate
is sufficient similarity

00:13:08.089 --> 00:13:09.880
between the defendant's
and the plaintiff's

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:16.280
work to make plagiarism more
likely than independent creation.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.580
The character and amount of similarity
that's necessary for this purpose

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.830
is sometimes called
probative similarity.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.580
It's different from
the kind of similarity

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.500
that we will discuss in a minute,
under the heading of "Improper

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.790
Appropriation," because
its function is different.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:36.180
Its role, to repeat, is to support an
inference that the way the defendant

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:42.190
created his work was wrong, not that
the amount he took was too much.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:47.270
The courts, unfortunately, sometimes
conflate these two types of similarity,

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.130
but you should not.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.930
 

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.370
What if the plaintiff has no evidence
that the defendant had access

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.580
to his work, but can show
that the defendant's work is

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.250
extremely similar to his?

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.090
Is that enough to show copying?

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.250
US courts use to disagree on this point.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.870
Some Courts of Appeals
said yes; others said no.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.480
All of the Courts of Appeals now seem
to agree that sufficiently, quote,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:19.030
"striking," close quote, similarity
between unusual aspects of the two

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.320
works can suffice.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.380
However, the inference of copying
that arises in such circumstances

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.120
can be overcome if the
defendant demonstrates

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.770
that he did not have access
to the plaintiff's work

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.660
or that both the plaintiff's
work and the defendant's work

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.290
could have been copied from
something in the public domain.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.860
 

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.230
Finally, an especially
powerful way of showing

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.720
copying is to demonstrate
that the same errors can

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.390
be found in both the plaintiff's
and the defendant's works.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.250
Sometimes, such errors are deliberate.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.350
The writers of travel
guides, for example,

00:14:55.350 --> 00:15:00.120
often insert fictitious entries in
their lists of hotels and restaurants

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.370
precisely in order to enable them
to detect copying of their material

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.460
by the publishers of other guides
to the same cities or countries.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.600
This is a very effective way
of ferreting out copying,

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.750
although it can be inconvenient
for the readers who

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:17.200
visit the non-existent sites.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.170
At other times, the
errors are inadvertent.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.850
Paul Goldstein, for
example, points to one case

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.830
in which a legal publisher,
as part of an infringement

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:30.630
suit against another publisher, admitted
that, in 50 pages of the plaintiff's

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:35.580
treatise, there were 138
inaccurate citations,

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:40.560
and the same mis-citations
appeared in the defendant's text--

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.830
embarrassing, but convincing,
evidence of copying.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.250
Assuming that the plaintiff
can surmount this first hurdle,

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.690
the second of the three
things the plaintiff must show

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:56.050
is that the thing the
defendant made through copying

00:15:56.050 --> 00:16:01.430
is sufficiently concrete and
stable to be called a copy.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.160
In the overwhelming majority
of cases, this is easy.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.820
But occasionally, a
plaintiff falters here.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:15.620
The statutory definition the plaintiff
must satisfy is shown on your screen.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.240
From this language, the courts
have extracted the requirements

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.840
that the thing produced by
the defendant be tangible--

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:28.660
in other words, a material
object-- fixed, and intelligible.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:33.010
The most slippery of these
requirements is fixation.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:38.120
You'll recall, I hope, that fixation is
a precondition of copyright protection

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.850
under US law, although not
under the law of most countries.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.280
Here, we encounter a second,
closely related manifestation

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.120
of the laws concerned with fixation.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.900
Not only must the plaintiff's
work be fixed in order

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.390
to enjoy copyright protection;
the defendant's work must also

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:58.830
be fixed in order to violate the
plaintiff's copyright, at least

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.090
under Section 106(1).

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.670
 

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.119
Recently, the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:08.180
decided a complicated and
important case in which

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.170
this fixation requirement
proved critical.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.619
Because the case implicated
several other legal rules,

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:18.480
as well, I'm going to describe
the facts in some detail.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.990
Then, I'll discuss one of the
issues raised by those facts today

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:25.400
and come back to other
dimensions of the case next week.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.960
 

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:34.140
Cablevision is a small cable TV
system based in New York City.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.250
Like all cable companies, it
aggregates audiovisual programming

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.150
from several sources.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:46.280
For example, Warner Brothers may
produce a movie, license it to NBC,

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.690
and then Cablevision
picks up NBC's signal.

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:55.240
Cartoon Network and HBO provide
programming directly to Cablevision,

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.210
and so forth.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.080
As you might expect,
Cablevision pays for the right

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.320
to broadcast this
material either according

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.500
to the terms of voluntary licenses
or through a compulsory license.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.090
Those licenses are
important and complex.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.120
We'll touch on them briefly at
the end of the next lecture.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.080
For present purposes,
all you need to know

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.870
is that these licenses do not
give Cablevision the right

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.930
to make copies of the TV
shows or movies in question,

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:26.240
only to publicly perform them.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.700
So to return to the
narrative, Cablevision

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.310
combines these various
streams of programs

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.790
into a single, composite,
encoded signal,

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:39.890
which it sends via cable,
of course, to its customers.

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.400
Each customer receives the composite
signal through a set-top box,

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:48.440
which decodes it, relays it to a
television, which, in turn, displays it

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.160
to the subscriber sitting on his couch.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.800
If, as is likely, the
subscriber doesn't want

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.860
to watch all shows at the
times they are broadcast,

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.370
he's likely to employ a
device to record them.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.840
Once upon a time, the device
would have been a VCR.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:12.320
Today, it's likely to be a digital
video recorder, commonly known as a DVR.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.500
Then, when the subscriber
wants to watch a given show,

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.440
he plays the copy stored on the DVR.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.480
So this pattern should be
entirely familiar to most of you.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.580
But if you've been following this
course of letters from the beginning,

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.940
it should make you uneasy.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.810
There's no question that the
DVR recording, represented

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:39.920
by the blue dot on this slide, is a copy
of the television shows in question.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.900
The subscriber who makes
those copies does not

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:48.280
have a license from Warner Brothers
or Cartoon Networks to do so.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.725
Is the subscriber then violating
section 106(1) of the copyright statute?

00:19:52.725 --> 00:19:56.410
The answer is yes, but that
violation, as we'll see,

00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:00.030
is excused under the fair use doctrine.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.020
When and how that crucial
principle was established

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.670
we'll discuss in a few weeks.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.240
For now, it's enough to
recognize that the subscriber can

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.850
slip the noose by pleading fair use.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.440
Now, back to our story.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.870
In 2006, Cablevision had an idea.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.050
What if, instead of relying
on individual subscribers

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.170
to make copies of shows
on their home DVRs,

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:30.250
it offered to make copies for them
using a cloud-based technology?

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.810
This would be more efficient and
convenient than the home devices,

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.260
sufficiently so, that the subscribers
would be willing to pay a premium

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.010
for it.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:42.220
So Cablevision created,
though it did not immediately

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:49.540
implement, what it called a remote
storage DVR, or RS-DVR system.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.210
Its main features, in the language
of the court eventually called upon

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.800
to review the system, looked like this.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.640
Quote, "Under the new RS-DVR,
this single stream of data

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.820
is split into two streams.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:07.640
The first is routed immediately
to customers, as before.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:12.660
The second stream flows into a device,
called the broadband media router--

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.850
BMR-- which buffers the data
stream, reformats it, and sends it

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.790
to the Arroyo server, which
consists, in relevant part,

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:26.970
of two data buffers and a number
of high-capacity hard disks.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.710
The entire stream of data
moves to the first buffer,

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.460
the primary ingest
buffer, at which point

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.400
the server automatically inquires
as to whether any customers might

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.310
want to record any of that programming.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.540
If a customer has requested
a particular program,

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:48.000
the data for that program move from the
primary buffer into a secondary buffer

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.890
and then into a portion of one of the
hard disks allocated to that customer.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.510
As new data flow into
the primary buffer,

00:21:55.510 --> 00:22:01.330
they overwrite a corresponding
quantity of data already on the buffer.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:05.950
The primary ingest buffer
holds no more than 0.1 seconds

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.900
of each channel's
programming at any moment.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.820
Thus, every tenth of a second,
the data residing on this buffer

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:17.090
are automatically erased and replaced.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:21.460
The data buffer in the BMR holds no
more than 1.2 seconds of programming

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.330
at any time.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:27.010
While buffering occurs at other
points in the operation of the RS-DVR,

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:30.650
only the BMR buffer and
the primary ingest buffers

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:36.240
are utilized absent any request
from the individual subscriber.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.830
To the customer, however, the processes
of recording and playback on the RS-DVR

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.430
are similar to that of
a standard set-top DVR.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.920
Using a remote control, the
customer can record programming

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.850
by selecting a program in
advance or by pressing the Record

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.940
button while playing a given program.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.550
To begin playback, the
customer selects the show

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:01.430
from an on-screen menu of
previously recorded programs.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:05.450
The principal difference in operation
is that, instead of sending signals

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:10.530
from the remote to an on-set box, the
viewer sends signals from the remote

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:15.720
through the cable to the Arroyo server
at Cablevision's central facility,

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:20.530
which then delivers the program
to the subscriber's home.

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:26.140
In this respect, RS-DVR more closely
resembles a video-on-demand service,

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.890
whereby a cable subscriber
uses his remote and cable

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:33.250
box to request transmission of
content, such as a movie, stored

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.830
on computers at the
cable company's facility.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:40.630
But unlike a video-on-demand
service, RS-DVR users

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:48.940
can only play content that they
previously requested to be recorded."

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.860
So those are the facts.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.030
You can guess what happened next.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:56.820
Cartoon Network and the owners of
the copyrights in the other shows

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.820
that would be delivered to
subscribers through the system

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.820
initiated a lawsuit
against Cablevision, not

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.010
because they thought
this was a bad idea,

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:08.330
but because they wanted Cablevision
to pay them additional license

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:13.740
fees to deploy this new feature,
which Cablevision was unwilling to do.

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.870
The plaintiffs contended that the RS-DVR
system would violate their copyrights

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:21.750
in not just one, but
three, separate ways.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:25.020
First, they argued that
buffering an audiovisual work,

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:30.470
specifically for 1.2 seconds
in the BMR and for a tenth

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:35.610
of a second in the primary ingest
buffer of the Arroyo server,

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:39.700
creates a series of replicated
pieces of the work, which,

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.650
although each one is
stored only briefly,

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:46.590
gives rise in the aggregate
to a copy of that work

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:50.580
and thus violates Section
106(1) of the Copyright Act.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:55.160
Second, they argued that making the
much more durable copies of their shows

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.910
on the Arroyo server
hard drives gives rise

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.816
to a second violation of Section 106(1).

00:25:01.816 --> 00:25:06.600
Third, they argued that the delivery
of the programming from the Arroyo

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.050
server to the subscriber
at the subscriber's request

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:15.580
would constitute an unauthorized, quote,
"public performance," close quote,

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:20.010
in violation of Section 106(4).

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:23.640
We'll discuss the second and third
of those claims in future lectures.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.850
For present purposes, we're
concerned only with the first one.

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:30.370
The district court agreed
with the plaintiffs

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:34.490
that the buffer triggered a
violation of section 106(1).

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:36.860
But the Court of Appeals reversed.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.970
Here's the crucial language in
the appellate court's opinion.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.430
"Copies, as defined
in the Copyright Act,

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:48.230
are material objects in which
a work is fixed by any method

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.530
and from which the
work can be reproduced.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:55.385
The act also provides that a work
is fixed in a tangible medium

00:25:55.385 --> 00:26:00.420
and expression when its embodiment
is sufficiently permanent or stable

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.980
to permit it to be reproduced
for a period of more

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.560
than transitory duration.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.820
We believe that this language plainly
imposes two distinct, but related,

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.850
requirements-- the work must
be embodied in a medium,

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:17.150
i.e., placed in a medium such
that it can be perceived,

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:23.090
reproduced, et cetera, from that medium;
and it must remain thus embodied,"

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:27.020
quote, "for a period of more
than transitory duration.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:31.630
Unless both requirements are met,
the work is not fixed in the buffer.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:35.430
And as a result, the
buffer data is not a copy

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:40.620
of the original work
whose data is buffered."

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.000
Because the data being channeled
toward the Arroyo server

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.750
reside in no buffer for
more than 1.2 seconds

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.780
before being automatically
overwritten, the court

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.200
concluded that the duration
requirement had not been satisfied

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.440
and thus that the defendant's
technology did not

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.160
result in the creation of any copies.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.242
 

00:27:01.242 --> 00:27:03.450
For reasons we'll explore
later, the Court of Appeals

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.590
also rejected the second and
third of the plaintiff's claims.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:10.850
As we'll see, the bases of those
rulings were also highly technical,

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:15.900
and thus arguably a
bit counterintuitive.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:21.850
The net result was that Cablevision was
permitted to deploy its new service.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:25.730
This decision, which the Supreme
Court declined to review,

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:31.000
has facilitated the emergence of many
analogous cloud-based services, which,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.380
in turn, have had huge
economic implications.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:39.400
As Josh Lerner discovered, quote, "VC
investment in cloud computing firms

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.200
increased significantly in the
United States relative to the EU

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.910
after the Cablevision decision."

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:49.220
The decision, it appears, led to
additional incremental investment

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:53.430
in US cloud computing firms
that ranged from $728 million

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.980
to approximately $1.3 billion
over the two and a half years

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.900
after the decision.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.920
When paired with the findings of
enhanced effects of VC investment

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.450
relative to corporate
investment, this may

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:13.130
be the equivalent of $2 billion to $5
billion in traditional R&amp;D investment.

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:17.200
An essential step in the ruling
that catalyzed this investment

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:22.270
was, as we've seen, the court's judgment
that the fixation requirement had not

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.595
been satisfied by the buffer copies.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.280
So let's take a break at this point.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.100
When we resume, we'll consider
the third and arguably

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:39.380
most important component of the
cause of action under Section 106(1),

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.140
the requirement of, quote,
"improper appropriation."

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.883
