00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.800
Congratulations.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.133
You've learned a lot of tools
to solve computational problems.

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:09.401
Now we're going to dive into some of the
most well-known computational problems,

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:11.700
and see how we can use
our tools to solve them.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.500
Along the way, we'll look at
a few famous algorithms and

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.170
concepts that show up often
on technical interviews.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.120
You might not get asked
specifically to solve one of these

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.810
problems in an interview.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.680
But it's common to be presented with a
problem that boils down to one of these.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.369
Make sure you have a crystal clear
understanding of the root problem.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.610
And stay vigilant for instances of
these cases masked as something else.
