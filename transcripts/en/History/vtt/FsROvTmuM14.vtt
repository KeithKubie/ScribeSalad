00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:04.254
[up-tempo music]

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:13.888
[music continues]

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:15.390
So, you got time
to talk about this?

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.183
We need to get together
on this build.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.685
Didn't think this day
was ever gonna come.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.645
Yeah, I got time.

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:24.399
Let's go do it.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.443
You got unlimited resources,
as far as I'm concerned,

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:27.902
but I don't know
what's in your mind,

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:29.738
so I gotta have
some kind of rough idea,

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.781
you know,
what the plan is.

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:34.325
Why don't we do something
in the ceiling, like,
badass deals up here?

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:36.077
So they can get up there
and walk on it.

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:37.871
So, you want some sort
of handrail around it?

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.414
Gotta get up there
and hang out.

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.207
Let's say that's
the outside, right?

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:44.043
I mean, what are we
gonna do on the inside?

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:46.296
You got all this badass going
on, come on, what do we got?

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.339
Well, I mean, that's
a badass outside, right?

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.468
So, the inside of it,
you said you need cabinets
on the top on both sides.

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.219
-Yeah, that's--
-So, I don't know yet.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.804
-I get the cabinets.
-I don't know yet.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.144
I'll figure out
something.

00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:07.484
Well, how-- Can I throw some
ideas out there and you
soak on them a little bit?

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:08.902
Do it.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.320
What if you put a solid,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.531
hardwood wall and floor
in that [bleep]?

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:16.743
-All right.
-Whatever. I mean,
why not just make it sexy?

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.287
Y'all went that far.

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:21.289
-Let's do it. It'll work.
-What do you think?

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.249
It'll work, but what
do you think, though?

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.667
-Yeah.
-It'll work? All right.

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:27.003
I got one more idea
we throw out there with you.

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:29.923
You don't have to go
with any of this at all.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.425
But what if this whole side
of this thing right here...

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:35.470
you got your fender boxes
come out like this,

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.765
what if this whole
son-of-a-[bleep] was clear?

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:41.893
What if the whole side of it
was some kind of plexiglass?

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:45.396
But I need you to kinda be able
to come up with these ideas.

00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:46.898
It's killer.

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:49.150
I mean, you make it
a reality?

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.319
I'll-I'll help you with it,
going through reality,
but we just--

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:52.904
It's my challenge, baby.
I'll handle it.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.824
There's 30 days.
When you say 30 days,

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:59.536
-It's not 40-hours a week
for 30 days.
-I got it. I know.

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:00.578
I got you.

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:02.622
There's 24 hours in a day.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.707
You need three hours of sleep.

00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:06.501
Anyways, back to this.

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.169
All right, so we're
going in the back door.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.879
What are we gonna see
on the walls?

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.756
I don't know.
Figure that out.
I don't know.

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:13.758
-I love [bleep] speakers.
-Yeah, I need speakers--

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:17.011
-I mean, why not?
-Yeah. I'm 24-years-old, dude.
What do you think?

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:19.097
-You got it.
-It's a lot of work.

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:20.849
[laughs] It's gonna be tough,
but that's okay.

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.225
I'll help you figure it out.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.143
Come on, give me some.
