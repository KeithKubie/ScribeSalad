00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.640
So many studies say coffee is hurting you
or coffee is helping you…

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:13.070
everyone wants something out of coffee, but
all it wants to do is give!

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.200
Howdy hot brown water hawkers, Trace here
for DNews.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.070
Scientists have again, and again, and again
tried to find out what coffee is doing to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.220
the human body.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.770
A study in Scientific Reports lays out nicely,
"coffee consumption has been linked to protective

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.810
effects on various common pathologies such
as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.911
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases,
type 2 diabetes, some types of cancer, and

00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:42.500
hearing functions, and it may predispose to
others such as sleep disturbance."

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.900
Whew.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.149
Scientists have been studying coffee since
the 1960s, and a 1972 study in Cell's Biophysical

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.629
Journal tried to find out exactly what it
was doing to our cells, noting caffeine binds

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.329
to broken DNA, and that if it's present during
the formation of new DNA, it can cause breaks

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.059
in chromosomes (which is why we've long known
pregnant humans shouldn't consume it).

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.830
We've also found that when DNA is broken by
other processes, caffeine can play with those

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.480
broken pieces, keeping them DNA broke.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.790
But confusingly, a study in March 2016's Molecular
Nutrition &amp; Food Research found coffee drinking

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.200
reduced DNA breakage by about a third, and
that reduction continued for hours!

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.880
So, coffee (or caffeine really) can break
DNA, or keep it from being broken, depending

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.369
on when the coffee hits your DNA.

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.080
It's important to note, DNA breakage is not
necessarily a bad thing; normal cell functions

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.119
can break it, but so can UV light, and certain
chemicals, and irradiation.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.119
More research be needed.

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.250
In the decades since we started looking into
coffee and caffeine, study after study keeps

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.259
coming out talking about DNA…

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.979
For example, a study in the European Journal
of Nutrition found spontaneous DNA strand

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.270
breaks were somewhat less likely in those
who drank dark roast coffee.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.040
A 2012 study in Cell Metabolism found the
DNA of people who exercised had fewer methyl

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.000
groups -- a specific type of chemical marker
that occurs when DNA goes through a chemical

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.240
change.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.320
Caffeine mimics that methylation!

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.510
This shows exercise and coffee affect the
DNA pretty dynamically!

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.390
Another pair of studies, one with Italians
(who do love their caffé) and another in

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.329
the Netherlands (the Dutch drink 2.6-times
more coffee than Americans), found people

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:27.129
who drink coffee pass their habit to their
offspring, pinpointing several genes associated

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.379
with coffee drinkers!

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:34.670
Which is interesting, because a study in Scientific
Reports found a mutation on gene PDSS2 which

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.799
is associated with drinking fewer cups of
coffee.

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.840
In a twin study using both identical and fraternal
twins, the identicals had higher correlations

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.889
of habits like smoking, coffee drinking and
alcohol consumption; indicating to the researchers

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.489
there was a genetic component.

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:50.749
But it's not just genetics…

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:55.010
You can change your DNA with your behaviors
in life -- this is called epigenetics.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.510
A study in Biochimie found mice that were
chronic over-eaters, passed genetic markers

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.809
to their offspring which then had higher levels
of insulin resistance… so they were more

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.249
likely to be diabetic.

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:08.680
Could this happen with coffee too?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.230
More research is needed again.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.939
In my opinion, a lot of these studies have
more to do with our love of coffee than the

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.920
magical powers of this beverage we happen
to drink.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.230
Coffee drinking is really common.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.359
According to the International Coffee Organization,
over nine billion kilograms of coffee were

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.459
consumed in 2015-16.

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.919
Most of the countries on our planet consume
coffee, it's one of the most consumed beverages

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.989
anywhere (tea is the tops, of course), and
is one of humanity's primary sources of the

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.090
drug caffeine.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.919
And yet, it's super interesting that we still
don't know a lot about the epigenetics of

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:39.919
coffee.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.569
And remember, it's not just about coffee.

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.349
All DNA is constantly affected by the food
you eat.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.879
DNA is created, copied and created throughout
your life -- so you are literally what you

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:49.879
eat!

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.169
So next time you're having a java, think about
your kids.

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:53.949
Because what's happening to them?

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:54.949
Who knows!

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:56.839
More research is needed and science is awesome.

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:58.459
Also I need a coffee.

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.040
Sorry unborn kid.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.449
When you don't get your coffee are you a monster?

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:03.969
Is there a monster inside of you?

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:06.659
You should watch the show of that same name
on Animal Planet GO!

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.519
(Seriously, it's about parasites and worms
and it's amazing, also they have cheesy computer

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:11.599
animation).

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:17.410
Download animal planet go from the app store,
or use the link in the description.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.370
Are you drinking too much caffeine?

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.590
Do you know the medical limit?

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.770
Find out in this video: OMG that video is
so old.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.770
My hair.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.770
Weird.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.050
Have a favorite coffee?

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.699
Tell us cause I want it.

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.120
Go down in the comments, let us know.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.980
