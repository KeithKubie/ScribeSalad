&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston: Good
afternoon and welcome.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.410
I'm Steve Levingston
non-fiction book editor

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.190
of the Washington Post
which is a charter sponsor

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.610
of the National Book Festival.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.310
First a couple of
housekeeping things.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.880
We'd like to extend
a word of thanks

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.190
to the festival's
co-chairman David Rubenstein

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.510
and the other generous sponsors
who've made this event possible.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.450
[ Applause ]

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.750
&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston:
And if you'd

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.830
like to contribute your
financial support there's some

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.590
information about
that in the program.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.250
Before we begin I've
been asked to remind you

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.340
that these events are being
recorded by the Library

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.130
of Congress, which may broadcast
them at some future date.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.670
After our author's
presentation there will be time

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.980
for questions, but if you
don't want to become perm --

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.710
the library's permanent
collection, it may be best

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.490
to let someone else
ask the questions.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.510
Many people have the
look of brilliance.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.490
There are many people
who sound brilliant

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.600
but few people have
both of those qualities

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.120
and a third most important one.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.600
They prove their brilliance.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.250
Steve Coll is that rare person.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.510
His works speak for itself.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.130
He's a two time winner of the
Pulitzer Prize once a reporter

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.000
for the Washington Post
for his overage of the SEC

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.350
and another time for
his book Ghost Wars,

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.490
his account of the CIA's
role in Afghanistan.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.730
Now he's dean of
Columbia Journalism School

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.500
and a staff writer
at the New Yorker.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.990
I was honored to work under
him when he was managing editor

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.460
of the Washington Post.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.590
Steve has written eight books.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.220
These include the breakup
of AT&amp;T, an exploration

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.430
of Exxon Mobile's power and a
history of the Bin Laden family.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.560
His latest book Directorate S
is a follow-up to Ghost Wars.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.540
It takes us into the
aftermath of the US invasion

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.150
of Afghanistan in 2001
and the U.S. experience

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.290
over the next 17 years, which
can be described as one --

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.640
as one reviewed put
it best as "A period

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.650
of American ignorance,
atrocity and error."

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.720
Reviewers have called the book
impressive and definitive.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.460
They have noted the 550
interviews Steve conducted.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.920
Their praised as
literary prowess.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.710
But the story Steve tells
is a dispiriting one.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.890
As the New York Times wrote
"The topic is important.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.430
The treatment compelling.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.060
The conclusions persuasive."

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.170
But that reviewer
Andrew Bacavich noted

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.120
that America's policy
makers are not listening

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.260
and are not taking
Steve's reporting to heart.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.560
"Just don't expect anything

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.680
to change" Bacavich
said, concluded sadly.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.040
Steve is a force for
illumination and understanding

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.840
of America's past and present.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.510
So please welcome me -- please
join me in welcoming Steve Call.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:10.430
[ Applause ]

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.730
&gt;&gt; Steve Coll: Thank
you so much Steve.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.030
Thank you all for coming out.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.940
I really enjoyed working with
Steve and fantastic colleagues

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.240
at the Washington Post.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.140
I miss them a lot so I'm always
glad to get back to Washington.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.480
And I'm also glad to get back to
a city that has so many people

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.150
in public service and engaged
in international policy,

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.450
which are kind of my subjects.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.120
I wonder just a quick show
of hands how many people

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.360
in this room have been
to Afghanistan since 2001

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.530
in service in one
way or another?

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.350
Yeah a significant number.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.150
So.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.730
[ Applause ]

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.190
&gt;&gt; Steve Coll: I have about 30
minutes to introduce the book

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.870
to you so I'm going to
have to be efficient.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.640
As you might notice
it's not a thin book.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.660
And so the way I try to
give you a flavor of it is

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.540
by giving you a sense of what
it's about, where it came

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.840
and what story it tells.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.960
But mostly what are,
what are several

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.930
of the most important themes
in this history that I can try

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.360
to draw out and give you
a little bit of flavor for

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.700
and then I look forward -- I'll
read a little bit at one stage

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.470
as well just to give
you a flavor of some

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.170
of the reporting on the ground.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.740
Then I look forward
to your questions.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:27.270
So in February 1989 the
final armored column

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.640
of the limited contingent of
Soviet forces in Afghanistan

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.000
as the Soviet occupation
army was called crossed

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.800
over the Friendship bridge
of the Amu Darya River,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.770
officially ending
the Soviet occupation

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.280
of Afghanistan during
the 1980's.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.630
General Gromov was the final
Soviet commander and he got

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.440
down from the last
armored personnel carrier

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.980
and turned his back on
Afghanistan and walked out

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.790
and was greeted by his son who
gave him a bouquet of flowers.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.360
That's how the Soviet war ended.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.500
In December 2014 the Obama
administration thought it was

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.270
ending the war in Afghanistan
although it intended to stay

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.080
and hand off support
in an advisory role

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.250
under operation resolution
support.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.800
But none the less the United
States at that time thought

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.780
that it's combat operations
direct combat operations

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.650
in Afghanistan were ending
so they held a ceremony

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.800
in a gymnasium in the bunkered
and fortified headquarters

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.220
of the International
Security Assistance Force

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.320
in Afghanistan in Kabul.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.710
And they handed out, they
had some military bands.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.880
They were -- but they were
very well inside an area

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.970
that they sometimes
had experienced

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.480
of being rocketed in.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.610
So they handed out kind of
a program for the ceremony

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.670
that included instructions about
how to get down on the floor

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.670
and cover your head in
the event of rocketing.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.520
So that was how the
U.S. war ended once.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.170
And then a year later
it started again.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.520
And today as you know
we're still actually

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.880
in direct combat
operations in Afghanistan.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.040
We're fighting two
wars there one directly

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.170
against the Islamic state
al-Qaeda affiliated groups.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.940
And then another that
advisor and assist war that,

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.880
that we thought we were
moving into in 2014.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.350
So it's been 17 years.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.860
A lot of frustration.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.850
A lot of sacrifice.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.590
Hundreds and thousands
of Americans volunteered

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.450
over the course of those
years to serve in Afghanistan.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.040
More than 2,000 American
soldiers died

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.700
as did hundreds of contractors.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.790
More than 20,000 soldiers
suffered injuries.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.750
The casualties among Afghans and
Pakistani's were even greater.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.620
The war that, that followed the
end of the American invasion

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.520
in 2001 caused about 140,000
deaths directly by the end

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.760
of 2014 according to
estimates by researchers

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.870
at Brown University and 10
of thousands more since then.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.400
And of course Afghans

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.240
and Pakistani's have
suffered the most losses,

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.460
even greater losses.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.820
So why over so many years
and despite some many efforts

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.750
and strategies has the
United States failed

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.640
to achieve its goals
in Afghanistan?

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.250
Has it failed to bank
with the Taliban,

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.250
failed to stabilize the country,

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.240
failed to create a
self-sustaining independent

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.040
constitutional republic
or democracy of some sort.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.340
It's a long story.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.710
It's a complicated story,
but as I say I want to draw

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.760
out a few themes and
tell a few stories

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.060
around what I think are some

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.810
of the recurring
problems in the war.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.700
So the first is the
problem of war aims.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.430
Why are we there?

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.730
Which was a question that was

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.920
of course never really formally
addressed before we invaded

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.190
Afghanistan because
the war was a hurried

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.310
and a provisional response to
September 11th attacks designed

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.850
to disrupt al-Qaeda which was
in Afghanistan and had carried

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.590
out the attacks substantially
from there.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.720
To disrupt their leadership
before they could launch what

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.730
was presumed to be
following attacks.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:08:00.040
And so the war never really
reckoned with what Afghanistan

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.330
after the invasion would be

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.970
because it was really
being conceived within two

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:09.370
or three weeks of the shock
of the September 11th attacks.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.600
So in the subsequent period
after the Taliban fell

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.000
at the end of 2001 and al-Qaeda
largely escaped Afghanistan

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.860
and migrated into Pakistan, the
war since then has been plagued

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:26.110
by recurring arguments and
confusion over war aims.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.410
I want to talk about that.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:33.070
Second thing that has really
been repetitive although it was

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:37.620
confined to the period
when Hamid Karzai was

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:42.930
in office was the failure to
consolidate a relationship

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.840
with Karzai that would
serve American interests

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.550
in the transition to
a post Karzai world.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.020
We, we really lost our
relationship with Karzai and,

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.750
and our investments

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.960
in democratic Afghan
politics also faltered,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.070
not only because of our
conductor or decision making.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.900
Afghans had a lot to do with
that too, but I think the,

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.860
the story of the failure
of the relationship

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.920
with Harmon Karzai is
particularly interesting

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.570
because it goes to the
big problem of Pakistan.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.790
The biggest puzzle I think
for a lot of people who served

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.440
in the war and certainly
for a lot

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.500
of Afghans throughout the war
after 2001 and particularly

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.110
when the Taliban started to
revive around 2004 or 2005

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.680
in seriousness, was
why the United States

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.270
and NATO were willing
to accept the sanctuary

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.950
and the support the
Taliban enjoyed,

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.220
still enjoy across the
border in Pakistan even

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.900
when Pakistan was receiving
hundreds of millions of dollars

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.340
in U.S. aid and even
after it became obvious

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.250
that the Taliban were
prevailing or certainly working

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.990
up a pretty bloody
stalemate in Afghanistan

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:55.350
because of the sanctuary
and the training and the aid

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.620
that they enjoyed
covertly from Pakistan

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.080
and from Pakistan's principle
intelligence service,

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.040
Interviews Intelligence or ISI.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.870
The title of the book
Directorate S refers

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.650
to the covert action arm.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.770
It's what the American's
sometimes called the,

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.090
the covert action arm of ISI,

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.480
the Pakistanian Intelligence
Service that works with groups

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:20.110
like the Taliban related
groups in Cashmere to carry

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:21.990
out what Pakistan's army sees

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.290
as its foreign policy
interests in the region.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.520
Of course the American's
knew all about ISI

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.820
because we had collaborated

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.570
with them during the 1980's
during the Soviet Union along

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.500
with Saudi intelligence, we
pumped billions of dollars

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.220
into the Alphagan rebel
force based in Pakistan.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.240
That also prevailed
of the Soviet Union

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.130
because it enjoyed this physical
sanctuary and covert aid

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.090
that we participated in.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.660
So why, why did we fail
to recognize ISI's revival

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.650
and why did it turn out
to be so flummoxing?

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.680
Something we can talk about.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.720
Alright so that's the real
principle narrative of the book.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.530
It opens -- Ghost Wars closes
on the eve of the 9 11 attacks.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.840
It's about the, the history

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.640
between the Soviet
invasion and 9 11.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.560
And this is intended
as a second volume

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.140
of Ghost Wars although its kind
o f a funny thing as a writer

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.800
to write a second volume of
a book that wasn't intended

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.850
to be the first of two, but
that's kind of what this is.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.420
And it ends where Ghost Wars
stops quite deliberately

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.580
and comes forward to
something like the present day

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.260
and has many of the same
reporting and narrative,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.790
story-telling strategies
as the first volume.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.540
Alright so I promised to go over
this, this subject of war aims.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.060
One of the things-- you know
I was kind of a beat reporter

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:43.210
on the war after 9 11 because
I had accidental expertise

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.510
about Afghanistan.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.190
I had been assigned out
there by the Washington Post

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.490
as a foreign correspondent.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:48.790
I had covered the war

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.630
on the ground long before 9 11
before anyone was really very

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:52.930
interested in it.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.520
But it was a -- I, I became kind

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.000
of a professional obsession
and a great interest.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.880
I loved the landscape and the
people that I met in Afghanistan

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.660
and Pakistan and I found
the war and the structure

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.050
of covert action that shaped
so much misery and radicalism

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.000
in the region to be
an important subject

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.650
and one that fascinated me.

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:16.870
But after 9 11 because of that
background I kept going back

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.190
to the region Pakistan

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.750
and Afghanistan doing
a lot of reporting.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.490
And I, and I also was a creature

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:25.480
of Washington covering the
National Security bureaucracy

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.990
and interagency debates
about U.S. Policy

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.680
in Afghanistan and in the war.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.030
And so when I went
back to do the research

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:36.910
to really excavate the history
of decision making in Washington

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:41.410
about policy in the Afghan war
and policy toward Pakistan,

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.510
I was surprised and a
little bit disheartened

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:49.810
to encounter what I didn't
fully appreciate as a kind

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:54.050
of beat reporter which is the
repetitive nature of the debates

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:58.310
about why are we in Afghanistan
and who is our enemy?

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.420
The Busch administration
through several phases,

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.300
right up until the
last days and months

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.540
of the Bush administration
convened

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.420
in a classified conference room

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.340
in the Eisenhower
Executive Office Building

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.720
which is next door
to the White House.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.420
If you're walking by the
White House it's over there

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.820
to the right, that very
ornate looking building,

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.120
on the fourth floor.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.410
And they would typically
spend a whole day wrestling

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.870
over what direction to
take in Afghanistan.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.210
They'd have the intelligence
analyst come in, in the morning

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.590
and try to brief the facts.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.980
This is what the map looks like.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.410
These are, these are the,
the principle ethnic groups.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.350
Here are the principle factions.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.790
And then they would leave and
the policy makers would debate.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.460
And they would get to
these basic questions.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.580
Are the Taliban our enemy?

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.570
There were no Afghans'
on the planes on 9 11.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.420
So far known the Afghan
Taliban have never carried

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.740
out a terrorist attack
as an organization

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.630
against the United States
in the U.S. or in Europe.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.470
They were attacked initially
because they were correctly seen

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.510
as providing sanctuary
to al-Qaeda.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:08.110
Their alliance with al-Qaeda
was always uneasy and debatable.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:12.280
And so in these policy decisions
starting in 2006 repeating

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:18.530
in 2008 and in 209 and in 2012
and in 2014, the best minds

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:19.830
in the U.S. government.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:24.020
The best informed south Asia
policy makers would return

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.810
to this conference room,
write up white papers try

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.170
to develop recommendations
to the president.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.660
And one of the questions they
kept returning too is what are

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.620
our vital interests
in Afghanistan

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.910
that justify the kinds of
sacrifices that we ask young men

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.220
and women in uniform
to make over there?

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.830
And an example would be in
2009 during the first year

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.140
of the Obama administration
a new group came in went back

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.450
to the same conference room,
picked up the white papers

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.210
that the Bush administration
had left behind went back

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.510
to this question.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.200
And they were cleared eyed about
what the question should be.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.790
As taxpayers you would want them

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.600
to be asking what vital
interests really justify this

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.710
kind of military sacrifice?

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.820
And they worked on that
for weeks and months.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.450
And in the end they
identified two.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.120
One was al-Qaeda which
was still carrying

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.050
out international attacks
from the, from the region

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.160
against the United States,

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.120
attempting attacks inside
the United States also

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.670
in Europe and elsewhere.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:32.190
And the second was the security
of Pakistani's nuclear weapons

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.600
because Pakistan has
about 100 nuclear weapons.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.410
It has a lot of radical
groups on its soil.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:40.080
And the nightmare scenario would
be if somehow Pakistan became

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.220
so destabilized that
these weapons fell

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.510
into the wrong hands.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.910
But consider this contradiction,
the first of half a dozen

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.990
that we can review over
the next 20 minutes.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.960
Neither al-Qaeda nor
Pakistani's nuclear weapons were

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.430
in Afghanistan in 2009,
where the president was

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.300
about to send 100,000 troops.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.600
So if the vital interests are

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.860
in Pakistan why are we fighting
a war next door in Afghanistan?

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.650
The, the president's
advisors were smart enough

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.030
to understand this
contradiction,

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.330
so they wrestled with it.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:16.120
And they said "Well it's
sort of an indirect reason

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.870
because if Afghanistan
falls apart,

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.730
then al-Qaeda will come
back into Afghanistan

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:27.010
and that may also
destabilize Pakistan.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.330
So we've got to shore up
this neighbor in order

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.880
to pursue the vital
interests that are next door."

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.180
I don't know.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.600
I mean as a parent sending
a child into harm's way,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.880
that feels a little bit indirect
to me as a, as a, as a war aim.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.350
Well the other war aim then
that might justify this sort

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:48.330
of sacrifice is you are
going to fight the Taliban.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.900
You're going to prevent
the Taliban

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:54.660
from consolidating the momentum
which by 2009 it had quite a lot

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.900
of on the ground in Afghanistan.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.100
But the policy makers
including --

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.100
particularly during the early
Obama years were really divided

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.480
about whether the Taliban
should be understood as an enemy

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.030
of the United States partly
for the reasons I described.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.660
They're indigenous
to Afghanistan.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.910
It was pointed out
in these debates.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.710
They are part of the
fabric of southern

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.490
and eastern Afghanistan.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.590
They have, they have
not declared war

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:19.890
against the Unites States.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.190
They're abhorrent.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:22.490
Their ideas are abhorrent.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.320
We certainly don't want
them to take power.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.760
But are they an enemy?

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.180
The truth was that President
Obama did not believe the United

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.540
States should attempt to fight a
forever war against the Taliban

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.830
and that there was
neither the political clock

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.780
in the Unites States nor the
resources nor the prospect

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.040
of military victory to
justify such an endeavor.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.040
But his generals had
sold him on the idea

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.130
of a counter insurgency
war that could succeed

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.580
in Afghanistan the way it was
perceived to have succeeded

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:55.210
in Bagdad after the
surge at there in 2006.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.570
And so the president
was reluctant

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.730
to at least initially --

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:04.200
that's a funnier
conversation than Afghanistan.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.060
Let's make some noise in here.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.510
Sorry. People are.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:16.710
[ Applause, Cheering ]

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.270
&gt;&gt; Steve Coll: It's hard to
get a laugh out of fighting

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.680
and dying, but we'll
keep trying.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:27.420
Anyway there's a scene where
the president basically makes it

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.810
known through his White House
aid's that he doesn't want

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.070
to fight this forever
war against the Taliban,

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.430
so his aids go into this
secure conference room

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.340
or the situation room
one day and they say

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.600
"Have we ever really
said that it was our aim

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.470
to defeat the Taliban?"

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.080
And the Pentagon
representatives are appalled.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.620
And the next day they come
back with a big PowerPoint deck

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.410
that shows all the
different statements

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.150
that American presidents
and senators have made

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.270
about our intention to
vanquish the Taliban

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.570
from the face of the earth.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:56.870
They say, "You may not
want to fight this war,

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.750
but you've said you've
signed up for it."

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:02.400
And, and so yes we have declared
our interest in defeating it.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.300
But when the troop surge
announcements were made,

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.320
if you parsed that language,
he's very careful not to declare

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.380
that we intend to defeat the
Taliban on the battlefield.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.280
The, the war aim was to reduce

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.750
or reverse the Taliban's
momentum to create space

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:23.710
for Afghan forces to take the
lead and, and essentially kind

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.070
of Vietnmization
of the Afghan war.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.370
And that was achieved.

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.350
It still has been
achieved today.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:33.200
The war is a stalemate now,
just as it was in 2007.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.240
One of the episodes the book
described repeatedly is this --

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.310
these very popular
classified maps

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.110
that the CIA would produce
called the District Assessments

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:44.050
which were derived from a
similar mapping exercise carried

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.620
out during the Vietnam War.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.780
They would take all
of approximately --

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.510
Afghanistan spans
approximately 400 districts,

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.740
administrative districts
and color code them based

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.990
on the latest intelligence and
open information as to whether

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.870
or not they're controlled
by the Taliban or controlled

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.170
by the Afghan government,
contested or locally controlled

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.440
by some other war lord.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.400
And essentially they would
come in and unfurl these maps.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.820
Everyone would poor over them
looking for subtle changes.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:13.600
The reality is they haven't
changed color in 10 years.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.840
They're made every six months
and things move around.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.050
And green appears here
and red appears there.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.770
The wars stalemated
and it's stalemated

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:25.570
because the Taliban have no air
force and they have no answer

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:30.080
for the U.S. Air Force, so they
can't mask very successfully.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.350
But also neither
the NATO led troops

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:38.170
which after peak numbered
150,000 in Afghanistan in 2010.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:43.590
Nor the Afghan forces after we
reduced our presence has had an

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.100
answer for the sanctuary in
Pakistan for the role of ISI

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.790
and supporting the
Taliban in the war

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.430
or for the Taliban's coercive
control of quite a lot

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:57.070
of rural districts particularly
in the south and east.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.970
Loosing Hamid Karzai.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.720
Again as a beat reporter
I, I covered Hamid Karzai

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.180
for a long time over the years.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.600
I've interviewed him
a couple of times

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.680
and watched him in
press conferences.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.560
He's a fascinating figure
and certainly was as,

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.540
as he became the
unexpected president

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.230
of Afghanistan after 2001.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:18.150
And I thought I understood
him reasonably well.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.790
I was aware certainly by the
time I was working on this book

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.230
that he had gained a reputation

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.280
as being this very
unstable individual

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.900
who was constantly going off and
attacking the United States and,

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.480
and kind of involved
in conspiracy theories

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.070
and that sort of thing.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.080
Again I was surprised when
I kind of excavated as many

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.980
of the private conversations
that he had with his own cabinet

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.600
or with the American's
that he was very consistent

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.510
over the years about one thing.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:48.270
Every time an American would
come to visit him he would say,

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.600
"You're not doing enough to
put pressure on Pakistan.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.190
These sanctuaries
are unacceptable.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.410
And ISI's interference
in the war is going

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:56.980
to make the war unwinnable.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.350
Why are you not doing this?

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.450
Why are you not -- why
are you treating them

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.710
as if this isn't going on?"

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.380
And the American's
at first would say,

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.210
"Well yeah I don't think you
understand President Musharraf

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.940
who is seen as a reliable
ally of the United States.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.240
He's a friend.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.540
He's trying to do his best."

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.150
Later the American's agreed
that ISI was a problem

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.520
but they felt they couldn't put
too much pressure on Pakistan

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.030
because after all Pakistan
itself was convulsed

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:23.690
by internal violence caused
in part by the migration

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:25.770
of al-Qaeda into Pakistan.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:29.010
They had the worst domestic
terrorism they ever experienced

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.280
in 2009, 2010.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.580
And if a vital interest

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.420
of the United States was
preventing Pakistan's nuclear

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.960
weapons from getting
into the wrong hands,

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.410
you couldn't very well and go in

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.790
and exacerbate the
almost civil war

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.310
that Pakistan was
experiencing at that point.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.190
Nonetheless, we kept
confusing Karzai by kind

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.270
of fluffing off his question.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.100
In the summer of 2008
then candidate Obama flew

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.770
into Afghanistan on a
campaign visit and he went

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.320
to meet Karzai and his cabinet.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.420
And this cabinet
really they all didn't

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.720
like each other very much.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.690
They rarely cooperated on much,

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.660
but they all got together
before the meeting and said,

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.980
"Let's agree to emphasize,
to possible President Obama

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.770
that it's all about ISI.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.180
It's all about Pakistan."

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.920
So when each of them
went around the table

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.760
and said something they all
said, "You really have to focus

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.770
on this problem because
the sanctuary is going

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.030
to make the war unwinnable."

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:22.990
And when the United States
didn't do anything about it,

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.380
worse, when the United States
made it clear to Karzai

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.480
that it thought that maybe
Pakistan was actually more

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.590
important to the United
States than Afghanistan,

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.920
he understandably
became deeply confused.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.220
There's a scene in the book

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.230
where Vice-President
Joe Biden goes out early

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.190
on in the Obama Administration
to meet with Karzai.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.780
The Obama Administration
came in and a lot

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.460
of the administrations come
no matter which party it is

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.800
and they think whatever the
last guys did was exactly wrong

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.390
so we're going to
do the opposite.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.340
And one of the syndromes
and this case was

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.390
that the Obama folks thought

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:57.980
that the Busch administration
particularly President Bush

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.890
personally had coddled Karzai,

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.490
had spent too much
time holding his hand.

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.910
Had, had accommodated
too much corruption,

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.290
too much drug dealing and it
was time to get tough on him.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:11.040
So Biden was sent out to deliver
this message, you know the,

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.100
the era of the friendly
video conference is over.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.100
You, you got to clean up your
act and you can't expect us

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:21.000
to accommodate you the way
the last administration did.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.520
So he's goes into this
private meeting with Karzai.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.120
Karzai starts the
meeting by saying,

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.750
"You know Mr. Vice-President,
you really need

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:29.050
to do more about Pakistan.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:31.310
You really need to
do more about ISI."

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:34.320
And Biden replies,
"Mr. President,

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.790
Pakistan is 50 times
more important

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:39.690
to the United States
than Afghanistan."

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:43.990
So maybe not the most diplomatic
way to put pressure on Karzai.

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:48.230
But you know in a lot of
south Asia and certainly a lot

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.500
of similar parts of the
world, it's common to sink

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.800
into conspiracy thinking.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.080
And the way it wet for Karzai
was when he looked at the fact

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.670
that the United States wasn't
putting any pressure on Pakistan

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.980
and that Pakistan
was by the admission

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.320
of many American Generals
and intelligence officers,

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.020
that's its role in
the war was critical.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.940
He began to think well the
United States must want Pakistan

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.370
to be reviving the Taliban.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:14.930
He must want Pakistan to be
destabilizing Afghanistan.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.730
He must want the American -- the
American's must want this war

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.670
to grind on so that they can
justify having a long-term

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.350
military presence
in the country.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.790
This is the kind of
confusion that you can create.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:29.170
Now diplomat after diplomat,
general after general would go

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:30.790
to Karzai and say,
"No Mr. President,

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.500
there's no such conspiracy.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.810
We're just doing our best to
try to keep this war going

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:37.110
in the right direction."

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:39.490
But Karzai was absolutely
convinced that the American's

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:43.380
after a certain point were
deliberately allowing ISI

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.800
to create this war so
that they could justify a

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.340
long-term presence.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.630
At one point a guy named Jim
Dobbin's in 2013 he goes out

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.760
and meets with Karzai to try
to talk him out of this idea.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.780
He says, "Mr. President, by now
you've got the Snowden material,

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.200
the Wiki Leaks, millions
of documents.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.500
Read them.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.210
Can you see any trace of
this plan, this conspiracy

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:07.210
that you're attributing to us?"

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.870
And Karzai looks
at him and says,

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:12.000
"Well maybe you don't
know the plan.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.840
Maybe you're not briefed."

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.290
"You know there is a deep
state in America", he said.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.690
Okay. A lot of the book tries

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.410
to describe how these
decisions cascaded,

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:28.260
built one on another how these
misunderstandings developed

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:31.940
at the highest levels among
decision makers in Washington

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.270
and Islamabad, and Kabul.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.890
But I also felt that I should
try to write about the war

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.690
as it was experienced on
the ground, and particularly

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:45.080
after the United States launched
this counter-insurgency campaign

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:51.270
in southern Afghanistan
in 2010, 2009, 2010, 2011.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.870
It was a war very distant war.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:57.500
Didn't get quite all of the
attention the reality of it.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.930
I don't think quite
soaked through.

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:03.040
It was a volunteer army fighting
in very difficult terrain.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.580
But it was a product of a kind

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.490
of faith encounter
insurgency expeditionary

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:08.960
counter insurgency.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.300
As I mentioned followed out of
the perceived success in Bagdad.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.870
And if you were in town, in
national security circles

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.820
in Washington, circa 2009
2010 it was like a bubble.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:23.620
It was like a Bit coin or
some other kind of sense,

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.650
self reinforcing sense that
his idea is going to solve it.

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:27.950
We're going to go
out there we're going

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:31.290
to run this counter insurgency
campaign, connecting people

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.470
to their government,
walking through villages,

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:36.650
fighting it out one
path at a time.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:39.080
And it turned out I
places like Kandahar

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.130
to be a very violent war.

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:44.070
And so I looked for a
way to tell the story

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:47.470
through one unit's experience
in the heart of the campaign.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:51.390
And I chose the part of the
campaign that was fought in the

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:55.790
so called green zone to
the, to the west of Kandahar

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.450
which is the Taliban's
birth place significant city

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.330
in the south of Afghanistan.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:03.100
It's called the green zone
because though it's desert,

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.530
there's the Arghandab
river flows through it

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:07.950
and irrigation is
made possible much

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:10.120
of the year through this river.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.790
And the vegetation around
in this green zone is

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.160
incredibly thick.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.940
That's great orchards
with drying houses

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.530
and berms almost worse
than Normandy in terms

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.970
of terrain to try to fight in.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:28.910
And foliage that's almost jungle
like in the canopy it creates.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:32.110
10 foot marijuana plants
being a feature of this.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.710
Big marijuana farming industry.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.170
One of the jobs the American's
had was to go out and cut

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.890
down these 10 foot plants
then set them on fire

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:42.440
which was not always
objected to as duty.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:48.000
But it was -- the Taliban had
been imbedding in this zone for,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.350
for years and years
and they build an

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.650
incredible infrastructure.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.650
And the, and the purpose of the
counter insurgency campaign was

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.840
to go in and knock them
out once and for all.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:59.620
So I'll just read you
a little passage from,

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.920
from that campaign.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.400
The flavor of it.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.630
"So the initial phase of
Colonel Art Kandarian's campaign

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.400
in the green zone wasn't
that much different of that

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.690
of the U.S. Army in the American
West during the 19th century.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:14.320
Build forts in Indian
country and poke around.

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:19.680
Forward American units
detains suspected insurgents

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.820
and used retinal scanners to log
them into classified data bases,

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.330
but interrogations and human
intelligence collection

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:28.960
in Kandahar that summer rarely
produced insights besides the

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.000
known fact that many
Taliban fighters were from

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.500
or trained in Pakistan."

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.660
So the platoons that I write

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:41.290
about were former artillery
units that had been converted

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.250
to infantry because
during this period

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.960
of the war the United States
military was so stressed

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.510
by the cascading consequences
of fighting hard in Iraq

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.640
and Afghanistan at
the same time,

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.680
that they were piecing
together task forces

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.100
out of different units.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.360
And they were asking
artillery men

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:04.300
to fight close infantry patrol
wars with a lot of IED's

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.880
and implanted explosives.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.150
And, and this is you know a lot

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:13.230
of these artillery men had been
trained to fight with big guns

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:15.140
on bases at a remote distance.

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:19.030
They were engineers and
they weren't used to this.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:23.380
They -- so they would build
these outposts in the middle

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.190
of the green zone, barely
being able to see five feet

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:31.850
over the wall and then they
would go out and patrol on foot

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:36.750
by contact, trying to just
draw the Taliban into contact.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.090
"Platoons depended on their
most experienced sergeants

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:40.390
to survive.

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:43.190
Sergeant Josh Strickland had
served two tours in Iraq and one

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.570
in Afghanistan before joining
third platoon a battery

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.760
of the 1-320th the
artillery misfits.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.810
During the first couple of weeks
of -- at combat outpost Noland,

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:55.180
Strickland's patrol
could not walk 100 years

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.440
without hitting an
IED or getting lit

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.890
up by Taliban from
several sides.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.340
Listening to the enemy radio
talk they learned the enemy knew

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.910
they were artillery
not infantry.

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:09.190
In general, Strickland thought
the lowest ranking first time

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:10.900
soldiers adjusted
to the stress better

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.670
than the more experienced
artillery men

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.300
because the rookies
had no expectations

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.300
from prior deployments.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.840
Because of Strickland's
experience and uncanny ability

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.810
to avoid IED's soldiers
continually asked him

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:23.880
to walk point on their patrols.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.590
He chose to walk 10 to 15
feet ahead of everyone else

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.650
so that he could carefully
identify the best route and so

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:32.160
that if he did make a mistake
it would cost one life instead

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.460
of several.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.050
He was ultimately
wounded and medivaced

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.240
to Kandahar airfield four times.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.560
Each time as he recovered

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.560
in the hospital a doctor would
ask Strickland if he wanted

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.250
to go back or go home.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:43.550
"What am I going to say?"

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:44.850
he thought.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:46.150
He went back.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:47.450
Day after day they
shouldered their loads,

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:49.280
stepped on presence patrols
and hoped for the best.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.900
They walked past villagers
near their outposts

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.940
who were neither
helpful nor hostile.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.010
One elder near Strickland's
base kept a pigeon

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:58.690
that he would let fly every
time a platoon departed,

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:02.100
apparently to let the Taliban
know they were on the march.

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.940
By July IED's and the escalating
casualties had rattled the most

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.300
experienced infantry men.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.390
Every soldier carried
70 to 90 pounds

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:13.050
of gear, water and ammunition.

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.550
They patrolled at
night to avoid the sun.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.800
They drank water continually
to stave off dehydration.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.440
The IED's were so thick
around the bulldog encampment

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.560
that they had to clear 100 years
at a time from the walls out.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.540
A lot of soldiers
struggled with the stress.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:31.130
The first platoon of the
1-320th started out with 19 men.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.940
After three patrols, they had 6.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:38.110
80%, 80% Bravo company's
personnel had

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.320
to be replaced during
Strickland's tour

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.060
because of combat
vets severed limbs,

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.950
concussions or other injuries."

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:49.460
Now you think of those
percentages, I mean that sound

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.470
like Battle of the Bulge.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.830
Wasn't, it -- wasn't present

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:58.400
in American life
that part of the war.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.720
And one of the reasons
that I want to finish

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.480
on the last theme I
want to touch on is

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:08.520
because we really didn't
have a national debate

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.740
about the war during the time

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.860
that these sacrifices
were being sought.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.850
And we also failed to
reckon with the kind

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:24.490
of political strategy that was
necessary given the history

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:28.940
of wars of this kind to really
fashion any kind of exit

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.930
from the war that
would be sustainable.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.660
One of the contradictions that
keeps recurring in history is

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.950
that every general who
goes out to command.

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.700
They command usually for a
year at a time, maybe two years

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:43.360
at a time If there, if
they stay for a long while.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.410
Every general who goes out for
the American effort will say,

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:51.000
"There is no military victory
possible against the Taliban.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.690
The only way this
war will end will be

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:56.340
through political negotiations
and some kind of settlement."

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.690
And yet again and again
military action is, is,

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:03.060
is resourced ahead of
political strategy.

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:07.190
And there is very little
effort of a serious kind made

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:11.340
to bring the regional
powers, the great powers,

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:12.850
the international system

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:15.190
into negotiation to
stabilize the war.

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:19.990
The book recounts this very
interesting secret negotiation

00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:22.710
the Obama administration
carried out with the Taliban

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:25.980
between 2010 and 2013.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.330
It failed for a bunch
of reasons.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:31.010
The Trump administration is
trying something similar now.

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:34.700
But it was always treated
as kind of a Hail Mary pass

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:37.630
and never given the serious
international attention

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:39.730
that for example
accompanied the efforts

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:44.680
to cap Iran's nuclear program
with the P5 powers in Europe

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.950
and everyone else involved.

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:52.760
It's kind of a tragedy that we
keep repeating the same strategy

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.060
again and again.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.180
And expecting a different
result, while asking

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.250
for such large sacrifices
from our own soldiers

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.840
and those of our allies.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.140
Thank you for listening.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.440
I'll take a few questions.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.240
Thanks.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:16.830
[ Applause ]

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:18.160
&gt;&gt; Thank you for your remarks.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.610
Really appreciated that.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:23.730
In your discussion you
talked about American aims,

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:25.290
what about the Pakistani aims

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:28.570
and specifically the
Pakistan's interest in India,

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:31.650
and how that plays
out in Afghanistan?

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:32.950
&gt;&gt; Steve Coll: Great question.

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:35.030
So and it's a big
part of the book.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:38.870
Short version Pakistan's foreign
policy and military policy

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:41.240
of course is very heavily
influenced by its army,

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.380
so the outlook of civilian
politicians is much less

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.700
relevant when you talk about
something like Afghanistan.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:54.880
And, and as you say Pakistan's
army principle concern is India

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.520
in which it believes seeks
Pakistan's demilitarization

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.930
or dismemberment.

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:07.330
And the Pakistan army discovered
with our help during the 1980's

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:08.630
that his asymmetric strategy

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:12.490
of supporting Islamist militia
groups against India in,

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:16.700
in the region was a successful
way for a smaller country

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:20.110
with a smaller population
and a less powerful economy

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:22.480
to hold its own to deter India.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.050
And so that's been their
historical strategy

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.130
and Afghanistan has been part
of it is why Pakistan was one

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:30.450
of only three countries
in the world

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:32.130
that recognized the
Taliban government

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.570
when it ruled Afghanistan
in the 1990's.

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:36.970
They see India as kind
of using Afghanistan

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:39.020
to sort of encircle Pakistan.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:44.130
And then they have a direct
confrontation to their east.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:48.840
The -- a [inaudible] question
is why did Pakistan go back

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:55.530
into partnership with the
Taliban after 2005 2006?

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:59.850
Because for all of Pervez
Musharraf's limitations

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.130
as Pakistan's military
leader and president,

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:07.110
there was a period in 2002 2003
where he was arresting a lot

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.950
of al-Qaeda figures
cooperating a lot

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:11.460
with the United States
on counter terrorism.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.770
Looking not to particularly
get involved with the Taliban.

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:17.550
I think probably just
hoping they would fade away.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:19.590
But several years later
it became clear first

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:23.160
to front line American officers
and intelligence collectors

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.420
and then eventually
to the whole cabinet,

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.750
that ISI was back in action.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.050
That they were going back

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:30.950
to the same old strategies
they'd used before.

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:33.090
And then so why, why did
the high command make

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:36.200
that decision 2004 2005 2006?

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.150
A kind of a mystery that I
worked on in my research.

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:41.580
I'm not saying -- I don't
think I solved it entirely,

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:45.050
but I think there were a
couple of important factors.

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:49.130
One was that the Pakistani's
sense of our involvement

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:50.790
in Afghanistan and with them

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.410
over the years is
we're not reliable.

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:53.710
We come, we go.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:55.350
We come in when we
need something.

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:57.420
As soon as we have
it then we go.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:01.890
And in 2004 and 2005 we
were all fighting in Iraq.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:04.140
And the Bush administration's
view was

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.440
that Iraq was the main effort
and that Afghanistan was

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.290
at peace and they turned
over security in the country

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:13.000
to NATO allies and declined

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.590
to resource significant American
commitment to the country.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:19.210
And so when the Pakistani
general saw the Dutch coming

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:22.020
in to provide security
in southern Afghanistan,

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.080
and they saw the American's
concentrating in Iraq,

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.520
they basically said
to themselves

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.420
"So we've seen this
movie before.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:29.720
They're, they're going home.

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.630
They're leaving us with this
neighborhood and India's going

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:35.870
to take advantage of this if
we don't defend our interests."

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:37.170
That was one reason.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.000
I think the second
was around this time,

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.400
United States did this
big strategic nuclear deal

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.700
with India.

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.250
India's a natural
21st Century ally

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:47.200
of the United States
in a lot of ways.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.710
And they wanted India
to, to feel rewarded

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.520
in strategic partnership.

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.020
But they essentially said
to the Indian government,

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.830
"We forgive you for having
a nuclear weapons program.

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:03.230
And, and you're now legitimate
as a partner of ours."

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:05.710
And we said to the
Pakistani's at the same time,

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.560
"You're not getting this deal.

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.110
You're not reliable enough.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:12.080
You give away your nuclear
weapons to through [inaudible]."

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.020
Pakistani's said, "Okay
you've made yourself clear.

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.740
India's your strategic,

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.970
your strategic ally
for the 21st Century.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.740
We're your rent a cop.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:25.010
You know we're going to get
after our own interests."

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:27.490
And I think that's a lot
of why they went back to,

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:29.100
to pursuing the Taliban's
revival.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.400
Yes?

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.700
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much for
your presentation.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.680
My question is do you think
that the debate on this war

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.950
and on many recent
wars would be enhanced

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:39.370
if we reintroduced
the, the draft?

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:40.890
&gt;&gt; Steve Coll: It's really
interesting question.

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:43.640
I mean you know the,
the strength

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.340
of the American military as an
institution, as a journalist

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:51.410
if you encounter it, you can
see many of its great strengths.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:55.660
And they're rooted in the, in
the revival of a volunteer army

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.380
after the debacle of the Vietnam
War and the effects it had

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:03.910
on the, on the military
as an institution.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:07.540
But I'm so struck at how
segregated the experience

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:11.470
of sacrifice has been in both
wars because of the geography

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:13.670
of volunteerism in the country.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:16.910
And I do think that a lot
of the populism and disgust

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:18.320
that the country has expressed

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.990
about its decision making
elites particularly in some

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:24.700
of the states and
communities that volunteered

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.500
to follow leaders into
these wars, is located in a,

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:33.860
in a kind of uneven
understanding of the failures

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.350
of these wars of the,
of the promises betrayed

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:39.850
and the price paid even where
the sacrifices seen as noble.

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:44.250
The extraordinary price that's
paid by people coming home with,

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:47.630
with missing limbs
and, and broken spirits

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:50.140
from repeated concussions
and so forth.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:55.180
So I, I'm personally
I kind of --

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.950
it's not fashionable in
the zip code where I live,

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:02.880
but I think national public
service is a, is a good policy

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.010
and it doesn't have to all be
conscripted military service

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:08.300
to be successful but these kinds

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.340
of sacrifices should
not be isolated

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.630
from our shared experiences.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:13.930
And they are.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.700
They were in this case.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.500
Yes?

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:24.140
[ Applause ]

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:29.100
&gt;&gt; You're description of ISI in
Pakistan makes it sound sort of,

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:34.100
not to be facetious, but like
the deep state of Pakistan.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.840
So two questions.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:40.700
What, what is Imran Khan's
relationship going to be to ISI?

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:48.560
And secondly coming back to Sy
Hersh's alternative scenario

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.110
for the, the capture
and killing of,

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:56.360
of al-Qaeda's you
know Bin Laden,

00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:00.130
do you put any credence in that?

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:03.810
&gt;&gt; Steve Coll: So Imran Khan
is a really fascinating figure.

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:07.640
I wrote a profile about him in
the New Yorker in 2012 I think

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.690
when he was first
bursting onto the scene.

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:12.350
He was a very entertaining
person to hang

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:13.690
around with and write about.

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:17.920
So if you are interested in him
I -- you can find that online.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.470
At the time I went back and read
it when he became Prime Minister

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:24.210
and I was surprised at that time
he really spoke pretty boldly

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:27.830
about the army which is not
a thing to do in Pakistan

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.300
if you want a political future.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.780
He was critical of the army
very openly at that time.

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.120
But I think he's seen now

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.910
as having become
partner of the army.

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:40.750
And the army has -- made
a very clear decision

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:44.350
and understandable one
that it doesn't want

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:46.430
to rule Pakistan directly.

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:49.900
The reputational costs,
the institutional costs,

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.510
the costs in the
international system are high.

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:57.340
Better to rule indirectly
through civilian politicians

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:00.590
who can deal with the domestic
problems of the economy

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:04.520
of negotiating with the
IMF, of all of the problems

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.940
that Pakistan perennially
endures.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:11.400
And so Imran Khan I think
has been willing to cooperate

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.020
or to share space with the army.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.590
You know there're debates
about how much of lackey

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:18.510
of the army he is, but I think
the record is he's stopped

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:23.020
criticizing them and he's
accepted their clear kind

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.570
of frame work of support
for him to take power.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:28.100
Will he be able to
accomplish anything?

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.020
I'm, I'm doubtful.

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:35.140
And I, I think he might be able
to do a few things domestically,

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:38.380
particularly with his
anti-corruption drives.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:43.080
But in foreign policy clearly
that belongs to the army

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.280
and I don't -- if he tries
to move in that direction --

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.180
every civilian politician
who has tried

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:51.370
to challenge the army's ideas
about regional policy and,

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:57.850
and foreign policy has lost
office in a, in a coup or kind

00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:59.860
of indirect electoral coup.

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:01.160
So he knows that history.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.810
That goes back 30, 40 years.

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:04.110
&gt;&gt; Hersh's Story.

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:05.410
&gt;&gt; Steve Coll: Oh Hersh's story.

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:08.800
I, I mean Sy is an American
legend and a colleague

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.490
and someone I respect
a great deal.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:15.090
And so all I can say is I
researched that same subject

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:17.750
and I didn't see
evidence for the, the,

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:22.020
the account that he obtained
from the unknown sources

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.960
because they're, they're
just background sources.

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.130
I, I, I didn't find
those sources.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:29.870
You know Sy he does
have a record sometimes

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:33.700
of reporting things that
seem couldn't possibly be

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.620
and it turns out it's true.

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.260
So I you know in
Pakistan I'm willing

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.690
to believe anything
about Pakistan.

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:43.070
But I, I, I really worked
that thing pretty hard and I,

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:47.250
I don't see evidence for
those, for those claims.

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:50.010
Do I have time for one more?

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:51.310
Wrap it up I'm told.

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:54.270
So I've got a card that
says literally wrap it up.

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:56.980
So we'll -- you're going
to have the last word.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.370
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:02.280
I will not apologize if I
offend anybody because I --

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.440
as you can hear I'm,
I'm not from here.

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.810
I'm originally from Poland.

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:07.110
Living in Canada now.

00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:10.710
So I hope my question
won't sound like hostile.

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:12.670
But I, I think like --

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:15.570
especially Like I remember
watching the movie Charlie

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:17.760
[inaudible] many, many years
ago and there was this scene

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:22.330
when Charlie goes to like
CIA or government and he ask

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:25.260
about like Afghanistan or
like central Asia department.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.370
And there's like three kids
from fresh out of college.

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:30.170
And, and I think what really

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:33.610
like considering the American
involvement or not now

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:35.900
like I think some
places especially people

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.680
from other countries with
all due respect for like,

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:42.160
like soldiers fighting, American
soldiers and Canadian soldiers

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.740
in other countries,
soldiers fighting

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.280
and sacrificing their life.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:49.800
Is there really like some
kind of a government body

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.000
that like has like a
really good knowledge

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.350
and understanding of the area?

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:54.650
&gt;&gt; Steve Coll: Yeah.

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:56.180
So it's, it's, a great question.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:46:02.130
I think expertise
about Afghanistan

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:05.220
and Pakistan was scant on 9 11.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.520
And it was a problem.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.410
There really wasn't
anyone in the cabinet

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:10.580
who had experience
of the region first.

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.440
I'm not sure there was anyone in
the cabinet or the senior ranks

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.070
of the administration
who've actually been

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:17.810
in Afghanistan on as of 9 11.

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:19.450
Compow [phonetic],
Richard Armistead

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:21.700
of the state department knew
the region reasonably well,

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.340
but primarily collaborating

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:26.670
with the Pakistan army
during the first Gulf War.

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:29.580
And so their perspective was
very much located around the,

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:33.290
the stabilizing force
of the Pakistan army.

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:35.730
And that influenced some
of the early debates.

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:39.670
There were CIA people who knew
quite a lot about the resistance

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:42.140
to the Taliban because they'd
been working with them.

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:45.610
And they did get to the table
and offered some initial advice.

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:50.990
But as a broad matter I think
the failure to see ISI go back

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:55.960
into action until it was pretty
much too late in 2007, 2008,

00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:01.100
was partly a function of the
lack of high level understanding

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:03.540
about the complexities
of the war

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:05.620
and the complexities
of the region.

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:08.170
A lot of it, more of it was
about the distraction of Iraq.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:09.950
But I think that was a factor.

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:12.140
And then for those of us
who would, who would --

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:15.290
been working on this and, and
were really engaged with it,

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:17.040
it was frustrating
sometimes to think

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.380
that our government really
didn't get it at some level.

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:24.770
By 2008 I -- by 2007, 2008
I wouldn't say that anymore.

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:26.270
I mean I knew enough
of the people

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:27.570
who were making decisions.

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:30.120
The army had been out in the
field, people multiple tours.

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.860
You had a lot of Dari speakers
and Pashto speakers going

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:35.060
into the military now.

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:38.130
You had a cabinet that had
finally really spent a lot

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:39.700
of time with this problem.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:45.780
I think by 2000, 2007, 2008 the
cabinet level decision makers

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.870
yeah they did understand
what the problem was.

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:51.830
And I used to go around
to, to friends in 2009,

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:53.730
2010 I was working
down here at the time.

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:55.790
I'd say "You know
finally everybody

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:58.630
in the system understands
what's going on.

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:02.450
The problem is that doesn't
make it possible to solve it."

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:04.260
Nobody you know that,

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.080
that clarity has not produced
insights about how to,

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.030
how to untie this knot.

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:11.830
And, and you still see
that happening today.

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:15.890
Yeah but there the expertise
accumulated at a great cost

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:21.570
and it wasn't the expertise
of a, of a solution.

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:22.870
Thank you all.
