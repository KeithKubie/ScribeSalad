00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040
in their family that they were depending
 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.040
in their family that they were depending
on has developed a very serious illness

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050
on has developed a very serious illness
 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.360
on has developed a very serious illness
and that's throwing their entire

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370
and that's throwing their entire
 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.060
and that's throwing their entire
financial state into utter chaos or

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070
financial state into utter chaos or
 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.860
financial state into utter chaos or
maybe they've developed a condition that

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870
maybe they've developed a condition that
 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.630
maybe they've developed a condition that
makes it impossible for them to work or

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640
makes it impossible for them to work or
 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.430
makes it impossible for them to work or
you know you can you can imagine the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440
you know you can you can imagine the
 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.320
you know you can you can imagine the
potential range of catastrophes and

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330
potential range of catastrophes and
 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.060
potential range of catastrophes and
they're coming to see you because

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070
they're coming to see you because
 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.100
they're coming to see you because
they're anxious and depressed but the

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110
they're anxious and depressed but the
 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.630
they're anxious and depressed but the
reason they're anxious and depressed is

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640
reason they're anxious and depressed is
 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.759
reason they're anxious and depressed is
because everything they have ignored has

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769
because everything they have ignored has
 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.729
because everything they have ignored has
popped its head back up and is hell-bent

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739
popped its head back up and is hell-bent
 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.490
popped its head back up and is hell-bent
on their destruction and often you see

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500
on their destruction and often you see
 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.259
on their destruction and often you see
people who are being attacked by five or

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269
people who are being attacked by five or
 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.000
people who are being attacked by five or
six of these monsters at the same time

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010
six of these monsters at the same time
 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.790
six of these monsters at the same time
and it isn't their mental illness that

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800
and it isn't their mental illness that
 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.440
and it isn't their mental illness that
stops them from being able to deal with

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450
stops them from being able to deal with
 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.390
stops them from being able to deal with
it although that's you know whatever

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400
it although that's you know whatever
 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.979
it although that's you know whatever
weaknesses you have are going to

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989
weaknesses you have are going to
 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.170
weaknesses you have are going to
interfere it's the fact that what

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180
interfere it's the fact that what
 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.330
interfere it's the fact that what
they're facing is no damn joke and if

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340
they're facing is no damn joke and if
 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.979
they're facing is no damn joke and if
you were facing it you'd feel exactly

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989
you were facing it you'd feel exactly
 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.440
you were facing it you'd feel exactly
the same way so then you're trying to

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450
the same way so then you're trying to
 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.360
the same way so then you're trying to
come up with practical solutions to

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370
come up with practical solutions to
 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.550
come up with practical solutions to
these tremendously complex problems and

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560
these tremendously complex problems and
 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.350
these tremendously complex problems and
that's a very

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360
that's a very
 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.920
that's a very
very well it's extraordinarily difficult

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930
very well it's extraordinarily difficult
 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.179
very well it's extraordinarily difficult
generally speaking people often don't

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:32.189
generally speaking people often don't
 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:34.010
generally speaking people often don't
come to a therapist until they've

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020
come to a therapist until they've
 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.290
come to a therapist until they've
exhausted their entire range of

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300
exhausted their entire range of
 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.869
exhausted their entire range of
resources they cannot figure out what to

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879
resources they cannot figure out what to
 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.990
resources they cannot figure out what to
do and so you know in a situation like

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000
do and so you know in a situation like
 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.939
do and so you know in a situation like
that you can administer antidepressants

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949
that you can administer antidepressants
 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.619
that you can administer antidepressants
and maybe that will help the person

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629
and maybe that will help the person
 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:48.140
and maybe that will help the person
increase their stress resistance but as

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150
increase their stress resistance but as
 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.809
increase their stress resistance but as
a and it may be that because they're

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819
a and it may be that because they're
 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:51.980
a and it may be that because they're
depressed and have been brought down

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990
depressed and have been brought down
 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.170
depressed and have been brought down
that they are in fact exaggerating the

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180
that they are in fact exaggerating the
 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.209
that they are in fact exaggerating the
danger of some of the smaller monsters

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219
danger of some of the smaller monsters
 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.490
danger of some of the smaller monsters
that are after them but making the

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500
that are after them but making the
 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.499
that are after them but making the
person more stress resilient doesn't

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509
person more stress resilient doesn't
 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.480
person more stress resilient doesn't
give them for example a new job and it

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490
give them for example a new job and it
 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.670
give them for example a new job and it
certainly doesn't bring back the person

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680
certainly doesn't bring back the person
 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.110
certainly doesn't bring back the person
they've been living with for two years

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120
they've been living with for two years
 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.209
they've been living with for two years
who has a degenerating neurological

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:08.219
who has a degenerating neurological
 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:10.369
who has a degenerating neurological
disease or some form of cancer but these

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:10.379
disease or some form of cancer but these
 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.070
disease or some form of cancer but these
things are major you know I often see

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080
things are major you know I often see
 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.110
things are major you know I often see
people who well they're in a

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120
people who well they're in a
 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.249
people who well they're in a
relationship maybe they're rather

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259
relationship maybe they're rather
 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.309
relationship maybe they're rather
isolated older older people one of the

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319
isolated older older people one of the
 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.050
isolated older older people one of the
partners is dying in their entire

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060
partners is dying in their entire
 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.700
partners is dying in their entire
financial situation that has become

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710
financial situation that has become
 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.179
financial situation that has become
catastrophic it's like that's not a

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:26.189
catastrophic it's like that's not a
 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:28.610
catastrophic it's like that's not a
mental illness man I mean they may have

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620
mental illness man I mean they may have
 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.860
mental illness man I mean they may have
got into that situation because of one

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870
got into that situation because of one
 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.930
got into that situation because of one
inadequacy or another but you don't even

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940
inadequacy or another but you don't even
 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.850
inadequacy or another but you don't even
want to push that too far because that

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860
want to push that too far because that
 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.320
want to push that too far because that
sort of thing can happen to anyone

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330
sort of thing can happen to anyone
 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.659
sort of thing can happen to anyone
and and will in fact happen to most

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669
and and will in fact happen to most
 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.640
and and will in fact happen to most
people in one form or another at least

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650
people in one form or another at least
 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.800
people in one form or another at least
at some point in their lives so you want

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810
at some point in their lives so you want
 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.350
at some point in their lives so you want
to be damned prepared for that you want

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360
to be damned prepared for that you want
 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.329
to be damned prepared for that you want
to be prepared for that because it's

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:47.339
to be prepared for that because it's
 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:50.540
to be prepared for that because it's
bitter and and harsh and anxiety

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550
bitter and and harsh and anxiety
 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.579
bitter and and harsh and anxiety
provoking and painful but if you're not

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:52.589
provoking and painful but if you're not
 

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:55.879
provoking and painful but if you're not
ready that it's also held and often you

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889
ready that it's also held and often you
 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.010
ready that it's also held and often you
can stop things from becoming hell even

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020
can stop things from becoming hell even
 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.629
can stop things from becoming hell even
though you can't stop them from being

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639
though you can't stop them from being
 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.459
though you can't stop them from being
bitter and painful and anxiety provoking

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:01.469
bitter and painful and anxiety provoking
 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:04.579
bitter and painful and anxiety provoking
and all of that you can at least delimit

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:04.589
and all of that you can at least delimit
 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:06.619
and all of that you can at least delimit
the catastrophe enough so that it

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:06.629
the catastrophe enough so that it
 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:08.689
the catastrophe enough so that it
doesn't permanently bring you and the

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699
doesn't permanently bring you and the
 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.820
doesn't permanently bring you and the
people around you down and that stuff's

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830
people around you down and that stuff's
 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.439
people around you down and that stuff's
not so bad right that's a hell are at

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449
not so bad right that's a hell are at
 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:13.550
not so bad right that's a hell are at
least it's a lot better than the

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560
least it's a lot better than the
 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.899
least it's a lot better than the
alternative so this is the problem you

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:17.909
alternative so this is the problem you
 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:20.059
alternative so this is the problem you
know things object things are obstacles

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:20.069
know things object things are obstacles
 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:23.029
know things object things are obstacles
well how big is the obstacles the same

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039
well how big is the obstacles the same
 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.790
well how big is the obstacles the same
it's the same question as how big is the

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800
it's the same question as how big is the
 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.679
it's the same question as how big is the
predator that's lurking outside the door

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:27.689
predator that's lurking outside the door
 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:29.929
predator that's lurking outside the door
of our cave it's exactly the same

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:29.939
of our cave it's exactly the same
 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:32.779
of our cave it's exactly the same

problem except construct conceptualized
 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:35.360
problem except construct conceptualized
abstractly and I would say exactly the

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370
abstractly and I would say exactly the
 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.920
abstractly and I would say exactly the
same systems that you're gifted

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930
same systems that you're gifted

same systems that you're gifted

ancestors used to conceptualize the
 

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.060
ancestors used to conceptualize the
lurking predator

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070
lurking predator

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350
are the systems that are activated now
 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.650
are the systems that are activated now
when you encounter the re-emergence of

when you encounter the re-emergence of
 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.390
when you encounter the re-emergence of
all the monsters that you've ignored

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400
all the monsters that you've ignored
 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.630
all the monsters that you've ignored
it's the same neurological platform you

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.640
it's the same neurological platform you
 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.560
it's the same neurological platform you
think well how could it be otherwise

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570
think well how could it be otherwise
 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.950
