1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,190
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,870
joining me today as a sociologist, a
physician, a professor at Yale University,

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,970
and author of the new book blueprint,

4
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:14,930
the evolutionary origins of a
good society. Nick Christakis,

5
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,150
welcome to the Rubin report.
Thank you for having me, dude.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,370
I am happy to have you here sir.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,380
But I'm depressed that I have to start
the show the way I sort of have to start

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,380
the show and I suspect, you know
how I have to start the show. Yeah.

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,920
So do you want to set it up for me?

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,350
Well, I mean we do just have to get
this out of, I know, I know. I mean,

11
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:37,210
I knew when the book was published.
I mean,

12
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:39,970
I've been working in the book for nine
years and I knew when it was published

13
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:44,830
that I would have to revisit those
events from 2015 which, you know,

14
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:49,240
we're just a challenging period of
my life. Um, thankfully in the past.

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,600
I'm really glad to have it behind
me. Yeah. But I recognize that.

16
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:54,610
So you tell whatever part
of it you want to tell.

17
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,800
Okay. So you are and were a
professor at Yale? Yes. This is,

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,710
this is in I think the fall
of 2015. Yes, it fall of 2015.

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,810
And your wife Erica, who's also a
professor, uh, childhood development.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,060
She was an instructor but yes. Yes. So uh,

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:15,150
she basically wrote a piece that said it
was a defensive free speech and it was

22
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,440
sort of worked around the Halloween
costume idea that you know,

23
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:23,680
you should wear what you want but you can
try to be respectful of people but you

24
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:27,430
know, we shouldn't have some sort of
top down version where people, you know,

25
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:30,700
administrators or professors
are telling students what were,

26
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,100
you offered her a bit of a defense on
that and now I'll throw it in the clip.

27
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:39,160
Is that fair? Fair. Okay.
Let's throw it to the clip.

28
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,620
Don't need to bend down. I'm not bending.
What's your name? I don't want this.

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,500
I do not want you to take care. I
do not want, I do not respect you.

30
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,470
I'm going to hear that. I'm looking at
this rec in your face like I'm disgusting.

31
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,730
Okay. I am off and I'm sick
watching them argue with you.

32
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,780
I believe we've been standing on stage
literally for at least five to six hours

33
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,220
between you and Halloween,
which we last night to now,

34
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,520
we've been arguing with people who are
not willing to be listened to for a long

35
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:09,720
time. And all I see from
you is arrogance and ego.

36
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,590
I am sick looking at you. I am
disgusted watching, argue with you.

37
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,970
You are not listening.
You are disgusting.

38
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,430
I don't think you understand that.
And before I wasn't I before,

39
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:29,280
I was not angry per say,
I was disappointed.

40
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:32,250
Maybe I thought maybe there was
room for it before an apology.

41
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:36,420
You've clearly told us that you did not
plant. Offer an apology for your words.

42
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,500
You left the meeting last night
to go home and vent. Tweak.

43
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,420
Do not interrupt me to tweet from
your Twitter and then the filaments.

44
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:47,070
Twitter,
you showed no remorse.

45
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,520
You tried to let your wife leave that
conversation without having answered for

46
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:55,140
herself. That is disgusting. That is
sick. And now I wasn't angry before.

47
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,680
I was not angry before,
but now I am actually angry sir.

48
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:01,480
I really do not interrupt me.
I was not angry.

49
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,400
And now I want your job to be taken from
you. I don't want you to have this job.

50
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,360
I am disgusted knowing that you work
at Yale University where I will get my

51
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:14,610
degree. Well, I will look back and think
I have to argue with you. All right?

52
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,980
Don't Miss Sarah. Don't
do it. Don't do it. Third,

53
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,960
to not do it.

54
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,140
This is not the day you do not want to
play this game with meters out of thing.

55
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,050
You don't wanna play this game
with me. Okay? Understand that.

56
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,920
Look me in my face first of all
and understand that you are such a

57
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:33,310
disappointment to this university,
to your students, to yourself.

58
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,080
Do the things that you do claim to agree
with you are you want free dialogue.

59
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:41,860
You want free speech. This is how it
works. Someone speaks, you listen,

60
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,700
you're not cut them off. You did not
do these, these condescending gestures.

61
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:48,550
You do not smirk.
You look them in the face and you wait.

62
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,770
You wait until it's your turn.

63
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,170
Okay? So before we even dive into
that, the second we played the clip,

64
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,520
you let out a big exhale.

65
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,070
You just not was interested
in this anymore or it's
depressing to look back at.

66
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:05,040
Both are true. It's, you know, it's, um,

67
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,190
I was in the courtyard for two hours
and 15 minutes from four to six,

68
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:13,191
15 about an hour of footage has been
released of from five or six different

69
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:16,980
vantage points. You showed one clip that's
typically not the clip that's shown.

70
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,450
Um, so many people put
stuff online you can read,

71
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,540
you can piece together the
whole hour between five and six.

72
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,640
For the first hour that I
was out in the courtyard,

73
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:30,690
I listened quietly to the
students. Um, you know,

74
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:33,960
there's a lot of stuff that, that young
woman said that's just factually wrong.

75
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,860
Um,

76
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,860
she's alluding to an event that occurred
the night before at the Afro Afro

77
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,260
American Cultural House at Yale where
there was a huge event with hundreds of

78
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:46,750
students. Um, it had been
announced at the beginning that,

79
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,040
that we would have to leave that
event at the conclusion it was,

80
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,390
I can't remember the precise timing,

81
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,280
but I think it was
scheduled from six to eight.

82
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,640
My wife had to teach a class from seven
to nine, so she deals in the evening.

83
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:01,080
So she told her students she'd be
late and we'd stay from six to eight.

84
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,920
She did in fact speak
to the crowd. She, um,

85
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,630
had to leave to teach an eye.

86
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,350
We had a student in the hospital actually
that evening that I was responsible

87
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:14,010
for and that also was known.
So,

88
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,730
so when she said that we tried to
leave, that's not, that's false. Um,

89
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,760
you know,
I think that um,

90
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,960
many of the students were swept
up in a kind of a mob fervor.

91
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:29,400
I think they behave badly.
Um,

92
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,170
they should have known better.
I think they were trying to assert power.

93
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,240
If I had a tool when I was that age that
could get grownups into trouble. Right.

94
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,040
Uh, you know, probably I would just
get doing it nonstop, you know,

95
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,820
and they have found a tool often
are doing it. Yes. Yes. And so,

96
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,840
but so I think what distressed me is I
think at some point in the background of

97
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:54,450
that footage that one of the
administrators, actually the author,

98
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,830
what happened is,
is a man by the name of Howard.

99
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,460
I had moved from north western university
to Yale and had assumed a new position

100
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:08,330
there. And he had written an email. He
had written a memo while at Northwestern,

101
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,650
uh, admonishing students not
to wear a offensive costumes.

102
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,860
And I should say for the record that
many of the students that many of the

103
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:19,730
costumes that he or anyone else would find
offensive, I too would find offensive.

104
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,100
I wouldn't like these costumes.
I,

105
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:26,180
I'm well aware of the long
history of racism in our society.

106
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,500
I am well aware of the ways in which,
uh,

107
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,320
there's trafficking and certain cultural
tropes that put down other groups.

108
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:37,520
I reject. I am of, I've a
very pro immigrant policy.

109
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:41,930
I believe system. I, I think
that anyone can be an American.

110
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:43,940
I love the idea that we have open borders,
you know,

111
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:48,750
I mean I have all set of beliefs that
are around openness and welcoming or

112
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,200
lefty. Yeah. I am quite lot. I am
a lefty. I'm left of center plate.

113
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:54,650
I mean I have some conservative ideas,
some libertarian,

114
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:58,460
I think of myself as a classical liberal
and I think of myself as very pragmatic

115
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,260
and policymaking.
So I like,

116
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,370
I like markets to address
most allocation of goods,

117
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:07,310
but I also very concerned about market
failures and then I want government

118
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:11,940
intervention. Anyway, so,
um, so, uh, so that, anyway,

119
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,190
that man who was,

120
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:17,060
I then had moved to Yale and then he
took out of mothballs this email that he

121
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,460
had sent at Northwestern
five or 10 years earlier,

122
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,990
got a bunch of Yale administrators
to sign it and then send it off.

123
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:27,500
And in it he had links to approved and
non-approved costumes are very costumes

124
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:29,900
which were deemed to be
offensive in his email.

125
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:34,190
There were links to lots of
those ostensibly offensive
costumes and the students,

126
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,770
there had been a lot of
conversation at the time.

127
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,840
The New York Times had a big piece like
the previous month about the growing use

128
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:44,960
of Halloween costume advice at American
colleges. So it was in his, like guys,

129
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,160
this was the third,

130
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:49,040
his email was the third email that
had been sent out telling students,

131
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,680
giving them advice.
So in my wife's class,

132
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:54,890
many of the students in the class and
other students in the college where we,

133
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,910
the subpart of Yale that
we were responsible for
had told her that they felt

134
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,810
this was very infantilizing and they
didn't really need advice on what to wear.

135
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,460
And so my wife from a
developmental perspective wrote
a response to this email,

136
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:11,360
which itself had been, was signed
by 13 administrators. It, it didn't,

137
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,490
it was framed as guidance, but it
sort of had the color of law. And um,

138
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,870
so she wrote a response saying,

139
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,610
and her intellectual point was
not wear whatever you want.

140
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:24,650
Right.
Her intellectual point was,

141
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,760
do you students at Yale in your
twenties early twenties late teens,

142
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:33,650
early twenties really need older
adults to tell you what to wear,

143
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,520
provide you guidance. You should think
about that and decide whether you really,

144
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:41,090
and apparently many students
did want such guidance.

145
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,810
And so then I was then thereafter,
then all hell broke loose.

146
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:48,620
And I was in the court courtyard
and did the best I could. Yeah.

147
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,310
What do you make of the reason we chose
that cliff was because there is the

148
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:55,800
other more famous clip of, of the growth,
really liberating with, there were many,

149
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,490
many,
they were hired on you that,

150
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,070
that was the one that I
think we should note here.

151
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,380
And I think that's the
most of our little bubble.

152
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:03,420
I thought that one was interesting because
the angle was a little different and

153
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:06,150
you could see some of the other
kids and the, and the, you know,

154
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:08,090
the either tears or the look of horror,

155
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,170
all of these things when you
actually didn't do anything.

156
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,320
Well that's another whole
topic. I think that, um,

157
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,130
I mean many people have analyzed
those events and honestly, I don't,

158
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,590
I don't know if I have anything
to add to those analyses.

159
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:29,080
I think that the thing that
was very interesting to mean,

160
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,470
so, so one of the ideas that I've been
thinking about for a long time is this

161
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:37,500
tension between our individuality
and our group of shyness.

162
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,850
And we have evolved to, first of
all, it's a very interesting idea.

163
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:46,260
We've evolved to be individuals,
so we humans have unique identities.

164
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:47,730
So we have unique faces.

165
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,880
So you can look out at a sea of
people and can tell who's who.

166
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,790
And not only do we have the
ability to signal our uniqueness,

167
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,230
we use our faces for that,

168
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,530
but we have the cognitive apparatus
to detect that uniqueness.

169
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,590
So you can have a lot of
brainpower you haven't done,

170
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:03,000
you allocate to tell who's who.

171
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,920
So this ability to be individuals is
crucial for our ability to function in

172
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:08,191
groups.

173
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:12,900
It's very paradoxical because you need
the capacity to tell who's my offspring,

174
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,340
who's my friend? Who do I reciprocate?
Kindness to, who do I cooperate with?

175
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,440
Who's my enemy?
All of these things.

176
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,840
So all of these capacities
of individuality are
crucial to our collective

177
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:29,550
expression, our ability to
live together. But equally we,

178
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:33,420
um, we have this desire to
surrender ourselves to the group,

179
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,820
to do something called two d individually,

180
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,660
to form a part of a collectivity
to suppress our individual desires,

181
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,370
which also allows us to work together.

182
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,110
But the irony is when you'd get
too much of that, you get mobs,

183
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,570
you get panics, you get, you know, uh, uh,

184
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,310
all kinds of collective phenomena that
are destructive rather than constructive.

185
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,720
So when I was in the crowd, when I was in
that mob, I, I knew what was happening,

186
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,620
I could tell.

187
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,700
So one of the things I started doing
was as I started asking people,

188
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,200
what's your name? And I was trying to
connect to them person to person saying,

189
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:11,580
you know, hi, I'm Nicholas. Who are you?
So you're a person and I'm a person.

190
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:15,480
You're not a part of this, a mob. You're
a human being. And I am a human being.

191
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,820
And in fact,
the,

192
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,390
the one thing that happened that
that isn't as an intellectual idea,

193
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,460
that's part of this book that
I've been working on for 10 years.

194
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:27,540
But that also I made in the heat of the
moment is in the moment I said to the

195
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:31,050
students, I said that I
believe in our common humanity.

196
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,220
I believe that even though this person
and this person is superficially

197
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:38,550
different than me, nevertheless,
we can talk to each other.

198
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:43,080
We all have life experiences where
human beings and ended. And then if you,

199
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,260
if you don't believe that, if you don't
believe we have a common humanity,

200
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,700
which I see as a wonderful thing.
Yes, yes. Cause I'm an optimist.

201
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,980
I'm an optimist.
If you don't believe our common humanity,

202
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,840
why are you even trying to talk to
me and the students geared to, yeah,

203
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,770
they jeered it's on film.
They jeered and I honestly,

204
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,000
I think that's one of the most depressing
things that's happened that I've ever

205
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:12,001
seen actually said the yields students
in the 21st century would jeer at what I

206
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:16,720
regard to be a fundamental,
humane,

207
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,260
wonderful claim about human beings
is that we have a common humanity.

208
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,980
So, all right. So I know you don't
want to spend the whole time, but I do.

209
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,220
But I think a lot of this does segue to
your book for reasons that you just laid

210
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:30,730
out. So those trying to do that.
Yeah, I know you're a very clever,

211
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,920
you're tid bits. You can, I'll watch
what, I'm going to go back in there.

212
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,630
How did they get us there then?
Okay. Right on his back. Um,

213
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,270
but that look that you're talking
about when, when you say that,

214
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:43,960
like we have to be able to share a
common humanity. I've been there too.

215
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:48,490
I mean I face these mobs to do and what
I find is there's an actual look they

216
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:52,770
have in their heads where the individual
that you just spoke about is gone.

217
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:57,880
Um, did you think there was
anything, so I guess there's really,

218
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:58,780
in that case,

219
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,320
for the people that are watching this
that think that one day they are going to

220
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,660
go against the mob, is there any other
advice you would have for them on how to,

221
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,140
how to do it? Because that doesn't
always work. I mean, saying, I,

222
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:10,300
I've done that where I've said,
I'm standing right in front of you.

223
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:14,590
I'm listening to you.
My name's Dave and it doesn't work that

224
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,490
I think that, um, I,

225
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,390
I don't know. I, I don't know.

226
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,190
You know,
there's that,

227
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,750
there's that scene in Lord of the
rings where Aragorn rushes the gates,

228
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,780
you know, um, and have more door.

229
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,370
And I of course love those movies and uh,
you know,

230
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,010
I don't know if I would have,
I don't think,

231
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,520
I don't know if I would be
capable of such bravery, but, um,

232
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,680
intellectually I definitely am. That
is to say I'm not easily cowed. Um,

233
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,040
and I,

234
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:57,270
I have spent my life training myself
to think as clearly as I can to look at

235
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:02,680
evidence to collect evidence. I'm an if
scientist, I'm an empiricist. So, um,

236
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,360
so in the,
in the case of a mob,

237
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,560
I don't think I would yield to a mob
intellectually. Now, physically, you know,

238
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:12,010
if they're, if they're throwing bricks
at you as a different thing, but I think

239
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,650
you too often that threat is always there.

240
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:17,140
Even if they're not holding
a weapon that threads, right.

241
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,120
It's a dangerous situation. I
would agree. But mass, you know,

242
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,780
[inaudible] are always dangerous.
But my point is that I think that if you,

243
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,340
if you can keep your calm, you can think
clearly about what you're saying. Also,

244
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:32,130
if you've thought about these ideas
before in the cool of the day,

245
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,920
so it's not the heat of the moment said,
look, I really thought about these ideas.

246
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,290
This is not just a sudden heat of passion.
Like I've,

247
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,630
I've thought about this topic
or this point, whatever it is.

248
00:14:39,631 --> 00:14:42,570
It doesn't have to be a political point.
It can be scientific point or something.

249
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,770
Then when you're pressed, you know, you
can say, you know, I'm listening to you.

250
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,910
Here's what I think. Okay. What
do you think? I think you can,

251
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,430
I think you can, you can, I won't
say you can win the battle of ideas,

252
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:57,450
but you can at least fight it. Well. Yeah.

253
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,220
What was the administration's
response after this older, well,

254
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:05,240
I think the administration
faced a difficult challenge
in deciding what to do.

255
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,550
Many people have commented on
what they did or didn't do.

256
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:12,140
I'm not sure I want to go into it. Um,
it took them quite awhile to come to,

257
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:17,150
to release any kind of public
statement in support of us. Um, so,

258
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:18,950
and you know,
many members of the administration,

259
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,160
junior members were actually involved in,
so in the crowd that day,

260
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:27,080
they were four, four administrators
actually, uh, who, um, you know,

261
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:31,100
who's others have since identified.
But um, you know, I think,

262
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,100
I don't think it was Yale at its best.
And um,

263
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,510
and I don't in the students were not
at their best and I was not at my best.

264
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:41,270
I did my best, but you know, I
think I could've done even better.

265
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,280
So as someone that then has lived
through it, where did this go wrong?

266
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,040
On college campuses because
for the past couple of years,

267
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,850
every time I see one of these stories
I think either, well, I used to think,

268
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,910
oh this, this is the end of it.
Now people will really get it.

269
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:59,450
Like I remember you're the one with you
from the other video clip that we didn't

270
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:02,990
show that people had seen. It was
like, this is so patently absurd.

271
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,570
Maybe this will finally
be the wake up call.

272
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:08,420
I've now come to believe that the wake
up call, these can come at anytime soon,

273
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,100
sadly. Um, but what, when
do you think as well,

274
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:16,550
I think this is a complicated
topic. I see. You know, this is not,

275
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:20,720
it was not my area of expertise.
I am a natural and social scientist.

276
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:25,721
I run a lab with computer scientists and
molecular biologists and sociologists

277
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:26,930
and evolutionary biologists,

278
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:30,770
and we work around the world who
do all kinds of stuff. So I was,

279
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:33,950
I have always been committed to liberal
principles including to free speech.

280
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:38,750
When, when I was at Harvard,
before I moved to Yale in 2013, uh,

281
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,200
my wife and I came to the defense of
minority students who were being, um,

282
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,560
having their right or speech
rights squelched on campus.

283
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,510
So I'm committed to these ideas, but it
wasn't the most central part of my life.

284
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:54,500
And I'm not an expert like John Height or,
or Greg Lukey off look Kiana far,

285
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,890
however, so, so I see
conflicting evidence.

286
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:02,390
I agree with you that there are a
lot of these salient cases which,

287
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,640
which they weren't before.

288
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,630
And Jonathan feels that they're still
rising and they have their own theories.

289
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:13,550
Jonathan and Greg about why I see
other evidence that looks at surveys of

290
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:16,910
college students and finds that they
are no more or less likely to want to

291
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:20,060
suppress the speech of others
than adults and older adults.

292
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,000
It's very tempting to silence people
who don't agree with, right? I mean,

293
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,940
everyone wants to do that,
but I don't,

294
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:29,180
I want to talk to them and persuade
them like it would be, it would be,

295
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:33,230
it's very tempting to like, you know,
shut the anti-vaxxer is up, you know,

296
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:36,770
prevent them from speaking.
But that doesn't win, right?
That that's not a victory.

297
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:40,970
What we need to do is persuade them.
Why do you believe, think this? So,

298
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:42,600
so if you compare college
students to adults,

299
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:45,200
some evidence suggests they're
not more sanctimonious.

300
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:48,050
Some evidence suggests
there are some polls, uh,

301
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,980
if you look a disadvantage there
clearly rising, but they're still small.

302
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,030
So, so the critics say there's
a rising level of [inaudible],

303
00:17:57,031 --> 00:18:01,200
which I deplore let me just, can I go on
a degression? Yeah. Yes. So I have no,

304
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,080
let me be very clear because there's
a lot of sloppy thinking about this.

305
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,450
Nobody has a right to
speak on a college campus.

306
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,480
So I'm not claiming that
anyone has the right.

307
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:12,450
But once a group on campus
invites you to speak,

308
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,140
you cannot yield to the
mob Verdis invitation.

309
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,540
It totally destroys the university.
It's,

310
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,790
it's the antithesis of what
a university should be like.

311
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,170
So you can protest that person,
but you cannot have dissertations.

312
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:28,950
That's just ridiculous. So, so
they're, so those have been rising,

313
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:31,050
but so the critics say, look,
this invitation had been rising,

314
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:35,220
but the defendant saying yes, but millions
of Tok state place and nobody objects.

315
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,630
So it's a tiny minority. So to
answer your question, I don't,

316
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,040
I don't think we're beyond the hump,
but I'm not the expert to tell you.

317
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,030
How bad is it?

318
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,660
Does it say something about the
state of liberalism or in a way that,

319
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,940
that this was sort of the end conclusion
of liberalism? I hate to say it,

320
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,380
that it would get sort of usurped
by progressivism or whatever the new

321
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:03,520
collectivist idea was. In other
words, liberals are tolerant.

322
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,800
Liberals generally are live and let live.

323
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:10,670
So it was sort of fertile ground for
people with bad ideas to Russian and kind

324
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:14,530
of take over where perhaps conservatives
are a little harder to get in at

325
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,650
they derivatives. Yeah.
Yeah. But conservatives have
their own political failings.

326
00:19:18,651 --> 00:19:20,450
Right. But I have no doubt. Yeah.

327
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,210
They'll move in lock step so you
can get them to like, you know,

328
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,400
you two to mark to get, to get to
organize an inquisition. Right. So,

329
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,740
you know, it's not like, right.
We can conserve. I'm Larry,

330
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:32,180
I'm not comparing either one.

331
00:19:32,181 --> 00:19:36,380
I'm just saying that there
is a weakness of liberalism,

332
00:19:36,381 --> 00:19:41,150
which is very sad for me to say. The
openness is exactly what invites, yeah.

333
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,290
So this is the radicalism within. So I
mean I think this is, I mean I think,

334
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:49,790
you know, the open society and
its, and its enemies. Um, you know,

335
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:53,160
I think there is a sense
in which you can use the,

336
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,200
the tools to destroy the foundation.
Um,

337
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,580
but I also think,

338
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:01,490
and this is one of the arguments that I
made and I actually believe politically,

339
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,520
which is that these very core
commitments to freedom of assembly,

340
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,850
freedom of expression,
which the students were using right now.

341
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,970
Then we're also engaging in harassment,
which is a different topic.

342
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:16,700
And because I was an actor
in those events, I was,

343
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,270
I didn't feel at liberty to
help the students see the
difference between freedom

344
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:21,950
of expression and harassment.
Right?

345
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,140
Yeah. Somehow I don't think
they would've been like, oh,

346
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,560
let's sit down and listen to him as you

347
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,020
explains why, you know, so you can, so the
classic example is the, you know, is that,

348
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:33,560
you know, you can, you can march
through the streets of Skokie, Illinois,

349
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:38,240
but you can't stop in front
of my house, right. Because,
you know, that is a threat,

350
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,460
uh, the political expression
and a public places not so, so,

351
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,400
uh, so the students, so the, so,
uh, um, I lost my train of thought.

352
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,400
Where was I going? Uh, well, basically the
idea that the liberalism and that, yeah.

353
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:55,840
So, so the, so the,
so, so these are chord,

354
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:59,590
that sort of non-corrupt judiciary
sort of impartial separation of powers,

355
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,360
freedom of assembly,
freedom of speech.

356
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,300
I regard these as like foundational
principles of our democracy,

357
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,720
which are essential liberal principles.
Liberal principles. Yes, yes.

358
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:11,830
Liberal Bristles, which the students
in some ways we're using, right. Um,

359
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,210
except to call for people to be fired
for expressing their ideas in a collared

360
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:19,270
campus is using these
principles but to liberal ends.

361
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,070
And this is what you're asking,
I think,

362
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,150
which is what you're saying is can
these tools be used to like degrade the,

363
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,140
and the answer is yes,
there is a kind of threat from within,

364
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:32,560
but I still wouldn't abandon the
principles and I don't want to abandon the

365
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:34,000
peanut goes either. Okay. There we go.

366
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,050
You want to shift to the book or you want
to keep going? No, no, no. Please, please,

367
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,330
please. I would much rather
talk about this book. All right.

368
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:44,440
So it's called blueprint, the
evolutionary origins of a good society.

369
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:48,280
So let's start with the tag there.
So we actually live in a good society.

370
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:50,680
I can't believe it.
I thought we live in the worst society.

371
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,910
Capitalism is evil and the patriarchy
and so many terrible things,

372
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:59,230
and we've done horrible things, but
say this is good. Yeah, I'm appalled.

373
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:02,560
Can you please explain this about
commercial statement? Yes. Okay.

374
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:07,561
So I think there has been a long tradition
in the sciences and in the public

375
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:10,230
domain as well of um,

376
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,000
focusing on the bad side of human nature,

377
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,590
on our propensity for tribalism or
selfishness or violence or hatred.

378
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,110
But equally we are natural selection of
our evolution has equipped us and shaped

379
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:27,760
us for love and friendship and cooperation
and teaching and all these other

380
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:29,920
wonderful qualities.
And in fact,

381
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:34,900
I would argue that these good qualities
and their benefits must necessarily have

382
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:39,580
outweighed the bad qualities and their
costs. Because if I came near you,

383
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,160
I'm now speaking over evolutionary time,

384
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,440
over tens or hundreds
of thousands of years.

385
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:49,240
If I came near you and you killed me or
filled me with lies or otherwise injured

386
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:53,080
me, I would be better off
living separately. So, so the,

387
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,770
so the fact that we live socially
suggests that on balance,

388
00:22:56,771 --> 00:23:00,850
the benefits of a connected
life must outweigh the costs.
So the books, the book,

389
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,180
what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to
push back at these claims that we are,

390
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,770
that humans are inexorably evil.
And these arguments I should make,

391
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,810
I should say, are
supplementary to the, uh,

392
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,520
the body of ideas that Steven pinker
and others had been advancing about the

393
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:19,450
sweep of history. So where Stephen
is interested in historical forces,

394
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,900
I'm interested in the
books over there. So, yeah,

395
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,460
an Amy's I see in a bunch of
other younger Steve and Amy. Oh,

396
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:29,410
my friends Neil Neil crew by data.
So you want to be yes,

397
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,280
please put me over there with those guys.
Yes, exactly. Some of those guys. Yes.

398
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:37,850
And Schirmer's book. I can see. Yeah,
these are great. Um, okay, so, uh,

399
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:42,670
uh, yeah, the moral arc.
[inaudible] great. So I'll make
sure you have a copy. Okay.

400
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:47,650
But anyway. Um, so, so, um, so, uh,

401
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,720
uh, so Steven is arguing
that, uh, you know,

402
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,740
basically since the enlightenment,

403
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,700
the philosophical principles
in the scientific discoveries,

404
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,990
discoveries of the enlightenment,

405
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:01,070
the world has been getting better and
he's unquestionably bright. We are safer,

406
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:04,580
less violent, healthier, live, longer,
wealthier, better off at every,

407
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,720
every possible dimension. And that is
largely a product of historical forces.

408
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,020
But what I'm arguing and
technological forces,

409
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:15,260
but what I'm arguing is that we don't
just have to look to our history to find

410
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:16,460
this goodness.

411
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,420
We can look to our pre history and
actually over tens of thousands of years

412
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:21,740
we've been shaped to be good.

413
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,660
We have been shaped to be able to live
together in productive ways, in good ways,

414
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:30,860
actually in morally good
ways. I even argue. So, so the
both works synergistically,

415
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:33,290
these two forces and in,
and in fact,

416
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,520
I would even argue that these historical
and technological forces are actually

417
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:41,300
just a thin veneer on top of
much more powerful forces.

418
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:44,340
So he's there a bizarre
evolutionary force that,

419
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,030
that inclines us to focus on the negative.
Oh no,

420
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,680
that's a good question. I suspect if I had
to get one per show, no, no, no, no, no.

421
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,530
Um,

422
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:59,530
I would say right because if you
a person or things good or bad,

423
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,930
people generally tend to bed. We watch
the local news. That is all terrible news.

424
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,670
We're conditioned sort of. So there must
be something that's leading to that. Yes.

425
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:10,190
I think that, I think, I
know this has been studied.

426
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,030
I'm trying to quickly call
the literature to my mind. Um,

427
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,000
if I had to speculate on what the
conclusions of that literature would be,

428
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:20,750
it would be that there's more advantage
to paying attention to bad news and good

429
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:23,870
news that, that the fitness
advantage is survival advantage.

430
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:26,640
The advantage to your wellbeing from,
um,

431
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,850
noting a fire in your vicinity
or a Predator or a killer,

432
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:37,080
uh, is more advantageous to you than,
than, uh, than noted the noting the on,

433
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:42,190
on average the presence of water
or a food or a kindly person.

434
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,120
So I think, I think that that's probably
why we're hardwired to be pessimistic,

435
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,850
but actually we're not,
let me be clear. So, uh,

436
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:55,700
so we have both pessimistic and
optimistic, uh, inclinations. People.

437
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,580
And of course there's Inter individual
variation. People vary in this,

438
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,780
these personality traits.

439
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,980
But I think on overall we are
definitely inclined to the good.

440
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,590
So when you described yourself
as an optimist before,

441
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,340
if you had to try to parse that out
between what you think human nature is

442
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:14,420
versus upbringing and everything else,
could you give it some percentages?

443
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:19,421
I mean where your parents optimists so
that then push a well as ideas to you or

444
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,120
I think it's important not to
conflate personality traits. Uh,

445
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,800
which I am a optimist.

446
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:29,540
I think it person by personality with um,
sort of,

447
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,433
um,

448
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:34,610
how to put this exactly the kind
of characteristics of our species.

449
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,940
So I think we, for example,
we are cooperative species.

450
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:40,670
We cooperate with strangers,
which is very unusual.

451
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:45,480
Other animals will cooperate with,
but we also cooperate with non-kin.

452
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,410
It's rare in the animal kingdom. So I
don't know how you would describe that.

453
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:50,820
I wouldn't call that optimism exactly.

454
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:53,040
I would call that something
good cooperativity.

455
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,650
That's a characteristic of our species.

456
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:57,780
And then above and beyond that
we also have personalities.

457
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,210
Some of us are optimistic, some of us
are not. But all of us, for example,

458
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:07,360
love our mates. So here's an interesting
idea. Why? Why do we do that?

459
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,960
It other animals have sex with each other.

460
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,560
We're not the only animals that do this,
but we also love each other.

461
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,340
We formed sentimental attachments to
the people we are having sex with.

462
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,570
We are also tend to be monogamous
and that we can be by monogamous,

463
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:24,360
I don't mean social monogamy
or even heterosexual monogamy.

464
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,020
I mean we form a longterm attachment
to the person we're having sex with.

465
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,370
Whether it's polygynous, polyandrous,
straight or gay, doesn't matter.

466
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:36,930
We love the person we're with. Why?
Why do we evolve this capacity? Well,

467
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,720
I talk a little bit about that. Why
would do that? And it's universal.

468
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,840
Everywhere in the world you go,
no matter what the marital system,

469
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,070
people love their partners instantly.
We get too proud of ourselves. Birds.

470
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:50,730
90% of bird species are also monogamous.
But anyway,

471
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,850
so the point is is that there are all
these qualities we have or we befriend

472
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:57,240
each other. Why do we do that? We, we
don't just reproduce with each other.

473
00:27:57,241 --> 00:28:02,100
We form longterm non reproductive unions
with other members of our species.

474
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:06,360
Namely, we have friends. This is very
rare in the animal kingdom. We do it,

475
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,700
certain primates do it, whales, orcas
and dolphins do it. And elephants do it.

476
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,430
Why? Well, there's a reason we do it and
it's a wonderful quality of our species.

477
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:21,900
So do you think societies
should be organized to help
these institutions? I mean,

478
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:26,660
this is where I could throw out Jordan
Peterson's enforced monogamy and you know,

479
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,140
people had a field day with that at all.

480
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:31,440
He really was saying was that societies
should kind of look at marriages,

481
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,131
it Justin thing,

482
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:34,320
because it's a foundational thing
that will help you build a family,

483
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,730
help you build it for full of life.

484
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,980
Do you agree that that's part of what
would lead to a good society or which

485
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:43,740
should be instilled? Well, I say
I talk about that in the book. Uh,

486
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,980
when I talk about is that we should be
very wary of efforts to engineer society

487
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:52,380
in opposition to our evolved proclivities.

488
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,810
So societies that try for example,
to prevent loving attachments.

489
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,910
I talk about communes for example,

490
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,080
communes have a problem because in a
commune they want you to feel loyalty to

491
00:29:04,081 --> 00:29:05,290
the group,
to the commune.

492
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,250
So therefore feeling of love
for your partner is a threat.

493
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:12,330
So many communes have gone
two opposite extremes,

494
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,400
both of which are attempting
to solve the same problem.

495
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:18,810
So on the one hand you have the shakers
who say no sex, no loving attachment.

496
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,570
On the other hand you have
communes that say polyamory.

497
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,850
Everyone loves everybody or
can have sex with everyone.

498
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:27,600
Both of those are attempting to sever an
individualistic connection between two

499
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:28,380
people,

500
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,980
which therefore you in the same thing
happens in eastern Germany where they

501
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:33,990
tried to separate connections
with friends, right?

502
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,010
You don't you who my friends could be
spying on me or ratting out to the Staci

503
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,420
[inaudible] sitting there for a second.

504
00:29:39,421 --> 00:29:42,430
Cause it's a fascinating idea
that it's the same force at work.

505
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,560
Whether you say to people
don't have any relationships,

506
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,170
is actually the same divorce as have
relations with everybody. I mean that's,

507
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,640
that's not something that the
average person is thinking about.

508
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,440
But if you're just having
relations with everybody, yes,

509
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,120
you're actually having on special
nobody. That's right. So they're both,

510
00:29:58,121 --> 00:30:00,760
both of those extreme strategies
are tackling the same problem,

511
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:04,750
which is the threat to the collectivity
of individual relationships,

512
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:06,700
whether it's with your partner,
your sexual partner,

513
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,190
or as I was about to say
with your friends or others.

514
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,520
So collectivist societies will often,
every everyone call you comrade.

515
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,820
So everyone is your friend.
Same as having polyamory, right?

516
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:19,870
It's like the polyamorous equivalent
to everyone dresses the same.

517
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:22,510
We all call each other friend. No
individual identity. It's a kind of,

518
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,880
it's a kind of science fiction dystopia
actually. So the argument I make is,

519
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:31,881
is that we should be very wary of efforts
to engineer society in opposition to

520
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,360
our interests.
They're bound to fail is my argument.

521
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:39,310
Now there are brief moments of time and
certain cultures where you can apply a

522
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:43,660
tremendous cultural force and suppress
some of these innate tendencies. So,

523
00:30:43,661 --> 00:30:45,520
for example,
I talk about the not,

524
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,770
so if you look at societies around
the world that the, the, the,

525
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,050
the expression of love for your partners,
seeing universally,

526
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,790
except perhaps with one exception,

527
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:59,791
which is the not people in the Himalayas
who've organized society around a brief

528
00:31:00,071 --> 00:31:02,890
sexual encounters,
you're not supposed to love your partner.

529
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,220
And so this is a matrilineal society.
The women stay at home.

530
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:10,420
The men will go out at night basically
cruising for dates. So there'll be like,

531
00:31:10,421 --> 00:31:13,300
and it's not uncommon for every woman
to have had sex with every man in the

532
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:17,230
village. And the men will be knocking
on the door, take me tonight, take me.

533
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:19,750
And she'll pick this guy tonight
and they'll have a brief fling.

534
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,700
Maybe he can come back and at any moment,

535
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:24,760
either of them can break off the
relationship, but even in it,

536
00:31:24,761 --> 00:31:26,860
and so there's a whole
complex cultural edifice.

537
00:31:26,861 --> 00:31:30,340
Marco Polo describes this
when he gets to China,

538
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,730
the Chinese government thought
it was sapping productivity,

539
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:36,840
that everyone was having sex all the
time. They were, they were saying,

540
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:41,730
we need to stop this. They tried to stamp
it out, but it still has existed. This,

541
00:31:41,731 --> 00:31:45,430
this culture, this cultural set of
rules. But even in this society,

542
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:49,630
there are people who want the
forbidden fruit of having a,

543
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,190
a committed relationship and who flee
for because they want to be with each

544
00:31:54,191 --> 00:31:55,570
other,
forsaking all others.

545
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,750
So even this society cannot fully
suppressed this desire for love.

546
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:03,610
And I look also at friendship and
show that there are some societies,

547
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:06,920
very few which seem to have no,
um,

548
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,580
experience of this notion of friendship.

549
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,690
But those societies are extremely rare
and also have certain idiosyncrasies.

550
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,800
So the simple way of saying that'd be
that there's basically an evolutionary

551
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:22,690
force that no matter how far you go to
one extreme, it has to sort of push you.

552
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,460
Yes. Or that it's extremely difficult
to entirely suppressed. You can,

553
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,250
through force of arms, you know, you can
slaughter populations. You can, you can,

554
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:33,870
you know, you can, uh, you can,
um, have very elaborate, uh,

555
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,890
sort of autocratic governments.
You,

556
00:32:35,891 --> 00:32:40,220
you can have procedures or other highly
evolved stylized that have cotton to

557
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:40,761
this.
For example,

558
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:44,240
there's a play is universal and
children and there's one society,

559
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:49,241
the [inaudible] people who really think
play is awful and really try to suppress

560
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:51,830
the innate tendency of children to play.

561
00:32:51,831 --> 00:32:55,250
So there's very little play among
children in that society, but it's,

562
00:32:55,251 --> 00:33:00,020
these societies are rare and they require
very large cultural forces to suppress

563
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:01,160
these innate tendencies.

564
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,620
You know, I was thinking as
we've been talking about this,

565
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:09,090
that there's something
also sort of related to our
political situation right now

566
00:33:09,091 --> 00:33:11,850
about this that it seems like we're
sort of going off the deep end.

567
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,150
I would say the argue more on
the left at the moment. Um,

568
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,900
but I guess if I'm an optimist here
and I described myself as a world weary

569
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:23,730
optimist that you're saying at some point
and whether Jonathan Haidt says it's

570
00:33:23,731 --> 00:33:27,060
two years down the road or whenever it
is that at some point we'll eventually

571
00:33:27,061 --> 00:33:30,480
have to rebound right. Secrets.
Sure. Cause it, what is it?

572
00:33:30,481 --> 00:33:33,090
If it doesn't rebound
then, then that's just, no,

573
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:35,730
I don't think Jordan Peterson
would say is just chaos. Right?

574
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,550
Yeah. I think, I think, I mean, I, I
can't, I think we're in for another,

575
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,440
I think there'll be
about five or 10 years.

576
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:47,270
Our society is going to go through
a long period of, of, of acrimony.

577
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,080
Um, no, I have to say I'm
not, you know, um, sort of,

578
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:54,280
I don't have a wig ish view of history.
Like, oh, in the olden days, you know, uh,

579
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,380
everything was great. I mean, let's
not forget we had, we had colonialism,

580
00:33:57,381 --> 00:33:59,240
we had slavery,
we had a,

581
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,110
we had to anti immigrant sentiment
forever and our couldn't even vote. Yes.

582
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,880
Women couldn't vote. Exactly. Do
you have gay rights? You know, so,

583
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,040
so there's always been this uh,

584
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:14,050
this incredible disconnect between our
wonderful principles in our society.

585
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,340
All men are created equal.
You know,

586
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,520
the bill of rights can bring
tears to your eyes if you read it.

587
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:24,680
And the fact that we didn't always,
but we are, I think getting better.

588
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,930
This is the progressive in
me. You know, the society,

589
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:27,950
we're getting better and better.

590
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:30,080
We are expanding the franchise
to more and more people.

591
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,280
We are opening up our democracy.
We are, we are extending rights,

592
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:38,660
we are extending liberties. Um,
now of course the libertarian,

593
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,160
we'll say the government
doesn't grant liberties.

594
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,070
We are protecting liberties are,
you know,

595
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:46,010
we are trying to stay out but took
it right out of it is exactly.

596
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:47,150
And I agree with that actually.

597
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,890
I don't think the liberties over the
governments to grant, but anyway, so,

598
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:55,460
uh, but I think our society is
getting better in these regards. Um,

599
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,800
I don't think you can, you could
say otherwise. So I think that we,

600
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,360
we will get there.
It's just going to take some time.

601
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,900
So how do you navigate through
a messy time like this?

602
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,930
If you're someone that's just kind of
awake to these ideas and you want to be

603
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:11,970
able to express your individuality,

604
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:17,420
but there is a mob or a morphous
machine that is silencing things,

605
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:19,440
or as you just said before,

606
00:35:19,441 --> 00:35:22,410
that you don't want a society that's going
to push down things that were sort of

607
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:25,380
always accepted for a long time.
I'm slightly paraphrasing, but,

608
00:35:25,381 --> 00:35:29,160
so right now it's like if you call a man
a man, they'll tell you you're a folk.

609
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,270
These, these basic things that seem,
now we hear about them constantly as if,

610
00:35:33,271 --> 00:35:36,510
as if this is just the most
important thing happening.

611
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,040
No,
I think

612
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,060
there are other,
this is the other thing.

613
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:42,330
I think that I think there are certain
segments of Twitter in certain segments

614
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:45,390
of our society that have made these
particular topics than others.

615
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,690
A very central in everyone. You
know, the people who want to,

616
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,210
who are concerned about climate
change or people who come as I am,

617
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,750
they're people who are concerned about
the private Prentice prison industry as I

618
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:56,850
am. These are two hot
topics at Harvard right now.

619
00:35:56,851 --> 00:36:00,270
So there was a heckler situation
where the president of Harvard was,

620
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,860
was not allowed to speak about,

621
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:04,680
he was at an educational conference
and these groups that were opposed to

622
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:08,790
private ownership of prisons, which I am
and, uh, concern about climate change,

623
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:12,540
which I also am, they shut the president
down, which is ridiculous, you know?

624
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:15,390
I mean, why did they shut him?
Because he thought he wasn't taking,

625
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,650
paying enough attention to their concern.
So you,

626
00:36:17,651 --> 00:36:20,250
you have this kind of ruled by minorities,
right?

627
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:23,640
Where a vocal minority can hijack the
conversation about whatever particular

628
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:27,090
topic they have. So everyone's entitled
to have their topics of interest.

629
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,450
But that doesn't mean you have
to go along with it, right?

630
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:33,990
You can have your own ideas
about the topic or you can
switch conversation. Like,

631
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,060
I'm not interested in talking
about trans rights today.

632
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:38,150
Today I'd like to talk about, uh, how, uh,

633
00:36:38,151 --> 00:36:41,410
motor vehicle accidents are the one of
the leading killers or the opioid crisis.

634
00:36:41,411 --> 00:36:44,940
There's another important dilemma. Where
are the guns? You know, we, we, we have,

635
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:48,360
we have more people are killed by guns
in our society per capita than any

636
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:51,990
society in the world almost.
It's craziness. So, um,

637
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,360
so all of these are different
people have different, anyway,

638
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:57,900
the point I'm making is that if you
wish to engage in a conversation with

639
00:36:57,901 --> 00:36:59,880
someone about a topic
they feel strongly about,

640
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:02,460
I think it's incumbent on you
to listen to their arguments,

641
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,950
think and then respond.

642
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,470
So do you think there's an evolutionary
reason that people either basically

643
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:11,740
become sort of government
people or freedom people?

644
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,980
So the way you were laying out
that argument, is that going to go,

645
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,410
it's like you were telling me your
progressive, uh, sort of prayed,

646
00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:20,200
which I have to do all the time,
but then you basically said, yeah,

647
00:37:20,201 --> 00:37:23,590
but all these things can be accomplished
by libertarianism if you don't believe

648
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:25,930
that it's the government's
job to give these things.

649
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:31,080
So that basically it sort of shows why
the progressive's are the ones screaming

650
00:37:31,091 --> 00:37:32,530
on campus all the time.

651
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:37,770
And it's in larger society because they
think the system can be perfected to get

652
00:37:37,901 --> 00:37:40,300
it however they want it.
Where are the Libertarians?

653
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:43,050
I think just say I'm very wearable system.
Yeah.

654
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,880
I don't think the system can be perfect.
So let's just keep it out of our lives.

655
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,550
I mean, I think, you know, which,
which idea I'm more sympathetic to.

656
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,010
But do you think there's a reason
that what occurs? That yes.

657
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,290
Okay. So there are, there are
a set of ideas about where do,

658
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:00,700
where do so,
so the content of political beliefs,

659
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:05,590
like whether for example you believe
in, um, whatever it is, pick I know any,

660
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:06,740
the,
the,

661
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,230
the belief you have about a particular
topic is of course not evolutionarily

662
00:38:11,231 --> 00:38:12,040
shaped,

663
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,390
but there is a kind of evolutionary
shaping to whether or not you are more

664
00:38:16,391 --> 00:38:19,210
conservative or liberal. That's
what I'm trying to get. Yeah.

665
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:23,560
So some people are more rule abiding and
there's an, there's a good, for example,

666
00:38:23,561 --> 00:38:26,740
children that learn children that listen
to their parents might be more likely

667
00:38:26,741 --> 00:38:31,090
to survive. So listening to your parents
is actually a good survival strategy.

668
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,960
On the other hand,
too much obedience is also bad.

669
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,060
You can be led like a lemming off a cliff.

670
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,420
So occasionally you need to not
listen to what everyone else is doing.

671
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,610
So both are advantageous and we're,

672
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,690
we're equipped with both abilities and
there's variation across people and it's

673
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:47,620
a complicated topic.

674
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:51,120
So nobody thinks there's like a genetic
background to being a Democrat or a

675
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:51,731
Republican.

676
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:55,840
But there is evidence that there is a
kind of genetic predisposition to certain

677
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,160
political polls.

678
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,080
But what I would say though is
that we live in a plural democracy.

679
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,770
So you're going to have to
compromise, you know, uh,

680
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:07,960
if you're a libertarian
who thinks x, Y, and Z,

681
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:11,980
and you're going to be in a society with
other people who think different things,

682
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:17,320
we have decided to come together as a
people and vote to resolve our disputes.

683
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,360
And t by the way,
not just to vote,

684
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:23,230
but to educate ourselves and to teach
each other stuff, right? To communicate.

685
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,360
Right. The founders recognize
that in order for us to
get to the wisest decision,

686
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,630
we have to have free and open
conversation. Well, I think that's why,

687
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,910
which I support I do here.
Well of course you do.

688
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,840
But that's why so many people are so
concerned about this at the college layer.

689
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:40,120
You know, I'll hear some of
our critics will say, oh,

690
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:42,880
they're just obsessed with
what's happening on colleges
and they're handing over

691
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,910
all this power to the, to
the mob oncologist. But then,

692
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,520
but then every day we
see it then leak out.

693
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:50,650
And also these people will
be the leaders of tomorrow.

694
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:53,350
That's why I don't think it's,
I don't think it's overestimating.

695
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:55,660
And even if it is a small minority,
which we agree,

696
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,580
the amount of power they can extend,

697
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,680
they definitely needs to be way
disproportionate to the numbers. For sure.

698
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:04,020
I would agree with that.
Uh,

699
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,160
I would agree that the vast majority of
students on any college campus just want

700
00:40:07,161 --> 00:40:09,520
to get a good education and,
um,

701
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,150
and many of them have other political
concerns other than some of the ones that

702
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:17,920
are getting a lot of attention. So, um,
you know, even for example, even with the,

703
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:21,850
you know, so you know, people are
concerned about the opioid crisis.

704
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:24,640
They're concerned about gun violence,
are concerned about police brutality.

705
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:26,280
They're concerned about
the climate change,

706
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:29,320
are concerned about all of these issues,
which I think weren't concerned.

707
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:33,190
We can perfect our society, we can be
better than we are. And I generally,

708
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:36,670
we can perfect it. I, I do better than we
are. But you think we can perfect it. No,

709
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:38,470
I don't think we can
have a perfect society,

710
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:42,910
but I think we can make it better than
it is. So by perfect, I mean improve. Um,

711
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,400
so I think we can make our
society better and better.

712
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,730
I don't think we're done yet. I think
there's still deficits are, for example,

713
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:53,500
our spending is crazy. I mean, I think we
do better fiscal fiscally. Um, you know,

714
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:56,560
I think we have, we have a
carceral state. We have, I think,

715
00:40:56,561 --> 00:40:59,560
I think this number's right,
that upper on a per capita basis.

716
00:40:59,561 --> 00:41:03,280
We have as many people in prisons as
Stalinist Russia. I mean, it's insane.

717
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,671
You know,

718
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:08,110
we have millions of Americans are in
prison and it's way out of proportion to

719
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:11,530
other countries. Um, you know, there
are lots of things about our society.

720
00:41:11,531 --> 00:41:12,251
We have very high,

721
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:15,550
we have century long heights of
income inequality in our society.

722
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,210
There's a big debate about whether that
is an unavoidable side effect of growth.

723
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,470
You know,
everyone is better off.

724
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:22,510
So what do we care if the
income is unequally distributed?

725
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,370
But I think I tend to be agree with the
critics that are concerned that this

726
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:31,440
level of inequalities not sustainable
to have a common wheel to like have a,

727
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,500
a sense that everyone is
a part of the society.

728
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,970
We've had no income growth in the middle.
Uh,

729
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,950
like the meeting American has seen in a
generation and see no growth in wages.

730
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:43,250
Right? So the bottom actually has raised
and we've watched the top go bananas,

731
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,340
but the middle of the bottom hasn't even
gone up that much either. Well, let me,

732
00:41:46,341 --> 00:41:49,580
let me put it this way. They
have absolutely not been
living standards, right?

733
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,790
So like a poor American today is vastly
better off than a poor American a

734
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:56,570
generation ago. But in terms of wage
growth, there's been very little growth.

735
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:00,350
My understanding of statistics and most
of the accumulation of wealth in the

736
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,820
last generation has gone to
the top, top 1% 0.1%. Anyway,

737
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,150
there's a debate about why that happened.
The technological advance that we have.

738
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,820
The same thing during the
industrial revolution. These
are important deep ideas,

739
00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:13,610
which as a society we should
be debating and discussing.

740
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,330
What's the best for our society anyway,
there are,

741
00:42:17,331 --> 00:42:20,150
these are all much more
important topics in my view,

742
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,110
and have much more bearing on the
wellbeing of our society than a lot of the

743
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:25,670
other crap that gets so much attention.

744
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,600
So what's the evolutionary
reason for that? I mean,

745
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:32,540
your previous book was about social media,
right?

746
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,930
So there's gotta be some link there.
I mean,

747
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:37,240
and it's already getting
back to what I was saying.

748
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:40,400
I know I've got depressing local
news. I don't know. I mean,

749
00:42:40,401 --> 00:42:45,260
I'm trying to talk about things
that I think are important.
Um, you know, I, I, um,

750
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,930
I'm doing my part as best I can,

751
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:54,030
who's done a society in a more quote
unquote good way than we have right now.

752
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,370
So, uh, so the book, so I don't, I don't,
I'm not, it's not a work of history,

753
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:01,430
so I'm not, I'm not, I don't
primarily talk about, um,

754
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:07,040
like the last 200 or even 2000 years
of human evolution or experience.

755
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:11,660
I'm much more interested in the long
arc of our history. And if you look at,

756
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,440
um, forged your societies around
the world as I do, and you,

757
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:19,820
and you look at their qualities,
you will see that again and again.

758
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,280
These societies have these
desirable properties. They,

759
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:25,190
there's variation of course,
and how cooperative they are.

760
00:43:25,191 --> 00:43:29,390
And there's variation in marital systems
and there's variation in sustenance

761
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:32,930
systems. There's a lot of variation.
But also there's a lot of commonality.

762
00:43:32,931 --> 00:43:36,230
And those common features I argue are
universal. See, here's the other argument.

763
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,440
The argument is that,
uh,

764
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,460
there are these universal qualities
that are shared across all societies.

765
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,590
They are shaped by our evolution.

766
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:47,420
They're not just a product
of historical forces.

767
00:43:47,421 --> 00:43:52,250
Can you just list out a couple
of them again, just so, so
love, love a friendship,

768
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,620
uh,
cooperation where cooperative species,

769
00:43:54,621 --> 00:43:57,890
you'll be kind to a stranger
on the first tee. You know, uh,

770
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,110
teaching the fact that we
teach each other stuff,

771
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:03,290
which actually is the ultimate source
of all our wealth and wellbeing.

772
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:08,530
The fact that we can accumulate knowledge
and distributed across time and place.

773
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,740
So I can tell people far away something.
And when I'm born,

774
00:44:12,741 --> 00:44:17,150
I benefit from all the other knowledge
that has been produced for the many

775
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:19,130
hundreds of thousands of years
before me is astonishing.

776
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:22,070
And I would again argue this is why
what's happening on college. Yes,

777
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,950
I would argue with, I would agree
with that. There's a connection there.

778
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:28,580
Like our capacity to teach and to
create environments in which we foster

779
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:32,220
teaching and learning are crucial anyway.
Also hierarchy.

780
00:44:32,221 --> 00:44:35,850
We are a species that we cannot
survive with no hierarchy.

781
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:41,160
We need some leaders and I discussed
that but we also don't like too much

782
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:43,660
hierarchy.
So when you get too autocratic power,

783
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,660
the little guys down below band
together and basically kills.

784
00:44:46,661 --> 00:44:50,490
So Richard Wrangham has been making this
argument that we self domesticated as a

785
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:54,210
species that over millennia bands of
weaker members would say, you know,

786
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:57,180
that guy's too powerful and he's getting
all the dates and this we're going to

787
00:44:57,181 --> 00:45:00,810
kill them. And basically they did. So
we got more peaceful as time went by.

788
00:45:00,811 --> 00:45:04,350
Is One of the ideas,
mild hierarchy in group bias.

789
00:45:04,351 --> 00:45:08,400
So some tribalism is
unavoidable in human beings. Um,

790
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,670
this capacity for identity that
we discussed at the beginning.

791
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:16,080
These are all qualities. So identity,
love, friendships, social networks,

792
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:19,050
mild hierarchy in group bias,
teaching and social learning.

793
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:23,010
These are seen everywhere and they lie
and I believe at the core of a good

794
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:27,960
society and, and institutions, uh, uh,

795
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:33,060
try to suppress those at their own
peril. Yeah. How can you be sort of,

796
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:38,061
have a healthy dose of in group preference
without starting to fall into the

797
00:45:38,311 --> 00:45:41,610
trap of identity politics. So for
example, you're agree guys. Yes.

798
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,460
Greek thing I did. I love Greek, my best
child friends growing up in the Greek,

799
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:48,220
we're still great friends.
Um,

800
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:51,750
I love Greek culture and the way that
opened a Greek and the interest in

801
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,390
intellectual wisdom and I love feta
cheese and all of those things.

802
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:58,830
Span of Kopi dialogue. Yes. Yes. Great.
So, and you can open a Greek restaurant.

803
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:01,590
As far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't
object. That'd be totally fine.

804
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:06,540
[inaudible] I know that port,
that poor girl,

805
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,900
it's insane. It's toe Chinese
residents without being Chinese.

806
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,460
And not just that there was the,

807
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:15,180
there's the person in in Oregon
that had a Mexican restaurant. Yes.

808
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:19,350
There's so many examples
of this is unbelievable. So
how can you say love a call?

809
00:46:19,351 --> 00:46:21,840
I just told you all the reasons I
left this year. But let's pretend,

810
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,120
let's say it's roughly the same
feelings about your own culture.

811
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:27,870
How can you embrace all of those
things without falling into the trap of

812
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:29,850
identity politics? Because
I think that's, yeah,

813
00:46:29,851 --> 00:46:31,980
so I think there are a lot of
people are at these days. Okay.

814
00:46:31,981 --> 00:46:34,840
So I have a couple of ideas and responses.
The first thing I would say is,

815
00:46:34,841 --> 00:46:38,070
is that that this is one
of the both the most,

816
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:42,600
it's still not totally clear how
we evolved to have this capacity.

817
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,110
It's felt that this ingroup bias,
this I,

818
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,290
this tribalism that we have was
crucial to our ability to cooperate.

819
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:53,160
That the ability to draw a distinction
between us and them, that the challenge,

820
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,310
the problem that, that this
ability that we evolved. So,

821
00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:01,080
so there's whether we cooperate with each
other and whether we are xenophobic or

822
00:47:01,081 --> 00:47:05,100
tribalistic or draw distinctions
between us and them. And this property,

823
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:09,950
this tribalism property is a property
that reduces the scale of interactions.

824
00:47:09,951 --> 00:47:12,570
So instead of you having to
cooperate with everybody,

825
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,300
you only cooperate with your guys.

826
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:19,890
And this is innate in human beings and
it is felt that this ability to draw

827
00:47:19,891 --> 00:47:23,580
distinction between us and
them was crucial in the
emergence of the variability

828
00:47:23,581 --> 00:47:26,550
to cooperate with other
people. Okay. So they're tied,

829
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:30,100
they're connected to each other.
What's is,

830
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:34,300
is it necessary to hate the other group?
Why can't you just love your own group,

831
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,170
right?

832
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:38,480
So why could you be indifferent to the
other group or even admire and say that

833
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,450
to them?
They're not us.

834
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:45,640
We like them or we are in different to
them. Why do we have to kill them? Right?

835
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:48,420
Like why, you know, where does
the killing part come from? Right?

836
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,570
And this is complicated.

837
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:52,930
We don't exactly know like where
the hostility comes in weather,

838
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,150
but we tend to see this hostility.
So for example,

839
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,580
are famous experiments that have
been done with little toddlers.

840
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,820
You can randomly assign toddlers
to different tee shirts.

841
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:04,180
You can test at the toddlers
understand that this was random,

842
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,810
that there was no merit to whether they
got the yellow t shirt or the green t

843
00:48:07,811 --> 00:48:11,050
shirt. And yet as soon as you give
them the t shirts, the yellow t shirt,

844
00:48:11,051 --> 00:48:14,380
kids say those green t shirt children,
they shouldn't have toys.

845
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:19,120
They're bad children. They don't
deserve, you know, anything. It's insane.

846
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,610
Look like you can see this is called
the minimal group experiments.

847
00:48:21,611 --> 00:48:25,780
So the most trivial of interventions
you can elicit in us this, this, this,

848
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:28,330
dislike of the other.
However,

849
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,910
this is not the only tool that
evolution has given us to live together,

850
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:38,460
this disability to draw the
boundary between us and them. Uh,

851
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:41,110
there are a couple of other tools and
before I tell you what those two other

852
00:48:41,111 --> 00:48:45,010
tools are, let me just say one other
thing. So if you think of our society is,

853
00:48:45,011 --> 00:48:49,060
here's our whole society and here's
our groups in the middle and here,

854
00:48:49,061 --> 00:48:53,200
individuals at the bottom. If you're
struggling with the problem of tribalism,

855
00:48:53,201 --> 00:48:54,910
there are basically two ways you can go.

856
00:48:55,570 --> 00:49:00,220
You can go up a level and broadened
the boundary and you can say,

857
00:49:00,221 --> 00:49:03,430
for example, we are all
Americans, right? You can say,

858
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,550
because we all have the
capacity to draw the boundary,

859
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:09,850
we are evolved to have that capacity.
Now you just say,

860
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,370
actually these little group boundaries
that we were paying attention to,

861
00:49:12,371 --> 00:49:12,790
they're not,

862
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:16,950
they're not relevant and basically take
all the ethnic divisions or other than

863
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,170
the religious or immigrant or whatever
it is, and we're all American.

864
00:49:20,171 --> 00:49:23,770
We're all American. This other group,
yes, at a higher level. Exactly.

865
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,460
So you move up a level and you efface
tribalism by appeal to larger groups.

866
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,830
This has been part of our history
since the beginning to talk.

867
00:49:29,831 --> 00:49:31,600
They'll talks about this
where nature of joiners,

868
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,580
you know anyone can be an American,

869
00:49:33,581 --> 00:49:36,460
that that itself is part of the
American project. It's astonishing.

870
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:41,230
The belief which I share that anyone can
be an American is a statement that the

871
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:43,150
groups don't matter.
Anyone can be an American,

872
00:49:43,151 --> 00:49:45,430
you just have to buy
our liberal principles.

873
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,880
And then you could be an American even
though there's a debate about that.

874
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,730
But there's also an interesting parable
to Trump here because at some level it's

875
00:49:54,731 --> 00:49:57,130
like he's talking about
a miracle all the time.

876
00:49:57,131 --> 00:49:59,140
So that is the higher
group for all of this.

877
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,010
And yet I suspect your feelings
on what he's doing. Yes.

878
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:04,280
There's some other things, probably
not, no, but I would be like,

879
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,350
anyone can be an American.

880
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:08,490
If you come to our country and
you work and are productive and,

881
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:11,980
and obey our laws and our constitution,

882
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,450
you're an American as
far as I'm concerned.

883
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,300
It didn't matter whether you
came from Mexico or you know,

884
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:20,890
one of the four Mexican countries
as he's, you know, anyway, okay,

885
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:25,630
so a whole other show. Okay, good. So,
so, okay, so, so, but another solution,

886
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:29,660
okay to the group is of the
tribalism. Mr. Go down a level.

887
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,490
Remember we talked
earlier about individuals.

888
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:34,520
So now you can say instead of looking
at people as which groups are they a

889
00:50:34,521 --> 00:50:36,890
member of,
you look at them as individual people.

890
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,870
And this too has been
a part of our history.

891
00:50:38,871 --> 00:50:41,870
So Martin Luther King's
famous sentiment, I, you know,

892
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,990
I'm look forward to a society in which
people are judged by the content of their

893
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:48,950
character rather than the color of their
skin isn't appeal to our individuality.

894
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,010
Seen groups don't matter.
Individuals matter. So,

895
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:56,300
so if we're struggling with tribalism,
we'd go up or we can go down both help,

896
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:00,950
however lateral to that point,
there's another set of ideas,

897
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:05,951
which is tribalism is not even the only
tool we have in order to reduce the

898
00:51:06,321 --> 00:51:08,000
sense of scale and to cooperate.

899
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:11,390
So natural selection is also
equipped us with friendship,

900
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,080
friendship,
the really one of the reasons it is felt,

901
00:51:15,081 --> 00:51:19,160
we evolved the capacity for friendship
is again to reduce the sense of scale.

902
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,140
So instead of now and
being in a big group,

903
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,090
everyone has to cooperate with everyone.

904
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,920
Each of us has a subset of people who
are our friends that we cooperate with.

905
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:29,510
So it's similar to tribalism,

906
00:51:29,511 --> 00:51:32,090
but different because now
instead of defining it by group,

907
00:51:32,091 --> 00:51:35,570
membership is defined by each
person has their particular friends.

908
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:40,840
So this is another tool that we innately
have that we can use to sustain our

909
00:51:40,941 --> 00:51:45,050
cooperative instincts and
push aside the tribalism.

910
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,940
So how much do you think on a day, day
and a day to day basis, are we, uh,

911
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:52,940
normally I get the water for people.
You had to be so wrapped up there.

912
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:55,250
That's what I forgot. Uh,
on a day to day basis,

913
00:51:55,251 --> 00:51:58,460
how much movement do we as
individuals have to sort of

914
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,040
either go around,

915
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:06,070
let's say go around our
evolutionary behavior?

916
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,970
Well, I don't think, okay. So I think
I do believe in free will. I mean,

917
00:52:10,971 --> 00:52:12,130
I think you have,
um,

918
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:17,090
some capacity to self mastery and make
her own decisions in life and your own,

919
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,133
you know,
um,

920
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:23,420
but you're also born with certain innate
qualities and you're also born a human

921
00:52:23,421 --> 00:52:26,630
being, which is you're part
of a particular species
that has a particular set of

922
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:31,200
characteristics. Um, so I,

923
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,510
I think that as individuals, you know,
we have some control over how we act.

924
00:52:35,511 --> 00:52:40,511
I don't think our individual actions will
individually change the whole society.

925
00:52:41,211 --> 00:52:45,110
But I think if each of us is
attempting to do the right thing,

926
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:49,850
I think ultimately that
makes things better. Look,
there's a lot of famous ideas.

927
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,460
Uh, so a Victor Frankl who was
in the concentration camps, his,

928
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:56,750
his wife was killed.

929
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:02,020
He survives the Nazi concentration camps
and he goes and he writes a famous book

930
00:53:02,331 --> 00:53:06,710
called Man's search for meaning after
he's liberated it right to 10 days after

931
00:53:06,711 --> 00:53:07,544
his liberation.

932
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:11,360
And he talks about how he came to the
recognition that even in this camp in the

933
00:53:11,361 --> 00:53:14,030
most vile possible circumstance where
his life was threatened every day,

934
00:53:14,031 --> 00:53:16,970
where people were dying all the time. He
was starving to death. He had no shoes.

935
00:53:16,971 --> 00:53:17,661
It was in the winter.

936
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:22,100
I mean it was a slave even
there he recognized that he
was the master of his own

937
00:53:22,101 --> 00:53:23,630
internal state.
You know,

938
00:53:23,631 --> 00:53:28,320
that how he saw the world was
something that was in his own control.

939
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:32,760
So he was able to find a sense of
self discipline and mastery even in an

940
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:37,700
environment in which the structures
around him were engineered to crush him,

941
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,290
to kill him. So, so I think that there
are, and there are many examples of this,

942
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:47,640
I mean another one of my favorite examples
is a Buddhist monks that were studied

943
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:52,560
at MIT years ago. I think I'm going
to get the facts of this work correct.

944
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:53,550
So,
so,

945
00:53:53,551 --> 00:53:56,880
so they were very interested in how
meditation changes the structure of your

946
00:53:56,881 --> 00:54:01,881
brain and how are these monks so able to
be so peaceful in these very stressful

947
00:54:03,121 --> 00:54:05,070
circumstances.
And they scan them,

948
00:54:05,071 --> 00:54:07,440
they put them in the MRI scanner and
they looked at different parts of their

949
00:54:07,441 --> 00:54:12,441
brain in which parts were enhanced or
diminished compared to other more ordinary

950
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:15,750
mortals. And uh, and then,

951
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:18,510
and they saw the different parts of the
brain and Buddhist monks were different

952
00:54:18,511 --> 00:54:19,440
than the rest of us.

953
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,100
But what interested me was not even the
neuroanatomical discoveries that were in

954
00:54:23,101 --> 00:54:23,521
that paper,

955
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:27,030
but it was the interviews with amongst
and so at amongst would say was that,

956
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:27,421
for example,

957
00:54:27,421 --> 00:54:32,421
let's say you and I are in traffic and
someone cuts us off a normal response,

958
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,730
certainly one that I often have
is who is that jerk? You know,

959
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:39,080
you'd be really pissed off and your
blood pressure would rise and maybe you'd

960
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:42,270
race that guy and uh, you know, you
would, you would think ill of them.

961
00:54:42,271 --> 00:54:44,790
That would be our natural goto thing.
That's a thoughtless,

962
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,360
maybe they're idiotic or
they're inattentive or you
would have all these bad

963
00:54:48,361 --> 00:54:51,270
thoughts about this person who, you
know, in a road rage kind of way.

964
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:56,130
The monks don't do that with, amongst do
is they train themselves to regenerate.

965
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,140
So when that happens,
so then they say,

966
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:02,370
maybe that's a man who's taking his
wife to the hospital because she's

967
00:55:02,371 --> 00:55:06,360
delivering the baby. The baby's
being born in the car in front of me.

968
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,850
Isn't that amazing?
There's a new life,

969
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:13,140
I should help that man to get to the mean
and they're doing it not for the sake

970
00:55:13,141 --> 00:55:17,540
of that person, but for their
own wellbeing. You see, so,

971
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:22,260
so I think it's possible to, to, to,
to re, even though it's difficult,

972
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:27,690
it's very difficult to exercise
some internal self control.

973
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,100
I think you're mostly saying that there
are no monks on Twitter. Yes, very few.

974
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:33,630
The Dalai Lama,
my things on Twitter,

975
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:38,160
I think I follow up on do I think
I have to check. He's on Facebook,

976
00:55:38,161 --> 00:55:38,820
I'm pretty sure.

977
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:42,420
What else do you think sort of the average
person that's watching this can do to

978
00:55:42,421 --> 00:55:45,740
help order a good society?
Because I think people, you know,

979
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,730
everything's become so political.
Yes.

980
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:51,450
I think people think that's the only
solution to sort of help make a better,

981
00:55:51,451 --> 00:55:54,240
I think granting charity to your
enemies I think is important.

982
00:55:54,241 --> 00:55:58,800
I think listening to them,
cultivating, listening, you know, um,

983
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,550
that's pretty big of you to
say after everything. Well,

984
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,960
I was listening in the clip you showed,
I was listening.

985
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:06,600
I thought that was so ridiculous.
The young woman who said,

986
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:09,330
I'm not listening to her.
I was really listening.

987
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,610
I mean I was listening then
and before and after. Um,

988
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,890
I don't agree with what she was saying,
but I heard what she was saying.

989
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:18,730
I could summarize what
she was saying but even,

990
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:21,570
but what do you do in that case
then? It just sort of, yeah,

991
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,950
we don't have to bring it back to that
specific instance, but in general,

992
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,510
because I think a lot of
people are going through this.

993
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:26,830
You're being berated by somebody.

994
00:56:26,831 --> 00:56:29,500
They're saying all the worst
things about you and your motives.

995
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:32,920
They're attacking you as a person.
All of those things now you can listen,

996
00:56:32,921 --> 00:56:35,590
you can absorb and ignore.
You can ignore.

997
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:40,591
All Ruth Bader Ginsburg says survival
in life is ignoring a lot of the

998
00:56:40,721 --> 00:56:42,280
stupidities,
which I also think is good.

999
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,640
I think that's the answer and what was
ignore and also who was that famous

1000
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:50,641
actress that found this guy in Texas
that had said horrible things to her and

1001
00:56:50,861 --> 00:56:52,410
then, or him I can't
remember, was an actor,

1002
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,880
an actress and it was an actress
and made it her business.

1003
00:56:54,881 --> 00:56:59,140
To find out about this guy's life. And
he had lost his health insurance and he,

1004
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:03,380
and then she intervened and raised
money for his healthcare and, and,

1005
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:07,230
and he felt seen and heard,
wow, I can't, which one?

1006
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:09,880
It's an incredible story.
And um,

1007
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:14,170
and I think that a lot of times people,
and I think anonymity is a real,

1008
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,630
it can contributes to bad behavior online.

1009
00:57:16,631 --> 00:57:19,270
So I think sort of as Jordan
Peterson says, you know,

1010
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:23,020
man up as it were a woman up and have
the strength of your convictions.

1011
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:25,840
This is what I think, this
is what I'm going to say.
But is there a problem there?

1012
00:57:25,841 --> 00:57:26,291
I mean,
Jordan,

1013
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:30,670
I've done this many times where then
depending on how that hierarchal structure

1014
00:57:30,671 --> 00:57:34,840
is operated, if you are saying
something that's an politically correct,

1015
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:36,131
well,

1016
00:57:36,131 --> 00:57:39,640
I mean you have to have the strength or
revise your opinions or stick to them or

1017
00:57:39,641 --> 00:57:42,700
make good arguments but are listening.
But you know, let's don't engage.

1018
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,750
Let's say you're a Trump supporter.

1019
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,010
You just don't want to lose your job
because you think if you say that

1020
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:50,680
[inaudible] I'm against
people losing their jobs for
their opinions. Yeah. So, uh,

1021
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,150
so you know,
so I think that,

1022
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,000
I think there's a thing where I
think a little bit of bravery,

1023
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,370
a little bit of civil discourse,

1024
00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:02,230
a little bit of commitment to
granting charity to our opponents. Um,

1025
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:03,430
a little bit of like for example,

1026
00:58:03,431 --> 00:58:06,130
when I would have an argument with
people who are opposed to vaccination,

1027
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:11,410
I think there is no merit to their ideas.
I understand their fierce.

1028
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:15,460
I understand that there have been either
some actual cases of vaccine induced

1029
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:19,360
neurological conditions, one in a
hundred thousand one and 500,000 cases,

1030
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:20,680
which is awful.

1031
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,310
And I understand that there are a lot
of coincidences where people think that

1032
00:58:24,311 --> 00:58:26,680
there's a relationship, but no,
it's just that you have, you know,

1033
00:58:26,681 --> 00:58:28,780
you have lot of vaccines
are being administered,

1034
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:29,920
there are a lot of illnesses occurring.

1035
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:32,980
There's going to be an overlap
in those two sets. But,

1036
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:35,590
and I also know the data
on how that's very been,

1037
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:38,250
how vaccination is like
a 20 20th and 25th,

1038
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:41,260
actually more like even a 19th century
triumph. I mean, you know, we've,

1039
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,210
we've mastered these diseases.
We humans,

1040
00:58:43,211 --> 00:58:46,150
it's astonishing what we've done through
our capacity to teach and learn and

1041
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:50,560
engage in science and so forth. But I
would engage that person. I would try it,

1042
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:53,500
I would talk to them. I would
say, you know, let me talk
to you about your beliefs.

1043
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:56,500
And because I think that that's the only
way to get them to revise their beliefs.

1044
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:00,610
I think telling them they're fools
doesn't, doesn't help. Yeah. Um,

1045
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,100
so a true liberal, I am a liberal.
Yes I am buying. I am a liberal. Yeah.

1046
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:07,090
But do you think one side is a little,

1047
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,090
it's a little bit easier to do that
right now. And does that flip over time?

1048
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:13,540
So for example, right now I find
it much easier to go to consider.

1049
00:59:13,541 --> 00:59:16,840
I get invited by conservative cliffs.
Libertarians is no problem.

1050
00:59:16,841 --> 00:59:20,110
But let's say conservatives that I
have disagreements on, on abortion,

1051
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:22,190
gay marriage,
and legalizing marijuana.

1052
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,560
And the death penalty. And we could
do the list cause I, oh wait, hold on.

1053
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:28,610
So I'm for legalization of marijuana. Yes.
What is your position on death penalty?

1054
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:32,880
I'm against the death. Let
me too. What were the other
gay marriage? Yes. Yeah. Uh,

1055
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,010
legalizing weed. Um, so, but
yes, sorry, I hate to tell you,

1056
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:40,400
I'm guessing that you
only would get invited by
conservative groups to basically

1057
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:45,050
to college as well. I don't know. Um,
I don't know. I don't get that many.

1058
00:59:45,051 --> 00:59:47,900
I mean usually my invitations are
scientific. Like I am a scientist.

1059
00:59:47,901 --> 00:59:49,550
Like I give talks about my science.

1060
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:53,840
So I have not historically been
very politically but, right. So,

1061
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:57,680
but what I'm getting, I really is that at
the moment it seems very obvious to me.

1062
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:01,370
Like I don't know that I could be clearer
or anything on the center right there

1063
01:00:01,371 --> 01:00:02,430
is,
there is a,

1064
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:06,470
an ability and actually a
desire to discuss ideas.

1065
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:11,150
I would agree to disagree and that
just isn't happening right now.

1066
01:00:11,151 --> 01:00:14,330
And I would suspect her argue, and I'm
sure you can give me examples where that,

1067
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:17,130
I mean during the McCarthyism
for example, I think, you know,

1068
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:20,540
it was very difficult to be a
communist for sure and even, you know,

1069
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,730
left where they were so they weren't
inviting communist talk to them.

1070
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,633
That's right.

1071
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:29,650
So I think, um, I honestly don't
know the answer to that question.

1072
01:00:29,651 --> 01:00:34,000
I think there are subgroups on campus
which are still committed to debate the

1073
01:00:34,001 --> 01:00:38,440
get the political unions. These guys
love to argue these young people. Um,

1074
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,220
I think there are other vocal minorities
on campus that don't want to hear

1075
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:45,220
opinions that they don't agree with and
they think that even the hearing of it,

1076
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:48,700
there's this, there's this very sloppy
conflation of speech with violence,

1077
01:00:48,701 --> 01:00:52,720
which I think is ridiculous, um, which
seems to really be ramping up. Yes,

1078
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:56,380
I would agree with that. And you also see
it, for instance, in Pakistan, they will,

1079
01:00:56,381 --> 01:00:59,710
they will kill apostates that's
answering speech with violence.

1080
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:03,310
If you actually think that
someone believing in a
different God and expressing

1081
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:07,690
that belief is violence, then then the
country justifies killing that person.

1082
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:12,730
Or in Brunei recently, they had the same
kind of um, situation. I think this,

1083
01:01:12,731 --> 01:01:16,090
this is, I strongly reject that
belief. There's, there's uh,

1084
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:19,300
we have different words and there's a
totally different meeting between speech

1085
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:24,140
and violence. So, uh, so I don't know
how we got onto that topic, but uh,

1086
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:25,900
oh, so, so I think that,

1087
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:29,710
I think there are groups
of people on campus who do
conflate speech and violence.

1088
01:01:29,711 --> 01:01:33,280
I think that's a problem. Um, but there
are also many groups that are very,

1089
01:01:33,281 --> 01:01:36,160
very vigorous political debates.
I think one thing that is different,

1090
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:41,080
so I'm in my fifties when I was
in college in my, in the eighties,

1091
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:44,470
we would stay up late and argue
about politics with our friends,

1092
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:47,300
with our friend's notice.
I said my friends,

1093
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:51,700
I would argue with my friends about
politics and a, and they were my friends.

1094
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:54,340
I don't think that
happens very much anymore.

1095
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,890
It does in the political unions
and the debates societies.

1096
01:01:56,891 --> 01:01:58,660
But in the broader college,

1097
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:03,040
I think if you have a different opinion
about abortion, for example, um,

1098
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:05,010
you really can't express that.
But

1099
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:09,180
the weird thing is that it is happening
with conservatives. Well cause they,

1100
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,470
because they do believe, I mean I go to
these things and I have these debates,

1101
01:02:12,471 --> 01:02:13,430
we have kids all over,

1102
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:16,250
all of their better debaters cause
they have more experience. Yes.

1103
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:18,650
Arguing with people they disagree with.
Yes.

1104
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:22,650
They get a better education in some ways
because they have to constantly defend

1105
01:02:22,651 --> 01:02:26,920
their opinions. It's a weird thing to
say then. Yes, yes, yes. I think, well,

1106
01:02:26,921 --> 01:02:29,610
I mean if you, this is the thing
why in the martial arts for example,

1107
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,200
why don't we bow to our opponent?

1108
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,700
You'll learn more from the people you
disagree with and from the people you

1109
01:02:35,701 --> 01:02:38,820
agree with. Right. In Jay's
mill's famous saying, you know,

1110
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:43,170
he who knows only his side of the
case knows little of it. Um, so,

1111
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:44,670
you know,
I think,

1112
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:49,650
I think that's where your ideas
get better when they are tested.

1113
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:54,660
Um, when you argue with
someone you disagree with, um,

1114
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,060
and, and, and I think,

1115
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,870
and I think cultivating
those kinds of conversations,

1116
01:03:00,871 --> 01:03:04,050
disciplining yourself to be able to have
arguments with people you disagree with,

1117
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:08,730
uh, improves your ideas. And actually
you should be grateful to that person.

1118
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:11,160
There's more interesting
person in some ways. Um,

1119
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,320
now you don't have to be best
friends with that person necessarily,

1120
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:17,610
although you can be. Um, but
I think it makes you smarter

1121
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,470
that my friend is a nice closing statement
and you've lived through it. I mean,

1122
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:27,300
that's the point. You lived through the
forces that so many of us see now as,

1123
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:29,790
as such dangerous forces in society
and now they live through it.

1124
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:33,090
You flourished and you've got another book
out and all of those things. So, well,

1125
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,180
I would say, I mean, yeah, well I
would close with saying, you know,

1126
01:03:36,181 --> 01:03:40,770
I really believe that, um, that
the arc of our evolution as long,

1127
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,630
but it bends towards goodness.

1128
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:45,020
Sounds good to me.

1129
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:50,090
