00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.890
In the last video, I spoke
somewhat theoretically about

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.690
what a null space is
and we showed that

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.700
it is a valid subspace.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.960
But in this video let's actually
calculate the null

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.380
space for a matrix.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.220
In this case, we'll calculate
the null space of matrix A.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.420
So null space is literally
just the set of all the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.230
vectors that, when I multiply A
times any of those vectors,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:29.560
so let me say that the vector
x1, x2, x3, x4 is a member of

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.850
our null space.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.410
So when I multiply this matrix
times this vector I should get

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.920
the 0 vector.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.430
I should get the vector.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.450
And just to make a few
points here, this

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.850
has exactly 4 columns.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.120
This is a 3 by 4 matrix, so I've
only legitimately defined

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.310
multiplication of this times a
four-component vector or a

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.050
member of Rn.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.970
Let me call this X.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.440
And this is our vector X.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.700
This is a member of R4.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.260
It has four components.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.040
And then when you multiply
these, we need

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.480
to produce a 0 vector.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.090
The null space is the set of
all the vectors, and when I

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.350
multiply it times A, I
produce the 0 vector.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.060
And what am I going to get?

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.570
I'm going to have one row times
this and that's going to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.830
be the first entry, then this
row times, that's the second

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.780
entry, and then the third row.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.580
So I should have three 0's So my
0 vector is going to be the

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.070
0 vector in R3.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.730
So how do we figure out the set
of all of these x's that

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.580
satisfy this?

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.370
Let me just write our
formal notation.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.260
The null space of A is the set
of all vectors that are a

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.340
member of -- we generally say
Rn, but this is a 3 by 4

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.720
matrix, so these are all the
vectors that are going to be

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.730
members of R4, because I'm using
this particular A, such

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.910
that my matrix A times any
of these vectors is

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.530
equal to the 0 vector.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.400
In this case it's going
to be 0 vector in R3.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.420
So how do we do this?

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.680
Well, this is just a straight
up linear equation.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.100
We can write it that way.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.860
If we were to actually perform
the matrix multiplication, we

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.830
get 1 times x1.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.010
Let me write it here.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.800
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:19.920
1 times x1, plus 1 times x2,
plus 1 times x3, plus 1 times

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.460
x4 is equal to this 0 there.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.580
So that times that is
equal to that 0.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.500
And then this times this should
be equal to that 0.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:41.430
So 1 times x1, so you get x1,
plus 2 times x2, plus 3 times

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.710
x3, plus 4 times x4 is going
to be equal to that 0.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.510
And then finally we have that
times this vector should be

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.990
equal to that 0.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.770
So the dot product of this row
vector with this column vector

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.220
should be equal to that 0.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.690
So you get 4x1.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:21.690
4x1 plus 3x2 plus 2x1 plus 2x3
plus x4 is equal to 0.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.570
4x1 plus 3x2 plus 2x3 plus
x4 is equal to 0.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.230
You just have to find the
solution set to this and we'll

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.220
essentially have figured
out our null space.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.920
Now, we've figured out the
solution set to systems of

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.770
equations like this.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.090
We have three equations
with four unknowns.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.650
We can do that.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.610
We can represent this by an
augmented matrix and then put

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.370
that in reduced row
echelon form.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.080
Let's do that.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.865
I can represent this problem
as the augmented matrix.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.260
1, 1, 4.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.070
1, 2, 3.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.550
1, 3, 2.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.110
and then 1, 4, 1.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.495
And then I augment that
with the 0 vector.

00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:12.720
And the immediate thing you
should notice is we took the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.610
pain of multiplying this times
this to equal that, and we

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.600
wrote this as a system of
equations, but now we want to

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.980
solve the system of equations,
we're going back to the

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.050
augmented matrix world.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.290
What does this augmented
matrix look like?

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.010
Well, this is just our
matrix A right there.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.570
That's just matrix A right
there, that's just the 0

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.880
vector right there.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.980
And to solve this, and we've
done this before, we're just

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.640
going to put this augmented
matrix into row echelon form.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.450
What you're going to find is
when you put it into row

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.230
echelon form, this right side's
not going to change at

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.680
all, because no matter what you
multiply or subtract by,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.930
you're just doing it all times
0, so you just keep

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:48.870
ending up with 0.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.880
So as we put this into reduced
row echelon form, were

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.760
actually just putting matrix A
into reduced echelon form.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.110
So let me do that, instead
of just talking about it.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.620
So let me start off by keeping
row 1 the same.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.570
Row 1 is 1, 1, 1, 1, 0.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.630
And then I want to eliminate
this 1 right here, so let me

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.820
replace row 2 with row
2 minus row 1.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.980
So 1 minus 1 is 0.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.050
2 minus 1 is 1.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.170
3 minus 1 is 2.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.400
4 minus 1 is 3.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.970
0 minus 0 is 0.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.490
You can see the 0's aren't
going to change.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.740
And then let me replace this
guy with 4 times this guy,

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.480
minus this guy.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.940
So I can only get rid of this.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.610
So 4 times 1 minus 4 is 0.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.950
4 times 1 minus 3 is 1.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.920
4 times 1 minus 2 is 2.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.840
4 times 1 minus 1 is 3.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.750
4 times 0 minus 0 is 0.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.490
Now I want to get rid of, if I
want to put this in reduced

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.170
row echelon form, I want
to get rid of that

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.660
term and that term.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.920
So let me keep my middle
row the same.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.135
My middle row is 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.330
So that's 0 on the augmented
side of it, although these 0's

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.470
are never going to change, it's
really just a little bit

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.780
of an exercise just to
keep writing them.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.140
And my first row, let me replace
it with the first row

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.360
minus the second row, so I
can get rid of this 1.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.720
So 1 minus 0 is 1.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.410
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.140
1 minus 2 is minus 1.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.340
1 minus 3 is minus 2.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.390
And 0 minus 0 is 0.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.670
And let me replace this last
row with the last row minus

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:46.610
the middle row.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.890
So 0 minus 0 is 0.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.440
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.570
2 minus 2 is 0.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:53.770
I think you see where
this is going.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.510
3 minus 3 is 0.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.790
And obviously 0 minus 0 is 0.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:04.510
So this system of equations
has been reduced, just by

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.560
doing reduce row echelon
form, this problem.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.030
If I just rewrite this right
here, this can be written as a

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:21.870
system equations of x1 minus
x3 minus x4, right?

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.110
The 0 x2's is equal to 0.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.830
And then this second row right
here, there's no x1, you just

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:37.870
have an x2, plus 2x3, plus 3x2
is equal to 0, and this

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.420
obviously gives me no
information whatsoever.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.510
And so I can solve this.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.160
I can solve this for x1 and
x2, and what do I get?

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:52.960
I get x1 is equal
to x3 plus x4.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.170
Actually, I made
a mistake here.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:08:01.000
This is x1 minus x3 minus 2
times x4 is equal to 0.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So if I rewrite this, I get x1
is equal to x3 plus 2x4.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.290
And then I get x2.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.280
Let me do that in green.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:20.875
x2 is equal to minus
2 x3 minus 3x2.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.270
So if I wanted to write the
solution set to this equation,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.640
if I wanted to write it in terms
of this, I could write

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:40.260
x1, x2, x3, x4 is equal to
-- what's x1 equal to?

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:54.400
It's equal to x3 times
1 plus x4 times 2.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:54.720
Right?

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.500
I just got this right here from
this equation right here.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.600
x1 is equal to 1 times
x3, plus 2 times x4.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.320
That's just that, right there.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:10.145
Now, x2 is equal to x3
times minus 2, plus

00:09:10.145 --> 00:09:13.330
x4 times minus 3.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.410
What am I doing?

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.050
I'm losing track of things.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:22.800
This x2 right here is x2 plus
2x3 plus 3x4 is equal to 0.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.620
So x2 is equal to minus
2x3, minus 3x4.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.060
Right.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:28.280
Like that.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.900
Sorry, my brain isn't completely
in the problem, I'm

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.730
making these silly mistakes.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.270
But I think you understand
this now.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.990
So then what is x3 equal to?

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.840
Well, it's just equal
to 1 times x3,

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.580
plus 0 times x4, right?

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.800
x3 is equal to x3.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.770
And what's x4 equal to?

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.420
It's equal to 0 times
x3 plus 1 times x4.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.220
So all of the vectors in R4,
these are a member R4, which

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.840
satisfy the equation, our
original equation, ax is equal

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.210
to 0, can be represented as a
linear combination of these

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.980
two vectors, of those
two vectors, right?

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.020
These are just random scalars
that are a member of-- We can

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.210
pick any real number for x3
and we could pick any real

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.810
number for x4.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.140
So our solution set is just a
linear combination of those

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.200
two vectors.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.060
What's another way of
saying a linear

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.130
combination of two vectors?

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.470
Let me write this.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:27.530
The null space of A, which is
just a solution set of this

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.600
equation, it's just all the
x's that satisfy this

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.090
equation, it equals all of the
linear combinations of this

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.530
vector and that vector.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.780
What do we call all the linear
combinations of two vectors?

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.330
It's the span of those
two vectors.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.000
So it equals the span of that
vector and that vector.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.290
Of the vector 1, minus 2,
1, 0, and the vector

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:57.840
2, minus 3, 0, 1.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.490
And this is our null space.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:03.050
Before letting you go, let me
just point out one interesting

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.640
thing right here.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.950
We represented our system of
equation like this and we put

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.130
it into reduced row echelon
form, so this is

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.700
A and this is 0.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.840
This right here is, let me make
sure I have some space,

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.600
let me put it right here.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.970
That right there is the reduced
row echelon form of A.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.180
And so where essentially this
equation, this is a linear

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.170
equation that is trying
to solve this problem.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:35.050
The reduced row echelon form
of A times our vector x is

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:36.530
equal to 0.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:40.580
So, all the solutions to this
are also the solutions to our

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.290
original problem, to our
original ax is equal to 0.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.530
So what's the solution
to this?

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.320
All the x's that satisfy this,
these are the null space of

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.470
the reduced row echelon
form of A.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.110
Right?

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.570
So here are all of the x's, this
is the null space, this

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:02.180
problem, if we find all of the
x's here, this is the null

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.315
space of the reduced row echelon
form of our matrix A.

00:12:06.315 --> 00:12:10.030
But we're saying that this
problem is the same problem as

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.790
this one, right?

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:17.800
So we can write that the null
space of A is equal to the

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.350
null space of the reduced
row echelon form of A.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.000
And that might seem a little
bit confusing, hey, why are

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.430
you even writing this out, but
it's the actually very useful

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.860
when you're trying to calculate
null spaces.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.240
So we didn't even have
to write a big

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.180
augmented matrix here.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.750
We can say, take our matrix A,
put it in reduced row echelon

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.780
form and then figure out
it's null space.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.060
We would have gone straight
to this point right here.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.170
This is the reduced row echelon
form of A, and then I

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.950
could have immediately solved
these equations, right?

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.040
I would have just taken the dot
product of the reduced row

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.840
echelon form or, not the dot
product, the matrix vector

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.350
product of the reduced row
echelon form of A with this

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.800
vector, and I would've gotten
these equations, and then

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.150
these equations would
immediately, I can just

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.060
rewrite them in this
form, and I would

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.890
have gotten our result.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.180
But anyway, hopefully you found
that reasonably useful.
