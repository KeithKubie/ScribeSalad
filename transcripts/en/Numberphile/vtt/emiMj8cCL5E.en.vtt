00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
I'm so happy I'm here to be able to get to talk about a viral maths problem.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.280
I mean when does that happen?

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.840
Come on.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.380
And this is not in the maths community.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.520
We're talking about like in the big wide world.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.900
This is really exciting.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.780
Have you heard of it, Brady?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.560
It's got a few names, at the moment.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.560
It's like the Singapore maths problem

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.080
it's a competition maths problem

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.520
originally from Singapore.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.680
it's also "The Cheryl problem"

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.160
Not saying anything against Cheryl

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.680
Cheryl's not a problem

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.800
Cheryls are usually pretty nice

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.300
So if you've been living under a rock

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.760
I'll quickly explain what it is

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.280
It's actually, from a mathematical point of view

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.660
it's a classic logic problem

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.780
It involves 3 people

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.500
Cheryl, Albert, and Bernard

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.260
Ok

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.100
So

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.040
Cheryl

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.800
is trying to get Albert and Bernard to guess her birthday

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.800
For what reason, we don't know

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.660
Maybe she's just trying to play Albert against Bernard

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.160
Or maybe Albert and Bernard, y'know, are trying to scam

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.580
Cheryl for like her secret question for a bank account

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.260
Who knows?

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.240
But Anyway

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.320
She gives them a bunch of options

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.840
Ok so, Cheryl has shared a possible pool of dates

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.520
But now, what's she's done is

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.480
she's actually gonna give a piece of information to Albert

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.020
and a piece of information to Bernard

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.020
An incomplete

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.020
piece of information about her birthday

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.380
so this is how it goes

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.560
Albert, I'm going to tell you the month, - whisper whisper whisper

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.440
and Bernard, I'm going to tell you the day, - whisper whisper whisper

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.320
So now all they know is

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.120
Bernard knows that Albert knows the month

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.880
and Albert knows that Bernard knows the day

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.680
But they don't know it together

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.680
And so then, they have a little exchange

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.900
So Albert

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.280
states

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.220
I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.720
But

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.860
I know that Bernard does not know too

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.380
then Berard replies

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.600
at first I didn't know when Cheyrl's birthday is, but I know now.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.000
So now suddenly, Bernard knows

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.860
But what happens? Is Albert left the in dark?

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.780
No

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.440
Somehow, Albert is then able to deduce

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.660
then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.300
So now they both know.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.880
And presumably, Cheryl is either happy or upset

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.460
Or her bank account has been broken into. Something like that. We don't know exactly.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.980
The question is how can you find out the information

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.840
Nothing is explicit, is it Brady?

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.320
it just seems like they playing games

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.660
Are they Jedis?

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.620
What's going on?

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.720
Are they reading each other's minds?

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.540
and this is the nature of these logic problems

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.480
Believe it or not, this isn't the first time I've been faced with a problem like this

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.800
As mathematicians, we get asked these problems all the time

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.640
And so the way to answer this

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.160
Is to actually break it down and try and attack it logically

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.200
because otherwise you're not going to get anywhere.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.200
I am now going to rearrange this information here

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.200
Because this is really important

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.660
we need to have something to focus on

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.660
So what I'm going to do is

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.660
I'm actually going to split out the dates

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.620
at the top here

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.500
I'm going to..I'm going to put

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.900
14

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.580
uh...

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.080
15

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.120
The dates there in columns

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.940
and in rows I'm going to place the months

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.280
So here is May

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.320
So now, what I'm going to do there is

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.320
I'm just going to have a look at this

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.560
so May 15

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.660
A cross is just basically, this is an option.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.000
This could be it.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
16

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.880
or 19

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.720
Yeah, these are also contenders.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.740
What I'm going to do is actually give us a bit of understanding here

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.460
because once we get into the logic we could get lost

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.460
Let's look at the options for this column.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.180
For the day or the date 14

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.940
how many different options do we have?

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.940
We've got 2

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.880
ok

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.060
15 we have 2

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.240
16 we have 2

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.660
17 we have 2

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.380
18 we have 1

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.240
and 19 we have 1 as well.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.620
Ok, now let's have a look for months.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.120
So now for months

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.980
how many options do we have for each month?

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.220
So we have 1,2,3 for May

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.220
2 for June

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.700
2 for July

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.820
and 3 for August

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.520
See where I'm going with this, Brady?

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.240
So now what's going on here is

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.420
that I've actually just, I've just spread out the information

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.480
Before I start bringing in

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.480
the weird conversation they had

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.260
The weird terse conversation that they had

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.460
so now Albert says

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.000
I don't know, I don't know what the birthday is.  OK.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.500
(Brady:  Of course he doesn't.)

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.500
Yeah, but that's a weird thing to say. Can I just say that?

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.500
It is a weird thing to say

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.780
because in a logic problem

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.100
Obviously you don't.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.740
We both know the game here.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.760
You've only been told months.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.280
There is 3 options, 2 options, 2 options, 3 options.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.020
The only way you'd know is if there was 1 month there with only 1 date.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.900
Just saying that.  I'm just saying that.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.400
What's interesting though is Albert says

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.160
"But I also know that Bernard doesn't know."

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.700
We've got the information in a way that, ya know, I'm gonna be able to work with,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.940
but just looking at this straight away

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.700
there are some red-hot dates.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.960
Here

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.700
June 18

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.340
Well if you have a look at it

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.820
it's only one 18 that applies to any of the months

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.820
It happens to be June. In actual fact

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.540
the same for May there's 19

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.060
19's not anywhere else

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.220
Can you see that, Brady?

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.800
There's nothing around there

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.860
What this means is if Cheryl went over and said to Bernard "18" or "19" *smooch*

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.720
What that means is straight away Bernard would be in.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.980
It's like a gimme.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.780
It's like "Bang". I know exactly what it is. You give me the information.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.140
It can only be 1 thing.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:45.280
But see, Albert in sort of a gloating way, I mean really Albert needs a bit of emotional intelligence I think

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.520
because he's basically gloating

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.340
and he's going, "&lt;pant&gt; &lt;pant&gt; I've got information that excludes the gimmes"

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.960
"So I know, Bernard, that you don't have gimmes."

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.500
But how can he not know?

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.740
Because he doesn't have the date information.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.620
He's only got month information.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.860
Ok, what are the months that had potential for gimmes?

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.620
Well they were June and they were May.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.040
And that's the only information that Albert has.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.500
He only has month information, yeah, monthly information

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.400
So. What can we deduce from this? We're mathematicians here.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.620
We're all getting mathematical...

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:23.740
Albert says, "I don't know the date". Yes, ok, that's a weird thing to say. "But I also know that Bernard doesn't know the date."

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.820
So logically, what you've got to say is

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.760
therefore Cheryl didn't whisper May or June in his ear.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.760
So, obviously cheryl whispered something like

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.640
"July"

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.460
or "August"

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.020
That's what she did

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.280
'Cause if she said May or June, Albert wouldn't be saying that, with conviction.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.480
Well that means

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.240
that this is...

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.900
no longer an option.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.920
And this...

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.640
is no longer an option.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.980
But because Albert has said "I know that 18 and 19 are not an option"

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.560
the only way Albert would've known that is through monthly information.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.140
So, in actual fact, this is gone, this is gone, and this is gone.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.100
Basically, everything in May and everything in June is gone

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.680
This is great because

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.180
with my prized little chart here, I can actually reduce some numbers here.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.760
So now this goes down to 0.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.220
This goes down to 0.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.200
So now Bernard actually knows....

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.620
Oh! An actual fact,

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.840
because all of May and all of June, all the dates that we had on the table are all gone,

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.580
that affects the total number of options I have for each day.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.840
It doesn't matter about his date.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.980
He's actually just looking at all the dates

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.060
So now for 14...

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.200
Well, there's still 2 there. That hasn't changed.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.020
But for 15, we've just struck out May

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.300
so now this is only 1 option.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.680
For the 16th

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.120
that was in May and July.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.900
May is struck out.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.080
So now...

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.940
there's only 1 standing in this column.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.220
For 17

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.920
same thing, look at this.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.740
There's June 17 and then there's August 17

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.600
So this one's getting struck out.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.360
And then for 18 and 19

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.480
and they turned down to 0 too

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.980
So Albert's given this information

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.760
Now Bernard has been able to reduce the options.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.100
But to be clear, for Bernard to know the birthday

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.180
he already has the date.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.340
He just needs the month.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.760
So now Bernard says...

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.380
"At first I don't know when Cheyl's birthday is, but I know now."

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.340
So, from what Albert has said

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.420
Bernard is now able to say

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.860
what the month is.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.940
Ok, so now, let's put ourselves in Bernard's shoes.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.660
So now he's actually discounted May and June.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:47.360
He's reduced the number of options. Really you're only talking about July and August.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.180
Now if he did have 14... right?

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.120
There are still 2 options on the table

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.640
So...

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.200
He didn't have 14.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.740
If he did have 14...

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.240
he would have said something like...

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.240
Uh... yeah, I still don't know.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.560
OK?

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.560
But instead he goes, "I didn't know before",

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.060
which means he didn't have the gimmes.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.600
But now he knows!

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.320
How does he know?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.720
Because there are actually new gimmes on the table, Brady, you wouldn't believe it.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.020
Look at this. The new gimmes are 15, 16, and 17

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.200
So now, if he's holding onto 15, 16, or 17

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.580
in his head, or really, in his heart, because we're dealing with Cheryl here...

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.200
What's happening here is he's going

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.300
"Wow, there's only one 15 that applies to August,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.140
there's only one 16 that applies to July

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.300
and there's only one 17 that applies to August."

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.300
"Look, if I have any of these dates,

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.360
I will know exactly which month it applies to."

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:44.840
So, at this stage of the problem, it could have been 15, 16, or 17.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.140
So now, Bernard is going...

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.740
"Sho sho sho sho sho..."

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.100
"bup bup bup bup bup"

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.100
And this one goes down to 0

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.480
But not only that

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.000
because July and August

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
have now lost a date.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.980
So that means over here, we need to go

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.220
bang bang bang... 1.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.140
...and over here....

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.460
We need to go: "bang bang bang... 2"

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.440
Right.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.560
So what's the last statement?

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:18.140
Albert says, "Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is."

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.200
Ok.  So that means he's got a gimme.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.200
So now if we have a look where the gimmes are...

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.200
Let's look at the options.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.540
He's either got July or August.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.860
What options do we have here?

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.460
Well August is no good because it's got two options. That means it's ambiguous.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.960
It means he doesn't have gimmes.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.820
It could be either 15 or 17.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.400
But because he knows...

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.000
it has to be July.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.540
Do you know what that means, Brady?

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.520
It means that Albert is going...

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.160
"Uh-uh, sorry."

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.220
and Albert's going... "Uh-uh, sorry."

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.060
So this now goes down to 0.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.580
This goes down here.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.580
Well Albert's doing it, so I'm doing it in blue.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.180
That one goes down to 0 too.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.180
So now, look what we end up with.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.000
We end up with 1 option for the month

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.200
and 1 option for the date

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.380
that they can both get.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.200
And that option is July 16.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.120
*sighs*

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.220
Ok, what's really interesting about this problem

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.120
is the fact that because it's using words

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.840
it's actually open to interpretation.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.520
If this was actually redone

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.520
in just pure symbolic logic,

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.520
it would be unambiguous.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.760
Because we're using these sentences

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.160
in actual fact, people have opened them up into interpretation.
