00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.980
Humans have always seriously messed up their lives,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.760
but the way in which failure has been viewed

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.260
has a long and fascinating history that it may help us to know about.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.660
Athens, 429 BC

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.900
It's the premiere of a tragedy called "Oedipus the King", written by the great playwright, Sophocles.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.110
It's the story of an honorable, capable
and highly resourceful man who,

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.279
nevertheless messes up his life in a
catastrophic way

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.920
but the audience doesn't leave the theater thinking of Oedipus as a loser.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.940
Greek tragedy was designed to show audiences

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.420
that terrible things can and very often do happen to good people,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.320
and therefore we must remain
sympathetic and kind in the face of failure.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.380
The Greeks force this message upon themselves again and again at prestigious annual festivals.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.320
The Greeks also love the story of the Spartan army at Thermopylae,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.320
where a small contingent of warriors held out to the last man against a vastly larger Persian force.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.120
The Spartans were utterly defeated, but their failure was seen as profoundly noble.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.400
You can lose and be good.
That was the moral.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.580
Rome, 46 AD

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.620
Julius Caesar celebrates yet another triumph over the enemies of Rome.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.620
The Romans worship success.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.500
They believed that success in the 
here and now is all that counts,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.140
and that success means three things: money, fame, and military glory,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.400
which creates a lot of anxiety around failure.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.840
Germany, 9 AD

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.920
The Roman general, Varus, kills himself after losing a battle in the Teutoburg forest,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.240
not far from modern-day Hanover in the north of Germany.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.080
He's made some major strategic errors in deploying his
troops.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.260
His suicide is an expected consequence;

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.580
Failure is so humiliating and shameful that it shows one doesn't deserve to go on living.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.200
The Romans represent a society where failure is thought of as naturally accompanied by shame.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.060
When big things go wrong you just kill yourself.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.640
There's no excuse.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.060
A small hill overlooking the Sea of Galilee, 30 AD

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.180
A former carpenter and itinerant preacher delivers a tender speech,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.660
which has since become known as the Sermon on the Mount.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.500
Jesus Christ tells his followers "blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth".

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.700
In other words, the unsuccessful are, in a way, more successful than the successful in the eyes of God,

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.680
because their failures erode arrogance and invite dependence on the divine.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.140
For hundreds of years Christianity lends glamour and prestige to failure,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.400
and challenges the worldly values of Rome.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.080
Privileging poverty, obscurity and weakness over wealth, fame and strength.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.500
Not simply you're not meant
to commit suicide when you fail,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.100
failing is a sign of being blessed.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.240
Eastern India, sometime in the fifth century BC

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.500
A wealthy young Indian prince, Siddhartha Gautama, later known as The Buddha, The Enlightened One,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.300
comes to a key realization about human beings:

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.860
all of us are deeply maladjusted, unhappy creatures.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.480
Worldly success, power, riches, love can mean nothing and will never satisfy us.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.360
We must learn to renounce our desires, and escape from constant cycles of craving and wanting.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.740
In Buddhist eyes, true success means utter failure in the eyes of a Roman soldier or a modern American.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.140
It means living under a fruit tree, owning nothing but a loincloth, and begging from passers-by.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.080
Paris 1799

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.760
Napoleon Bonaparte inaugurates a new social order, which will begin to be known as a meritocracy.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.520
No longer will success go only to members of the old corrupt aristocracy;

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.320
he wants to launch a meritocracy marked by what he terms "la carrière ouverte aux talents";

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.580
careers open to the talented rather than just the privileged.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.160
France requires a new honest system based on merit.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.340
The Légion d'honneur, which is given to people of all classes,

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.060
who were judged not by ancestry or wealth but by military scientific or artistic prowess.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:32.560
Suddenly, success comes to seem a lot more fair and deserved, which is very advantageous in many ways,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.100
but it also means that failure starts to be re-categorized as not merely accidental or morally neutral,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.220
as the Christian ideal had implied, but also in some ways, deserved.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.220
Paris, 1863

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:54.300
The French government sponsors its annual artistic salon, where the most successful painters are exhibited and celebrated.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.580
The jury, headed by the Comte de Nieuwerkerke, the head of the Academy of Fine Arts,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.520
is that year, extremely conservative and rejects two-thirds of the paintings presented,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.620
including those of Courbet, Édouard Manet, Camille Pissaro, and Whistler.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.260
The rejected artists and their
friends are outraged and protest.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.860
The Emperor, Napoleon lll, eventually
relents and allows the rejected artists to set up their own rival exhibition.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.560
Gradually the public and critics recognize that the officially successful artists,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.120
people like Alexandre Cabanel and Franz Winterhalter, are terrible painters,

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.080
and that the unsuccessful ones are, in fact, the true geniuses.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.580
This will be a theme throughout the history of 19th and 20th century art, and society more broadly.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.700
The genius is at first rejected by a stupid, blinkered world,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.660
but eventually comes to be accepted and celebrated

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:51.780
This is what happens to, among others, John Keats, Vincent van Gogh, Marcel Proust, Janis Joplin and Steve Jobs.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.300
"Real successes aren't successes immediately" goes the story;

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.280
they might need to wait for a
long time, perhaps until after their dead,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.700
a consoling story with echoes of the
Christian idea of redemption.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.360
New York, October 5, 1987

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.460
The right wing economics magazine, Forbes, publishes its first list of the richest people on the planet.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.680
The richest man is Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who is at that point worth 20 bilion dollars.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.960
The tone of the magazine is
celebratory, and un-nuanced,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.040
reflecting an uncritical acceptance of
the idea of the American dream:

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.700
"he who is richest finishes first".

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.440
It's a small irony, therefore, that two weeks later, on October 19th, the world stock markets collapse,

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:41.660
destroying wealth on an enormous scale, and shaking everyone's confidence in the merit and sanity of the economic system.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.720
New York, September 2011

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.480
Following yet another global economic meltdown,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.920
a group of protesters occupy Zuccotti Park in the financial district of Manhattan.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.980
Their protest is, in a narrow sense, about the corruption and blindness of America's financial institutions,

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:02.720
but more broadly, the protesters are arguing that a narrow elite, the 1%, as they call them,

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.530
have twisted our ideas of success and the good life.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.430
The so called "heroes", people like Jamie Dimon,

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.560
the head of JP Morgan, who's paid around 20 bilion dollars a year, are in fact the villains.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.180
Being a decent person doesn't necessarily mean making a lot of money,

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.460
it means acting wisely and kindly towards others and the planet.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.440
The protesters have a good few months in which to make their case,

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.020
which sounds remarkably like that made by Jesus in The Sermon on the Mount,

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.240
before the forces of contemporary capitalism hose them down and shut them up.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.720
Slowly, the economy recovers, which also means that

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:42.740
the battered American dream, equating mobility with financial success, becomes dominant once more.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:48.340
Most of us are going to endure horrific
failures in some area or other of our lives.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:56.280
We're an extremely success-focused world, and define success by some very narrow, normally financial criteria.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:02.160
There's endless talk about opportunity, and well-meaning efforts to make sure that everyone can have a chance,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.460
but there is a deep silence about what happens when you fail.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:12.340
To weaken the power of the narratives of success, we used to have religion, and we used to have art.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:18.340
We have less of that now; the very idea that failure could be noble has entirely disappeared.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:24.680
We need to go back in history and fetch some ideas that could stop us from being fatally hard on ourselves,

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:31.120
when we mess up in the eyes of Forbes magazine and the American Dream in general.
