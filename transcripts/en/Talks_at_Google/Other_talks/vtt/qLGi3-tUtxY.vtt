00:00:06.084 --> 00:00:07.750
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
All right, everyone.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.490
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.507
I'm here with Chuck Gaidica.

00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:12.840
Chuck, thanks for being with us.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.380
CHUCK GAIDICA: Good to see you.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:13.680
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Yeah.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.960
CHUCK GAIDICA: Thank you.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.340
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Yeah, great to see you.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.150
CHUCK GAIDICA: Thanks very much.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.233
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: I'll
give a short introduction

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:19.349
for those who aren't local
Detroit fans already.

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:20.390
CHUCK GAIDICA: All right.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.960
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Chuck works
at WDIV Channel 4 in Detroit.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.290
Has been there
for 30-plus years.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.430
Worked on all
sorts of programs--

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.770
Thanksgiving Day Parade,
Stanley Cup coverage,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.450
NHL Winter Classic.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.960
You name it.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.990
Pretty much any big event
that's happening in the Greater

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.130
Detroit area, Chuck has been
involved in through the media.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.640
He's also a co-host
and backup anchor

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.015
for Al Roker on the
weekend "Today Show."

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:51.390
CHUCK GAIDICA:
Yeah, I have been.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.830
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Correct?

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.520
CHUCK GAIDICA:
That's kind of past.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.040
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
You have been, yeah.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.530
CHUCK GAIDICA: But
yeah, I've been--

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.230
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: In the past.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.350
CHUCK GAIDICA: Mm-hm.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.891
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Worked nationally

00:00:56.891 --> 00:01:00.540
with all sorts of organizations,
including National Geographic.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.167
Done some expeditions
with them--

00:01:02.167 --> 00:01:03.750
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah,
Dr. Bob Ballard--

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.870
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
--I understand.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.610
CHUCK GAIDICA: --the guy who
discovered the "Titanic."

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.660
So I got to be with him on--

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.050
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Wow.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.890
CHUCK GAIDICA:
--two expeditions,

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.140
one to the rain forest
in Peru for 10 days,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.020
and one to the top
of Mount Kilauea.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.040
Very cool stuff.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.490
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Wow.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.640
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.430
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Were
there any dangerous moments

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.220
in those expeditions?

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.928
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah,
the smallest thing--

00:01:18.928 --> 00:01:20.370
an ant called the bullet ant.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.650
It looks like a big
chunky black ant.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.840
And I saw a scrawny camp dog
jump and get out of the way.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.720
And I asked my guide.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.480
I said, why did that dog just
jump out of the way of the ant?

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.550
He said, oh, it's the
law of the jungle.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.907
If that ant bites us, it's
equivalent to 38 bee stings.

00:01:35.907 --> 00:01:36.990
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Yikes.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.850
CHUCK GAIDICA: And so I stayed
clear of them myself, too.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.090
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: [CHUCKLES]

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.936
CHUCK GAIDICA: It was good.

00:01:39.936 --> 00:01:41.880
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: OK, yeah,
if the dog's scared of an ant.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.410
CHUCK GAIDICA:
Yeah, I'd just watch

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.454
where the dog wasn't
going, and I'd just-- yeah,

00:01:44.454 --> 00:01:45.370
I went with him, yeah.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.328
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: OK.

00:01:46.328 --> 00:01:49.410
So, Chuck, during all this
time you spent in the industry,

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.440
are there any periods of
those 30-plus years that were

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.570
your favorite,
where you could say,

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.370
I really miss the '90s or--

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.214
[CHUCKLING]

00:01:57.214 --> 00:01:58.060
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.615
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Any--

00:01:58.615 --> 00:02:00.670
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah, I've been
through a lot of decades, yeah.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.010
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Yeah, tell us about that.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.570
CHUCK GAIDICA: Well, I
started about '80-ish.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.620
So I've been in the
business almost 38 years.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.830
So I started down south.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.900
I grew up in Chicago--

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.850
never worked there;
almost went there--

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.140
and wound up starting
in a small market.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.620
In television, what we used
to call broadcasting-- now

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.700
everything is media.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.940
But in the day, you always
started in a small market.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.890
And you worked your way up.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.020
And I started out
to be a dentist--

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.840
a doctor.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.965
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Oh wow.

00:02:32.965 --> 00:02:35.480
CHUCK GAIDICA: Got
to Loyola University.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.886
Loved the idea, but I
was programmed as a kid

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:38.760
I should be a doctor.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.470
Nothing against
doctors, by the way.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.880
But I dropped out in the first
half of my first semester.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.880
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Wow.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.338
CHUCK GAIDICA: So
I kid my children

00:02:46.338 --> 00:02:48.420
that I'm able to operate
on them with a spork.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.940
That's about all I can do--

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.040
plastic.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.270
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: And
you have a child that's

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.770
becoming a doctor now, correct?

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.769
CHUCK GAIDICA: Well, a
different kind of doctor.

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.100
Right here in Ann Arbor.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.020
He'll have a doctorate
in neuroscience.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.260
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Wow.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.370
CHUCK GAIDICA: Researcher.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.080
So he's working on
Parkinson's, which

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.190
is just the coolest thing.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.160
I mean, he is on fire to
find a cure for Parkinson's.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.970
So it's a lot of fun.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.340
So I started there.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.110
Moved very quickly early on.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.150
Nine months in my first job.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.250
I met my wife there.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.230
Got fired on purpose.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.431
Called her up and said,
meet me at my townhouse.

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:18.930
She did.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.740
I had nothing.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.090
I had a bicycle.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.450
And I don't remember if I had
the love seat or the sofa.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.640
My buddy and I moved
together from college,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.230
and so we were roommates.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.200
So I got the sofa, the bicycle,
and I think I had a table.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.760
And I got down on one knee.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.080
And I said, would you marry me?

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.740
I have nothing.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.860
I didn't even have a ring.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.594
[CHUCKLING]

00:03:36.594 --> 00:03:37.635
Basically, it was an IOU.

00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:38.759
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Oh, OK.

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.093
CHUCK GAIDICA: And we'll be
married 36 years next month.

00:03:41.093 --> 00:03:42.092
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Wow.

00:03:42.092 --> 00:03:43.200
CHUCK GAIDICA: 7/11--

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.241
I remember that now because
we get free Slurpees.

00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:46.050
[CHUCKLING]

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.690
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Congratulations.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.273
CHUCK GAIDICA: Thank you, yeah,
on the Slurpee or the wedding?

00:03:49.273 --> 00:03:50.410
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Both.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.368
CHUCK GAIDICA: And so
then I move really quick.

00:03:52.368 --> 00:03:53.430
And I got to Detroit.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.110
I don't know if anybody here
will remember back in the day,

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.950
there was a weather guy
here named Sonny Eliot.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.810
And he was probably, when
I got here, about 65-ish.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.150
And I was this young
whippersnapper from down south.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.110
I got the job.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.550
I didn't know him.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.580
And so that's how
I got to Detroit.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.800
Channel 2 was CBS
back in the day.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.540
Worked there for five years.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.440
Went to work for the network.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.940
Substituted for two years in New
York on the CBS Morning News,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.800
all the while still living here.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.680
And then Channel
4 heard that I was

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.130
thinking of jumping to Chicago.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.213
They said, no, you're not.

00:04:28.213 --> 00:04:29.550
And I went to work at Channel 4.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.250
And that was almost
to the month--

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.210
next month August, it will
be 30 years at Channel 4.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.210
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Wow.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.480
Congratulations.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.980
CHUCK GAIDICA: So crazy.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.665
I mean, it just--

00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:39.830
[SNAPS] just went as fast
as the first couple three.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.740
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Are there others

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.834
at Channel 4 that have
been there 30 years?

00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:44.000
CHUCK GAIDICA: No, I think--

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.894
and I'm just part time
now because I left,

00:04:45.894 --> 00:04:46.560
and I came back.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.726
It's kind of like the mafia.

00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:49.660
You're never allowed to leave.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.130
So no, I think I
may have tenure.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.440
I think I'm the guy, yeah.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.050
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Oh.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.560
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.700
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Great.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.190
What brought you into the
industry in the first place?

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.412
I mean, being a weatherman
would be fun, I imagine--

00:05:01.412 --> 00:05:02.245
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah.

00:05:02.245 --> 00:05:02.670
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
--for anybody.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.950
CHUCK GAIDICA: So I
drop out of school.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.820
I go to work at
Walgreens drugstore,

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.500
trying to figure out what
I'm going to do with my life

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.750
because now I'm this guy
with a lot of great grades

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.250
and a free ride to Loyola.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.274
But I've just told
my parents, sorry,

00:05:14.274 --> 00:05:15.440
I don't want to be a doctor.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.050
It didn't go over too well.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.059
And so I went to
work at Walgreens.

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:22.600
I'm trying to figure out how do
I take my interest in science

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.840
and math, which I loved
and I was strong at,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.760
and how do I take my
interest in journalism

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.140
and put them together?

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.330
So I came up with meteorology.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.300
And I transferred to
Southern Illinois University,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.450
where they had a program--

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.930
not a major-- in meteorology.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.820
Left there with
this buddy of mine,

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.370
and we went to interview for
a job in Evansville, Indiana.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.150
And I was qualified to
either be a TV news reporter,

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.260
or I could do the weather.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.000
I had enough training.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.360
And so he went in for
the interview first.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.150
There were two job
openings-- a TV reporter

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.820
and a TV weatherman,
five days a week.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.790
And so he went in first, and he
comes out with a big thumbs up

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.770
like, I got this one.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.690
And so they call
me in, sit me down.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.700
In those days we had tapes.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.680
And they put my
tape in the machine.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.020
They watched my tape of me
doing reporting and weather.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.910
And they said, we
like your tape.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.349
We're going to offer
you either job.

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:17.140
And I already knew I
wanted the weather job

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.639
because I could get trained by
the National Weather Service.

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.250
So I said, well, how
much do they pay?

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.250
The general manager said,
well, the reporter job

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.580
is $10,000 a year.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.770
And the weather guy
is $15,000 a year.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.640
I said, [CLAPS] I'm
your new weather guy.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.310
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Yeah, easy decision, huh?

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.740
CHUCK GAIDICA: So that's
the way it started.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.823
And then I did get trained
by the Weather Service.

00:06:34.823 --> 00:06:37.720
So I was able to forecast and
work with the computer models.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.841
And so I've got degrees
that are different.

00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:40.840
I've got a master's now.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.920
So I have varied interests.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.337
But weather was the
interest at the beginning.

00:06:45.337 --> 00:06:47.670
Still is every day, even
though I don't do it every day.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.000
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: OK.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.460
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.350
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: So weather
is your primary interest.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.850
You've also been a game show
host for the "Michigan Lottery

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:53.350
Show."

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.450
CHUCK GAIDICA: That was
kind of by accident.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.350
I auditioned three times for the
"Michigan Lottery Game Show."

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.767
It was seen in nine
markets in the state.

00:07:02.767 --> 00:07:04.600
And I thought, oh, this
isn't going to work.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.400
I mean, what are the odds?

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.865
And I had been called by a
group out of California, Barry

00:07:09.865 --> 00:07:12.850
&amp; Enright Productions, to
audition for "The Joker's Wild"

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.074
and for another game show.

00:07:14.074 --> 00:07:15.740
And I didn't want to
move to California.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.040
It didn't make sense
for my family's life.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.917
So I auditioned.

00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:22.000
Two or three of these
auditions, and by that time,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.210
I was getting a little upset.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.610
I thought, hey, if you
want me, you want me.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.050
And if you don't, it's OK.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.310
I got stuff to do.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.351
And they said, sure, how
would you like to do it?

00:07:29.351 --> 00:07:30.730
We'll tape every Friday.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.720
And I thought it would be like
a one-year flash in the pan.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.501
It was 12 years.

00:07:34.501 --> 00:07:35.500
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Wow.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.575
CHUCK GAIDICA: So
worked out fine.

00:07:37.575 --> 00:07:38.950
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
That was fun?

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.760
CHUCK GAIDICA: And I got to
give people $50,000 a week

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.120
and a car or a cruise.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.370
And I thought, what a country?

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:45.790
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
People love you.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.456
CHUCK GAIDICA: What
a country, you know?

00:07:47.456 --> 00:07:48.450
[CHUCKLING]

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:49.991
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Oh, that's great.

00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:52.270
Tell us a little bit
more about your career

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.240
and how you've adapted and
changed your personal brand

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.891
over the past 38 years.

00:07:56.891 --> 00:07:58.390
CHUCK GAIDICA: Well,
in recent time,

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.200
we've used that phrase
"personal brand."

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.200
I don't know that I ever
thought of it that way.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.950
But it's been described
to me as a brand.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.990
So for me, I started
to get a little knock

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.666
on the door in my 40s.

00:08:10.666 --> 00:08:12.040
I think it happens
to some people

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.429
maybe earlier in their
30s, but in my 40s.

00:08:15.429 --> 00:08:17.470
And the knock on the door
was not midlife crisis,

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.600
like I needed a
Corvette or something.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.520
It was, why am I here?

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.380
What am I doing?

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.410
Is this all there is--
those kinds of questions.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.800
So I got a hold of a
book called "Halftime--

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.110
Moving Your Life from
Success to Significance."

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:36.700
And I thought, man, [SNAPS]
that resonates with me.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.600
I thought I was always
a good guy, you know.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.240
I like to do good for people.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.549
But I thought, yeah,
that really resonates.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:45.610
So I started really
thinking about this idea.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:46.840
What am I going to do?

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.970
So as I was looking at
that, I thought, well,

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.740
now I may have an issue in terms
of a personal brand or a story,

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.780
like is this authentic?

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.580
And it was, and it is.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.130
And so for me, that
was the beginning

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.410
of this journey of trying
to figure out, well,

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.949
what am I going to
do when I grow up?

00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:06.990
And I think we go through
that in various stages.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:12.720
I remember in my late 30s to
early 40s asking questions

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.840
that I asked myself
when I was 10.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.880
I grew up in the
inner city of Chicago.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.500
Sitting on a back porch,
concrete backyard--

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.290
a little bit of grass lawn--

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.810
looking up at the stars,
wondering one night,

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:25.800
why am I here?

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.834
Is there a god?

00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:28.500
What am I supposed
to do when I grow up?

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.447
Who will I marry?

00:09:29.447 --> 00:09:30.780
You know, all the big questions.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.580
And then you fast
forward into my 40s.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.140
And I'm asking, why am I here?

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.890
Is there a god?

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.360
What am I supposed
to do when I grow up?

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.980
You know, I'm married,
and it's all working out.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.660
So I didn't have
to ask that one.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.530
But that whole idea of what am
I going to do when I grow up

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.110
was a really
interesting question.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:49.200
I was flying at the top of
my game in broadcasting.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.470
But yet I felt like there was
going to be something more.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.450
And more didn't mean better.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.120
More didn't mean more money.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.060
More to me was, what can I do?

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.960
I guess success to
significance resonates.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.430
But for me, that
was the question.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.760
What can I do to help people?

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.100
And so that's when life
started to shift for me.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.320
It's very interesting.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.528
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: And what
steps did you take next?

00:10:14.528 --> 00:10:16.927
I understand you went to
Jerusalem and other parts--

00:10:16.927 --> 00:10:17.760
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.500
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: --of the
world to discover yourself

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.340
and learn more about your faith.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.470
CHUCK GAIDICA: Well, I
went back for a masters.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.090
I went back for a master's
in ministry and leadership.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.330
I'm a student of leadership.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.180
So I like that
idea of wondering,

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.139
how do you walk
alongside people?

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:30.180
How do you motivate them?

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.388
I mean, I'm in your building.

00:10:31.388 --> 00:10:33.870
And I'm watching, how do
you keep this group moving?

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.740
And what's going on?

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.060
And it's not by accident
that I got a free latte.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.690
I mean, it's like, wow, I'm
motivated now, you know.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.440
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Yeah, a good one, too.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.981
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah,
it's a good one.

00:10:42.981 --> 00:10:44.340
So that began.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.760
Part of my journey was to
go live in Israel and Jordan

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.536
for a month.

00:10:48.536 --> 00:10:49.660
So I studied on the ground.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.190
Covered archeology and
history of the Bible.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.770
So that was a
reinforcing thing for me.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.410
And then I was invited--

00:10:58.410 --> 00:10:59.910
I actually put on a conference.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.280
900 baby boomers showed up.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.370
And I had a speaker come in
from the Halftime Institute.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:10.080
The same man who wrote the book
took his wealth and decided he

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.440
was going to target it toward
doing good by inspiring

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.720
what he would describe, I
guess, as high-capacity men

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.600
and women who maybe are
at that stage like I was.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.310
What am I going to do now?

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.760
And then coach them-- come
alongside and send them out

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.390
into the world.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.590
Go do good.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.810
So I went to this
intensive three-day thing

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.880
out at Pepperdine
University in Malibu.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.010
I don't know how kids
go to school in Malibu.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:32.100
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
It's beautiful.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:32.650
CHUCK GAIDICA: Oh my gosh.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.660
You walk out, and
there's the ocean.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.310
I'm thinking, I would
slack off all the time.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:36.360
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
That's your motivation

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.210
to stay there-- stay in school.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.477
CHUCK GAIDICA: Right, I'm
a six-year freshman, yeah.

00:11:40.477 --> 00:11:43.157
So I go out to Malibu.

00:11:43.157 --> 00:11:45.490
And I'm in this three-day
intensive with coaches who had

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.540
walked away from their jobs.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.602
Multi-billion-dollar
operations is what they led.

00:11:50.602 --> 00:11:51.810
And there were only 10 of us.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.184
And they're coaching
me on what do you

00:11:54.184 --> 00:11:55.350
want to do when you grow up?

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:56.730
What is that going to look like?

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.830
What is success to significance?

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.460
What are your strengths?

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.010
What are your weaknesses?

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:05.620
So it was a fascinating
part of the journey.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.560
So I come back now, and
I've got a certificate

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.414
in second-half significance.

00:12:09.414 --> 00:12:10.830
The irony, of
course, is I'm still

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.480
trying to figure out my own.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.000
So it's still part
of the journey.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.620
And I think the other part of
this that maybe would resonate

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.620
was when I started to go
through these feelings,

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.940
I had to make sure that
my spouse was on track.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.330
And at the beginning,
she did not

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.950
understand these feelings I had.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.491
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Did she think you

00:12:30.491 --> 00:12:31.890
were having a midlife crisis?

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:32.370
CHUCK GAIDICA: Maybe at--

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.180
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: My
wife would say that.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.990
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah, I think
at the beginning, she did.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.031
And then I coined a phrase
that really helped me.

00:12:37.031 --> 00:12:39.360
It was lethargic for
me, and it helped me.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.560
I would tell her, and I would
tell my kids if they asked--

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.560
and anybody that asked--

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.350
I'm having the most
fun being confused

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.480
I've ever had in my life.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.060
Now part of that was
because I could be confused

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.170
at that stage in my life.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.130
And I still had a great job.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.180
But I knew I was
looking for what's next.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.830
And so that unfolded over
the course of about a decade.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.780
And I wound up
getting my master's.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:08.370
By the time I was done, I
got my master's at age 54.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.810
So I'm on track to
get a PhD when I'm 90.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:11.310
So--

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.030
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: All right.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.080
CHUCK GAIDICA: --you
know, it's never too late.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.190
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Oh, that's great.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:15.690
What are some of
the steps we can

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:19.350
take to find significance
or move from success

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.240
to significance?

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.057
Anything that we could maybe--

00:13:22.057 --> 00:13:22.890
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.681
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
--leave today and think

00:13:24.681 --> 00:13:25.635
about doing ourselves?

00:13:25.635 --> 00:13:26.880
CHUCK GAIDICA:
Well, I think that--

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.230
there are people that
have different views.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.510
Steve Harvey just wrote
a book called "Jump."

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:30.840
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Mm-hm.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.215
CHUCK GAIDICA:
And his premise is

00:13:32.215 --> 00:13:35.790
that sometimes we think about
this idea of doing things.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.650
It may not even be
goodness, right?

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.210
It may just be a job.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:40.252
And we think about it.

00:13:40.252 --> 00:13:40.960
We pray about it.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.890
We do about it.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.470
And then we just get paralyzed.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:44.740
We don't move.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.070
So one of the premises
anyway of his book is jump.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.660
Just take a chance, and
lean into your strengths.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.330
And there are some
that would say,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.750
you should analyze
your strengths.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.930
I think that's a good idea.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.601
You know, Gallup
"StrengthsFinder," $15.

00:13:57.601 --> 00:13:59.100
You can get your
top five strengths.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.070
And I've been told by
world-class coaches that

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.140
probably in your lifetime,
maybe your sixth strength

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.100
will cycle in.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.850
But basically your top five
are your top five strengths

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:10.630
for your lifetime.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.930
Well, that's good to
know what I'm good at.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.420
But if you look at the
YouTube videos or Vimeo--

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.890
wherever they are--

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.750
it will also show you red flags.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:20.950
Be careful.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:24.860
So in my case, my top
strength is I'm a learner.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.087
I love to learn stuff.

00:14:26.087 --> 00:14:28.170
But I don't know if you
noticed, when I walked in,

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.503
I went and looked at the camera.

00:14:29.503 --> 00:14:30.310
Like, who makes it?

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.820
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Mm-hm, right.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.153
CHUCK GAIDICA: What brand is it?

00:14:32.153 --> 00:14:33.730
That's a downside for me.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.837
So I'm a learner,
but, like, I want

00:14:35.837 --> 00:14:37.420
to look at the bottom
of my latte cup.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.871
Did that come from China?

00:14:38.871 --> 00:14:39.745
Who makes that paper?

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:41.080
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: You
get distracted or pulled--

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.340
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.520
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: --in
a lot of directions.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.330
CHUCK GAIDICA: So, I mean,
it's good to know that though,

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.280
because then I know
that I shouldn't

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.750
be looking at
bright, shiny objects

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.784
because they can distract me.

00:14:48.784 --> 00:14:50.950
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: I imagine
that makes your career

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.159
a good fit for you, hosting
a morning talk show because--

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:55.450
CHUCK GAIDICA: Being a learner?

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:56.908
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Being a learner

00:14:56.908 --> 00:14:59.525
because the variety of people
that come in is enormous.

00:14:59.525 --> 00:15:00.400
CHUCK GAIDICA: Right.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.566
Well, we've got live guests.

00:15:01.566 --> 00:15:03.565
We've got live animals.

00:15:03.565 --> 00:15:05.420
I mean, we've got
all kinds of stuff.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.800
So it's from people who
are important to people

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.035
who think they're important.

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:10.535
[CHUCKLING]

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:12.450
And I've met both.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.580
And so it's fun because
there is variety.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.870
In my case, I keep retiring.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.290
So I'm going to keep retiring
until I get it right.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:28.720
And so my goal now is really
to focus my energy and my being

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.800
on doing good.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.020
And so for me, there's a
Biblical charge to that.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.544
But there's also an idea that
I really want to do good.

00:15:36.544 --> 00:15:37.960
And what's interesting
is when you

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.180
look at research
from Pew and Barna

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.840
and other sources,
millennials and baby

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.250
boomers, which is what I am--

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.220
I'm a boomer--
show up similarly.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.150
We want to go do.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.950
We want to change the world.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.630
We don't mind travel.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.820
So I think that there
are some differences.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.360
But I'm encouraged that
while the baby boomers--

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.760
there are certain statistics
associated with us.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.970
The millennials have just passed
us in terms of sheer numbers.

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.730
But there's still
73 million boomers

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:13.210
and locked up between now and
the year 2030, $55 trillion

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:17.440
of saved and inherited wealth
in the hands of boomers.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.450
So the difference is we
may all want to go out

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.820
today and go build a
Habitat for Humanity house.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.277
It's just the boomers
will climb the same ladder

00:16:24.277 --> 00:16:25.610
and want to put up the shingles.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.026
But we'll say,
hey, you know what?

00:16:27.026 --> 00:16:27.850
This is so cool.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.370
Let me write a
check for a grand.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:31.619
I'll pay for the shingles.

00:16:31.619 --> 00:16:33.160
Millennials haven't
gotten there yet.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.710
But we actually show up,
interestingly enough,

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.010
with similar loves and
desires about what we

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.360
want to do to change the world.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.380
It's really cool.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.755
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
That's great.

00:16:42.755 --> 00:16:46.450
Do you feel like in your current
role in program television

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:50.410
you have opportunity to
serve as much as you'd like?

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.020
CHUCK GAIDICA: Probably
not, not just because it's--

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.090
I think I can give a
platform to serving.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.115
Maybe I can be an
encourager or more--

00:16:57.115 --> 00:16:59.680
how shall I put
it?-- a catalyst.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.600
I'm not some guru.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.920
But I do like to do.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.220
I mean, I like to be
on the ground doing it.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.030
I don't like to just
be talking about it.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.410
So for me, I love adventure.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.960
It's one of the reasons
I became a private pilot.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.460
A lot of things
because of the media

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.069
I've gotten to do over
the course of my career.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.319
So I love to be
hands-on and go do.

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:23.890
So I may have to shift
that a little bit in time

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.030
to allow me to go do.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.670
And doing-- especially
doing good--

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.020
doesn't always pay well.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.940
But for me, that's OK.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.190
I think there are so many
things going on in the world

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:37.995
that I'd like to be
part of and go do.

00:17:37.995 --> 00:17:39.370
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
That's great.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.647
Yeah, keep inspiring us.

00:17:40.647 --> 00:17:41.230
And we watch--

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.146
CHUCK GAIDICA: I hope.

00:17:42.146 --> 00:17:43.450
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Yeah, good.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.610
I understand being
in program television

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:49.367
that your success of your career
depends highly on your ratings.

00:17:49.367 --> 00:17:50.200
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.741
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
How have you been

00:17:51.741 --> 00:17:55.780
able to hold people's attention
as a television broadcaster?

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.280
CHUCK GAIDICA: Well,
that's changing

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.190
right before our very eyes
because what is media?

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.130
We could do it on
the iPhone right now.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.470
So I think broadcast
television--

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.900
traditional radio
and television--

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.300
we all know what's going on.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.780
Let's say I've got five
kids under the age of 35.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.870
Only one of them owns
or pays for cable--

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.310
only one.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.990
So I think the
cat's out of the bag

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:22.360
in terms of what's happening
in the world in terms

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.650
of on-demand, streaming,
and all the rest of it.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.490
So you guys know that better
than anybody in this building.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:28.690
Where are people going?

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.940
How are they getting
their information?

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.160
My biggest concern--
and it's not just

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.590
because of the recent
discussion of fake news.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:39.230
My biggest concern is where
is news going to come from?

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.500
So I don't need a
gatekeeper to tell me

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.900
it's a left-leaning source
or a right-leaning source.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.270
I need a gatekeeper to
vet to make sure at least

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.750
there are three sources
and that it's truth.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:53.260
And I think we're at the point
now where Google is there.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.360
Lots of others will be
there, that algorithms

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.910
are going to tell me
that [SNAPS] there's

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.290
something happening.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.810
And I think for some
news, that's OK.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:03.999
I mean, if I were
flying an airplane,

00:19:03.999 --> 00:19:05.790
and I had to look for
an emergency landing,

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.580
and I could land in your
parking lot, and all of us

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.690
grabbed our phone, and
we start taking pictures.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:11.460
This is nuts.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.670
Look at the weather guy just
stepped out of an airplane.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:18.630
So if that gets posted, and
somebody can assign high value

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.300
that 200 of us just said an
airplane landed in the Google

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:21.900
parking lot--

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.260
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
That's probably true.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.718
CHUCK GAIDICA: --I don't don't
know that I need a reporter.

00:19:24.718 --> 00:19:27.520
But I think for some things,
I'd like to have a voice.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.150
And I think that's what
media now is struggling with.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.340
Whose voice is it?

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.420
Where is it coming from?

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.170
And maybe in the future,
more importantly,

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.461
where is it going to come from?

00:19:36.461 --> 00:19:41.609
If everything is autonomous,
how do I trust it?

00:19:41.609 --> 00:19:43.650
I think that's a big
question for all of us here.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.010
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Right.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.620
What are your colleagues
doing in the industry

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.780
if viewership is going down?

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:49.980
How are they adapting?

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.260
Are people moving to
online news sources?

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.400
Or how are they staying
in the industry?

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.910
CHUCK GAIDICA: Well, traditional
media is looking at--

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:00.480
well, for instance, WDIV has
the strongest web presence

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.624
in the state, with
ClickOnDetroit.com.

00:20:03.624 --> 00:20:06.120
I think they're all looking
at what does new media mean?

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.230
How do we reach out
through social media?

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:13.890
What is the value of Google
and Facebook and Instagram?

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.772
So it's everything has
a little different play.

00:20:16.772 --> 00:20:18.480
And I think the trouble
traditional media

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.670
is having is trying to figure
out how to monetize it.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:22.500
So you could do it.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.800
We can do all kinds
of cool stuff.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.590
And we can buy or maybe for
free get programs or platforms

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.590
that can do cool stuff.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:35.820
But you can, as you know, if
you're not being productive,

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.390
if all day long all you're
doing is posting on Facebook,

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.390
I'm not sure that all
those people are going

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.830
to come translate into viewers.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.811
So I think that's what they're
struggling with is part of what

00:20:47.811 --> 00:20:48.810
they're struggling with.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:51.600
So there's maybe
a declining scale

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.630
in terms of financial resources
that are coming in to stations.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:56.980
And not just traditional TV.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.260
It's really anybody.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.050
The company that I work for
was owned by the Washington

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.930
Post/Newsweek Magazine.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:08.250
Post/Newsweek--
historic company.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.890
They're the guys that
investigated the Nixon White

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:11.820
House.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.820
This is "The Washington Post"--
not the one we know today--

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.230
"Newsweek" magazine.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:20.160
Eventually, they sold
"Newsweek" magazine for $1,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.804
for really the name.

00:21:21.804 --> 00:21:23.220
And the company
that bought it had

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.040
to inherit about $300 million,
I think is what the number was,

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.050
of debt.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.590
And several years later, they
sold "The Washington Post,"

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.060
mainly for its name.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.420
And so now we're
divested of anything

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.390
that's traditional print
because who in here is reading

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.310
a magazine or a newspaper?

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.820
It's not typical.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.410
So I've watched in my career
my very eyes things not just

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.320
diminish in terms of their
importance and their impact

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.020
but just, I mean, vanish--

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.387
in a practical sense.

00:21:53.387 --> 00:21:54.345
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: OK.

00:21:54.345 --> 00:21:57.750
Can you give us a little
bit of inside experience

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:00.570
of what it's like working
for the television station?

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:04.450
Are there any particular stories
that stand out to you as, wow,

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:06.930
the normal person in the world
wouldn't experience this?

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:09.587
Or waking up at 2:00 AM to
go get ready for a program.

00:22:09.587 --> 00:22:10.420
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.050
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Tell us a
little bit what that's like.

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:14.160
CHUCK GAIDICA: Traditional
broadcasting-- well,

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.960
really any broadcasting,
although today you

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.270
didn't require me to wear
makeup and pantyhose.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:22.497
But that's the-- so for guys,
that's the hardest part is--

00:22:22.497 --> 00:22:24.080
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Putting on makeup.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.040
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.140
The other part of this
that's really interesting

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.850
is the behind-the-scenes stuff.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.910
The people who come
in, who not so much

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.680
are requiring
special-colored jelly

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.600
beans and their private water.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.170
But you do have some of those
demands of guests that come in.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.740
The most fun I've
ever had is probably

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.409
[CHUCKLES] kids and animals.

00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:46.950
I don't think that
that ever changes.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.825
Look, Steve Harvey has
a whole new show now,

00:22:48.825 --> 00:22:49.680
working with kids.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:54.690
And I was out live once at the
airport doing the weather live.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.360
And I really memorize
what I'm going to do.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.200
I did the forecast, so
I ad lib everything.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.630
I just talk for three minutes.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.550
And they tell me,
shut up, and I'm done.

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.757
And so I had notes.

00:23:03.757 --> 00:23:05.340
I put them on top
of a little monitor.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.860
And I'm working
with pygmy goats.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.660
It's just part of the deal.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:09.180
And so--

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:09.950
[CHUCKLING]

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.990
--here are these little
poodle-size animals.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.580
And my paper blew off the top.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.050
You couldn't see it on camera.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.430
I was in full-screen graphics.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.720
But the paper blew
off, settled down,

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.590
and all these goats came running
over and ate my piece of paper

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.180
like they were piranhas.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.290
And I started laughing.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:28.004
And it was the only
time in my career

00:23:28.004 --> 00:23:29.920
where I just couldn't
finish what I was doing.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.570
I said, back to you.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:31.611
And I just kept laughing.

00:23:31.611 --> 00:23:32.820
I couldn't stop.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.600
So there was that.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.040
I've never had major bloopers.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.375
Like, a set hasn't
fallen down or, you know.

00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:42.400
But access is probably
the most fun thing.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.410
So I never would have gone on
expeditions to the rain forest

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.200
or in Peru or top of Mt.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.850
Kilauea if I weren't
in the media.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.560
It wasn't because it was me.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.279
It was because I happened to be
following a kid from Detroit.

00:23:55.279 --> 00:23:56.820
Never in a million
years could I have

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.340
flown through a hurricane
with the hurricane hunters

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.889
because I was in TV news.

00:24:00.889 --> 00:24:02.430
Never in a million
years could I have

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:04.317
flown with the Blue Angels.

00:24:04.317 --> 00:24:06.400
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: You
were in the cockpit with--

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.191
CHUCK GAIDICA: In the
cockpit with the guy.

00:24:08.191 --> 00:24:08.910
And he came out.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:09.850
Who's seen "Top Gun"?

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.290
Have you seen-- oh.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:12.940
So I'm with a Top Gun pilot.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.244
This kid is-- he's 26 years old.

00:24:15.244 --> 00:24:16.660
He walks out, and
he's about ready

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.030
to retire from being
a Top Gun pilot.

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:19.600
He walks out.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.220
Everybody snaps to attention.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.565
And he's got an assistant.

00:24:22.565 --> 00:24:24.190
And they put me in
the seat behind him.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.230
And the assistant
kid reaches in,

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.260
and pulls the lever down,
and locks it into place--

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.536
a big red lever.

00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:31.660
I said, what are you doing?

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.280
He said, I've just
armed your chair.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.540
I said, with what?

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.232
He said, with the equivalent
of two sticks of dynamite.

00:24:37.232 --> 00:24:39.190
So whatever you do, don't
push that red button.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.898
I said, trust me.

00:24:39.898 --> 00:24:41.560
I'm not touching any red button.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.597
But if you've seen
the movie, when--

00:24:43.597 --> 00:24:44.680
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Eject?

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.000
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah, the
ejection and the canopy

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.320
didn't come off.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.870
So I'm with this
Blue Angels pilot--

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.720
Willow Run Airport, Ypsilanti.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.400
And he got permission
to fly along

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.165
the top of the ground, maybe
50 feet off the ground.

00:24:57.165 --> 00:24:58.540
He got to the edge
of the runway.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.940
And he said, when
I say, pull, pull--

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.255
on the second pull,
I'm going vertical.

00:25:03.255 --> 00:25:04.630
I'm going to hit
the afterburner.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:08.790
We were from ground zero to
22,000 feet in 20 seconds.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:09.790
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Wow.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.100
CHUCK GAIDICA: It was awesome.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.780
But you know, I
go to Cedar Point.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.490
I've done Cedar Point and Kings
Island in Ohio in the same week

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.160
because I like roller coasters.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.540
So for me, it was a blast.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.420
And then he did an
inverted barrel loop.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.600
And I never knew that you
could see passing out.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.270
I always thought when people
pass out, they just pass out.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.200
So I see it coming
because we're upside down,

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.130
doing about 2 and 1/2 gs.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:32.180
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
And you passed out.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:32.820
CHUCK GAIDICA: No, almost.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:33.170
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: [CHUCKLES]

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:35.560
CHUCK GAIDICA: No, the good
news is I didn't puke because--

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:35.650
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: That's good.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:36.755
CHUCK GAIDICA: --it would
have been the assistant who

00:25:36.755 --> 00:25:37.150
had to clean it up.

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:38.080
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Was it televised?

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:38.355
CHUCK GAIDICA: No.

00:25:38.355 --> 00:25:38.630
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: From
the cockpit, was it--

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:39.220
CHUCK GAIDICA:
There were little,

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.245
like little lipstick
cameras in the cockpit.

00:25:41.245 --> 00:25:43.120
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Uh-huh.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.310
CHUCK GAIDICA: But that
kind of cool stuff,

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.590
for me, because I
was in the media--

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:50.260
being able to go on expeditions
with world-class researchers--

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.290
I mean, I'm sitting in
the middle of the Amazon

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.540
in Peru with Dr. Bob
Ballard, the guy who

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:56.730
discovered the "Titanic."

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.480
And I'm shooting the
breeze with this guy,

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.980
who was like, you know.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:00.950
He's on Nat Geo.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:04.420
I mean, for me, it's been like
being a kid in a candy store.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.720
That's probably some of
the most fun was just

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.840
being able to have access to--

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.400
I'm standing in the White House.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.650
And when I was in
Little Rock, Arkansas,

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.310
I used to draw a
cartoon character.

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.749
If I did the weather, I slid
open a secret little door,

00:26:18.749 --> 00:26:20.290
and there was a
piece of paper there.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.706
And I'd draw
cartoon named Gusty.

00:26:22.706 --> 00:26:24.425
You know, they
wanted to kill Gusty.

00:26:24.425 --> 00:26:26.050
And I said, I'm not
going to kill Gusty

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:27.341
because everybody will hate me.

00:26:27.341 --> 00:26:28.485
So I'll do Gusty.

00:26:28.485 --> 00:26:30.610
So I can draw a stick figure
with the best of them.

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:31.776
So I drew this stick figure.

00:26:31.776 --> 00:26:32.590
Now fast forward.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.290
I'm in the White House with
President Bill Clinton.

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:37.270
And I'm standing in
a receiving line.

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.186
And the guy in the
dress blues comes up.

00:26:40.186 --> 00:26:41.560
And he whispers
in my ear, you've

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.840
got 15 seconds
with the president.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.777
Make it count.

00:26:44.777 --> 00:26:46.360
And I'm thinking,
ah, what do you say?

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.190
I don't know.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.770
I don't know.

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:48.910
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Were you nervous?

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:49.810
CHUCK GAIDICA: I was.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:50.470
So I walk up.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.054
And he was in Little Rock
when I was in Little Rock.

00:26:53.054 --> 00:26:53.720
And I walked up.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.540
I said, Mr. President, I'm
one of the weather people

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.470
who used to draw Gusty.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:57.100
And he looked at me.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.420
He went, (BILL CLINTON
VOICE) oh, I remember you.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.845
And I'm thinking, you do not.

00:26:59.845 --> 00:27:00.345
You do not.

00:27:00.345 --> 00:27:00.620
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: He did?

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.162
Oh, wow.

00:27:01.162 --> 00:27:03.370
CHUCK GAIDICA: But people
said he had a sharp memory.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:04.875
But I think he was
just being nice.

00:27:04.875 --> 00:27:06.250
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Maybe he did.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:06.720
CHUCK GAIDICA:
Yeah, maybe he did.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.010
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
It's possible.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:07.665
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah.

00:27:07.665 --> 00:27:08.140
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Yeah.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.360
And you became known
for these Cuddle Alerts

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.980
when the cold winter came in.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:12.230
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.830
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: And actually
wrote a book about Cuddle Bear.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:15.010
CHUCK GAIDICA: I did.

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:15.230
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
Is that right?

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.396
CHUCK GAIDICA: Well, when
you hug somebody or cuddle

00:27:17.396 --> 00:27:19.190
with somebody, you
release oxytocin.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.770
So it's called the
cuddle hormone.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.210
I didn't name it.

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:24.640
And so I was in
Little Rock, Arkansas.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.690
And in Little Rock--

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:28.210
that was my stop
before Detroit--

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.080
it was boring.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.619
Winters were boring.

00:27:30.619 --> 00:27:31.660
There was never any snow.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.659
If there was, they'd kick
the kids out of school

00:27:33.659 --> 00:27:35.680
when there was like
a half inch of snow.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.225
And I thought, what am I going
to do to make the winter fun?

00:27:38.225 --> 00:27:39.100
I grew up in Chicago.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.630
We get blizzards--
2 feet of snow,

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:42.716
drifts up the side of the house.

00:27:42.716 --> 00:27:44.590
So I thought, I'm going
to come up with a fun

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.480
way of describing cold.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.570
So I came up with Cuddle Alert.

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:50.590
I eventually had
it service marked.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.590
And so then I start issuing
every night when I moved

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:54.760
to Detroit a Cuddle Alert.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.500
When it got colder than
average, I would say,

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.666
you can cuddle with somebody
you know or don't know.

00:27:58.666 --> 00:27:59.931
It's all platonic.

00:27:59.931 --> 00:28:00.430
And--

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.350
[CHUCKLING]

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.860
--it kind of stuck.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:06.941
And so then, moving forward, I
wrote a book-- children's book.

00:28:06.941 --> 00:28:09.190
And I wrote another book on
cuddling, more the science

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.990
of it.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.491
And--

00:28:10.491 --> 00:28:11.490
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Wow.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:13.760
CHUCK GAIDICA: Kind of
tongue-in-cheek science anyway.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.450
And out of that grew
a little teddy bear.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.362
And while my wife urged me
to make this a nonprofit--

00:28:19.362 --> 00:28:20.320
I probably should have.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.986
I didn't because I
never made any money.

00:28:21.986 --> 00:28:23.460
I wound up losing money on it.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.690
But I took all the
profits from the books.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:28.540
And I put them into teddy bears.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.240
And we gave away about
8,000 teddy bears

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.200
to first responders.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.050
Like if a ambulance pulled
up and saw a kid in a car

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.930
accident, they could reach in
the cab and hand them a bear.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:40.040
And so that was pretty
cool to be able to do that.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.490
So that's been the
fun part of trying

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:46.165
to do good is find ways
to media, old school,

00:28:46.165 --> 00:28:48.790
writing a book-- how do I put it
all together and do something?

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:51.414
And all of a sudden, I wake up,
and there are 8,000 teddy bears

00:28:51.414 --> 00:28:52.660
in the hands of kids.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.120
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
That's wonderful.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:53.920
CHUCK GAIDICA: Awesome.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.780
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: You may
have also played matchmaker

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.050
with those Cuddle Alerts, too.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:57.250
You never know.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:57.910
CHUCK GAIDICA: I've been told.

00:28:57.910 --> 00:28:58.240
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: The viewers.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.380
CHUCK GAIDICA: I've been told.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.100
I've been told.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.020
I actually have had
people walk up and say--

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.850
they point at
their kids and say,

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.672
this kid is a product
of a Cuddle Alert.

00:29:05.672 --> 00:29:06.921
[CHUCKLING]

00:29:06.921 --> 00:29:07.920
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Wow.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.090
OK, yeah.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:08.750
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah, I know.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.830
I'm not paying for college.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:09.620
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Yeah,
serious business here.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.654
CHUCK GAIDICA: I'm really
happy, but you know.

00:29:11.654 --> 00:29:13.820
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: So you
have a big responsibility

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.180
being on air.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.490
CHUCK GAIDICA: Well, I
didn't realize I did.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:16.055
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ: Yeah, so.

00:29:16.055 --> 00:29:16.450
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:18.116
MARC DE SCHWEINITZ:
OK, well, thank you.

00:29:18.116 --> 00:29:19.110
CHUCK GAIDICA: Yeah.
