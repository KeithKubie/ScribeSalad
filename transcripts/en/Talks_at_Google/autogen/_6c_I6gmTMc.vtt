SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: It is my
pleasure to hand the mic over

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.420
to Dana Gunders.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.492
And welcome.

00:00:10.492 --> 00:00:11.908
DANA GUNDERS: Thank you, Scott.

00:00:11.908 --> 00:00:15.212
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:16.628
Thanks, everyone.

00:00:16.628 --> 00:00:19.350
Do you guys-- do so many
of you seriously think

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.510
about food waste every day?

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.262
That's kind of amazing.

00:00:23.262 --> 00:00:25.470
I like to say, nobody wakes
up in the morning wanting

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.140
to waste food that day, but
it just kind of happens.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.640
And that was part
of the reason that I

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.170
wrote "The Waste-Free
Kitchen Handbook."

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.590
It is so fun to
be here right now.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.250
I've been to Google for
various reasons many times.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.597
And I didn't realize
how fun it was

00:00:44.597 --> 00:00:46.680
going to be to be standing
up and not just talking

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.763
about a book in a kitchen.

00:00:47.763 --> 00:00:49.260
That's great.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.680
Thank you for your time.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.060
I know you have a lot of
important things to do.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.590
So thank you for being here.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.180
What I will first say is
that, unlike many people who

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.618
probably give these
talks, I am not a chef.

00:01:04.618 --> 00:01:05.910
You may have heard in that bio.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.530
And my background is
released in science.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.800
And so it is kind of
curious that I wound up

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.750
writing what some
people call a cookbook.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.420
I don't call it a cookbook.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.940
I like to say it's a
reference book for what

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.670
to do in your kitchen when
you're standing there holding

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.560
a slightly wrinkled tomato and
don't know what to do with it.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.350
But I really got
into this-- well,

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.240
when I was born, actually.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.180
My father was raised
in the Philippines.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.750
My mom grew up in Queens.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.380
Her parents ran a lamp store.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.050
And we're all very frugal.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.200
And so when I was
growing up, I would

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.250
be completely embarrassed by
having friends over for dinner.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.010
And my mom would take
the pasta sauce jar.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.000
And she'd put the pasta
sauce on the spaghetti.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.660
And then she would take
water and put it in the jar,

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.923
and then shake up the jar,
and pour this watery pasta

00:02:00.923 --> 00:02:02.340
sauce on top just
to make sure she

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.720
got the last little bits out.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.170
And then we'd sit
down for dinner.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.070
And my dad would
be, like, sucking

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.979
the bones of the
chicken and slurping

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.860
as he did it just to make
sure he got everything off.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.730
And I kid you not.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.080
Last night, I was
staying with my parents.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.320
And my dad sat down with--

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.780
we celebrated Passover
over the weekend.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.400
And so we had all
this turkey left.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.900
And he sat down with a bowl of
bones and started sucking them.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.280
And my daughter sat next to
him and literally started

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.620
picking up bones and
sucking them with him.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.360
I was like, oh, this is such
a special moment for me.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.340
So anyway, that's how
it's been bred into me.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.250
And I'm sure many of you have
similar stories somewhere

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.500
in your families.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.830
But fast forward--
and for me, it

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.450
was really an
embarrassment and not

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.320
something I thought much
about until I started

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.930
working on a project in the
fruit and vegetable industry

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.490
with farmers.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.350
And the project was to
really look at how much water

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.370
or how much energy it took--

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.920
fertilizer, or pesticide,
and other resources

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.390
it took to grow food.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.280
And could we help
those farmers be

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.670
a little bit more efficient
with what they were doing?

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.480
And as I started to look into
the waste component of that,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.180
I was just startled by the
numbers that I was reading,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.530
numbers like 40% of
food never gets eaten.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.110
Around 20% of the
water in this country

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.060
goes to grow food that
never gets eaten--

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.180
and similar numbers
around energy,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.890
cropland, and things like that.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.810
Meanwhile, one in eight
people don't have enough food

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.300
on their tables all year long--

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.680
or at least some
point during the year.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.740
And I just thought,
wow, here we are

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.540
trying to get these farmers
to be this much more

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.070
efficient with their water.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.290
And yet, no matter
how sustainably we

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.407
grow our food, if we're
not actually doing anything

00:04:07.407 --> 00:04:09.490
with it at the end and
we're just throwing it out,

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.030
it's a huge waste of resources.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.560
And that is what really
impassioned to me on this issue

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.019
to the point of
slight obsession.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.940
And I ultimately wrote a report
in 2012 that took on the topic.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.590
I thought it was
just going to be

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.070
me and my boss who read it
and maybe one or two people

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.860
out there.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.060
And somehow, overnight,
CNN picked it up

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.020
on their breaking
news headlines.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.430
I think there was nothing
going on August 23, 2012.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.550
And the next night, I found
myself on "NBC Nightly News"

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.840
talking about the issue.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.830
And it's just been wild
to see how much it's

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.110
resonated over the last
seven years now with people.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.110
There's just been a steady
stream of interest in it.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.730
It's gone from being ranked as
like a top trend for the food

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.800
industry in 2013 to
something that's really,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.170
I would say, become
ingrained as a core pillar

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.240
of what a sustainable
food future looks like.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.650
And that's fantastic.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.270
And we have places like
Google taking the issue really

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.230
seriously, looking across
all the capabilities here

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.900
to think about, how do we make
the food system more efficient?

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.858
Because in the end, that's
really what this is.

00:05:31.858 --> 00:05:33.650
It's an efficiency question.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.640
And how do we do that?

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.190
Now quiz question for you all--

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.790
who in the whole supply chain--
when you think about farmers,

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.000
grocers, restaurants,
people in their homes--

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.050
who wastes the most food?

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.550
Let's say, farms.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.920
Raise your you think it's farms.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.430
Raise your hand if you
think it's restaurants.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.130
Raise your hand if you
think it's supermarkets.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.350
Raise your hand if you think
it's people in their homes.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.570
Yes, it is.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.930
People in their homes
make up about 40%

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.330
of all that 40% of food
that's getting wasted.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.950
They're a huge contributor.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.260
And it's you and
me standing there

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.210
with our overripe
avocado that just

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.770
didn't have the same schedule
as our plans that week.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.940
And so that is kind of what
led me to write the book.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.492
Because I felt like--

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:34.533
like I said, nobody
wakes up in the morning

00:06:34.533 --> 00:06:35.450
wanting to waste food.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.890
But it's also something we don't
really necessarily think about

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.810
in terms of how we're
managing our food.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.490
Are we practicing
the right strategy

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.560
so that we don't
get to that point

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.097
where there is a
science experiment

00:06:47.097 --> 00:06:48.180
in the back of our fridge?

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.640
And how do we think about this?

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.730
And do we have the right
knowledge of how to use food,

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.900
and what can be eaten,
and how to store food

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.480
in order to really
make sure we're not

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.740
wasting a lot at home?

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.100
This is a journey.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.430
In fact, I tell a
little story right

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.800
at the beginning about
being at a coffee

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.390
shop as I'm writing the book.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.950
And there's a salad that comes
with the sandwich I ordered.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.740
And it is like drenched
in dressing to the point

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.260
that I am just not
going to touch it.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.400
And I sat there.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.030
And I was like,
oh, this is ironic.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.218
I am going to waste
half of this plate

00:07:26.218 --> 00:07:28.760
while I'm writing a book to tell
everybody not to waste food.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.840
Isn't that funny?

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.070
But it really reminded
me to let everyone know

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.660
this is not about perfection.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.780
And the great thing
is that every time you

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.630
take a little step
to waste less food,

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.950
it lowers the demand for food
out there just that much.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.820
And I think that really gets at
what the size of the prize is.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.020
So by 2050, it's estimated
that we will need up

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.020
to twice as much food
to feed a growing

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.260
population and a
population that is starting

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.010
to eat more resource-intensive
foods like meat and dairy

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.300
in other parts of the world.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.660
And so where's that
food going to come from?

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.660
That's a huge-- food already
takes up an enormous portion

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.070
of all of our land.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.350
Are we going to cut
down more rain forests

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.350
and grasslands in order to
plant more food to get that?

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.060
Or are we going to
just start being

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.690
more efficient with the food
we have and actually using it?

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.630
And that means finding
ways to really build

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.559
in a more streamlined
system for our food,

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:37.730
as well as looking at how
some of the foods that

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:42.110
are being grown are being
used, such as feed for animals.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.770
And are there ways to better
use that land to grow foods

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.150
that we eat directly?

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:52.580
So with that, we have a
couple of fun recipes.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.430
So the book has some strategies.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.740
And then it has some recipes.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.490
And then it has my favorite
section in the back, which--

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.620
I call it the directory.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.760
And it has 85-plus foods.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.660
And it gives you information
on whether or not

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.930
you can eat the
stalk of a broccoli,

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.880
or a banana if it
has brown spots,

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.790
or an apple if it gets a
little bit mushy, or something.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.410
So you can look
up foods and learn

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.070
how you should store it, about
how long they last, the best

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.250
way to freeze it, and then
little things about what parts

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.650
are edible, and how you
know if it's still good.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.720
But the recipe part is
not your average cookbook.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.170
It really tries to find
things in the kitchen that

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:40.970
often do get thrown out, and
think about ways to use them.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:45.023
So today, we're going to
learn two of those recipes.

00:09:45.023 --> 00:09:46.940
The first is going to
be broccoli stalk salad.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.850
Has anyone ever cut off
this part of a broccoli

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.480
and thrown it in the
garbage or compost?

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.960
I see a lot of nodding heads.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.950
It's totally edible.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.530
And it's delicious.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.020
It's sometimes even sweeter
than the floret part.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.760
And so there is a recipe that
we're going to make today

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.110
called broccoli stalk salad.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:21.270
And there's a couple
of things to know.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:28.510
One is, depending how
strong your teeth are,

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:32.820
this part at the bottom
is usually pretty tough.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.190
So that very part of the bottom,
you might want to cut off.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.410
The outer skin of
the stalk-- and I

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.070
think this is probably why
it's sort of gone out of favor.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.380
The outer skin can be
kind of tough and almost

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.450
too fibrous to really chew.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.030
So when you're
making this salad,

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.511
you do want to peel that off.

00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:56.469
I think I was supposed
to do it into this bowl.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:13.083
Now if you are too lazy
or too rushed to do that,

00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:14.500
there's another
way you can do it.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.330
And you lose a
little bit more trim.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:28.440
But if you just
kind of square it--

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.780
this is what I do sometimes when
my two-year-old is screaming--

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.020
you can also do a little square,
and cut all these those outer

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.190
tough parts off.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.080
Or if you're up
for the challenge,

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.160
you can also leave them on and
have it be slightly chewier,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.270
as well.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.800
So do that.

00:11:53.884 --> 00:11:58.430
I'm not sure where to put the--
oh, I'll just put it there.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:04.280
And then from there, this
is really a basic salad.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:12.000
So we're just-- you
can use a peeler

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.180
and sort of julienne
the broccoli

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.160
into the bowl like that.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:25.620
If you prefer to be a
chopper, you can chop it up

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.615
into little disks like this.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.970
You can sort of
do it into lines.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.130
It doesn't really matter.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:39.330
And kind of mix it up.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.540
But I'll keep doing
this for a moment.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.530
And the other
thing is, sometimes

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.140
if you only have one or two--

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.910
like, if you just buy
a bunch of broccoli

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.150
and you just have
one bunch, then

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.610
you don't necessarily
have enough stalks to make

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.500
a salad like this.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.095
You can just chop
it up and throw it

00:13:00.095 --> 00:13:01.970
into whatever you're
doing with the broccoli.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:05.460
You're making a stir fry, chop
it up, put it in the stir fry.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.060
You're just steaming broccoli,
just cut it down to those ends.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.080
Eat those stems.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.400
There's really no reason not to.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.130
And one other thing I
like to do is use it

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.140
as a substitute for celery.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.900
Because I find that celery
is something that gets

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.310
sold in a bunch that
I don't typically use.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.310
But we go through a lot
of broccoli in my house.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.900
And so instead, I'll
substitute broccoli stalk

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.810
for celery in, say, a soup
recipe or something where

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.040
it's cooked.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.380
It has not exactly
the same flavor.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.840
But like I said, I'm not a chef.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.000
I'm not looking for perfection
in my kitchen all the time.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.590
And so that seems
to work just fine.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.840
OK, so you do that.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.610
And then we're just going to
make it a little bit in here.

00:13:56.394 --> 00:14:01.300
So the next
ingredient is carrots.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.690
You might find this
a little crazy.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.890
I just skip peeling the carrots.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.600
Carrots-- you wash
them, their roots.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.610
They're not any dirtier on the
outside than any other food

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.940
that you might eat directly.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.910
And so you can just put them in.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:22.840
And put them right in.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:29.130
It's less to throw out,
more salad for everyone.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:35.430
So that is what we
do with the carrot.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.970
All right.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.795
Next, we have onions.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:54.187
And cut the onions off.

00:14:54.187 --> 00:14:55.520
What do we do with these onions?

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.020
Anyone have any
idea what they could

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.968
do with this part of onion?

00:14:59.968 --> 00:15:02.460
AUDIENCE: I usually freeze
mine for vegetable stock.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.460
DANA GUNDERS: All right.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.300
I do the same thing.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:04.800
Freeze them.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.160
Make vegetable stock.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.650
They make a great vegetable
stock, especially when you

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.727
do have a lot of onions in it.

00:15:10.727 --> 00:15:12.310
Another interesting
thing about onions

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:19.400
is that the peels can
be used to make a dye.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.060
It's Easter, and
there are actually

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:27.100
a lot of natural dye recipes
out there using red onions

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.720
and their peels, in particular.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.172
So we will do that.

00:15:42.916 --> 00:15:44.685
Chop it up a bit.

00:16:02.946 --> 00:16:03.696
Put that in there.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.492
And then we can throw
in some avocado.

00:16:09.492 --> 00:16:10.950
Now, we'll be
talking about avocado

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.140
for our second recipe
today even more,

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.600
which is chocolate
avocado mousse made

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.400
with overripe avocados.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.910
But for this salad,
just chop it in.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.035
It makes it kind of creamy.

00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:45.210
And we are set there.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.527
Dressing-- super basic.

00:16:47.527 --> 00:16:49.860
You guys are going to be
surprised at how delicious this

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.510
actually is.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.000
And though I'm not
a cook, I did have

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.460
some help from
some professionals

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.890
in developing the recipes
that are in the book.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.980
So I am a cook.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:01.605
I'm not a chef.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:11.069
So we have olive oil,
red wine vinegar, agave--

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:12.460
you can also use honey.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.270
We used agave to make
sure this would be vegan

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.760
for any vegans in the room--

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.990
and some salt. And that's it.

00:17:24.182 --> 00:17:26.310
And we mix it up.

00:17:35.112 --> 00:17:38.515
I'm going to put a portion in--

00:17:38.515 --> 00:17:40.040
not too much.

00:17:47.207 --> 00:17:50.695
And just chop a
little parsley on top.

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:54.760
The parsley that we're using--

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.620
turns out, it comes
with some stems--

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.930
totally edible,
totally able to be

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:01.630
thrown in if you're putting
them in the food processor

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.090
or with anything.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.480
I chop them up and just use
them in whatever I'm doing.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.590
Other people may just want to
use the leaves for something

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.700
like garnish.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:20.500
But then you can use the
stems and stalk just mixed

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.360
into any kind of salad.

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:29.660
So throw those in on
top, and mix it up.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.610
And we're going to get to
try this in a little bit.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:34.910
It's best if you let
it sit for a while.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:41.020
Because it softens the
broccoli up and just

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:45.100
marinates it a little bit.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.220
So that's that.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.140
Any questions there?

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.940
Do you guys use broccoli stalks?

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.440
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
Yeah, I'm hoping

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.420
she's going to plate
that, so we can see it.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.240
Yeah, so in our operation,
which is a little larger

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.780
than cooking for four, or
five, or six people at home,

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.690
we would have large machines
like this that would basically

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.930
do all that prep for us.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.830
But I love the point about--

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.720
a lot of vegetables you
may not have to peel.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.012
And if you are peeling them,
a lot of these byproducts,

00:19:11.012 --> 00:19:13.200
like the onion skin, can
be used in so many things.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.742
And so we would do
the same approach.

00:19:14.742 --> 00:19:16.550
And so the carrots--

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:18.920
most of our chefs don't
peel carrots anymore here.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.190
We actually just put out
a little piece on this

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.160
to Googlers that, when you're
peeling away the fiber,

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.560
you're losing some of
that nutrient, as well

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.880
as the textural fiber.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.210
So leaving it on there--

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.252
as long as it's cooked in
a proper way in the way

00:19:32.252 --> 00:19:34.103
that you slice it
super thin, it's still

00:19:34.103 --> 00:19:35.270
going to be super delicious.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:37.062
And so we're doing a
lot of the same things

00:19:37.062 --> 00:19:39.180
you're talking about but
at a much larger scale.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.055
So it's great to see.

00:19:44.018 --> 00:19:46.670
DANA GUNDERS: There's kind of
this mantra in the food waste

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:52.235
world, if you will, that is
similar to if you've ever heard

00:19:52.235 --> 00:19:55.560
of "reduce, reuse, recycle."

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.100
It's similar to that.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.750
We like to think about
it the same for food

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.330
but with some nuances.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.600
But the first tenet is let's
try to not have extra food.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.400
Let's try to not
have food scraps.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.240
Let's try to use it all
food as much as we can.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:16.340
And for the home cook, that is
partially about how you shop,

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:16.910
actually.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.180
Because when you're
shopping, that's

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.220
when you're making the
commitment to food.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.950
So if you planned your
meals really well,

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:28.210
if you have made
a shopping list--

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.310
you've actually stuck
to your shopping list--

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.847
that helps you manage your food.

00:20:32.847 --> 00:20:35.180
Because it's really about how
you're managing your food.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.610
And it helps you not
wind up in that place

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:40.370
where you just bought
something on a whim

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:44.660
and didn't get
around to using it.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.380
And part of it is also
being able to use up

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.437
most of the vegetable.

00:20:51.437 --> 00:20:53.270
You sometimes hear
people talking about nose

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.520
to tail cooking
for meat and trying

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.170
to use up all of the animal.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.490
Well, it's kind of the
same thing in fruits

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:03.140
and vegetables-- is a root
to stalk, they call it--

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.220
and really trying to
use the whole thing.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.060
So things like beets, if
you buy them in a bunch,

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.710
you can actually use
those beet greens.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.240
Cut them up, and saute them.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.900
It's like a two
for one in my book.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.120
I just heard someone
the other day say,

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.740
carrot greens are going
to be the new parsley.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.930
And you can use those, as well.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.810
So there's a lot
of little things

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.000
you can do to just
make more of what

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.700
you're using in the kitchen.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:34.580
And I have to say, this topic
have been amazingly resonant

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:39.290
with people, just these
like tips and tricks on,

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:40.430
how do you use stuff?

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.360
How do you store your food?

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.400
I have found that it's a
topic that keeps giving.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.580
And people are really
constantly trying

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.160
to learn and do a little
bit better in their kitchen.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.540
There's a lot of
curiosity around it.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:01.550
All right, so let's go forth,
and make some chocolate

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.640
mousse using overripe avocados.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.110
We're going to move over here.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.560
I would like to pass this
around real quickly, actually.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.880
We'll do one this
way and one this way.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:17.330
Check out the avocados
we're going to use today.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.890
And tell me what
you would normally

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:22.550
do with an avocado like that.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:27.750
If anyone says, guacamole, first
of all, I don't believe you.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:32.690
Second of all, I
think that guacamole

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.240
using overripe avocados
tastes a little funny.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.160
That's the thing about
overripe avocados.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.820
They have a little
bit of a funky taste.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.880
And the other thing
about avocados

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.820
is they're really hard to nail
in that perfect window of time.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.920
You buy it, it's so hard.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.950
And then you do stuff,
like live your life.

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:55.880
And then you come home, and then
you're like, ugh, I missed it.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.200
Has anyone ever had that happen
to them on their $2.00 avocado

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.930
or $1.50.

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.270
So when I discovered
this recipe,

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.010
I was so excited about it.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:11.120
Because, well,
you're going to see.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.810
It's amazing in
how well it hides

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.270
that funky, overripe
flavor of avocados.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:23.520
Now, are any of you
frightened to eat this?

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.820
All right, bold people here.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.960
But a lot of people are.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:31.970
So a lot of people pick up
an avocado that is this mushy

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:37.040
and feel like, this is bad.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:37.910
This is bad.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:41.540
And I don't know
if I can eat it.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.760
And I think what's
behind that is, is it

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.210
going to make me sick?

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.120
So this is actually, I think,
a really important thing

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.270
to understand when
you're in your kitchen.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.910
Because we all have that
moment where we're like,

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:56.870
can I eat this?

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.776
Is this going to make me sick?

00:23:58.776 --> 00:24:01.310
And here's what I want
to tell you about that.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:05.720
People get sick from food
because it's contaminated.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.630
So you hear about people
getting sick from E. coli,

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.960
from salmonella, from Listeria.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.710
Those are all what they
call foodborne illnesses

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:20.480
from pathogens, which are
bacteria that get on the food

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.160
before it's entered your mouth.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.770
Oftentimes, it gets on
the food at the farm,

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:27.770
at the processing plant,
somewhere along the way

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.290
before it's gotten to you.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.390
What makes food old
and what makes it

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:37.010
decay are totally different
bacteria and actually

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:38.870
a lot of enzymes
which are not bacteria

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.167
but sort of natural protein--

00:24:41.167 --> 00:24:43.250
I don't know what enzymes
are-- but natural things

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.280
in the food that break it down.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.250
Those bacteria and enzymes
that break food down

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.920
are not what make people sick.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.420
And so there's kind
of this mass fear

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:01.070
around old food in our country
that is leading a lot of food

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.610
to be thrown out.

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.370
And when you look
at the date labels--

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.490
we see this happening around
the dates that are on food.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:12.350
And you'll see best by,
sell by, use by dates.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:15.380
Does anyone want to take a
guess at what those mean?

00:25:20.138 --> 00:25:20.638
Yes?

00:25:20.638 --> 00:25:23.097
AUDIENCE: Isn't it when the
store has to sell it by,

00:25:23.097 --> 00:25:24.680
and then it has to
go off their shelf?

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.130
But it doesn't mean you
can't use it at home.

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:28.380
DANA GUNDERS: OK, that's good.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:32.935
So when the store has to sell
it by to get it home to you

00:25:32.935 --> 00:25:35.310
with enough time so that you
can actually use it and have

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.660
a good experience with it.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.780
That is true for sell by
dates that actually say

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.208
the words "sell by" on them.

00:25:41.208 --> 00:25:43.500
And then we see others that
say "use by" and "best by."

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.480
Who wants to take a guess?

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.438
I saw a hand over here.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.850
So it turns out that
used by and best

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:55.950
by dates-- first of all, none
of them are federally regulated.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:58.350
The only product
that is federally

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:01.290
regulated around these
dates is infant formula,

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:04.140
which has a use by date,
because the nutrients can

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:04.908
decline over time.

00:26:04.908 --> 00:26:07.200
And they want to make sure
that the infants are getting

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.970
the appropriate nutrients.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:13.320
Other than that, those
dates are actually

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.050
manufacturers' estimate--
so their best guess--

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:22.140
at when the product is at
its top quality or freshness.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.810
And so if you have a
yogurt, for instance,

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.420
the way a company might
come to that date is

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:31.200
to take a bunch of
consumers, a focus group,

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.420
put them in a
room, and give them

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.380
five-day-old yogurt,
eight-day-old yogurt,

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.170
10-day-old yogurt
and say, OK, rate

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.930
this on a scale of 1 to 10.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:47.760
And as yogurt gets older, when
the score drops to below a 7,

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.180
let's just say, that's the
date that they do it on.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.855
And so it's really about, is
the texture-- or sometimes

00:26:53.855 --> 00:26:55.860
it's, does the texture change?

00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.060
But those dates are actually
not meant to indicate the food

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.400
safety, or to tell
you that it's bad,

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.940
or it should be thrown
out on that date.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.010
The vast majority
of them are really

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:10.170
just trying to tell you
that this product is

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:14.670
at its top quality and I,
the brand, stand by it.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:18.690
And so one of the things that I
really try to dispel out there

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:22.745
is the fear of food that
exists about it going bad.

00:27:22.745 --> 00:27:24.120
And one of the
ways we do that is

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.520
to make delicious
overripe avocado pudding.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.020
So hopefully, I
have not scared you.

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:36.990
And what's awesome is
this is super easy.

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:40.680
If you only have one overripe
avocado-- this is with two--

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.420
you can actually just
do this in a bowl

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.087
if you don't have
a food processor.

00:27:44.087 --> 00:27:44.920
And just mash it up.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.200
And that actually
works, as well.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.030
So I'm going take that out.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:52.930
Scoop it in.

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:02.500
There's also some neat products
coming out that are natural

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.680
coatings-- and they've
started with avocados--

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.690
to actually make the life
during which it's ripe,

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:14.090
that period of time for
which it's ripe longer,

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.330
which I find fascinating.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:22.765
And it just slows the ripening
process down a little bit.

00:28:22.765 --> 00:28:25.240
All right, take that out.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:38.700
And then all we're going
to add is some cocoa

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:48.425
powder, agave syrup--

00:28:48.425 --> 00:28:53.150
you can also use
maple syrup or honey.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:55.350
Honey changes the
flavor a little bit--

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:11.175
and salt, vanilla,
milk of your choice,

00:29:11.175 --> 00:29:15.780
be it cow or some
kind of alternative.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:22.278
This is pea milk that
we are using today

00:29:22.278 --> 00:29:24.950
to keep it vegan
for anyone who is.

00:29:33.615 --> 00:29:34.440
Put it in there.

00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:44.860
When I did my book
tour, I tried to make

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.850
this in a few different places.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:50.570
And we had one that was
quite a large audience.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:53.590
And we had to find, like,
50 overripe avocados, which

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:56.560
is not an easy thing to do.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.870
Because we had to go to,
like, five different stories

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:02.198
and beg them to give us
their overripe avocados.

00:30:06.978 --> 00:30:10.248
Let's see if that's done it.

00:30:10.248 --> 00:30:11.290
Yep, I think we're there.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:17.580
All right, and
there you have it.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.170
We'll get to try this soon--

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.220
delicious avocado mousse.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:29.010
Also, what I love about
this recipe is it's vegan.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:33.278
It is also way healthier than
throwing the usual butter

00:30:33.278 --> 00:30:35.320
and cream that you would
into a chocolate mousse.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.753
So it's an added benefit.

00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:38.920
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Awesome.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.470
We've done some taste tests with
some chefs on this dish before.

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.353
And many of them
couldn't tell that it

00:30:44.353 --> 00:30:45.520
didn't have the cream in it.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.937
They knew something
was different.

00:30:46.937 --> 00:30:48.562
But they couldn't
tell that they didn't

00:30:48.562 --> 00:30:51.280
have the actual fat, because the
avocado did a great job of it.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.280
It's a really good dish.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.680
DANA GUNDERS: Yeah, I can't
wait for you guys to try it.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.710
And we are actually going to
try it with strawberries today.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:01.930
And what I want you to know,
should you care to try this,

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:04.150
is that the green parts
on strawberries-- this

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:06.690
was like the very
last fact that I

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:10.630
had to verify before sending
my book to the publisher.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:13.960
And I did so by talking to
the California Strawberry

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.220
Commission.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:21.070
And the green parts on
strawberries are, in fact,

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:23.080
edible.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.050
They're a little bit chewy,
but I welcome you to try it.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.330
Their texture is not
ideal for eating.

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:30.602
But I think it comes
very much in handy

00:31:30.602 --> 00:31:31.810
when you're making smoothies.

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.040
Because it takes a lot of work.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.450
If you're doing it with
fresh strawberries,

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:36.220
you can just throw
them in, blend it,

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.560
and you won't notice
the difference--

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.223
get a little extra
vitamins in there for you.

00:31:42.223 --> 00:31:43.390
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Awesome.

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.670
So first off, big
round of applause.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:49.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.870
We're not done yet.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.770
So the chefs in the back are
putting both of these dishes

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:55.450
together for everyone to sample.

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.085
So my first question
is, you have obviously

00:31:58.085 --> 00:31:58.960
thought this through.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.043
You've wrote a book on it.

00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:01.630
You've got all the
tips in your head.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.470
How do you bring others along?

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:05.500
So, say you've got a
friend, a spouse that

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.390
just doesn't think about it.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.520
What's been successful?

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.530
And maybe toddlers
aren't the best example,

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.100
because you can
kind of mold them.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.490
But what's been the
best example in trying

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.800
to get others to think
differently about what you're

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.187
so passionate about?

00:32:19.187 --> 00:32:20.770
DANA GUNDERS: That's
a great question.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:28.750
What I have found is
that people naturally

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.340
don't want to see
food going to waste.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.170
There's something
instinctive or something.

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:36.110
And so when I first
got into this topic,

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:37.840
I was really surprised
by how much it

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.400
was resonating with everyone.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.460
And then I just tuned
into that, that people

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.330
don't like food to get wasted.

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:52.030
However-- so getting them
to care is not that hard.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:56.560
But getting them to notice
is what's really hard.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.100
Because we are not
wasting 40% of our food

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.520
in one big chunk over here.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.770
And you're not throwing all
your food out in your home

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:05.170
at one time in the year.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.310
It's happening every
day a little bit.

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:08.580
It's scraping your plate off.

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.710
It's not touching the potatoes
on a breakfast platter

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:13.460
that you go out to for brunch.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:18.190
It's just cleaning out
your fridge here and there.

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:20.720
And so it's really hard to see.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.190
And so I think the
two things that

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:26.770
have worked-- one is really
talking about this food safety

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:29.710
issue and getting people to
understand and be a little less

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:33.760
afraid of their food
by understanding

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.710
the science behind food.

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:38.320
What really is going on
there that could make you

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.340
sick or not?

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:44.800
And therefore, empowering
people to cook and try things

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.740
that they maybe
didn't try before.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.650
I think the other is--

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.320
I have found that it
is kind of entering

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.760
the ethos a little bit.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.890
And I think that
we're really going

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:03.700
to win when it is very
uncool to throw food out.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.220
That, to me, is going
to be the big engine.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:11.350
So I see it in my life-- since
you asked about my life--

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:14.039
because people are afraid
to eat dinner with me.

00:34:14.039 --> 00:34:16.245
Because they sit down at dinner.

00:34:16.245 --> 00:34:17.620
They don't think
about it before.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:18.578
And then they sit down.

00:34:18.578 --> 00:34:21.250
And they're like, oh,
am I going to have

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:24.250
to finish this plate
of food, because I'm

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:25.820
having dinner with you?

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:30.550
And so I see that
cultural, that sort

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:32.800
of social pressure that
I think is actually

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.679
really effective on this topic.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:40.360
And I always say, hey,
I'm not the food police.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.915
We'll get a leftover box.

00:34:41.915 --> 00:34:42.415
It's OK.

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:50.440
And then we go back
to it being a journey.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.300
I think what's really
helpful on this topic

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.580
is seeing the fun in it.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.520
Because there's a lot of fun
in learning new tips and tricks

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.310
and just becoming more
familiar with food.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:03.802
And so I think finding the
fun in it keeps it alive.

00:35:03.802 --> 00:35:06.010
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: I like
your example a lot better.

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:08.050
In a lot of kitchens--
not at Google

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:09.730
but in a lot of
kitchens-- you are first

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:14.290
learned how to combat food waste
when the chef walks up, takes

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:16.710
the garbage can that you put
all your food trimmings in,

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:19.165
dumps it upside down, and
makes an example of you.

00:35:19.165 --> 00:35:20.440
It happened to me once.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.980
I was very young.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:22.480
It stuck.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.980
DANA GUNDERS: I can't tell you
how many people come up to me

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.430
and go, oh, my god, I
thought of you the other day.

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:29.710
I had this almost rotten tomato.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.743
And I threw it in a pasta sauce.

00:35:31.743 --> 00:35:32.410
I'm like, great.

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:34.202
I'm like the queen of
rotten tomatoes here.

00:35:34.202 --> 00:35:35.118
That's actually like--

00:35:35.118 --> 00:35:36.595
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
That's awesome.

00:35:36.595 --> 00:35:38.970
So we have a few minutes for
questions from the audience.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.190
I'd love to hear anything
that's on your mind.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:43.690
If you don't have questions, I
might have questions for you.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:46.300
And the question might
be, what is the one tip

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:50.080
that you do at home that's been
successful in combating waste?

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.750
Like, you're going to the
big box stores less often,

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.917
and shopping more often per
week-- things like that.

00:35:54.917 --> 00:35:57.292
So if you don't have questions,
I might come back to you.

00:35:57.292 --> 00:35:58.110
So raise the hands.

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.104
Yes?

00:35:59.104 --> 00:36:00.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:01.570
DANA GUNDERS: Yeah.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:02.903
You can answer that, too, Scott.

00:36:02.903 --> 00:36:05.560
So the question was,
what works better?

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.500
Is it letting people serve
themselves or pre-plating food,

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.030
in terms of waste?

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:16.750
I think the closer we can get
to letting people customize

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:21.510
their plate for what they
want, the better we're doing,

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:25.570
the less likely it is that
they'll waste something.

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:28.060
So in a home setting,
I think, certainly,

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:32.050
letting people serve
themselves can be better.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:34.640
I know there's been a lot of
thought behind this at Google.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.980
So I'll let you answer it on--

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.960
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Yeah, it's
a really complicated question.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.270
And we look at a lot of the
things that we focus on.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:41.540
There's food waste at Google.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.980
There is line throughput.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:44.290
There's portion control.

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:44.980
There's balance.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.090
There's all of these.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:48.220
We find it quicker
and more effective

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.190
and overall appealing
to the users

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.750
if we actually plate the food--

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:54.390
but the caveat of having
a conversation to see,

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.300
would you like more or
less of this or that?

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.550
And can have the conversation.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:37:00.660
But to Dana's point, if you
can ensure that people are only

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.077
getting what they want in the
exact amounts, that's great.

00:37:03.077 --> 00:37:04.743
Part of the problem
here that we have is

00:37:04.743 --> 00:37:05.970
there's so much variety.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:07.230
The more you see,
the more you might

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:08.130
want to put on your plate.

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:09.780
And then you get to
the point of there

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.250
might be too many offerings.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.458
So I would say that another
great tip is really be

00:37:13.458 --> 00:37:15.000
mindful of how much
variety you have.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.958
Because the more you
offer, the more people

00:37:16.958 --> 00:37:18.250
want to try all the good stuff.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:20.730
DANA GUNDERS: Yeah,
that is absolutely true.

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:24.240
I think when you really peel
back the layers on this topic,

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.770
you get down to a few themes.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:28.470
One is portions.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:30.990
So quick pop quiz here--

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:35.400
how much have the calories in
the average cookie increased

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.440
since the 1980s?

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.160
Anyone-- doubled, tripled, more?

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.970
They've actually quadrupled in
calories, the average cookie.

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:49.240
And the average Caesar
salad has doubled.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.580
So our portions have
increased tremendously.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.170
We have this mindset
that quantity

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:57.930
is value as a general
thing in our country.

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:00.960
And that is leading
to waste-- so portion.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.880
But then variety
is another thing.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.860
We really want choice.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.940
And there's a PhD
student who did

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.380
some interviewing of people.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:16.110
And she said, hey, if
you brought eggs home

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:20.460
from the store and you
dropped them on the floor,

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.330
how would that make you feel
as you're putting them away?

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.220
And of course, everybody
felt very upset about that.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:31.110
And then she said, hey, if you
don't drop them on the floor,

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:32.580
you put them in
your refrigerator.

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.410
And four weeks later,
you get to them,

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:35.753
and they're not good anymore.

00:38:35.753 --> 00:38:37.170
But you haven't
eaten any of them.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:38.550
How do you feel about that?

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:42.000
And they felt less
bad on the scale.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.980
And I think that's
really fascinating.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.500
Because I think behind
that is something

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.770
around having the
option to eat something.

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:54.400
So I think we want to have
our options when we want them.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.040
And we also want a lot of them.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.610
And that's true in our homes.

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:00.390
So we have more food our fridge
than we actually are eating.

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:02.400
That's also true in a
grocery store, where

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.400
they have to carry like
50,000 different items

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:09.690
so that we can walk in and
pick which kind of cereal

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:12.030
we want out of an entire aisle.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:14.700
And it's also true in
restaurants, where there's

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.400
a pressure to have a
pretty big variety of foods

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.348
and a big menu.

00:39:18.348 --> 00:39:19.890
And that makes up
a little bit harder

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.530
to do all their stocking,
and inventory, and things.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:24.750
So I do think the
variety and choice

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:27.130
thing is an underlying driver.

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.380
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Excellent.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:29.733
Yes?

00:39:29.733 --> 00:39:30.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:32.740
DANA GUNDERS: Yeah,
great question.

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.730
The question was,
are there any efforts

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.340
to reduce portion sizes, given
that we're not that active?

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.860
We don't actually need as
much as a lot of people

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.780
are eating in the country.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:48.180
There is a lot of attention
to that, particularly because

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.060
of the health components of it--

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:53.360
the increased calories and all
the health effects of that.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.620
And here in California,
there's a law

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:58.410
around posting the calories.

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:01.110
You may have seen,
different like fast food

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:04.323
restaurants or restaurants
of a certain size

00:40:04.323 --> 00:40:05.490
need to post their calories.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:10.150
That's been one policy
effort towards that.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:13.752
I think there is a lot more we
could do-- is what I could say.

00:40:13.752 --> 00:40:15.210
There are people
thinking about it.

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:16.960
We have dietary
guidelines about it.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.770
But in terms of what impacts
you when you pick up a plate,

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:21.890
and put food on it,
and how much you eat,

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:24.390
I think there's actually some
innovative stuff that could be

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:30.600
done to change habits in place.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.170
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
So real quickly,

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.570
what we've been doing
for several years--

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:39.552
probably going on four,
close to five years

00:40:39.552 --> 00:40:41.010
through this current
system, but we

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:43.690
were doing it previously-- is we
have a system that we partnered

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:44.190
with.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:45.090
It's called LeanPath.

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:48.393
And imagine a scale and a
camera that is in your kitchen

00:40:48.393 --> 00:40:50.310
that, every time you
have some trim left over,

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:51.518
you can take a picture of it.

00:40:51.518 --> 00:40:53.970
And what that data does is it
allows you to look at, over

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:56.670
the course of a day, a week,
a month, a year, whatever--

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:59.430
through the 70-plus cafes
we have in the Bay Area,

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:00.690
there's a lot of food--

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:03.000
where we have
potential opportunities

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.840
for overproduction.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.000
Are we making too much?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.800
Are we buying things that maybe
could come in already peeled,

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.660
so we're not throwing
that in the compost?

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.690
And all of that data, over time,
allows us to basically menu

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:16.260
smarter so that we're able to do
a repetitive cycle menu, which

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.060
means that, in any
cafe you're in,

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:21.020
that menu will run for
probably about three weeks.

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.020
And then it will repeat.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.670
And so the chefs
now have a rhythm,

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:25.380
knowing that every
three weeks they're

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.210
going to make that recipe a
little bit better, a little bit

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:29.580
tastier, and they're going
to be a little less wasteful.

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:33.930
And I'm happy to say that the
Bay Area, for the last probably

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:36.480
three quarters, has
achieved all of their KPIs.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.700
And they just won the
Sustainability Award

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:40.980
at Environment Day based
off of their efforts

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.330
around food waste.

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:44.725
We have a long way to go
in other aspects of Google.

00:41:44.725 --> 00:41:46.350
Imagine all the stuff
that we take back

00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:50.040
to our desks and things that
don't make it to the cafe waste

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:50.640
stream--

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.440
but overall, doing
an amazing job.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.410
And it's folks like Dana
and people like you that

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:56.820
are asking those questions.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.830
We all need to continue
to think that through.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:01.240
Because it's not just
a waste of the product,

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.240
but it's a waste of the
time of all of our chefs

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:06.060
that have made that food that
we then end up throwing out

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.517
for all of the "right
reasons" at that moment-- so,

00:42:08.517 --> 00:42:09.100
good question.

00:42:12.067 --> 00:42:13.900
DANA GUNDERS: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:16.000
The question was around schools.

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.640
Schools are complicated.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:30.640
Because of the federal funding
that happens for school lunch,

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:35.890
there's a requirement
to at least offer

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:39.370
a certain amount of food and
certain different quantities.

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:44.860
And different schools interpret
that a little bit differently.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.900
There are a lot of people
thinking about this.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.790
So what you have are
you have kids going

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:49.570
through the school lunch line.

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:50.260
They take a milk.

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:52.180
They literally don't
touch that carton of milk.

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.680
They feel like they
have to take it,

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.470
or the lunch lady is telling
them they have to take it.

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:58.570
And then it goes
straight in the garbage.

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.500
Because they're not even allowed
to share it with anybody else.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:03.670
And at that very
same school, you

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:09.160
have 80%, 90% students
who are low income enough

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.520
to be qualifying for the free
and reduced lunch programs.

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.280
And some of them likely
don't necessarily

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.530
have a steady supply of food
to their tables all year.

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:20.740
So it's a real conundrum.

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:23.260
And I'll tell you,
what's happening on

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.212
that front is that
there is a lot of push

00:43:25.212 --> 00:43:27.670
for schools to understand they
only have to offer the food.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:29.212
They don't actually
have to serve it.

00:43:29.212 --> 00:43:31.960
So students don't always
have to take all of the food.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.090
They have to be given
the opportunity.

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:36.940
There's a lot of work
on share tables--

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.568
so places where students,
if they do take food

00:43:39.568 --> 00:43:41.860
and they don't touch it, they
can put it on that table,

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:43.690
and others can take it.

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:47.950
And there's some work on how
to send food home with students

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:50.360
at the end of the
day or week that

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.610
could help with that, as well.

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:55.893
So yeah, it's a real
opportunity area, I think.

00:43:55.893 --> 00:43:57.310
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
A huge, again,

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:58.210
round of applause for Dana.

00:43:58.210 --> 00:43:59.090
Thank you very much.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:43:59.470
Great job.

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:00.928
DANA GUNDERS: Thanks
for having me.
