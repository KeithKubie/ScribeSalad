00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.450
 What I would like to do in this presentation is to prove one of the most 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.980
 The results are useful in geometry, namely the peripheral angle 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.950
 It is a corner whose head is located on an ocean 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.080
 Circle 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.800
 This is the peripheral angle 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.950
 I'll call it psi - I use the psi name for the peripheral angle 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.170
 The angles in the display 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.530
 psi, or peripheral angle, equals exactly 1/2 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.880
 Corner center which has the same arch 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.730
 I have used many good words, but I think you 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.650
 You know what I say 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.820
 If this is PSI 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.470
 An oceanic angle 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.710
 Located, its view is located on the perimeter of the circle 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.570
 If you draw the two rays that come from this angle 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.040
 Or Vetrin who knew this corner, will intersect 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.340
 Circle from the other end 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.390
 If you look at the part of the circumference of the circle where the circle is located 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.730
 Inside it, this is the bow that 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.160
 Compiled by psi 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.010
 They are all excellent words, but I think the idea 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.920
 Quite directly 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:28.485
 This is an arc that is contained by psi, where the psi is 

00:01:28.485 --> 00:01:31.560
 That corner is here, and the head is located 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.400
 On the perimeter of the circle 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.920
 Now, the central corner of the corner neighborhood where the head is 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.460
 Located on the center of the circle 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.880
 I suppose this is - I'm trying to tell it - 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.510
 Here is the center of the circle 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.360
 Let me draw a central angle that includes this same arch 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.470
 It looks like a central angle that has the same arch 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.390
 So 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.440
 Let's call it Theta 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.030
 This angle is psi, and this angle is theta 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.120
 What I will prove in this presentation is that PSI is always 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.050
 Equal to 1/2 theta 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.220
 If I wanted to tell you that PSI is equal, I do not know 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.330
 25 degrees, so you will quickly know that theta 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.090
 Must be equal to 50 degrees 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.080
 Or if I tell you that theta is measured 80 degrees, you'll 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.300
 You know directly that the PSI measurement is 40 degrees 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.500
 Let us prove this 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.520
 Let me erase this 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.730
 And a good place to start, or where 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.460
 I will start with it, a special case 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.250
 I will draw a peripheral angle, but one of the strings 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.910
 You know it will be circle diameter 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.526
 This will not be the general situation, it will be 

00:02:50.526 --> 00:02:51.320
 Special case 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.325
 Let me see, this is the center of the circle 

00:02:55.325 --> 00:02:59.030
 I try to catch it 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.770
 The center looks like this 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.210
 Let me draw a diameter 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.440
 If the diameter looks like this 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.410
 Then let me know the peripheral corner 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.860
 This diameter is considered one of the ribs 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.910
 Then the other side may look like this 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.520
 Let me name this psi 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.120
 If the PSI, this length is a radius - that is 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.330
 Radius of the circle 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.080
 Then this length will be radius 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.760
 The circle that moves from the center of the ocean 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.130
 The ocean is defined by all points 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.340
 A distance equal to the radius of the center 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.610
 If this is also a radius 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.920
 Now, this isosceles triangle 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.890
 He has two equal ribs 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.880
 Two equal ribs 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.630
 We know that when we have two equal ribs 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.290
 The corners of the base are equal 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.640
 If this is also equal to PSI 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.130
 Perhaps you will not realize it 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.180
 So inclined 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.720
 But I think many of us when we see a triangle seem 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.940
 As such, if we assume that this is r and r, where are these two 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.860
 The two sides are equal, if these are PSI 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.830
 You will know that this angle is also PSI 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.930
 The corners of the base are equal in the isosceles triangle 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.720
 If these are PSI, those are also PSI 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.770
 Now, let's look at the central corner 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.710
 This central corner has the same arch 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.920
 Let us look at the arch that surrounds it 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.300
 This is the arc of the floodlight enclosing it 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.350
 This is the central angle, ie theta 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.000
 Now if this corner is theta, what will this angle be? 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.620
 This angle 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.010
 Well, this corner is complementary to Thita 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.640
 That is measured by 180-theta 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.560
 When you combine these two angles you will get 180 degrees 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.750
 They will be a line 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.790
 They are complementary to each other 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.740
 Now we also know that these three angles are located 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.260
 Inside the triangle itself 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.030
 If their total must also be 180 degrees 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.300
 We get psi -psi + these + psi ones + psi + these 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.420
 Corner = 180 - Theta + 180 - Theta 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.130
 These three angles must be a total of 180 degrees 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.740
 They are the angles of the three triangle 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.605
 Now we can ask 180 from both sides 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:43.260
 psi + psi = 2psi, - theta = 0 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.840
 We collect theta for both parties 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.770
 We get 2psi = theta 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.850
 Hit both sides with 1/2 or divide both ends on 2 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.680
 We get a psi equal to 1/2 theta 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.070
 So we have demonstrated what we wanted to prove 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:07.120
 For the special case where the peripheral angle is defined, and where that is one of 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.200
 Ray, if we want to consider these lines as rays, where one of the 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.220
 The radiation that defines this peripheral angle is 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.180
 Along the diameter 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.200
 The diameter forms part of that beam 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.720
 If this is a special case where one angle 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.760
 Located on the diameter 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.660
 And of course we can generalize this 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.580
 Now that we know that if these are 50 these 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.820
 It will be 100 degrees, is not it? 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.460
 Whatever the measurement of PSI or whatever theta measurement, the PSI will be 1/2 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.450
 So, whatever the measurement of PSI, FTATA will be 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.830
 2 x so 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.110
 This is applied at any time 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:55.440
 We can use this theory at any time - using those 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.460
 The result we'll get, we can now do it a bit 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.890
 Although this does not apply to all peripheral angles 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.090
 Let's draw an oceanic angle that looks like this 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.980
 If this status, status, you can consider it 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.470
 Inside the circle 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.150
 This is the peripheral angle 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.890
 I want to find a relationship between these 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.450
 The peripheral angle and the central angle that includes 

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.360
 Same bow 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.880
 This is the central corner that has the same arch 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.550
 Well, you might say, none of these endings or these 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.310
 The strings know the angle, and none of them crosses the diameter 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.400
 But what can be done is that we can draw Qatar 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.300
 If the center is located through these two poles 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.100
 We can draw diameter 

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.920
 We can paint Qatar looks like this 

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.680
 If we draw a diameter it looks like this, if we know this angle 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.430
 To be psi1, this angle is psi2 

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.320
 Clearly, psi equals the sum of these two angles 

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:04.350
 We call this theta angle 1, and these are theta 2 

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.240
 We will know this directly, using the result 

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:12.540
 I got it, since we have one side of the corners in both cases 

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:18.260
 It is a diameter now, we know that PSI1 

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.010
 = 1/2 theta 1 

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.870
 We know that psi2 equals 1/2 theta 2 

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:30.140
 psi2 equals 1/2 theta 2 

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:39.850
 If PSI, ie PSI1 + PSI2 

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.120
 They are equal 

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:47.580
 1/2 theta 1 + 1/2 theta 2 

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.180
 psi1 + psi2 = first peripheral angle 

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.850
 Which we want to deal with 

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:54.980
 This is psi 

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.350
 This equals 1/2 × 

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.960
 Theta 1 + Theta 2 

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.960
 What is Total Theta 1 + Theta 2? 

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.470
 So it is worth the original thatta 

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.490
 We were dealing with it 

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.080
 Now we see that psi equals 1/2 theta 

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.710
 We have now proved it to be more general 

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:20.020
 Where the center is located within the two radii 

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.640
 They know that angle 

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:27.100
 Now, we have not yet identified a slightly more difficult situation or 

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:33.660
 The situation is more general where this status is 

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:39.420
 The circle and I have a peripheral angle and center is not 

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.990
 Located within the Altran 

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.820
 Let me paint it 

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:48.800
 This will be the head, and I will replace the colors 

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.540
 Let's assume that this is one of the strings that you know 

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.320
 The angle, so 

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.860
 Suppose that this other string is known 

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.170
 The angle is so 

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.500
 How can we find the relationship between, let's 

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:07.910
 We call, this corner, let's call it PSI1 

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:13.050
 How to find the relationship between psi1 and central angle 

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:16.160
 Which includes the same arch? 

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.530
 When I talk about the same bow that is here 

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.720
 If the central corner has the same arc 

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.660
 You will look like this 

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:32.910
 Let's call it Theta 1 

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.770
 What we can do is use what we learned when we rib off 

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.350
 The peripheral angle is the diameter 

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.135
 Let us create it 

00:10:41.135 --> 00:10:44.260
 Let me paint a cat here 

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.010
 The result we want should be 1/2 

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.180
 But let's prove it 

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:57.560
 Let me draw a diameter like this 

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:09.490
 Let me name this corner, let me call it psi2 

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:14.770
 It includes this bow - let me draw it 

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.140
 In dark color 

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.770
 This bracket is included 

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.360
 If the central corner has the same arc 

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.300
 Let me call it Theta 2 

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:30.890
 Now, we know from the first part of the presentation that PSI2 

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:37.600
 Equals 1/2 theta 2, right? 

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.760
 They share - Qatar is here 

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.300
 The diameter is one of the tendons that form the angle 

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.500
 If psi2 equals 1/2 theta 2 

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.810
 That's exactly what we were doing at the last show, right? 

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.430
 This is an oceanic angle 

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.550
 One of the strings that defines falls on the diameter 

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.740
 This equals 1/2 this angle, ie the central angle 

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.980
 Which includes the same chord 

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.000
 Now, let's look at this larger corner 

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.680
 This corner is bigger 

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.240
 psi1 + psi2 

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:22.720
 True, the larger corner is psi1 + psi2 

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.680
 Again, it includes this whole arch, and 

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.100
 Where the diameter appears to be one of the strings that are known 

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.310
 This corner is huge 

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.380
 This is equal to the central half of that angle 

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.580
 It has the same arch 

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.270
 We use what we have explained in this offer 

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:47.390
 If this equals 1/2 this huge angle 

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:51.370
 Theta 1 + Theta 2 

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.530
 We used everything we learned 

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.160
 At the beginning of the presentation 

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.160
 Now, we already know that PSI2 equals 1/2 theta 2 

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.630
 Let me do this compensation 

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.030
 That's worth it 

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:15.330
 I can say that SI1 + - instead of SI2 I will write 

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:26.630
 1/2 Theta 2 is equal to 1/2 theta 1 + 1/2 theta 2 

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.020
 We can subtract 1/2 theta 2 from both ends, and 

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.740
 We get the result 

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:40.900
 si1 equals 1/2 theta 1 

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:41.970
 Now we are finished 

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.990
 We have shown the case where the peripheral angle is 

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:50.680
 1/2 central corner which has the same arch 

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.980
 Regardless of whether the center of the circuit is located inside 

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:58.990
 Corner, or outside the corner, or if we have 

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.950
 Qatar on one side 

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:05.860
 Any other angle can be a total 

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.300
 Any one or all we did 

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.190
 If I wish you found this useful and now we can already 

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.630
 Rely on this outcome until we do more 

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.460
 Engineering evidence
