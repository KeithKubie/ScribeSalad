00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.400
Wolverine is one the most popular comic
book characters but how did he get

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.690
all that metal on his bones?

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.200
And what about those claws?

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.430
Let's over think this a bit shall we?

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:20.150
Hey people, Trace here for Dnews with
some interesting insight into the man

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.700
known as Logan.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.960
Wolverine comes out in
theaters this week and we thought,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.789
[mimics sound effects]

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.580
Okay we thought that but we also thought,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.990
"I wonder if there's any scientific basis
for this?"

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.010
[mimics sound effects]

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.720
After some mediocre X-men
films came out in the early 2000s people got

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.250
Wolverine fever and have since been
debating a scientific basis

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.340
for Wolverine's super strong adamantium
bones and claws and stuff,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.070
the same debate comic nerds have been
having for decades.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.180
If we're gonna give Wolverine an adamantium
skeleton with today's technology,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.920
what would we use?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.740
Wolverine's claws and
skeleton use adamantium for their

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.040
indestructible-ness

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.080
and though it is a fictional elements we
do have some cool stuff that's a lot

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.100
like it.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.800
Adamantium is an indestructible stuff
that was once a solid.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.350
That's how it gets its name.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.430
Adamantine
means unbreakable.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.110
While diamond was once considered the hardest
naturally occurring substance and you

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.360
know it is really hard

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.780
it's not very strong.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.500
If you were to hit a diamond with a hammer,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.500
it would shatter.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.000
Tungsten is another option.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It's tough

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.220
but its heavy and unfortunately it's
water soluble so his claws would dissolve

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.600
in his blood.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.600
Not so good.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.220
Titanium is strong and light but

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.670
with the melting point of 1,933 Calvin, we
can't really liquefy it easily to coat Wolvy's

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.850
bones wihtout
also liquefying his skin.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.690
There are strong, tough nanomaterials - alloys
and other specially cultivated substances.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.740
For example,

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.920
wurtzite boron nitrate

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.299
a super strong crystalline substance with
a hugh melting point,

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.960
but unfortunately, it's an irritant.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.470
So if Logan deployed his claws, he'd cause
cell damage to the eyes and respiratory systems

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.060
to anyone in
the vicinity.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.060
DAMN IT!

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.640
I'm thinking the best bet would probably be
aggregated diamond nano-rods.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.510
If you take graphene and you roll it into
a tube and then press

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.780
it together,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.749
it's super strong, it has a high melting
point - it's actually stronger than

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:11.000
diamonds - and it wouldn't

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.799
kill anyone by being exposed to air.

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.239
Which is a plus.

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.170
In the movies, Wolverine has adamantium
injected

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.359
into his body so it could coat his bones.

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.260
And
thanks to its healing factor he survives

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.840
where others would have not.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.840
That's heavy doc.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.730
So how can we get these diamond nano-rods
into Logan?

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.349
We kinda can't.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.139
Once melted, the substance would cease to
be a network of diamonds

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:35.019
nano-tubes so this would just maybe work for
his claws.

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.209
What would we do to cover his bones?

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.310
A company called Liquid Metal produces an
amorphous metal alloy used in everything from

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.799
space technology, to cell phones &amp; toys,
and their metals have the moldability of

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.129
plastic and twice the strength of
titanium, which is pretty good.

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.689
The problem is liquid metal is not a liquid.

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.760
It's a solid alloy of at least three medals:

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.650
zirconium, titanium, nickel, copper or beryllium.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.430
So while it's great for commercial applications,
it's not exactly

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.779
awesome for a superhero.

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:03.040
He'd have to keep sharpening his claws and
the metal has high elasticity.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.409
So instead of a badass, rampaging Wolverine
with metal bone covers,

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.530
we'd have Gumby or Pokey.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.040
Or maybe we should skip the liquid coating
the bones thing and leave

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.690
that to the realm the comic books.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.650
Are you heading out to see the movie
this weekend?

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.370
Tell us what you think, no spoilers!

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.359
And we'll see you next time on Dnews.

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:21.359
Thanks a lot for watching everybody.

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.510
We do this for you.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.510
So thanks.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.511
Bye.
