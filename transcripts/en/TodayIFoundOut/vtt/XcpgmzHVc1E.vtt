00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:12.190
Tom Anderson, better known online as MySpace
Tom, was, for a brief period in the early

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.789
2000s, arguably the most popular man on the
internet.

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.720
Boasting over 200 million friends at the apex
of MySpace’s popularity, Tom was everybody

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.189
who signed up to use the site’s first, but
hopefully not only, friend.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.490
So what is he doing now and why was he everyone’s
friend?

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.840
To answer the latter, well, if you want to
be everyone’s friend, helping to found the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.430
website is a good way to make that happen.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.600
Created in 2003, MySpace was a direct response
to Friendster, an early social networking

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.010
site that has since faded into obscurity,
though at its peak had several million members

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.579
and was turning down dozens of millions of
dollar buyout offers from companies like Google.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.429
In early 2003, while working for a company
called eUniverse, Tom lamented that Friendster

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:02.030
took a heavy-handed approach to so-called
“Fakester” profiles belonging to people

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.120
pretending to be fictional characters, or
satirical accounts from people pretending

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.000
to be celebrities, etc.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.260
Tom felt Friendster’s policy of summarily
deleting these was a mistake, reasoning that

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.750
the internet of all places should be a forum
people felt comfortable expressing themselves

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.150
in any way they chose.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.390
In a later interview, Tom waxed poetic about
the nature of personal identity, musing, “Identity

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.390
is provisional.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.220
Who we are is whom we choose to be at any
given moment, depending on personality, whim,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.170
temperament or subjective need.”

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.810
With this in mind, Tom approached his friend
and eUniverse boss, Chris DeWolfe, with a

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.310
simple proposal- launch a site that basically
aped everything Friendster was doing, but

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.381
not be as stuffy or uptight about users calling
themselves Noir Angel or Dark Blade 69 or

00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:52.130
taking on any persona they chose.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.700
DeWolfe agreed with Tom that this could potentially
be a lucrative venture and the pair quickly

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.240
set about finding a name for the site.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.830
According to Tom, early ideas for what to
call the website included both YoPeeps.com

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.350
and Comingle.com, before DeWolfe remembered
that he had previously acquired the domain

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.680
MySpace.com from a data storage company YourZ.com,
Inc. that had gone out of business.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.379
As for why MySpace took off and the then wildly
popular Friendster went the way of the Dodo,

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.170
the ultimate success of the site is generally
largely attributed to a combination of good

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.900
timing, the duo’s business acumen, their
experience and resources in the field, and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.380
plain old dumb luck.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.000
As an example of the latter, when coding the
website, they committed a cardinal sin in

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.920
software engineering in forgetting to properly
sanitize their inputs.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.730
Or, in other words, they accidentally allowed
users to insert HTML tags and the like into

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.010
their pages.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.859
A huge potential security risk, this nonetheless
meant that users could customise their profile

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.599
pages in almost any way they wanted- people
loved this (at first).

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.299
When this snafu was discovered, while steps
were taken to mitigate some of the security

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.590
problems this could have introduced, Tom and
DeWolfe came to appreciate how allowing users

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.750
to do this fit into the site’s ethos of
letting people express themselves any way

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.999
they wanted.

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:09.230
As a result, rather than fully fixing the
bug, in a great example of textbook software

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.890
engineering ethos, they rebranded the bug
a feature.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.689
As for the duo’s business acumen and experience,
they not only were able to create a system

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.920
that performed much faster than Friendster’s
notoriously slow site, but also embarked on

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.359
a 17 city nightclub tour to woo hot women
to their platform via having professional

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.390
photographers take free glamor shots of the
ladies in exchange for said women joining

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.390
up.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.950
Naturally, where attractive women are online,
the men of the species inevitably flock like

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.150
the salmon of Capistrano.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.969
On top of that, they traveled around attempting
to get bands to sign up on the platform, ultimately

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:49.569
convincing over 5,000 such groups to join
up in the early marketing blitz days.

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.239
These bands, in turn, encouraged their fans
to check out their MySpace pages.

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.260
As DeWolfe put it at the time, “We want
to be the MTV of the Internet”.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.810
Towards this end, they even eventually implemented
features to allow musicians to upload and

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.480
sell their music through the site.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.370
(This strong connection to music is still
one of the ways MySpace survives as a surprisingly

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.250
well trafficked site even to this day, ranking
in around the 3800th most popular site in

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.150
the world and around the 1900th most popular
in the United States.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.850
While those might seem like unimpressive numbers
to the uninitiated, that likely means MySpace

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.380
is still getting several million unique visitors
per month.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.070
Which, well…)

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.460
On top of those in-person member acquisition
methods, the pair also leveraged access to

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.850
their day job at eUniverse’s 20+ million
strong email address list to promote the site.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.140
That said, the biggest initial marketing payoff
came from wooing several of Friendster’s

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.870
most prominent users over to MySpace.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.380
The biggest of these was the now somewhat
infamous social media personality Tila Tequila,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.100
who noted of her social media fame at the
time, “There’s a million hot naked chicks

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.100
on the Internet.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.220
There’s a difference between those girls
and me.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.050
Those chicks don’t talk back to you.”

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.510
At the time, Tequila had approximately 40,000
friends on Friendster.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.370
Besides being fed up with how slow Friendster
was, Tequilla also kept getting in trouble

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.840
on the site for her risque photographs and
larger than life confrontational/controversial

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.840
public persona.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.340
Reaching out to her, Tom and DeWolfe convinced
Tequila that she’d have no such problems

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.180
on their new social media site.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.740
She, thus, jumped ship to the new platform.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.650
Tequila’s impact on the site’s growth
was felt immediately and, soon after, other

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.220
major online personalities followed her lead.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.390
As Tequila herself would later note in an
interview with Time magazine:

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.360
At that time no one was on there at all.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.380
I felt like a loser while all the cool kids
were at some other school.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.570
So I mass e-mailed between 30,000 and 50,000
people and told them to come over.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.390
Everybody joined overnight.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.070
Oft called “The Queen of MySpace”, during
the site’s heyday Tequila had around 1.5

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.100
million friends on the site, which, while
impressive, was nowhere near the 200+ million

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.640
Tom had during MySpace’ reign at the top.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.470
And for those who missed out on that era,
despite Facebook being founded in 2004, from

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:58.640
about 2005 to 2008 MySpace was indeed on top,
including for a brief time in 2006 even becoming

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.900
the most visited site on the internet, edging
out Google for that honour.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.240
And, amazingly, in 2008 MySpace generated
nearly a billion dollars in revenue, valued

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.160
at some $12 billion at that point.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.080
(As an interesting aside, in February of 2005,
DeWolfe even turned down Mark Zuckerberg’s

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.380
offer to sell Facebook to MySpace for a mere
$75 million…

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.510
It’s also fascinating to note that Friendster
likewise turned down an offer to merge with

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.240
MySpace not long before Friendster’s ultimate
decline into oblivion.)

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.150
In any event, as to why Tom was automatically
added as a friend on MySpace, this was partially

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.780
a way to ensure everyone had a friend right
from the start but, much more importantly,

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.160
this was a way to introduce some of the friend
management features to newbies, like the “Top

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.940
8” which allowed users to sort their friends
in order of who they liked most.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.060
As any of us who lived through it remembers,
this was a hugely popular feature that led

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.980
to an amazing amount of teenage angst and
drama.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.920
Although users were free to immediately unfriend
Tom if they felt like it, most didn’t, making

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.890
him, for a brief window in the 2000s, one
of the most recognizable people online.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.041
In regards to Tom’s now iconic profile picture,
Tom continues to use it across his current

00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:09.260
very prominent social media profiles, despite
the picture being around a decade and a half

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.290
old at this point.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.970
On Facebook- yes, we’re quoting a Facebook
post written by the co-founder of MySpace-

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.710
Tom noted that while his name Tom Anderson
is “pretty generic”, his MySpace profile

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.350
picture is so iconic that most internet savvy
people recognise it almost instantly.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.442
Furthermore, in a tweet (and now we’re quoting
him from Twitter- some people just like to

00:07:26.442 --> 00:07:29.650
watch the world burn), Tom replied more succinctly
to a fan asking why he still used the same

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:30.720
profile picture:

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.130
If I used a new profile picture it would break
the internet; my pic has been viewed more

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.100
than the mona lisa bitch

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.600
You might now be wondering if that’s actually
true.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.980
Well, probably not, and definitely not if
you level the playing field to include digital

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.320
copies of the Mona Lisa.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.570
However, if you restrict the sample-set to
the number of people who’ve seen the original,

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:54.330
physical Mona Lisa since the debut of Tom’s
profile pic, then, yes, though, as noted,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.070
that’s hardly a level playing field.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.650
Nevertheless, for reference, the Louvre gets
about 7-9 million visitors per year in modern

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.650
times.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.630
Even if everyone who has gone in the 21st
century took a gander at the Mona Lisa while

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:10.440
there, that’s still at best maybe 120-ish
million people viewing the painting, which

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.470
doesn’t hold a candle to Tom’s profile
pic’s unique viewer numbers.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.030
We do, however, like to think several hundred
years from now “The MySpace Tom smile”

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:23.580
is something that will be studied by historians,
with the profile pic featured at digital museums

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.920
the world over- no doubt a centerpiece of
internet history sections of the museums.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.780
I mean, those perfect teeth, and the way his
eyes seem to follow you no matter what angle

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.909
you look at the picture from…

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.400
What’s he smiling about anyway?

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.529
Did someone make a joke?

00:08:36.529 --> 00:08:37.680
Is he just naturally photogenic?

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.680
Who took the photo?

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.820
Adding to the mystery and presumably infuriating
future historians, Tom is quite secretive

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.839
about the origins of the photograph when asked.

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:49.399
In any event, beyond not wanting to “break
the internet”, a secondary reason that Tom

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:53.130
has never changed his profile picture is that
it looks almost nothing like him today.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:57.860
You see, paradoxically for a man who once
had 200+ million online friends, Tom is a

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.420
pretty private person and he’s noted that
he’s very happy that the most well-known

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.680
photo of him in existence isn’t all that
representative of how he looks most of the

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.680
time.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.850
In an interview with PetaPixel Tom further
explained: “I’m always amazed that someone

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.930
can recognize me from that picture.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.040
Its kind of been a benefit that people don’t
really know what I look like…

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.980
I get recognized just enough for it to be
fun and not disruptive.”

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:23.600
Which is actually pretty genius and something
we’ve written about before when discussing

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.680
Daft Punk.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.800
To summarize a point we made in that article,
Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.410
adopted their robotic alter egos early in
their career partly so that they could enjoy

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.509
fame without having to deal with the inevitable
downsides that come with it, such as being

00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:38.540
constantly accosted by fans or followed by
the paparazzi.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.069
This all brings us around to what Tom’s
up to now.

00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:45.810
It turns out, Tom has a bit of an obsessive
personality about whatever he’s currently

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.720
doing, with those interests being quite diverse.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.550
As he notes, “I’ve lived many lives, so
to speak.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.621
At one time I was in a band (both as a singer
and guitar player) and that was all I did

00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:56.621
every day.

00:09:56.621 --> 00:09:59.670
If you knew me in college, you would have
assumed I was going to be an egghead professor….

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.800
I like change.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.499
I like the idea that anything can happen…”

00:10:03.499 --> 00:10:07.660
What he doesn’t reveal there is that before
all that, at the tender age of just 14, he

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.050
spent his days hacking, going by the name
Lord Flathead.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:14.470
Most famously, he managed to hack into Chase
Manhattan Bank’s mainframe.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:19.270
Not as exciting as movies depicting such things
make out, he reportedly managed this by simply

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:24.189
war dialing and then, when the system responded,
he was eventually able to guess an administrative

00:10:24.189 --> 00:10:26.339
user name and password correctly.

00:10:26.339 --> 00:10:29.790
Once in, beyond sharing this information with
a few dozen hacker friends, he also changed

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:34.110
a couple passwords to stop certain bank officials
from being able to access the system and,

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:38.550
at least according to a contemporary New York
Times article, created a few accounts of his

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.990
own, then left a message for bank officials
that he was going to start deleting financial

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:46.209
records unless they let him use the computer
for whatever he wanted…

00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:50.899
Unsurprisingly, soon after there was an FBI
raid of some 23 homes in the San Diego area

00:10:50.899 --> 00:10:51.899
where Tom lived.

00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:52.899
Initially thinking they were about to make
some major hacker arrests, what the FBI found

00:10:52.899 --> 00:10:53.899
was a bunch of young teens just playing around.

00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:56.240
Because Tom was so young, the FBI and Chase
Manhattan Bank let him off with a simple slap

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.110
on the wrist- taking away his computer and
never returning it, as well as making him

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.379
promise to stop his black-hat hacking ways
lest he be arrested.

00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:07.610
Much more recently, after spending four years
serving as the president of MySpace when NewsCorp

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:12.769
acquired the site for over a half a billion
dollars in 2005, Tom basically retired in

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:13.769
2009.

00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:17.170
He even ceased using MySpace at that point,
posting on Facebook, “I don’t like using

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.850
it anymore… not a fan of what the new folks
have done with MySpace.”

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.500
(You and me both, Tom.)

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.269
At this point you might be wondering exactly
how much Tom made from selling his stake in

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:27.269
MySpace.

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:31.269
Well, this isn’t clear, with sources wildly
conflicting on the amount- quoting numbers

00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:35.160
everywhere from a few million dollars to a
few hundred million.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.850
Whatever the case, it’s safe to say even
if it was $0, thanks to his salary after the

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.899
NewsCorp acquisition- which included an initial
$30 million, two year contract- after Tom

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:47.939
walked away from the site, he hasn’t had
to worry about money.

00:11:47.939 --> 00:11:52.009
Tom himself sheds a little light on the matter,
stating, “When MySpace sold, I made more

00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:54.550
money than I could ever possibly need”.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.420
Following his quasi-retirement, Tom notes
he spent a lot of time “learning about architectural

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.420
design.”

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.699
He goes on, “When I left the work world,
I started designing my dream house.

00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:05.800
I dived into architecture and bought seven
vacant lots.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.080
My plan was to build one house, move in, and
build the next.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.360
If the next was better, I’d move in and
sell the previous one – so on and so forth”.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.070
He designed and had built three homes before
his passions went another direction, which

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:20.490
leads us to present day in which Tom spends
most of his time with a different obsession-

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:21.490
travel photography.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.910
While he does not sell his photos as, to quote
him, “that would just feel like work, which

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.240
I don’t want to do”, it’s still something
he pursues full time.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.779
This is a profession he was inspired to start
after attending Burning Man in 2011.

00:12:32.779 --> 00:12:34.970
In his own words:

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.779
I became friends with photographer Trey Ratcliff
and since I was going to hang out with him

00:12:38.779 --> 00:12:41.149
at Burning Man, I decided to get a camera.

00:12:41.149 --> 00:12:44.769
I didn’t really develop an interest until
I saw the photos I was getting.

00:12:44.769 --> 00:12:47.629
In other words, I didn’t think “I want
to be a photographer.”

00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:51.839
I just saw the photos that were coming out
of my camera and I was kind of blown away.

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:54.879
I was mystified why I was liking what I was
getting so much.

00:12:54.879 --> 00:12:59.379
With most creative pursuits, I would struggle
for years and still not like the result.

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:03.459
With photography I was liking what I was producing
literally from day one.

00:13:03.459 --> 00:13:07.110
Then gradually it just became a way of life
and now an intense passion…

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:12.149
I’ve divested myself of all other responsibility
so I can just travel and shoot.

00:13:12.149 --> 00:13:16.689
Or to put it another way, like most of your
friends from MySpace who had way more friends

00:13:16.689 --> 00:13:20.420
than you, he’s today spending most of his
time taking artsy photos for Instagram.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.420
And, actually… wow.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:29.300
Unlike most of those aforementioned former
MySpace friends, he’s got some pretty ridiculously

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:44.240
amazing shots over there, which can best,
I think, be described as Top Shelf Travel

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.240
Porn…

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:45.800
Nothing halfway, eh, Tom?
