In general, we would expect our asset manager to have the following features.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.646
First off, loaded assets should be cached so that multiple requests won't

00:00:06.646 --> 00:00:11.818
trigger reloads of content, but instead use the in-memory version. We should

00:00:11.818 --> 00:00:14.624
also be able to receive asynchronous notification when an asset has been

00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:18.158
loaded. This allows us to go ahead and load the asset while also rendering the

00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:21.955
game scene at the same time. In addition, we should allow batches of assets to

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:25.936
be loaded in a single call. This is very critical for when we do map loading or

00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:29.688
other heterogeneous file computation where we need to pass images, JSON files,

00:00:29.688 --> 00:00:34.730
and sounds into the system to allow them to load in a single call.
