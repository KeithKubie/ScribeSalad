your app and tell you what you should be

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:50.050
your app and tell you what you should be
 

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.060
your app and tell you what you should be
doing differently but we're really

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:51.070
doing differently but we're really
 

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.370
doing differently but we're really
interested to hear what happens when you

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:53.380
interested to hear what happens when you

try and take that advice and it's a case
 

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.520
try and take that advice and it's a case
of hey we thought about that and we

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:56.530
of hey we thought about that and we
 

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.340
of hey we thought about that and we
chose not to do it for a reason or we

00:10:59.340 --> 00:10:59.350
chose not to do it for a reason or we

we ran into these roadblocks that's
 

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.990
we ran into these roadblocks that's
really important and useful information

frustration like yeah we tried to
 

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.620
frustration like yeah we tried to
implement this this skeuomorphic design

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:37.630
implement this this skeuomorphic design
 

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.390

our beta beta releases just sure that it
 

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:45.600
our beta beta releases just sure that it
wasn't working so we're going to get

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:45.610
wasn't working so we're going to get
 

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.920
wasn't working so we're going to get
both ends what are we getting right what

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:46.930
both ends what are we getting right what
 

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.240
both ends what are we getting right what
are we getting wrong what are you

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:48.250
are we getting wrong what are you
 

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.380
are we getting wrong what are you
finding easy what are you find it

difficult so we can then feed that back

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.160
difficult so we can then feed that back
 

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.580
difficult so we can then feed that back
into our system as well and try come up

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:53.590
into our system as well and try come up
 

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.870
into our system as well and try come up
with ways to make the things that we

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880
with ways to make the things that we

think of good easier for you guys to do

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:56.740
think of good easier for you guys to do
 

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.100
think of good easier for you guys to do
so that is hopefully going to save other

00:11:59.100 --> 00:11:59.110
so that is hopefully going to save other
 

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.840
so that is hopefully going to save other
developers pain as they try and improve

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:00.850
developers pain as they try and improve

their apps now once you've been reviewed

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:03.190
their apps now once you've been reviewed
 

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.280
their apps now once you've been reviewed
let us know whenever you think you're

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:05.290
let us know whenever you think you're
 

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.900
let us know whenever you think you're
one step closer to pure Android and

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:06.910
one step closer to pure Android and
 

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.490
one step closer to pure Android and
we'll take another look if we notice

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:08.500
we'll take another look if we notice
 

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.470

particularly challenging we'll invite
 

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.310
particularly challenging we'll invite
you to developers strike back to talk

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320
you to developers strike back to talk
 

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.780
you to developers strike back to talk
about what you've done and then once

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:15.790
about what you've done and then once
 

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.360
about what you've done and then once
your app is pure Android magic will

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:18.370
your app is pure Android magic will
 

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.800
your app is pure Android magic will
induct you into the pure Android

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:19.810
induct you into the pure Android
 

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.240

collection which will hopefully offer

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:21.250
collection which will hopefully offer
 

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.010
collection which will hopefully offer
you some extra downloads but more

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:23.020
you some extra downloads but more
 

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.030
you some extra downloads but more
importantly will give you an opportunity

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040
importantly will give you an opportunity
 

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.000
importantly will give you an opportunity

recognition and motivation and hopefully
 

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.040
recognition and motivation and hopefully
some income to the developers who are

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:35.050
some income to the developers who are
 

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.440
some income to the developers who are
brave enough to offer up your apps for

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:37.450
brave enough to offer up your apps for
 

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.750
brave enough to offer up your apps for
public scrutiny so with that I think

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760
public scrutiny so with that I think
 

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.980
public scrutiny so with that I think

part of what we do it's like you know we

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:09.430
part of what we do it's like you know we
 

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.889
part of what we do it's like you know we
do stand here and in this show in

00:14:10.889 --> 00:14:10.899
do stand here and in this show in
 

00:14:10.899 --> 00:14:12.540

doing so criticizing those who haven't

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.360
doing so criticizing those who haven't
 

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.329

really the reverse part of our job is

00:14:19.949 --> 00:14:19.959
really the reverse part of our job is
 

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:21.360
really the reverse part of our job is
taking all of that feedback from you

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:21.370
taking all of that feedback from you
 

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.069
taking all of that feedback from you
guys and that's why we really mean it

00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079
guys and that's why we really mean it
 

00:14:23.079 --> 00:14:24.720
guys and that's why we really mean it
when you say you know we tried to do

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:24.730
when you say you know we tried to do
 

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.129
when you say you know we tried to do
what you said and we couldn't for

00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:26.139
what you said and we couldn't for
 

00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:27.900
what you said and we couldn't for
whatever reason we want to hear that not

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:27.910
whatever reason we want to hear that not
 

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.429
whatever reason we want to hear that not
just because it changes the message that

00:14:29.429 --> 00:14:29.439
just because it changes the message that
 

00:14:29.439 --> 00:14:31.050
just because it changes the message that
we can tell other people but so that we

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:31.060
we can tell other people but so that we
 

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.429
we can tell other people but so that we
can go back to the framework team so

00:14:32.429 --> 00:14:32.439
can go back to the framework team so
 

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:33.840
can go back to the framework team so
that we can go back to our sample code

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:33.850
that we can go back to our sample code
 

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.300
that we can go back to our sample code
to the support library to the developer

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:36.310
to the support library to the developer
 

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.579
to the support library to the developer
tools and figure out ways to really make

00:14:38.579 --> 00:14:38.589
tools and figure out ways to really make
 

00:14:38.589 --> 00:14:41.220
tools and figure out ways to really make
that process easier for you guys so we

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:41.230
that process easier for you guys so we
 

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.319
that process easier for you guys so we
take that the notion of like at Google a

00:14:43.319 --> 00:14:43.329
take that the notion of like at Google a
 

00:14:43.329 --> 00:14:44.999
take that the notion of like at Google a
lot of companies would call the role

00:14:44.999 --> 00:14:45.009
lot of companies would call the role
 

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:47.850
lot of companies would call the role
that we have take advanced and a Google

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:47.860
that we have take advanced and a Google
 

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.290
that we have take advanced and a Google
we call ourselves advocates and the

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:49.300
we call ourselves advocates and the
 

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.610
we call ourselves advocates and the
reason for that is because we really

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:50.620
reason for that is because we really
 

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.400
reason for that is because we really
care about having that reverse lens we

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:53.410
care about having that reverse lens we
 

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.350
care about having that reverse lens we
want to be able to take the suggestions

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360
want to be able to take the suggestions
 

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.790
want to be able to take the suggestions
and the experiences that you guys have

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800
and the experiences that you guys have
 

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.710
and the experiences that you guys have
and feed it back into the system to try

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720
and feed it back into the system to try
 

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.210
and feed it back into the system to try
and improve that yeah I mean we sit

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:00.220
and improve that yeah I mean we sit
 

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.679
and improve that yeah I mean we sit
right in the middle of the framework

00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:01.689
right in the middle of the framework
 

00:15:01.689 --> 00:15:03.809
right in the middle of the framework
team on one side we've got the video and

00:15:03.809 --> 00:15:03.819
team on one side we've got the video and
 

00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:06.509
team on one side we've got the video and
media guys and graphics then we've got

00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:06.519
media guys and graphics then we've got
 

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:08.240
media guys and graphics then we've got
all the

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:08.250
all the
 

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.790
all the
the windowing and support and USB and

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800
the windowing and support and USB and
 

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.160
the windowing and support and USB and
and just basically in a horseshoe around

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:13.170
and just basically in a horseshoe around
 

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:17.510
and just basically in a horseshoe around
us and you will often find us going

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:17.520
us and you will often find us going
 

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.950
us and you will often find us going
around to those people to either ask

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:18.960
around to those people to either ask
 

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.570
around to those people to either ask
what it is the antenna so you know I'll

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:20.580
what it is the antenna so you know I'll
 

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.860
what it is the antenna so you know I'll
say you know Diane hack born for

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:21.870
say you know Diane hack born for
 

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.680
say you know Diane hack born for
instance there's this perfectly

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:24.690
instance there's this perfectly
 

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.510
instance there's this perfectly
legitimate request that I just got from

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:26.520
legitimate request that I just got from
 

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.240
legitimate request that I just got from
a developer and I really think that we

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:29.250
a developer and I really think that we
 

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.150
a developer and I really think that we
can't satisfy it correctly and then you

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160
can't satisfy it correctly and then you
 

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.800
can't satisfy it correctly and then you
know because I an is smarter than me

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:33.810
know because I an is smarter than me
 

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.930
know because I an is smarter than me

here's the way the system is supposed to

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480
here's the way the system is supposed to
 

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.180
here's the way the system is supposed to
work and here's way that makes more

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:41.190
work and here's way that makes more
 

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.090
work and here's way that makes more
sense you know or you know one of the

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:44.100
sense you know or you know one of the
 

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.010
sense you know or you know one of the
video guys will be like wow you know we

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:46.020
video guys will be like wow you know we
 

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.170
video guys will be like wow you know we

a better platform and part of that is
 

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.140
a better platform and part of that is
making sure that you as developers know

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:45.150
making sure that you as developers know
 

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.630
making sure that you as developers know

look here's an app that is really really

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300
look here's an app that is really really
 

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.720

good but it's not as successful as it
 

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.010
good but it's not as successful as it
could be and some of the reasons for

00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:58.020
could be and some of the reasons for
 

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.960
could be and some of the reasons for
that is that the developer just may not

00:16:59.960 --> 00:16:59.970
that is that the developer just may not
 

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.060
that is that the developer just may not
know what they could be taking advantage

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:02.070
know what they could be taking advantage
 

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.370
know what they could be taking advantage
of and so that's really what we're

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:04.380
of and so that's really what we're
 

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.809
of and so that's really what we're
talking about with the new direction to

00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:05.819
talking about with the new direction to
 

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:07.280

at on Tuesdays is really trying to

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:37.850
at on Tuesdays is really trying to
 

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.060
at on Tuesdays is really trying to
figure out ways that apps particularly

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:40.070
figure out ways that apps particularly
 

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.159
figure out ways that apps particularly
apps which have a unique look and feel

00:21:42.159 --> 00:21:42.169
apps which have a unique look and feel
 

00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:44.580
apps which have a unique look and feel
can maintain that uniqueness

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:44.590
can maintain that uniqueness
 

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.350
can maintain that uniqueness
while still being consistent with the

while still being consistent with the
 

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.970
while still being consistent with the
platform overall and I think that's a

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:47.980
platform overall and I think that's a
 

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.680
platform overall and I think that's a
really important part of what we're all

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:49.690
really important part of what we're all
 

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.539
really important part of what we're all
trying to focus on is we don't want to

00:21:51.539 --> 00:21:51.549
trying to focus on is we don't want to
 

00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:54.570
trying to focus on is we don't want to
create homogeneity across all apps i

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:54.580

comment well you know I mean that's the

00:23:18.779 --> 00:23:18.789
comment well you know I mean that's the
 

00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:19.740
comment well you know I mean that's the
thing it's like it would be pretty

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:19.750
thing it's like it would be pretty
 

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.810

ironic if if we did spend any amount of

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:21.820
ironic if if we did spend any amount of
 

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.399
ironic if if we did spend any amount of
time criticizing other apps and weren't

00:23:23.399 --> 00:23:23.409
time criticizing other apps and weren't
 

00:23:23.409 --> 00:23:25.470
time criticizing other apps and weren't
able to take criticism ourselves so we

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.480
able to take criticism ourselves so we
 

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.789
able to take criticism ourselves so we
definitely want to hear that feedback

00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799
definitely want to hear that feedback

like that in their app but that it was

00:23:37.049 --> 00:23:37.059
like that in their app but that it was
 

00:23:37.059 --> 00:23:38.580
like that in their app but that it was
non-trivial to implement and if we're

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:38.590
non-trivial to implement and if we're
 

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.019
non-trivial to implement and if we're
going to complain about people not doing

00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:40.029
going to complain about people not doing
 

00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:42.029

it the right way shouldn't we make it

00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:42.039
it the right way shouldn't we make it
 

00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:43.620
it the right way shouldn't we make it
easier and so that's the sort of thing

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:43.630
easier and so that's the sort of thing
 

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.330
easier and so that's the sort of thing

they didn't create the drawer pattern
 

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:53.260
they didn't create the drawer pattern
but they did look at the way everybody
