&gt;&gt; Paulette Hasier:
I'd like to welcome you

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.900
to Ninth Annual GIS Day here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.410
Our theme today is GIS in
K-12, from Data to STEM.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.990
So I hope you all
are ready for really,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.580
really excellent program.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.970
We got speakers from AAG,
Esri, our very own Library

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.580
of Congress, and we also
have Congressman Westerman,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.610
who will be here at
approximately 10 o'clock

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.480
to talk a little bit about
the Geospatial Data Act

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.860
that was just past a
couple of weeks ago.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.650
I want to thank everyone
who is here to support us,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.000
and those who have supported
us from the Geography

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.570
and Map staff, the
Library of Congress staff,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.050
and all the folks that I've
mentioned who are going

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.350
to be the speakers today.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.880
We do appreciate your
support for GIS Day,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.810
and we appreciate all
that you do to support us.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.640
And without further
ado, I'd like to turn it

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.780
over to Dr. John Hessler, who
is our geospatial specialist

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.730
in geography and
math, and he's going

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.400
to set the stage for
today's activity.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.510
Thank you again, and
have a good GIS Day.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.190
[ Applause ]

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.030
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Thank you,
Paulette, and I'll say, again,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.360
thank you everyone for coming.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.500
As Paulette mentioned, this
is the Ninth Annual GIS Day

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.010
at the Library of Congress,
and GIS has come a long,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.460
long way here in
those nine years.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.910
For those not familiar
with it, GIS really started

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.200
about 20 years ago here at the
library with a single license

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.390
in a single office down in GNM
with a man, Gary Fitzpatrick,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.180
who did a lot of work and a lot
of mapping and tried to kind

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.400
of get it all off the ground.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.900
It went through a lot of
different incarnations

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.360
to get to where it is today.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.250
Just a few years ago,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.200
it was only a few single
licenses being used

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.560
by Congressional
Cartography Project

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.140
and some analysts in CRS.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.440
Today, it is the geospatial
hosting environment.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.660
The geospatial hosting
environment is a series

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.000
of portals.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.220
We collect terabytes
of geospatial data.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.380
We have hundreds of users,
all of which come from either

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.920
across the street, the Senate,
the House members, CRS analysts,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.720
geography and maps,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.060
Congressional Cartography
Project, and even curators

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.560
with the new story maps project

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.450
that we began publishing
collections and things

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.170
like that here in the library.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.100
There are some people
in the crowd

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.040
who have been responsible
for this growth.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.570
I see Mike Handy,
retired many years ago,

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.450
was part of our IT team here,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.180
who is one of the most
responsible people

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.120
for building what is the
geospatial hosting environment

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.020
here at the library
and kind of pushing it

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.250
through the sixth floor.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.200
We have our engineering
team in the back, Bebe,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.500
who was one of the research
and development heads,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.020
who worked this through during
the last few years, and then,

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.250
we have our engineering
team, basically known

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.100
as Butch and the Two Mikes.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.570
Yes, and they do have a band,
plays hits from Python and JSON.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.400
And that would be Butch
Lazerac [assumed spelling],

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.600
Mike Scholen [assumed spelling],
who sitting back there,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.210
and Mike Bijou, who
was also in the back,

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.190
all of whom played a
big role in getting GIS

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.290
to where it is in the library.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.590
It's growing.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.680
It's growing rapidly.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.530
Our new chief, Paulette
Hasier, has been responsible

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.630
for pushing the cloud-based
online story map program

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.070
and moving that forward
at a sort of lightspeed.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.260
We've now published a
whole series of those.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.140
Curators across the
library are using them.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.100
There is training
being done, and so,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.090
the program is moving rapidly.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.940
But if it was just
data and software,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.140
it really wouldn't mean much.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.150
It's more than that.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.650
It's about getting the
staff in the Congress.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.020
It's about getting
the staff in CRS.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.040
It's about getting people
in GNM and curators all

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.180
over the library to use their
imagination and creativity.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.300
To understand how to
use these tools in order

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.760
to foster what their ideas are,
analysis, looking at things

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.340
from a spatial perspective.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.610
And so, today, we're
going to settle on that.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.410
Spatial thinking.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.080
Spatial activity.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.220
What can it tell
us about the world?

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.800
What can it tell us
about what we are?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.930
And so, these talks that we're
going to see today are going

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.540
to focus on K-12 education,
and it's very important,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.460
because when we think
about GIS, when we think

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.990
about where geography has come
as a discipline in the last 20

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.980
to 30 years, it's gone
through a revolution,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.400
and that revolution has allowed
the field to begin to think

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.350
of things in ways that
it never did before.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.230
It's allowed it to combine
humanistic thinking,

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.550
critical thinking, with
scientific analysis.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.280
It's allowed it to come to terms

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.080
with things the way human beings
interact with the environment,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.360
the way they interact
with themselves,

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.470
with the way we interact with
each other in a spatial way.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.980
It's given us the tools
to begin thinking deeply

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.900
about those problems and about
the way we live in society,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.380
and that's an extremely
important thing.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.260
To a certain extent, cartography
has always been about this.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.140
It's always been
about imagination.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.060
It's always been
about visualization.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.420
It's always been about
spatial thinking.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.730
One can think back to
the second century A.D.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.660
where Ptolemy is sitting
in Alexandria staring

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.550
out at the Mediterranean Sea
trying to figure out a way

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.000
in order to map the world,
to visualize the world.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.450
We can think of Francois Menard,
the great French cartographer,

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.530
who is sitting in his study
in Paris trying to figure

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.970
out what can space add to my
analysis of transatlantic trade?

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.370
How can I visualize this?

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.900
And coming up with
radical ways of doing it.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.560
Or it can be a group of hipsters
sitting in a bar wondering how

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.010
in God's name can we map

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.950
in three dimensions
the lives of squirrels?

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.560
So, it can be a lot of different
things, and all of those things

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.930
that I've just said, the
squirrels, the Ptolemy,

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.010
and the Menard, if you come to
the open house, you'll be able

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.690
to see all of those maps,
because we selected those.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.600
And so, when we start
thinking about what GIS is,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.030
and we start thinking about
how we can influence people

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.840
in K-12 education, and I
especially want to thank any

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.190
of the teachers who are
here today, because it's

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.770
in your hands that this is,

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.740
that these developments
are going to be thrust.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.640
The kids coming up
today, the children coming

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.320
up today are going to have tools
that can be used for good or,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.900
in fact, for not so good,
and getting them to use them

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.760
for good, getting them to
understand the excitement

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.460
of doing an analysis that might
squeeze a little bit more food

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.790
yield out of the
landscape to feed people,

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.380
to help people distribute
limited water resources,

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.210
and to understand, well, maybe
even squirrels, is something

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.050
that we can start with
very early and very simply.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.790
The data that we now have and
the tools that we now have,

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.650
can be brought down to the
level of K-12 students in a way

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.560
that we never could before.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.750
The excitement of a child
mapping a squirrel in a park,

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.810
interacting with the data, the
computers, and with the world.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:12.690
It's that triangle that
K-12 builds in students,

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:17.460
and is that triangle that's very
important, and is that triangle

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.720
that we're going to
explore in our talks today.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.600
And so, I want to
bring up Tim St. Onge,

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.790
who's going to be the host in
the introducer and the master

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.980
of ceremonies for the
rest of the conference.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.200
And again, I want to
thank you for coming,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.040
and especially the teachers.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.340
We're here for you.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.140
Thanks.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:45.160
[ Applause ]

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.460
&gt;&gt; Tim St. Onge: All
right, thank you, John.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.760
Good morning everyone.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.060
Thank you for coming.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.890
As John said, my
name is Tim St. Onge.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.940
I'm with the geography and map
division here at the library,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.740
and I'm going to be the
moderator or so this morning,

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.340
keeping us on schedule.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.880
So, first, I'm going

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.240
to be introducing our first
speaker, who is Kathy Hart.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.250
Kathy is the head
of the Geography

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.720
and Map Division's reference
team and reading room here

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.760
at the Library of Congress.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.430
She leads a team that
facilitates the use of maps,

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.460
atlases, and geographic
materials

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.430
in the library's extensive,
worldwide collection of maps.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.560
Throughout her career,
Kathy has promoted the use

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.370
and understanding of maps
and geographic information,

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:30.140
as well as delving into spatial
thinking and maps and GIS

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.930
in the digital humanities.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.060
She is a recent addition
to the Library of Congress

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.000
after spending 20 years
in academic libraries.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.510
So, please welcome Kathy Hart.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:45.560
[ Applause ]

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.690
&gt;&gt; Kathy Hart: All right,
well, happy GIS day.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.540
So, I am here, as you just
heard, I'm here to talk

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.710
about spatial thinking,
but before I do that,

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.950
I want to talk about maps.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.620
So, when was the last time that
you looked closely at a map?

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.090
I mean, it really
dug in and read it

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.890
to uncover the meaning behind
the lines, colors, and symbols.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.610
Did it all makes sense?

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.170
Did you understand
the intent of the map?

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.230
Did you examine the legend
and the text to help you

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.370
with the overall
meaning of the map?

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.290
Did you understand
the main concepts,

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.640
the cartographer's intent?

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.770
The same question can asked
regarding digital geographic

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.760
maps, or GISs, as well.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.270
Did you move through those
locations, zoom in and out,

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.610
understand the layers and
ability to select those layers

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.660
that were of most
interest to you?

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.960
Okay, so, great.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.910
You are a spatial thinker.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:46.680
So, I do want to talk
about how you make meaning

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.210
from those lines, colors,

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.980
and symbols on the
maps and GIS sites.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.520
What happens at the
cognitive level?

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.030
And what can we do to
enhance the spatial thinking

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.100
and spatial understanding
skills,

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.900
including in the schools,
with our K-12 students.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.200
So, why do we care?

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.930
Where we talk about this today?

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.350
Well, spatial thinking underpins
the whole -- the map reading,

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.990
the map interpretation,
map creation.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:14.370
It helps our K-12 students
succeed in their classes,

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.330
as well as their careers.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.430
Spatial thinking correlates with
success in math and science,

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.510
and as, therefore, students

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:26.280
with strong spatial thinking
skills are adding advantage

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.010
in their coursework and
their later career options.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.430
So, it follows that
instructional resources

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.850
for spatial thinking are
critical in the early years.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.340
The good news is that there's
been a great deal of interest

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.070
and research on spatial thinking

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.820
and enhancing spatial-related
curriculum.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.160
Much of the research
includes a digital component,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.860
including teaching
GIS in schools.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.490
So, what I hope to do my time
this morning is to create

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.020
for you the conceptual
connections

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.840
between spatial thinking and
map reading and the use of maps

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.950
and 3D models and learning GIS

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.240
and related digital
environments.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.450
How these can expand a student's
spatial habits of mind,

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.920
which then increases spatial
awareness and spatial skills.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.180
Beyond K-12, in our everyday
lives, it's important

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.590
to think spatially,
in that it helps us

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:17.890
to be informed citizens.

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:24.770
So, a few fields of
studies and careers.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.900
These should be familiar to you.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.940
There's probably others
that I don't have listed,

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.300
but this is just to kind of get
you thinking about the variety.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.940
So many things that are
touched by spatial thinking,

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.170
as far as fields of
study and careers.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.480
And I'm sure there's some that
I missed, but you can fill

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.950
in the blank on others.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.490
So, the types of spatial
relationships, it's important

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.300
to understand the range from
the simple to the more complex,

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.620
and it's important when
we're looking at maps in GIS

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.160
to use precise terminology.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.570
So, we're talking about, you
know, where things are located,

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.020
the distance between two things?

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.320
Is there movement?

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.290
Where are the boundaries?

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.590
Is there a region?

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.100
Is something adjacent
to something else?

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.060
Is something enclosed or within?

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.650
So again, these are terms that
when you're looking at maps

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.990
and using GIS, these
are the kinds of things

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.090
that you're trying to uncover.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:28.530
And then, you go into the more
complex spatial relationships.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.010
What are the patterns?

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.080
How are things distributed?

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.380
Are there dispersion?

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:37.040
Is there clustering involved?

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.810
So, as you look at maps in
GIS again, these are the types

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.710
of things you're
trying to understand.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.680
At the younger ages, at the very
of the stages, children come

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.870
to understand the basic
topological spatial concepts,

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:53.310
such as on, and, with,
close to, next to,

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.440
beside, over and inside.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.890
They understand these
just in everyday life

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:04.620
and when they're
learning their vocabulary.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.940
At around 6 to 8 years
old, children progress

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.780
to more complex,
projective understanding,

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:17.500
such as in front of, left of,
right of, on the side, behind,

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.460
straight, and up the
hill and down the hill.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.880
And this image that you're
looking at here is just kind

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.780
of a way to understand
with those concepts mean

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.400
when you're looking at a map.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.310
So, were talking
about verbal as well

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.860
as visual skills,
spatial skills.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.210
But it's not all work.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.230
There's also play involved.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.200
And while most children pick

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.310
up these concepts
naturally, some do struggle.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:48.120
But it comes, as I mentioned, it
comes informally in daily life,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.600
as part of the acquisition
of vocabulary,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.670
as well as more formally
in classroom activities

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.040
and focused curriculum.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.830
But think about the
common toys at this age.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.620
Much of the playtime
involves spatial thinking.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.980
So, you have building blocks.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.280
You have cars and trucks.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.070
You have doll houses,
Legos, and Rubik's Cubes.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.250
These objects can be arranged

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:12.400
and rearranged using the
child's native spatial awareness

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.900
and the inborn creativity.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.750
Numerous digital games
also use spatial abilities.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:23.110
Minecraft is one that comes to
mind, but there are many others.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.990
So, this is all, again, in
the kind of younger ages,

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:31.210
but around grades five and
six, the more abstract,

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:35.160
or the Euclidean understandings
emerge, as does curriculum,

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.080
on using a frame of reference,
such as how to measure distances

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.470
and direction and using
a coordinate system.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.410
So, how many of you have
seen these maps, right?

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:51.590
So, the children are asked to
make a map of a place they know.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.670
Basically, how you
get from school,

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.530
from your home to school?

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:58.670
And so, this is really
good practice,

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.920
because some elementary-age
children may have difficulty

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.260
understanding maps.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.560
So, practice.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.350
That practice with things they
know is a very important point

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.350
for them to kind of
bring that understanding.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:15.870
So, their drawings, their maps,
typically include their house.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.920
Maybe a curvy line
representing the street

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.550
and the school building,
and it's not to scale.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.880
The perspective and the
angle or vantage point is

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.720
from an on-the-ground
perspective,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.590
so street view rather than from

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.330
above as we know
typical used maps.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.470
The children understand
one key aspect

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:35.950
of map reading and map creation.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.760
That's self-location.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.950
So, the self-location is the
ability to relate where you are

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:44.290
in the real world to
a place on the map,

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.750
and they do that by
drawing and viewing it.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:50.700
So, these two examples
show some fairly complex

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.950
and sophisticated
thinking going on.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.490
They also show two
other spatial abilities.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.590
That's route memory
and map rotation.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:02.590
Route memory is the
ability to remember a way to

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:06.290
and from a place, and map
rotation is the ability

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.880
to mentally rotate a map
while you are making turns

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.040
without physically
turning a map.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.920
So, you don't have
to raise your hand

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.180
if you actually still do
the turning of the map.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.060
It's okay.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.730
We can work on that.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.140
But these two maps illustrate
all these concepts really well,

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:29.730
and you know, kudos to the
students that created these.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:35.910
Now I don't know the gender of
these two who created these,

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.680
and if there's any teachers in
the room, you may have an idea.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.250
May be the one on the left might
be a girl, and maybe the one

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.550
on the right might be a boy.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.930
And I want to bring that up,

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.240
because there are
some sex differences.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.850
There's studies that show
that males perform better,

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.080
slightly better, on
spatial tests such as

00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:00.070
with mental rotation tasks and
wayfinding, and explanations

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.550
as to the reason for
these differences very,

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.080
and some relate to the
environment in the home.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.010
For instance, in one study,

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.480
there were no gender
differences found in children

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.770
from lower income homes.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.510
However, there were gender
differences found in children

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.780
from the middle and
higher-income groups.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.830
So, I will give you a second to
think about why that might be.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:28.200
So, it may be due to their
home environment, right?

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.600
So, I'm happy, though, to report

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.650
that whatever differences
there may be due to biology

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:37.220
or individual differences
or economic circumstances,

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.360
these are easily
remedied by instruction

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.980
and increasing access to
spatial-related activities.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.950
So, my message to parents and
grandparents, give your girls

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.370
and kids Legos, building blocks.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.510
Teachers, encourage all
of your students to engage

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.640
in spatial play activities in
the classroom, especially those

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:02.110
who may not have the
opportunity at home.

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:06.340
So, moving a little bit more
into the map reading in GIS,

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.960
there's a lot of standard
methods that have been developed

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.010
over the years, so,
with map design,

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.750
and that really helps everyone.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.930
So that when we go
to read something,

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.980
we have a common
vocabulary, common language.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.010
And Jacques Bertin developed
frameworks, or visual variables,

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:29.390
as guides to map design,
and these are the concepts,

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:34.360
which I hope you can see in the
back, of position, size, shape,

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:39.260
the value or likeness, the
color or hue, and orientation,

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.250
which may be called
direction, and texture,

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.040
so as you can see in this chart.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.950
So, these concepts extend to
GIS, as well, and I just point

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.490
out Access Map prepared
this particular chart,

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:55.000
and there's a lot of description
on their website, as well.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.590
So, the point is, when you're
reading a map or creating a GIS,

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.790
it's important to understand
the theoretical background

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:06.040
and sometimes complexity
to the symbology.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.050
This is just a small part
to a much larger topic.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:16.070
And I should also point out that
these concepts can be combined.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:20.450
So, you may have color and shape
that are combined, and you know,

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:22.620
we understand that when
we're looking at maps,

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.890
and this applies to
points, lines, and polygons.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.490
So again, these are kind
of the building blocks

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.060
to how we put maps together.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.190
And as I mentioned earlier,
the spatial thinking,

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.290
it's a combination
of cognitive skills,

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:41.010
comprised of knowing
concepts of space,

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.750
using tools of representation

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.320
and applying processes
of reasoning.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.380
What we're seeing
now, a recent study,

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.190
that suggests a correlation
between thinking spatially

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.830
and thinking geographically,

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:56.200
and I will just read off this
section from this article

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.270
from Metoyer and Bednarz.

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.840
"Geographic thinking
extrapolates beyond spatial

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.840
thinking to encompass the
recognition and elaboration

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.510
of the relations
amongst spatial concepts,

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.910
the advanced associations
derived from these concepts,

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.230
and the formal linking
of the associations

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.590
into theories and
generalizations."

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.030
So, again, spatial thinking
is the building block.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.700
You add the geographic
concepts, and then you get

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.450
into the geographic thinking.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.750
So again, maps in GIS.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:27.620
And when we talk about
geography, you're going

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.080
into the geographic
realm, I hope some of you,

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.380
if not maybe all of you,

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.340
are aware of Tobler's
first law of geography.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.230
Everything is related
to everything else,

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.190
but near things are more
related than distant things.

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.910
So, think about that.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.500
How does that --
what does that mean?

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.940
So, things are nearby.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.240
They're somewhat dependent.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.570
So, you have tree species that
are more similar to the trees

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.750
that are in their
neighborhood then maybe trees

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.800
across the country or on another
continent, another climate.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:04.900
Any kind of species,
animals, plants,

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.890
but also demographic
and social issues.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.860
There you have similarities
in things that are near.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.370
You have more similarity
to things

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.140
that are near, rather
than far away.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.790
So, we can keep that
in mind, also,

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:18.290
when you're looking
at maps in GIS.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.460
What's going on in
that place as compared

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.950
to what's going on farther away?

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.540
And getting into why, again,

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.420
why is geographic
thinking important?

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:32.250
It's important because then
we have the whys of where.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:33.930
Where things happen is critical

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.010
to knowing how and
why they happen.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.610
So, we want to study maps.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:41.340
GIS, we want to study geographic
concepts and do studies,

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.830
because then we will know how
and why things are happening.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:49.010
We can plan, and we can
do all sorts of analyses

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:52.230
and really understand our
world in a much better way.

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:53.710
So, I want to circle back

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.680
to what I mentioned
at the beginning.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.620
We know that spatial thinking
is very important for success

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.660
in STEM, and we understand
that skills are based both

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.430
on innate abilities, as well
as environmental inputs.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:06.760
So, it follows that we must look

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.190
at the important
role of teachers.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.690
The skills of STEM and
non-STEM teachers are important,

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.520
and it's not surprising
that studies have found

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.470
that secondary STEM teachers
have strong spatial skills,

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.950
as compared to non-STEM teachers
in the general population,

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:24.790
as well as when compared
to preschool

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:26.600
and primary school teachers.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.710
So, what this means is that our
high school chemistry, physics,

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:34.670
and calculus teachers are much
stronger in spatial thinking.

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.360
Obviously, that's a good thing.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.280
However, since spatial skill
development is formative

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.220
in the primary school
years, we are reliant

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.130
on our primary school teachers'
spatial skills to foster

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.870
that strong spatial skills
and the younger ages.

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:51.630
Workshops and professional
development

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.780
for the primary school
teachers has been shown

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.660
to increase their
confidence and abilities

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.900
to teach spatial content.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:03.190
And I will point you to a few
articles, these first two.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:08.030
Nora Newcombe, who wrote
in American Educator,

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.930
really has a great
introduction to this topic.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:12.610
And then, Learning
to Think Spatially;

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:16.110
GIS as a Support System
in the K-12 Curriculum

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.070
from the National
Research Council.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:21.210
That's a very robust
and in-depth report.

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:23.600
I also encourage
you to read that.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.070
So, I hope by the established
the whys and where fors

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.740
of spatial thinking, but
what does this have to do

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.760
with libraries, you may ask?

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.730
Well, let me tell you.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:37.440
Librarians are partnering
with K-12 educators

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.300
to develop geographic
and spatial curriculum.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.470
I have the third and fourth
articles here are examples

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:45.770
of that.

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:49.110
In Colorado, Theobald
and Vrbancic have engaged

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.980
with K-12 educators and school
librarians with great success,

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.980
as well as in Florida.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.230
McAuliffe using aerial
photos in the University

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.700
of Florida library,
partnered with teachers,

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.920
to enhance the national
geography standards,

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.060
Geography for Life.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.990
So, libraries are engaged
in information resources

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:11.160
and information literacy
of all formats.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.480
And maps and GIS are among those
reliant on spatial thinking.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.150
So, it's incumbent upon us

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:19.570
to develop geospatial
information literacy programs.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.220
So, stay tuned, as they say.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.720
So, as I wind down,

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.470
I will encourage you
to think spatially.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:30.430
Observe spatial relationships
in your everyday life.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.290
Think critically about maps

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:34.890
and the information
that they convey.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:39.230
Use precise terminology to
describe spatial phenomenon,

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:40.530
and bring these concepts

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.970
into your instruction
and collaborations.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.770
And I want to thank you for
the opportunity to talk,

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:52.090
and I believe, again, we have
more discussion coming up.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.570
I think we're going to hold
questions until the end,

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:57.500
and I do want to put, also,
another plug for the open house

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.190
and the Geography and Map
Division from 1 to 3 PM.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.990
All right, thank you.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:14.140
[ Applause ]

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.220
&gt;&gt; Tim St. Onge: All right,
thank you very much, Kathy.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:21.760
So, as Kathy mentioned, for the
design of our morning session,

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.730
see here -- basically,

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:27.170
we're going to be having
a question session for all

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:31.430
of our speakers at 11:45, so
that the ideas that we have,

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.200
basically, a morning's
worth of learning about GIS,

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.070
spatial thinking, and that will
bring all that knowledge and,

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:38.370
that will bring all
that knowledge in.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:39.670
All the questions and thoughts
that are sort of popping

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:42.040
in your head, at 11:45,
we'll have all the speakers

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.540
of this morning up, and
we'll be able to answer --

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:50.090
we'll be able to have more of
a cohesive or a full discussion

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:51.630
about all the different topics

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.710
that we've been talking
about this morning.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.120
So, thank you again, Kathy.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.270
So, coming up next, we will
be having our keynote speaker,

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:02.770
Congressman Bruce Westerman of
Arkansas, and he will be talking

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:07.050
about the Geospatial Data
Act, Education and Policy.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:08.840
So, since we are
ahead of schedule,

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.900
he will be coming
before too long.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.970
So, in the meantime, we want to
bring up John Wertman from Esri.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:19.280
He is graciously going
to provide a little bit

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.880
of an introduction, a little
bit of the background,

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.630
on the Geospatial Data Act,
which will be the subject

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:26.220
of Congressman Westerman's talk.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:30.510
So, without ado, I'll
bring up John Weortman.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:40.040
[ Applause ]

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.340
&gt;&gt; John Wertman: Well,
thanks very much, Tim.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.670
So, I wanted to give a little
bit of a background to sort

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.060
of set the story for
what you're going

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.660
to hear from the Congressman.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.850
About five or six years
ago, there was a movement

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:53.430
on the Senate side to put
together a foundational bill

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.790
for how Congress and the
federal government deal

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.090
with geospatial data.

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:01.350
There was previously a bill
passed called the Data Act,

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:03.780
which dealt with
sort of data broadly,

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.400
and I see that the
Congressman is here now.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.100
So, I'll sort of wrap
this up, but essentially,

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:13.360
the bill was enacted as
part of the FAA compromise

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.350
that passed a few weeks ago,
and we're delighted to have it

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.900
in place, and I'll
turn it over to Tim

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.610
to introduce the Congressman.

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:20.910
&gt;&gt; Female: Thanks John.

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:22.710
&gt;&gt; Male: Yeah!

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:27.130
[ Applause ]

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:28.970
&gt;&gt; Tim St. Onge:
Excellent, thank you.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:32.320
All right, so without
further ado,

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.490
I'd like to introduce
our keynote speaker

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:35.910
for this morning.

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.750
Congressman Bruce Westerman
representing the fourth district

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.100
of Arkansas.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.450
He is a member of the
committee on transportation

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:46.480
and infrastructure and on the
committee on natural resources.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.850
He's an engineer and
forester by trade.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.490
Westerman has worked
for 22 years

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:54.650
at Midsouth Engineering
in Hot Springs.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:57.640
He was named Engineer of the
Year by the Arkansas Society

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.550
of Professional Engineers
in 2013.

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:04.510
So, without further ado, welcome
Congressman Bruce Westerman.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:20.060
[ Applause ]

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.360
&gt;&gt; Congressman Bruce Westerman:
Well, good morning everyone.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.520
I think it's -- yeah,
it's still morning.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.210
One of those days.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:28.450
This is a good day.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:32.140
We should all be happy
about what's happened.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.690
It's strange how
Washington DC works.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.490
I've worked on legislation.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:38.050
I've been in Congress
for four years.

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:41.860
I've got bills that I've
worked on tirelessly

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:47.830
since I've been here, and
worked on this bill very hard.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.390
And all the sudden, we
found a vehicle to get it

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:55.330
in the FAA bill, and like
that, almost, it became law.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:30:00.020
So, sometimes as we say in
Arkansas, a blind hog finds

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.220
in acorn, and we found
this one on this bill.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.550
And I'm thrilled about that.

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:08.200
You know, at the end of the
day, we want to see results,

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.500
and we were able to get results.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.890
And much of that's due to the
support that this group had

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:19.730
for the Geospatial Data Act
and your efforts in really,

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:24.530
not just in lobbying for the
bill and contacting members

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:26.920
and trying to get it
to pass, but the work

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.710
that we all did coming to
agreement on what should be

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:32.570
in the bill, and I say
thank you to everyone

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:35.440
who participated in that.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.080
As was mentioned when I was
introduced, my background is

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.550
in engineering and forestry.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.010
So, it's two areas

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:46.420
where geospatial data is
used quite extensively,

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.550
but I was thinking about
my engineering background,

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:55.640
and I was partner in a
consulting engineering firm,

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.610
and you know, we had to have
standards in our business.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.990
Like many businesses that want

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:05.350
to be successful,
it makes good sense.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:09.080
It makes your business work more
efficiently and more effectively

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.600
if you have good standards.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.940
We have standards
and specifications.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.630
We have certain things
that we knew were going

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:20.440
to be purchased many times over.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.830
It wasn't rocket science.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:23.130
We'd gone through the design.

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:27.820
We'd gone through the analysis,
and we could write standards

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.350
and standard specifications.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:34.430
So that when it came
time to use the services

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:40.060
or these materials again on the
job, that was all taken care of.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.340
And in our drawings,
you know, I'm old enough

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.580
that I learned drafting
in college doing it

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.960
with -- on a drawing board.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.880
And it's amazing things you
learn when you're doing it

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.260
by hand that actually translate
into doing it digitally.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.870
You know, when you're
drawing on paper,

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:03.690
you change your line weight
by using a different pencil.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:06.800
You do it by the amount
of pressure you put on it,

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.190
and we had to have
standards even

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:11.140
when we were drawing by hand.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.690
Really, it was almost more
important when we were drawing

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:17.140
by hand, because it was so
time-consuming and laborious

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:22.170
to make a drawing, that you
wanted to have certain drawings

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:24.540
that you could use
over and over.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:28.570
It's just a little example
of what standardization does

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:31.720
to make things work
more efficiently.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.970
We, as you all know, have an
issue in the federal government

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:37.110
where we were being
very duplicative.

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.700
We had different agencies
using different standards,

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:45.270
different platforms and
formats, and there was a lot

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:49.420
of taxpayer dollars going
to produce geospatial data

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:53.600
that wasn't being --
or wasn't in a way

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.810
that it could easily be
shared among agencies,

00:32:56.810 --> 00:33:00.210
and I'm not sure the agencies
were even communicating to know,

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.030
you know, if one
agency had this data

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.810
that another agency
could possibly use.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:08.780
So, that was the driver
behind doing this bill.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.080
I was fortunate.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:15.040
We got a very strong geospatial
data program in Arkansas.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.830
the state director of
that, Shelby Johnson,

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.870
has been a longtime
friend of mine back

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:21.720
when I was just doing
engineering work,

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.210
before I ever got into politics.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:27.330
I worked with Shelby at
the -- they called it CAST,

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.540
the Center for Advanced Spatial
Technologies at the University

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:35.280
of Arkansas, where my
undergraduate degree is from

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:41.340
and worked with Shelby there
and learned more and more

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.520
about geospatial data systems.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.940
I went to forestry school
at Yale about the time

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.120
when foresters were
really starting

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:53.670
to use satellite imagery and
remote-sensing technologies,

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:57.450
and the amount of time that
you can save, and really,

00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:59.450
the ceiling is still
way up there

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.530
on the advancements we can make
an understanding our natural

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:05.620
environment using
remote-sensing technologies.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:10.830
But I got to kind of come in
in the early stages of that

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:17.270
and was able to use
that in my business

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:18.960
to make better decisions

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.860
and help the clients
that we were serving.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.890
So, I've kind of got a
working knowledge of GIS

00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:27.810
and the many ways that
it affects our lives,

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:31.550
much more than what was used
in my engineering business,

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:35.190
and I know that the way
technology is advancing

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:40.430
that remote-sensing and GIS
and spatial data is going

00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:44.480
to be a more and more
important part of our lives.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.600
I know that is an engineer, if I
went into an existing facility,

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.850
and we wanted to make
modernization to that facility,

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:57.620
we would spend days, if not
weeks, taking hand measurements,

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.960
making sketches, going back
and putting those sketches

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.740
into a drawing, so that we would
know what was there before we

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.040
got started.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.130
I'm sure, and this is
what happens when you get

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:13.440
into Congress, you kind of get
out of touch with the details

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:17.010
that you used to like
to stay so close to,

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:20.580
but I know there were
sensing technologies

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:24.910
where you could go inside
an existing facility using

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:30.030
something like LIDAR and
measure everything in there

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:33.410
from different places and put
it all together in a 3D drawing,

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:36.590
and you can probably do that
very cost-effectively now,

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:38.890
and some of you may know
all about how to do that,

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:42.220
but there's just, like I
said, the sky's the limit

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:48.620
on where we can go with
geospatial data, and this bill,

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:53.350
I think, is a very good
start in getting standards

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:54.650
across the federal government,

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:57.710
which will probably affect
many things outside the

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.010
federal government.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:01.400
I've got to say thank
you to Senator Hatch,

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.790
who was the Senate sponsor
on this bill and work so hard

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:11.160
to get it included
in the FAA bill.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.870
When I'm on the Transportation
and Infrastructure Committee,

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:16.480
I'm on the Aviation
Subcommittee,

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.970
and had you asked me
this time last year

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:23.620
about getting the
geospatial data act as part

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.860
of the FAA bill, I would've
just given you a strange look,

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:31.630
but that's kind of the
way things happened here.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:36.130
And I'm excited about where
the future will take us.

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:41.490
As you all know, what this bill
did was basically codified some

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:49.490
things in the -- that the
OMB had already put out,

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:54.670
codified the Federal
Geographic Data Committee

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:59.120
and also codified the National
Geospatial Advisory Committee.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:04.400
It defined the geospatial
data infrastructure.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.750
It talks about data
themes, and from there,

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:08.620
how to develop standards.

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:13.170
It talks about geoplatform,
and then,

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:16.820
it gets into the covered
agency responsibilities.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.820
One of the hurdles we had
to get through and this was

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:26.990
with the Defense Department
and intelligence groups.

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.030
They didn't necessarily
want to share their data

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.230
across platforms, which
is understandable.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:34.620
So, we carved out exemptions
for them, but the rest

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:39.550
of our agencies, hopefully,
as we move forward,

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:43.970
we'll see much easier, seamless
transition between sharing data

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.310
across agencies, and I'm
hoping that the oversight

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:50.550
that we established in this bill
will get more agencies talking

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:52.090
and sharing data and also making

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:54.710
that data more available
for the public.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:58.940
So, we don't get to celebrate
that often Washington DC

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:03.750
about a big win like this,
but this really is a big win

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:05.450
that happened in
an unexpected way.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.870
And again, I want to say
thank you for all the work

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:11.180
that you put into it, it is
just an honor for me to get

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:17.170
to be part of it, and you
know, this isn't going to be --

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:21.350
people actually not even heard
of the Geospatial Data Act.

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:25.230
They just know we passed
in FAA bill, and you know,

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:27.060
I go home to my constituents,
and they say,

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.360
"Well, what have you done?"

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.790
And I say, well, we got this
Geospatial Data Act passed,

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:32.290
and they look at me like,

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:34.070
that's what we elected
you to Congress to do?

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:37.850
I say, well, it actually
affects a lot of your life.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:41.030
I said, if you use one of
those smartphones you got.

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:42.440
You pull up a map program.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.420
I say, that's geospatial data.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.830
I said, the weather that you
look at every day, I said,

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:48.170
there's just tons of ways

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:52.160
that geospatial data affects
your life, and we did something

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.380
to streamline that process and
make it more user friendly,

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.300
and hopefully, make life
better for more Americans.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.920
It's not the sexiest thing in
the world, but I'm glad to be,

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:06.650
as a fellow nerd, I'm glad to
be part of the cause, and again,

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:08.850
appreciate your support.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.800
Do we have time for
a few questions?

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.100
As long as they're
easy questions,

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.900
I'll take all of them.

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.310
[ Laughter ]

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.020
Well, those are really
easy questions.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.610
Yes, ma'am.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.910
&gt;&gt; Female: So, do you see,

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:25.210
when [speaking off
mic] are developed,

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.040
do you see this impacting
education at all?

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.340
&gt;&gt; Congressman Bruce
Westerman: I would hope so.

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.860
&gt;&gt; Female: How would
you foresee that?

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.470
&gt;&gt; Congressman Bruce Westerman:
So, I can give you a little bit

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:35.160
of a practical answer to that.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:39.450
Back in my high-school days,
I had a friend who went

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:45.050
to West Point, and he was
just -- he just retired.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:47.290
He'd gone back to West
Point as an instructor,

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:50.740
and he was teaching a
geospatial data class up there.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:55.930
So, I went up to visit the
academy and visit his class,

00:39:55.930 --> 00:40:00.150
and the students were very
interested in this bill,

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:03.880
in this legislation,
and I already know

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.480
that what we were talking about
in this bill was being carried

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:12.050
over into a class of future
geospatial data scientists.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:17.060
And as the federal government
moves in a way to standardize,

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.900
I would think the natural
process would be for that

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.520
to move into the --
into higher education

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:28.000
and be implemented
in the classroom.

00:40:32.510 --> 00:41:10.050
[ Female Speaking off Mic ]

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.660
Now maybe somebody might be
able to correct me on this

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.270
that knows more about the weeds
of the dealing with defense

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:18.530
and intelligence,
but my understanding

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:20.160
and my feedback was basically

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:28.360
that if we left the Defense
Department and NSA in the bill,

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.900
then it was going to
get a lot of pushback.

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.100
And so, we kind of
just left them alone

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.400
to do their own thing.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:39.030
Now whether they eventually
will declassify information,

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:40.660
I think that will
be there decision

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:44.270
on whether they classify or what

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:47.180
of their data they make
available and what kind

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.510
of standards they use, but --

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:59.170
[ Female Speaking off Mic ]

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:01.420
You would think they
would want to do that,

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:05.730
but we pretty much left
them alone to enable

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:10.040
to get the bill enacted
as it is.

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:14.340
&gt;&gt; Male: Do you have any plans

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:16.890
for expanding [speaking
off mic]?

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:18.240
&gt;&gt; Congressman Bruce Westerman:
Whether I have plans or not,

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.420
I think, it's GIS is
going to be expanded.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.910
I think it's definitely --

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:24.780
I don't think it's a
mature technology yet.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:29.290
I know there's tremendous
amounts of use for GIS,

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:32.900
and we'll see more
and more than.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:36.550
As much is it's -- you
know, for story was one

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.500
of the early adapters
of GIS technology,

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.660
and there's still a tremendous
amount of work that can be done

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:47.290
in forestry in an area that
have some expertise in,

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:51.180
and as you look at
all the other uses,

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.760
it's just, it's pretty amazing.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.900
I had a fascinating conversation
with National Geographic,

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:59.910
probably it's been
within the last two years,

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:03.380
and they were talking about all
the mapping that they're doing,

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:07.040
the different kinds of mapping,
and it just makes your head spin

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.040
to think that there's
that much data out there

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.400
and all the analysis
we can do with it,

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.340
and I think it could
actually affect policy,

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:18.180
because you would hope
that lawmakers are looking

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:21.380
at the data that's available to
make the most informed decision,

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.550
and if you can get better data
in a more real-time situation,

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:30.000
then you can make
better decisions.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.630
I was just looking at a map

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:35.950
on wildland urban
interfaces this morning,

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:38.820
which is all geospatial
data, with the wildfires

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.440
that are happening
out in California,

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.600
and we're seeing more and
more with warming temperatures

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:50.150
and drier conditions and more
people moving into the WUI,

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:52.840
as we call it, wildland-urban
interface.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.350
I think we're going to have

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:59.270
to make some definite policy
changes and has some leadership

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:01.590
in the federal government
to address that government,

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:03.950
and GIS will be critical
in doing that.

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:05.250
So, it's everywhere.

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:08.620
It affects all the
parts of our lives.

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.430
People just -- I don't think the
general public realizes that,

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:13.730
how much they actually use it.

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:21.040
[ Female Speaking off Mic ]

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.620
Yeah, you would think so.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:27.340
I served in my state
legislature, and I was there

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:32.100
in 2012, which after
the 2010 Census and part

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.490
of the state legislature's
duty was

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:37.090
to draw congressional districts.

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:39.890
I had was in the
minority, and I had no say

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:43.200
in how my congressional district
was actually drawn of the time,

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.910
but it was fascinating to me,
the tools that were available

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:50.250
in 2012, to take data by
precincts and start --

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:54.150
you could draw your own
maps and get real creative,

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:57.190
and I know that technology's
increased even more.

00:44:57.190 --> 00:45:01.600
So yeah, it'll definitely
be used in census data.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.120
&gt;&gt; Female: So, you mentioned
the disparity between standards

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:11.740
and what was being published in
the geospatial data environment.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.760
You talked a little bit about
your background as an engineer

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.980
and also, the importance
in forestry,

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.940
but why was this bill
so important to you?

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.520
Why did you champion it?

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.820
&gt;&gt; Congressman Bruce
Westerman: Well,

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:25.930
I like to see things work
efficiently and effectively,

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:29.180
and I understand the
importance of standards

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:35.450
and common platforms, and I've
seen the success in Arkansas

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:41.730
with our GIS departments there
and the leadership, really,

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:43.500
that Shelby's been
able to bring to that,

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:46.630
and I just thought there was
a better way to do government

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:51.480
at the federal level, and
this is a good governance bill

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.520
that should save
taxpayers dollars

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.910
and provide a better service.

00:45:55.910 --> 00:46:00.660
So, it was easy for me to
get on board to support it.

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:08.100
I wish we could find more pieces
of legislation like this.'

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.520
&gt;&gt; Male: So, [speaking
off mic] your final point.

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.000
I'm just curious if,
sort of looking ahead,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.790
if there are more types of bills
or more types of initiatives

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:17.150
that you might need
jumping onto that,

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.830
that might relate
more efficiently

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:22.500
to geospatial education

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.000
or for promoting geospatial
technology development

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.500
in the government or beyond?

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.340
&gt;&gt; Congressman Bruce Westerman:
Yeah, and I think we need

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.920
to give this piece
of legislation time

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.200
to get implemented, and
there will always be tweaks

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.750
that need to be made.

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:38.840
I'm also a huge proponent
of STEM education,

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:42.850
which geospatial data
education would fall

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:44.510
in that stem category.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:52.000
You know, I have four children,
one still in high school,

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.170
and they all got a little bit
of exposure to geospatial data

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:03.120
in a program called EAST, that
actually originated in Arkansas,

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:07.530
and I see programs like
than continuing to grow,

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:11.110
and it's amazing when the
interest it can create

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:14.430
in young people, who may have
never thought about a career

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:16.840
in STEM, when they
get to start playing

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.730
around with satellite
data and remote sensing

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:22.690
and building their own maps
and doing projects with that.

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:28.230
So, I think it will -- I think
the educational component will

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:32.000
come along to support the
science in the industry.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.300
&gt;&gt; Female: What's
the timeline expected

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:48.100
for getting all the government
agencies on the same page,

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:49.400
as far as the standards go?

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.700
[speaking off mic]

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.000
&gt;&gt; Congressman Bruce
Westerman: I don't know

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.870
if an official timeline has been
established yet, but you know,

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:56.440
my response to the agencies
would be you're not done yet.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.440
You know? And you all know
-- and this is a hard thing.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:03.180
You know, we have huge
issues in the world today

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:07.070
with cybersecurity, which
GIS also can play a part

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:14.340
in cybersecurity, but one
problem with trying to legislate

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:17.570
and regulate anything that
has to do with technology,

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:19.840
and especially with
computer systems,

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:25.480
is that by the time government
gets the big massive slow

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:29.590
machinery moving and just
momentum, everything's changed.

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:31.660
So, it's got to be
something is responsive.

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:34.930
That's why hope that
these two committees

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:39.890
that have been codified
will work closely together

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:44.650
to monitor the situation and to
build something that can react

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:48.190
at the same speed that
technology changes today,

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:51.820
if that's at all possible
in the federal government.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.010
I think that's a huge challenge,

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:58.390
and we all know how slow
the federal government moves

00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:59.690
on things.

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:03.520
But this is one that
it really needs

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:07.440
to have a bigger
flame built under it,

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.090
I guess, to move faster.

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:12.660
And that's one thing that I will
keep pushing for, is following

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:15.630
up with, you know,
most of this is --

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:17.720
falls under the Department
of Interior.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.780
So, we have a lot of
contacts over there

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:23.060
that we'll be following up with
to say where you at on this?

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.980
How can we help?

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.530
And, you know, what's your
timeline kind of thing?

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:31.380
But I think you all can
help with that, too.

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:35.360
Just because we've got a bill
signed into law doesn't mean

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.990
that anything's happened to it.

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:41.910
We've got to get
the code written

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:45.250
and get the agencies
to implement the law.

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:51.150
Well, again, thank
you for your time,

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:54.560
and I can't say enough
how humbled I am to get

00:49:54.560 --> 00:50:00.200
to be the person that got to
carry this piece of legislation.

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:05.470
We'll make nerds proud
everywhere, and it's really,

00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:10.980
really -- I can't express
enough how much your work

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.050
and efforts helped
to get this done.

00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:16.210
Without your work and
efforts, we wouldn't get

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:18.330
to celebrate today
the fact that we got

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:20.870
to the geospatial data
act signed into law.

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:24.170
So again, thank you, and
if I can ever help you

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:28.570
with anything else, I'm
pretty easy to find.

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:30.510

and have a good day.

Congressman Westerman, for
that excellent keynote talk.

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:56.090
So, next up, I'd like to
introduce Candice Luebbering.

with a variety of AAG
programs and programs

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:15.050

and membership engagement
activities.

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:21.700
She is a proudly self-labeled
map nerd, who loves promoting

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.810
and sharing geography and
GIS with all audiences.

Good morning.

00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:43.890
&gt;&gt; Audience: Good morning.

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:45.190
&gt;&gt; Candice Luebbering: Thanks
so much for having me here.

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:46.490
Thank you to the Library of
Congress for putting this on,

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:49.120
to John Hessler, Tim, all of
your colleagues for having me.

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:51.170
First time following a
Congressman speaking.

00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:52.780
That's a little nerve-racking.

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:54.470
I'm not going to lie.

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:57.210
But I'm really excited to
be here, in particular,

00:51:57.210 --> 00:52:00.880
because the focus today is
on GIS in K-12 education,

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:03.530
and that's what our
GeoMentors Program is all about.

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:06.310
The GeoMentors Programs is a
nationwide network of volunteers

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:07.610
who are looking to do.

00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:10.680
Find ways to insert GIS and
geography in spatial thinking,

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.740
any way we can, into
K-12 classrooms

00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:15.100
and student groups
across the country.

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:18.870
So, that's what I'll
be talking about today.

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:21.020
So, the AAG is partnered
with Esri

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.530
for the GeoMentors Programs,
and this was borne out of,

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:25.840
starting in 2015, for
the GeoMentors Program,

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.870
Esri made a fantastic
donation saying, hey,

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:30.260
we've got this software
platform.

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:32.650
We will give it to any K-12
school the US that wants it

00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:34.840
and wants to use it, which
is fantastic, and even now,

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:37.780
they've expanded that donation,
and Charlie, who'll speak

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:39.660
after me, will have a lot
more to say about this,

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:40.960
but now it's also available

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.220
to all K-12 schools
internationally, as well.

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:44.550
So, this is fantastic, right?

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:48.070
Students have the opportunity to
map with the same software that,

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:49.370
you know, industry
and government

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:51.640
and business were using around
the world, which is great.

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.880
But we can't always just, of
course, just take software

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:57.110
and drop it in the laps of K-12
schools, because they have tons

00:52:57.110 --> 00:53:00.560
of time, right, to learn
new technology or find a way

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.070
to insert this in curriculum.

00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:04.770
No, so, you know, as we had the
foresight of thinking, yeah,

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:06.440
this is a great gift, but
we know it's not going

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.740
to be the easiest
thing to implement.

00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:11.760
So, with the free software
bundle, let's also bundle

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.720
in some free help,
and that's the idea

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:15.300
of having this GeoMentors
network.

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:18.670
Volunteers who will work with
a teacher, with the classroom,

00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:21.030
with a school district, asking
them what they would like to do

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:22.910
with this technology,
kind of teaching them

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:24.210
about the technology,

00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:25.510
and helping them implement
it in the classroom.

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:26.810
So, there's the best chance

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:30.040
for the software give
to actually get used.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.560
Our current GeoMentors
network, as of yesterday,

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.830
was 1814 people who
have signed up.

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:38.240
So, every dot on this map is
someone who is, basically,

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.710
another Geo nerd,
who was like, yeah,

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:41.660
I want to help get kids mapping.

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:42.960
Who doesn't?

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:44.260
So, they're available.

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:45.560
This is an interactive map.

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.330
So, any teachers in the
room, you can go on here,

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:48.720
click on this, learn
about people,

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.020
find their contact information.

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:51.320
We also have a database.

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.620
So, you can search keywords.

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:53.920
You can have certain
topics you're teaching.

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.710
These are all people who
are interested, are ready,

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:58.740
and willing to work with a
teacher or with a youth group

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:00.860
or something like that.

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:04.280
So, teachers, again, see these
points as resources for you

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:05.890
and those of you
potential GeoMentors,

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:07.960
consider adding your
dot to the map.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:10.670
So, this is a lot of volunteers,
which is great, but if you think

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:12.980
of how many schools and
classrooms there are to reach,

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:18.100
we could always use a few more
good people helping us out.

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.960
So, then your next
thought might be, well,

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.260
who can be a GeoMentor?

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.880
I run into so many people
thinking, can I be a GeoMentor?

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.340
If you're asking yourself,
if you're here on GIS Day,

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:28.150
if you know what GIS day is,

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:30.810
you're already super
qualified to be a GeoMentor.

00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:33.160
And I'm not saying that
it's because, you know,

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.760
you don't have to
be an absolute whiz.

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:36.060
You're not going to
go into a classroom

00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.360
and they expect you to, yeah,

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:39.040
I need you to Python
program to do this.

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.450
No, right?

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:42.890
So, I have a lot of people who
get intimidated and realize

00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:44.190
and think I can't do it.

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:45.750
You have so much more
to offer than you think.

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:48.020
If you know what GIS is, if
you know the cool web map

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:50.140
and can lead a class
through asking questions

00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:54.360
that can be answered spatially
by looking at imagery or,

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.870
you know, adding
different data layers.

00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:57.360
That's being a great GeoMentor.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.750
So, if you're here.

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:03.000
It's more the enthusiasm of
the passion that's a perquisite

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.680
than a certain type
or level of skills.

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.370
So, we're not just academics.

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:08.670
We're not just GISPs.

00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:10.260
We're not just geographers.

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.010
So, it's anyone from undergrads.

00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:15.040
They're some of our most
enthusiastic volunteers.

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.660
To retirees and everyone
in between,

00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:19.900
from all different
disciplines, are our GeoMentors.

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.200
So, don't be intimidated

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.730
and think you don't know
enough to be a volunteer.

00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:27.520
And you can really see the
diversity of our volunteers

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.650
by seeing just some of the
descriptions of who they are.

00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:33.100
Again, not just geographers,
not just in academics

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:34.400
or something like that.

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.250
So, a biologist with the
National Park Service.

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:38.160
A teacher is also a GeoMentor.

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.880
So, we have teachers who are
using this in the classroom,

00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:42.040
and then they're helping
other teachers to use it.

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.340
Undergrad students.

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.850
Really, they are fantastic
and enthusiastic and wonderful

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:47.470
as volunteers, because
they're not far removed

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:49.130
from the K-12 environment.

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:51.550
So, they have the connection
to get into the classrooms,

00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:53.090
but they also remember
that experience

00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:54.650
on how they want
to make it better.

00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:57.050
A GIS tech at an
engineering firm.

00:55:57.050 --> 00:55:58.940
So, urban planners.

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:01.850
A health educator who also
has a certification in GIS.

00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:03.150
I like that, right?

00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:06.040
Talk about diversifying on your
skill set in your portfolio.

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:09.610
So, what's good about this is
not just that it's interesting,

00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:11.860
but we don't go into a school

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:13.480
and have a prescription
of what are you?

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.780
You're eighth grade.

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:16.600
All right, do this.

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:17.900
We know it would never work.

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:19.940
What our job really
is is to listen.

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.240
What would you like
to do with this?

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.540
What are you currently teaching,

00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:24.530
and how can I help
you apply that?

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:26.490
And if you imagine all
the different, you know,

00:56:26.490 --> 00:56:28.030
teachers in schools
across the country,

00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:29.370
all have very different
interests

00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:30.670
with what they're teaching,

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:32.220
with what's important
in their local area.

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:35.170
So, we need this broad spectrum
of volunteers to be able

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:38.330
to respond to this, to have
varying expertise and interests,

00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:41.450
to have -- be able to respond
to their needs can cater to them

00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:43.680
in what's going to be
important and useful for them

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.540
in using the technology.

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:46.840
All right, so who are they?

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.140
We covered that.

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:49.440
What exactly do you do?

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.740
All right, that was
the next thing.

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.040
All right, you're asking me
to sign up for something.

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.770
So, volunteers, what do you do?

00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:57.610
Not the easiest answer, again,
because we don't have a playbook

00:56:57.610 --> 00:56:58.920
that you take, all right?

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:00.550
So, really, the opportunities,

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:02.900
I often call this a choose
your own adventure volunteer

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:05.190
opportunity, because
it really is.

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:07.650
You're responding to
what a teacher or school,

00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:10.550
or a student working
on project might have.

00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:14.130
So, it's kind of as broad as
the applications of GIS itself.

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:16.310
So, a lot.

00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:19.690
But the general areas of what
a lot of our volunteers do kind

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:21.470
of fall in four areas.

00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:24.330
One, advocating for using GIS.

00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:26.850
So, for most of us in
this room, check, right?

00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:28.900
We are like, we know
GIS Is important.

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:32.250
That assumption actually does
not carry super far sometimes

00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:34.430
outside of this room
for this building

00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:36.320
or even agencies around here.

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.210
I think even hearing about the
Congressman making the case

00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:42.330
that the Geospatial Data Act,
right, to his constituents.

00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:45.820
Right? Unfortunately, people use
an interactive geospatial data

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:48.050
all the time, but they don't
necessarily make the connection

00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:49.750
to the field of GIS
and all the work

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:52.260
that makes the magic
happen in their phone.

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:55.680
So, even just telling a
school about what this is,

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.760
that it's not just
something you can only use

00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.060
that one grade level.

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:01.640
That it's not just something you
can only use with one subject.

00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:04.660
That is something you can use
throughout the entire school.

00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:05.960
That's a big feat.

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:07.260
That's something that
needs to be done.

00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:08.560
So again, you don't
have to be a GIS was.

00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.410
Can you talk about how it's cool

00:58:10.410 --> 00:58:13.040
and how it could help
in the classroom?

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.520
Demonstrating existing
exercises to educators.

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:17.750
So, not having to
reinvent the wheel.

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:20.680
There are so many good resources
out there, lessons plans

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:23.590
and activities, and it's
a matter of, you know,

00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:24.890
showing a teacher
that it's there

00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:26.190
and walking them through it.

00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:27.930
Helping them get
comfortable with leading it

00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:29.230
in their own classroom.

00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:32.640
So that they can carry out and
carry the torch themselves.

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.220
So, you don't always
have to completely come

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:35.520
up with all new things.

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:36.820
You're not building,
necessarily,

00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:38.180
a whole semester's
worth of coursework

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:39.480
from them to implement.

00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:40.780
Some people do.

00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:42.080
Maybe they'll ask you to.

00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:43.380
But often, it's just showing
them what's already available

00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:44.680
and being that person
they can talk

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.310
to about it to implement it.

00:58:46.310 --> 00:58:49.230
Sharing information about
careers in geography and GIS.

00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:51.070
Again, and this room,
we're well aware

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:52.590
that this is a good
feel to be in.

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:54.400
There are a lot of
opportunities.

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.280
Even labor market
statistics say there's a lot

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.750
of growth opportunities,
but how many people heard

00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:03.300
about be a geographer or be a
geoscientist in high school?

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.600
Yeah, exactly, right?

00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.940
So, it's not one of those
typical career paths you hear

00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:10.240
about at younger stages
and K-12, and yet,

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:11.820
it so the career
path that is open

00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:13.430
to a world of opportunities.

00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:14.730
You know, this type

00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:16.030
of technology doesn't
really pigeonhole you

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:17.330
and to one discipline
at all, does it?

00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:18.630
All right, so, if you're
a person that likes

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:21.370
to say undecided and do
all possible things, one,

00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:22.670
you might end up
being a geographer.

00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:23.970
That's what happened here.

00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:25.970
But two, if you learn
this technology,

00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:27.600
it doesn't put you
on a certain path.

00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.170
There's so many different
ways they can apply it.

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:31.280
So, it's only going to be
more and more beneficial

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:34.410
to our discipline and to society
if we have students more aware

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:36.760
of these opportunities
at a younger age.

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:39.560
And then, finally, some
people do assist teachers

00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:43.100
and group leaders with making
all new exercises with coming

00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.230
up with survey one, two, three,
and running out in the field

00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:47.860
and collecting data in a park
of things that are broken

00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:50.280
and taking it to city council
and saying, "Hey, fix this."

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:51.580
That's happened.

00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:53.710
That's been a group project.

00:59:53.710 --> 00:59:55.410
You know, but finding new
data, collecting data,

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:58.100
building story maps,
new web apps.

00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.690
So, some people do, from the
ground up, do entirely new,

01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:03.140
customized things, again,
with a teacher or a classroom.

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.560
It all depends on what
they're looking for

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.860
and what you're interested in

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:07.160
and how much you can
help them with it.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:10.390
So really, our GeoMentors
do a variety of things,

01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:13.320
and you can work in person in
your local community schools,

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.040
but, I mean, this is
all about technology.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.970
So, obviously, you can
work at a distance, right?

01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:19.250
You can work with the teacher
across the country, you know,

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:21.680
and be their point of
contact to help them through,

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.890
answer questions, and
that kind of thing.

01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:25.280
Great. That's what
they generally do,

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.580
but what did they actually do?

01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:29.160
That's really going to drive
home what this program does,

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.940
what it can do, what you might
want to do if you're involved,

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.510
how you might want to work with
a GeoMentor if you're a teacher.

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:36.490
So, I'm just kind of
bringing up some quotes

01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:37.900
and some little examples.

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.410
What I've learned from
running this program

01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:43.560
with volunteers is they
are so excited sometimes

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.120
about doing this stuff, that
they don't tell me about it.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.710
So, I actually have the
problem of people being more

01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:50.590
into volunteering
than reporting.

01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:54.340
Great problem to have, and
if you're only going to focus

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:55.640
on one thing, I want
you to do that.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.500
So, I know there's so many
more stories out there

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:58.910
than even the ones that we have,

01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:00.670
but I'll just highlight
a few today.

01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:03.690
And these kind of show exactly
those kind of general categories

01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:04.990
of what I said volunteers do.

01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:07.060
So, meeting with juniors
and seniors at two

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:08.360
of our local high schools,

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.390
discussing with them what
a GIS career entails,

01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:12.710
and the choices you
have with a GIS career.

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:14.080
So, just actually
going somewhere

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.020
and telling people what you
do every day, maybe to you,

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:19.560
you're already like, I
know I do that every day.

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.330
But to them, it's completely
something new they've never

01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:25.480
heard of them thought, I did
not know that was a job, right?

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.400
Anytime a student kind of
hear something like that,

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.720
you've just opened up a whole
kind of opportunity and,

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.140
you know, who thought I didn't
know that's something you

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:34.440
could do.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.740
Whether or not it's something
they're interested in,

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:37.430
but even making them aware
of these possibilities.

01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:40.390
So, one, you are an expert
what you do every day.

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:43.510
So again, if you think you can't
be a GeoMentor, you know to do?

01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:45.280
Yes, okay, can you
talk about it?

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.840
Probably, hopefully, right?

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.930
And so, that's already
being a great GeoMentor.

01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:52.180
I visited a middle school
in Riverside, California.

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.800
They're learning about
earthquakes and architecture.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.950
So, I'll demonstrate how 3D GIS

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:58.800
and ArcGIS online can be
used to model such events.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.640
So, this is a lot
of what it's about.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.700
What are you guys already
teaching and learning?

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.470
Okay, hey, so we could visualize
this in a different way.

01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:06.770
Let's just check it out.

01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:08.070
What do you think?

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:09.560
All right, so we're not
supplanting curriculum.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.860
We're finding out
ways to say, hey,

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.160
would you like to
see this differently?

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.660
Would you like to look
at this spatially?

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:15.650
Would this be a something
of interest to your students

01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:18.080
to learn this topic
in a different way?

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.280
And it's stuff, you know,
not just connecting them

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.620
to what they're learning,
but especially

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.990
if they're learning something
applicable to their environment.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:25.290
They're in California.

01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:26.590
Earthquakes and architecture.

01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:27.900
This is not a foreign
thing, far, far away.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.510
Again, this is something
they can connect with

01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:32.090
and imagine how much more
this topic might drive home

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:34.970
if they see it visualized
spatially in this way.

01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:38.510
My son's school just
registered for their account.

01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:40.290
Principal and IT
specialist are both excited,

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:41.780
as is his kindergarten teacher.

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:43.080
Kindergarten.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.380
That's awesome.

01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:46.740
So, this is another big task
is just getting them aware

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:49.430
of what it is and, yeah,
getting them excited about it,

01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:51.210
even just a little bit
excited, compared to the level

01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:54.150
that we are or I am about it.

01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:57.990
It's a really big, important
step is getting them aware

01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:00.150
of this, excited, and
getting them on board.

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:02.990
So, that's something that a lot
of our GeoMentors do, as well.

01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:05.930
I'm just going to keep showing
this stuff, because I love it.

01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:07.970
So, I always share this one.

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:10.660
Charlie's probably seen me
talk about this so many times.

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:13.560
"I reached out to my daughter's
fourth grade Challenge Program.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.420
I shared a bunch of
resources with her

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:17.990
and inadvertently caused her to
change her entire lesson plan

01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:21.300
to incorporate GIS (oops)."

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:23.960
We don't often want oops
moments, right, in our lives,

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:27.760
but we want these oops
moments, where the teacher now,

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.580
and I think that's part
of the program, too,

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.800
is it's not just how the
students can get more excited

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.690
but the teachers
can get more excited

01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:35.380
about what they're
already doing, all right?

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:38.230
Maybe something they taught
every year, year in, year out,

01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:40.760
and you know, they're
passionate about it, but oh,

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:42.900
a new way of teaching it
is invigorating for them,

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:44.330
as much as it is
for the students.

01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:47.640
So, and we didn't force her
to change her lesson plan.

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.940
They were excited to.

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:50.450
So, that's another
important part, too.

01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:54.460
But we want more oops moments,
more excitement moments.

01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:57.670
And this next one is just
something about volunteering.

01:03:57.670 --> 01:04:00.250
I think that was -- kind of
came through in this quote.

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:02.390
"I'm about to reach out to my
daughter's sixth grade social

01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:03.690
studies teacher.

01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:04.990
He's expecting my email.

01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:07.120
This will be the first time
doing anything like this.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.470
Pretty scary for me, but
I have to get over it."

01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:13.200
Just like I have to get
over public speaking, right?

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.540
So, a big part of this,
again, do I know enough

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:19.570
to be a GeoMentor and, oh, I
have to put myself out there.

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:21.640
And you do, and it is
scary, but I encourage you

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.300
in the most positive way
possible what I say this,

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:25.600
get over it.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.190
I encourage you to put
yourself out there, and again,

01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:29.980
you'll get so much
validation out of this

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:32.140
in realizing how much
you have to offer,

01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:37.440
how much the technology
knowledge you have can go beyond

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.660
your daily frame of
reference of what you work in

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:42.800
and help students
get excited about it.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.040
So, yes, I probably should not
tell a crowd of people to get

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.130
over it, but I just did.

01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:50.710
So, that happened.

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:52.530
And then, we just get to
see the stories come in,

01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:54.170
and it's super exciting.

01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:57.370
Top left there, not
everyone uses GIS

01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:58.670
when they do GeoMentoring.

01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:00.040
That's fine.

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:01.920
Wall maps or even just talking

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.220
about spatial thinking,
all right?

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:04.520
It doesn't have to be GIS.

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.520
So, with younger kids, we do
have GeoMentors who will just go

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.550
in sometimes with
a giant wall map.

01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:10.580
National Geographic has
those huge floor maps

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:11.950
of the states that
are fantastic.

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:14.020
So, kids will run around in
socks, hopping around on,

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:16.040
you know, cities
and mountain ranges.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:19.750
Bottom left, actually, it's an
undergraduate geography society

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:22.490
at a university partners with
a local high school and takes

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:23.800
over the classroom
for a couple days

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.230
to teach high schoolers
with ArcGIS online.

01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:30.080
In the center there, working
with the AP GIS class,

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.380
making custom web maps.

01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:34.140
Can you imagine getting to do
that at the high school level?

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.950
I started learning
GIS when I was 24,

01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:39.630
and I felt young starting at 24.

01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:42.480
But when I think of just a
different way of thinking

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.680
and the future of the field
and innovation that will come

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.040
from students intuitively
knowing how to work

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.320
with this stuff at a younger
and younger age, it's exciting.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.220
Top right, working with a
Girls Innovation Academy.

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:55.520
Again, that sounds supercool.

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.780
I want to go back in time
and be in these things,

01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:00.600
but teaching geo referencing
and wetlands mapping.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:04.020
And the bottom one, an example,
again, of working at a distance.

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:07.550
So, Rob Spacecraft, he actually
puts that on his name badges

01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:11.230
at conferences, Spacecraft
as to go by.

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:12.530
Fun with names.

01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:13.830
Puns with names.

01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:15.690
But he virtually mentored
students in California,

01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:17.930
who were working on story map
submissions for a contest.

01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:20.350
So, wasn't even in the same
place, but could go back

01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:22.230
and forth and advise
them, help them find data,

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:25.130
and that sort of thing.

01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:26.430
And I'll just keep sharing more.

01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:28.030
So, this picture,
top left to Justin.

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:29.750
He's the one who had a paper
map with the younger kids,

01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:31.670
but now you see him
teaching, you know,

01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:33.410
digital mapping with
an older crowd.

01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:35.530
So, adapting with the students
or with what's available

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:36.830
in the classroom, right?

01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:38.130
You just have to adapt.

01:06:38.130 --> 01:06:40.330
So, this is a very good
exercise in adapting.

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.100
Top right, Annette

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:44.480
in Pennsylvania does
amazing jobs working

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.780
with all these different schools

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:49.030
and getting just the
most adorable, you know,

01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:50.910
activities of kids going
out and doing surveying

01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:55.660
and collecting data in
the field, and of course,

01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:57.460
can you spot the
geospatial professional

01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:59.390
in a sea of fourth-graders?

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:01.560
I'll give you a moment.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:05.710
And maybe it's because he or
she, you know, is really blended

01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:07.720
in there, or maybe it's because
the fourth-graders are looking

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.520
more and more like
geospatial professionals.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:10.820
I don't know.

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:14.770
I'll leave that is
food for thought.

01:07:14.770 --> 01:07:17.700
And really, the other
thing is, this also,

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.250
it's not just one directional
of GeoMentors are out going

01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:22.940
and doing a thing and just
students are benefiting.

01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:25.150
I really found that
everyone kind of benefits,

01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:27.280
and you don't necessarily
predict

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.190
which way the geomentoring
really is going to happen.

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:33.020
So, I don't know if you see
our tiny man-big vest here

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:34.320
in the front left, right?

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.620
That's Oliver, and Oliver is the
son of his geomentor dad next

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:41.390
to him, and when his geomentor
dad goes and does drone exhibits

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:44.530
and kind of demonstrations for
classrooms, Oliver goes with him

01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:45.870
and is super jazzed about it.

01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:47.170
He likes to help.

01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:48.470
He likes to be the helper.

01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:50.060
So, while I know
there's a classroom

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:52.390
of students here learning about
drones, I think there's a lot

01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:54.930
of geomentoring here
between Oliver and his dad,

01:07:54.930 --> 01:07:56.890
and we've got a geomentor
in training here.

01:07:56.890 --> 01:07:59.510
And he's learning about what his
dad does and what's interesting

01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:00.810
about this, and he's learning

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.410
about teaching other
students, as well.

01:08:02.410 --> 01:08:06.050
So, there's a lot of
positive, multidirectional kind

01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:09.340
of benefits out of these
geomentoring opportunities.

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:13.720
So, maybe I have some of
you hooked thinking, I mean,

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.800
maybe I could do that possibly.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:18.470
So, how do you get involved?

01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:19.770
It's painless.

01:08:19.770 --> 01:08:21.070
I promise.

01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:22.990
You just sign up online,
and you're not obligated

01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:25.190
to anything, assigned
anything, required anything.

01:08:25.190 --> 01:08:26.970
You just get in our
communication loop.

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:28.270
So, you'll get emails.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.930
He'll get newsletters, and
you'll be a dot on the map.

01:08:30.930 --> 01:08:33.700
So, educators and schools can
find you and reach out to you.

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:36.300
If there are educators in
the room, and you would

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.350
like to also put
your name out there

01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:39.860
and saying, hey, I want help.

01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:41.960
We have a sign up for
educators, as well.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.200
So, if you sign up, then
GeoMentors will be notified,

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.730
and they can contact you, and
you can say what you're looking

01:08:46.730 --> 01:08:48.840
for and what kind
of help you want.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.350
And once you've signed up, and
if you're ready at some point,

01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:53.560
and I will say, we ask
GeoMentors to get involved

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.710
when they can to the
extent that they can.

01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:57.310
Maybe it's a one-time thing.

01:08:57.310 --> 01:08:59.380
Maybe it's an ongoing
collaboration for a semester,

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:02.150
or a year, or beyond, but
every little bit helps.

01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:04.760
So, I don't think I only
have this much time.

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:07.030
So, I can't do it, or
that kind of thing.

01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:09.100
We don't have any limitations
or anything like that.

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.840
Again, every little bit helps to
be the spark for the educator,

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.870
the spark for the
student, a spark for you.

01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:15.990
So, connecting with
a collaborator,

01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:18.370
I will be straightforward,
it's not always the easiest

01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:20.220
to make roads into
the K-12 communities.

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.910
Charlie knows a lot
more about that.

01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:24.400
So, sometimes this can be
the most challenging thing.

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:27.840
As a GeoMentor, you can, first
of all, see what educators are

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.140
out there requesting help.

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:30.860
We do tend to have more
volunteers putting their name

01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:32.660
on the map then educators.

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:35.510
Contact local schools
in your area.

01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:38.160
You can see which schools have
signed up for the software

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.460
and which ones haven't.

01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.060
So, that's a strategy of
go to schools that have

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.790
or approach schools that
haven't and tell them about it,

01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:45.420
if you want to do that
kind of advocacy angle.

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:47.420
You can also work
with youth groups,

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.820
because they're also
eligible to get free software.

01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:52.200
So, maybe you've volunteered
with Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.660
or 4-H or Boys and
Girls Clubs of America.

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:57.940
Those are options too, or
afterschool clubs affiliated

01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:59.580
with schools, as well.

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.010
So, think outside the box.

01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:02.820
What are environments
that students are

01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.250
in that I could work with?

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:06.190
But we really encourage
people to work

01:10:06.190 --> 01:10:08.420
through your social network.

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:11.630
Most people have a connection
to K-12 in their life, right?

01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:13.300
So, it's their kids' school.

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:14.600
Their friend is a teacher.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.900
Their alma mater, right?

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:17.200
So, think of it that way.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.080
One, it makes little bit easier.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.220
People know who you are
and why you want to help,

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:23.180
because you're just
invested, and you're kind

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:24.480
of more invested,
too, because you know

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.780
who you're helping already.

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:28.620
But you could be the
person that brings GIS

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:29.920
to your elementary
school, right?

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.790
So, your middle school
to your high school.

01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:33.550
Again, a lot of parents
who are working

01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:34.890
with their own kids' teachers.

01:10:34.890 --> 01:10:36.590
Some of them follow
them through the grades.

01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:39.100
So, they'll work with the grade
level that their child is at,

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:40.400
and they're going and adapting.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.700
And so, they're starting
with elementary.

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:44.180
Now they're in middle and
adapting their skills,

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.670
as well, with doing that.

01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:48.830
And again, for those who
are seeking a GeoMentor,

01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:50.130
the online map is there,

01:10:50.130 --> 01:10:51.960
but there's also a
database, as well.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.930
So, you can connect and
find people that way.

01:10:54.930 --> 01:10:56.360
And we don't just say, woo-hoo!

01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:01.330
Sign up! We try and put as much
resources as we can in one spot

01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:02.630
to have more than enough
to get you started.

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:04.680
So, if you go to our website,
you know, we have information

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:05.980
on how to find people.

01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:07.280
How to talk to them.

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.580
Also, how to connect
with each other.

01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:09.880
We do want this to
be a community.

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:11.180
So, we have online communities.

01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:12.480
We have social media.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.190
How you can share
your story, and also,

01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:16.350
a review other people's
stories, as well.

01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:19.720
And you can gain service and
outreach experience, which,

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:22.120
in and of itself, is
fulfilling, but some people,

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.510
particularly undergrads who are
looking to have more experience,

01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:27.480
if you tell us about your story,
which we really want you to do,

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:29.620
we'll document it and
give you a certificate,

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.980
and anyone who is an
aspiring GISP, right,

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:36.160
this can work towards your
accreditation or your renewal.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.370
And I mentioned the
case studies.

01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:39.950
This is how you can
really find out more

01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:42.350
about these variety
of experiences.

01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:44.670
We have over 40 case studies
from 27 different states,

01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:46.800
and these are people who
took the time to write a lot

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.160
about their experience.

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.960
How did they find someone?

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.690
You know, how much
time did it take?

01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:52.990
That's something
we want to know.

01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:54.290
What did they teach?

01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:55.590
What worked well?

01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:56.890
What didn't work well?

01:11:56.890 --> 01:11:58.190
And what did they
learn from experience?

01:11:58.190 --> 01:11:59.490
How was it for them?

01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:01.720
So, I encourage you to go
online and check those out,

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:03.390
and what we really
hear is, again,

01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:05.040
how much our volunteers
get out of it.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.340
All right?

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:07.640
So, it's invigorating to
have students show enthusiasm

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.500
in what each of us have
chosen as a career.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.090
Or as Diana said, "It encouraged
me in my day-to-day work.

01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:14.980
It reminded me of how fun GIS
can be and how it can be applied

01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:16.280
to almost everything
you do daily."

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:19.020
I think sometimes we forget
that, oh, yeah, this is fun.

01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:21.050
Right? Oh, yeah, you can
use this for a lot more

01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:23.240
than just what I do
in my discipline here.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:26.300
So, I think this can actually
be really reinvigorating

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.040
for our volunteers, as well.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:31.150
So, I encourage you, if
you're not signed up,

01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:33.720
if you'd like to sign up or
at least check us out online,

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.830
reach out to us on Twitter,
email, and all that,

01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:38.130
and I want to thank you again

01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:41.510
for having me here
today and happy GIS Day.

01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:53.040
[ Applause ]

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.000
&gt;&gt; Tim St. Onge: All right,
thank you very much, Candice.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.040
So, I will remind everyone
again that at the end

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.220
of all these talks, we will have
all the presenters up again,

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:02.960
so you can ask questions,
so we can have more

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.640
of a full-range discussion
with everybody.

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:07.250
So, if you have any
questions, don't worry.

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:11.100
Candice is sticking around
for a while and will be able

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:13.800
to answer questions and will
be able to have that discussion

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:18.180
at this point at maybe about
11:30ish, but for right now,

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:21.710
I'd like to introduce our next
speaker, Charlie Fitzpatrick.

01:13:21.710 --> 01:13:26.040
Charlie has been Esri's schools
program manager since 1992,

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.150
focused on K-12 classroom
use in the US.

01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:33.750
He taught social studies
in grades seven through 12,

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:36.850
mostly eighth-grade geography
in St. Paul, Minnesota.

01:13:36.850 --> 01:13:39.510
So, please welcome
Charlie Fitzpatrick.

01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:44.430
[ Applause ]

01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:47.240
&gt;&gt; Charlie Fitzpatrick:
Nobody's asked for this so far.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:50.740
So, are there any
teachers out there?

01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:52.340
We've got a handful.

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:59.930
Yay! And some of who have
been who will say, oh,

01:13:59.930 --> 01:14:02.630
that's one of the best
times of our lives.

01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:08.030
Well, so, I get to -- I have
one of the three or four jobs

01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:10.640
that Jack Dangerman, the head
of Esri, would like to have.

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.060
And so, this is always a big
responsibility for me to come in

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:17.800
and talk with people
about what's available?

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.100
What's possible?

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:22.610
Because there's so many
things that people are doing,

01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:24.770
and you look at these
pictures and think, wow,

01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:27.140
everybody's doing stuff.

01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:28.950
And well, yes and no.

01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:32.250
And it's important to
understand a little bit

01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:34.300
about why this came to be.

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:39.230
So, I got to start in the
old days, back in 1992,

01:14:39.230 --> 01:14:45.540
with the dawn of ArcView 1.0,
and it was on Windows 3.1,

01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:50.230
and very few people, very few
teachers, had access to machines

01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:53.300
and were comfortable with
them and had time to mess

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:55.110
around with them, and
there was no curriculum.

01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:59.230
And so, ArcView 1 was out.

01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:03.050
And then ArcView 2, and by the
time that ArcView 3 was around,

01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:04.800
there were things
that people could do.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.100
There were some activities.

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:10.130
There were some projects,
and really, it was projects

01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:12.540
that made it happen for people.

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:15.350
Getting people to say,
hey, there's a thing

01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:17.190
that I really want to explore,

01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:21.680
and that's been the
watchword all the way through,

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:24.300
whether it's I want to take
a look at the watershed

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:26.710
in my community, or I
want to see the world

01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:28.830
in several different
projections,

01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:33.260
or I have this battle that I
really like to think about.

01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:37.950
There's something that people
want to do in their class

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:40.060
and have the time and
have the passion to do,

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:43.050
but it was really the
oddball way back then.

01:15:43.050 --> 01:15:48.700
Then about 2000, things
started to roll fast.

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:52.120
We came out with this GIS
in schools, but with a set

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.230
of case studies of
what people are doing

01:15:54.230 --> 01:15:55.910
and some best practices.

01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:59.810
And 2002 was a real
watershed, because we came

01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:02.390
out with this big green
book, Mapping our World.

01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:06.680
And that was a curriculum where
there was the software in place,

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:10.510
and there were activities
for world geography

01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:12.500
that people could go through,
and they were doing it

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.550
from third and fourth
grade on up

01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:19.460
into grad school using
that one resource.

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:23.550
And they been doing that
over the years with ArcView 3

01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:26.220
and then ArcView 9
and then ArcView 10

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:28.800
and then ArcGIS online.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:31.510
That resource has
been fairly timeless,

01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:35.020
but what also happened
back in 2000 was

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.320
that kids started appearing

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.150
up on the Esri user
conference stage,

01:16:39.150 --> 01:16:41.090
and you can see in the top left.

01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:43.220
There's a group that
is sitting on top

01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:45.020
of this thing called
the geography network,

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:48.940
which was starting to get
to be online capacity,

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:51.330
and they were actually
some of the first users

01:16:51.330 --> 01:16:53.320
of the geography network.

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:55.500
They were working with
some data from online.

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.670
So, this was something
that was, you know,

01:16:57.670 --> 01:17:00.350
presaging the big
change that was coming.

01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:03.140
The group in the top right,
they look like little munchkins.

01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:06.870
They were fourth-graders who
came up on stage and were able

01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:09.940
to prove to people what
it is that kids can do,

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:14.160
because these guys said, hey,
Department of Natural Resources,

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:18.020
your model about what these
toads, with these tiny,

01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:21.670
little horny toads in
central Washington,

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:24.480
that they only travel of
thousand feet in their life,

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.870
but the ones that
we're tracking,

01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:27.770
they've traveled three,
four times that much.

01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:29.070
So, your models are wrong.

01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:30.400
So, go fix them.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:33.170
And so, that was really
important for people to get

01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:35.590
to see that students
can do a lot.

01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:39.170
So then came these,
you know, that whole --

01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:41.090
this world that you
see in the center came

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:43.770
out with the mapping
our world book,

01:17:43.770 --> 01:17:46.670
and it was a powerful
thing for people to see.

01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:49.570
That this is what GIS people do.

01:17:49.570 --> 01:17:53.440
This is this geographic inquiry
process that they go through,

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:57.000
and a lot of people who were
science teachers will look

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.550
at this and say,
well, of course.

01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:59.850
Everybody's doing this.

01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:02.710
No, not everybody was doing
this, and certainly not

01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:04.040
so much social studies teachers.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:07.090
I was a social studies teacher,
but I grew up as a biologist,

01:18:07.090 --> 01:18:12.190
and so it's that science thing
that helps people see I need

01:18:12.190 --> 01:18:14.810
to be approaching these
things scientifically.

01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:18.920
I always wanted my kids to be
exploring and messing with data,

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.500
and that's what you got
to do with these tools.

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:25.170
Well, and that's what happened
with some of the materials,

01:18:25.170 --> 01:18:26.530
the software, but started coming

01:18:26.530 --> 01:18:32.830
out for integrating both
desktop data and online data.

01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:36.500
So, you can see in the far
right, Arc Explore Java Edition

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:39.860
for Education that
came out in 2007,

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:44.130
and then ArcGIS Explorer,
and then, okay.

01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:45.980
Come on, you can
scroll down here.

01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:47.280
Let's see.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.620
Let me smallerize this
one more a notch here.

01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:52.080
All right, then we can get to --

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:54.500
how about if I move
the mouse over here?

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:59.680
All right, well, we'll
just deal with that.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:05.250
ArcGIS Explorer, and then,
the ArcGIS online came out.

01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:08.880
And then, some apps
working with ArcGIS online.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:12.780
So, things were really
starting to happen at the end

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:19.020
of these 2010-2011 year,
and in 2012, my God,

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:22.270
the world just went -- exploded.

01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:25.660
ArcGIS Online organizations
came out, and people finally,

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:30.130
in schools, had a way to have
students be able to safely

01:19:30.130 --> 01:19:35.030
and securely be able to share
and collaborate and work

01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:40.500
across activities, across
classrooms with each other.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:43.070
There were all kinds of ways
that they could do this,

01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:47.180
and Jack ran into
[inaudible], who introduced him

01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:49.830
to this school, and he
said, "I think we want

01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:51.130
to work with the school."

01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:55.130
And what they were able to do,
they had two fabulous teachers

01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:58.460
who were at this
math-science-technology

01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.760
magnet academy.

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:02.900
It was the social studies
teacher and the English teacher

01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:05.270
who took GIS and ran with it,

01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:08.390
because they converted what
was already a great project,

01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:11.440
a research project, and to
a really powerful thing,

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.950
and in three months,
they went from, okay,

01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:18.060
we now have computers we
can turn on two, Jack,

01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:21.270
this is the group that
needs to be up on stage.

01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:23.940
When you have teachers that
are really good teachers,

01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:27.850
and you expose them to GIS,
powerful things happen.

01:20:27.850 --> 01:20:31.030
And so, they came
onto the stage.

01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:34.370
They show people what was
possible, and that was

01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:36.810
about the time when President
Obama was saying, hey,

01:20:36.810 --> 01:20:40.280
we want private industry
to help education.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:41.740
Jack heard that said, okay.

01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:43.620
We're going to do that, and
as Candice was talking about,

01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:44.920
we're going to do that.

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:49.480
We're going to provide software
to any school that wants it.

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:50.980
We're going to provide mentors.

01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:52.730
We're going to provide
instructional materials,

01:20:52.730 --> 01:20:54.790
and we're going to provide
some teacher support.

01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:57.180
So, we're going to
make that stuff happen,

01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:02.010
and that was this Connect
Ed program that started out,

01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:08.770
and as we jumped in in 2014, and
the biggest thing that we jumped

01:21:08.770 --> 01:21:12.330
into was working
with geo inquiries.

01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:16.470
One of my colleagues, Tom Baker,
said, okay, we've got to come

01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:21.230
up with materials that
Joe Teacher, Jane Teacher,

01:21:21.230 --> 01:21:25.820
without GIS background, can
incorporate into their class,

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:27.960
into work that they're
already doing.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:30.040
So, he has, over the
last couple years,

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:35.950
built with teachers helping him
out, built in these nine sets

01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:42.570
of 15 to 20 lessons for anybody
to use with no GIS background.

01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:44.000
So, how do they work?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.650
Well, what happens is
there is a two-page,

01:21:48.650 --> 01:21:52.930
back and front PDF
for every lesson.

01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:57.380
That two-page PDF includes a
color bar on the first page

01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:02.400
where it's got a URL to its
own unique preconstructed map.

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:07.810
So, all of these lessons, 150
lessons, that lead to content

01:22:07.810 --> 01:22:11.150
that is the stuff that teachers
are doing in their standard,

01:22:11.150 --> 01:22:13.800
regular classroom activities.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.820
They're working on
standard content.

01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:17.480
So, it's Edgar Allan Poe.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:23.310
It's the Civil War, or it's
earthquakes and plate tectonics

01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:29.280
and watersheds and linear
rates of development

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.190
and whatever happens to be.

01:22:31.190 --> 01:22:32.970
Oh, and there's elementary

01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:36.330
that is an integrated
set of content, as well.

01:22:36.330 --> 01:22:39.410
Teachers can do this with
very little background,

01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:43.440
and it'll work even in just
one computer in a classroom

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.440
with a projector, but
if you have students

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:49.850
that have devices,
all the better.

01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:53.150
And so, this has been
extremely powerful,

01:22:53.150 --> 01:22:55.510
because no login is required.

01:22:55.510 --> 01:23:00.080
They can do this in 15 minutes,
or if they decide, oh, hey,

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:02.220
we want to mess around
with the software,

01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:04.410
it may take a little bit longer.

01:23:04.410 --> 01:23:06.250
But it's all good.

01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:08.660
Now what has come of that?

01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:12.290
You introduce people to
some of these geo inquiries

01:23:12.290 --> 01:23:16.800
where they get to do these
activities, and they say, great.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.120
I want more.

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.420
Where's more?

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:20.890
Well, a level two.

01:23:20.890 --> 01:23:24.480
So, we've been creating
these level-two geo inquiries

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:29.180
that say now we want you to
get into doing some analysis.

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:31.380
To do that, you actually
have to log

01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:34.780
in with an organization
account and be able

01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:39.960
to have publishing capacity,
but when you can do that,

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:42.810
you can do geographic analysis.

01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:47.170
So, this particular lesson,
this dustbowl, is looking at --

01:23:47.170 --> 01:23:52.100
it's a summarize within
activity, where you're going in

01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:55.210
and taking a look at how
many are within this zone.

01:23:55.210 --> 01:23:59.500
And so, there are all kinds
of analytical capacities

01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:03.290
that are built into ArcGIS
online, and what's happening is

01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:06.320
that teachers are starting
to get exposed to this

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:07.650
and discovering, while.

01:24:07.650 --> 01:24:09.040
This is pretty powerful.

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:13.150
This is pretty cool, and those
organizations are available

01:24:13.150 --> 01:24:15.770
at no cost to any
school in the country,

01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:18.090
and that's what a lot
of schools are doing.

01:24:18.090 --> 01:24:25.830
So then, what you
see is a couple

01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:27.130
of different examples here.

01:24:27.130 --> 01:24:29.820
So, in the bottom right,
let's start with that one.

01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:33.960
Here you see an AP
human geography class

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:38.220
that is happening in two
schools at once with one teacher

01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:43.080
that is a virtual situation
in the other school.

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:46.020
So, you can see the other
school in the left-hand monitor,

01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:50.790
and you can see the presentation
that he's walking his students

01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:56.950
through in two schools at
once, just with a big monitor.

01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:58.770
That's very doable, even

01:24:58.770 --> 01:25:00.990
if you don't have a really
big monitor like that.

01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:02.580
This was a very cool classroom.

01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:03.880
I love this.

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:06.190
And you can see, actually,
if you get in and take a look

01:25:06.190 --> 01:25:09.670
at it, the students all have
devices on their machines.

01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:12.300
So, he's walked them
through some things,

01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:13.600
and now he's saying, okay,

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.210
here's what I want
you to explore.

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.650
So, now in three
different classrooms

01:25:17.650 --> 01:25:19.630
in these other pictures,
you're seeing students,

01:25:19.630 --> 01:25:22.150
and they're all working
on iPads here.

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:25.360
The fellow with the broken
arm in the top-left corner,

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:28.190
he's actually got
the teacher material

01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:30.050
that he's been working with.

01:25:30.050 --> 01:25:32.950
And this teacher said,
hey, I like my science kids

01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:37.260
to be working with the actual
content that I get to see.

01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:39.610
I want them to go
through the exact steps,

01:25:39.610 --> 01:25:41.570
and we interrupt them
every now and then.

01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:45.830
And so, he was very good,
skilled at doing that.

01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:49.410
The student below in the
lower left, he's working

01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:53.610
on a social studies one,
looking at the Middle East,

01:25:53.610 --> 01:25:55.890
with a worksheet
from the teacher

01:25:55.890 --> 01:25:59.270
that the teacher has specially
created and said, you know,

01:25:59.270 --> 01:26:02.830
go through these activities
and work your way through it.

01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:05.680
And the student on the top
right has no worksheet at all.

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.560
That student and that
class, they're going through

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.960
and saying, hey, this is
what we want you to explore.

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.130
You've got 10 minutes
to get in and explore

01:26:13.130 --> 01:26:15.290
and tell me what you
found afterwards.

01:26:15.290 --> 01:26:18.110
And so, there are a lot of
different ways of working

01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:20.960
with these things,
teaching standard content.

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:23.810
So that's been very helpful,
and people get to the end

01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:25.110
of that and they say, great.

01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:26.410
I want more.

01:26:26.410 --> 01:26:27.710
Where do I go?

01:26:27.710 --> 01:26:29.010
So, people inside Esri

01:26:29.010 --> 01:26:33.260
and beyond have been
building these materials.

01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:37.070
There's a book that came
out, the ArcGIS book,

01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:41.050
and what that says is it
provides people a number

01:26:41.050 --> 01:26:44.270
of activities that
they can go through.

01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:50.370
Well, they've added to that some
lessons that they also said,

01:26:50.370 --> 01:26:53.630
hey, let's open it up
and bring some lessons

01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:55.480
that are just designed
for teachers.

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.650
And so, there are three
different types of lessons,

01:26:57.650 --> 01:26:59.990
and one of the mentors
said, "My God,

01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:02.700
the kids are just downloading
the book or the lesson

01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:04.270
on to their phone,
and they're doing it

01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:06.460
on the computers,
and they love it.

01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:07.760
They're focused.

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:09.670
They're so into it,"
which is great.

01:27:09.670 --> 01:27:11.510
That's what we want
people to do.

01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:14.630
And one of the best examples of
that is happening in Virginia,

01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:18.380
where the Virginia Geospatial
Semester, which is a program

01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:21.720
that is coordinated by
James Madison University,

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:27.830
is running through and they've
got about 500 students this year

01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:29.130
that are going through that.

01:27:29.130 --> 01:27:30.430
Mostly 12th graders.

01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:32.350
There are a few 11th
graders going through it.

01:27:32.350 --> 01:27:36.620
Science, social studies,
and some CTE teachers.

01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:40.260
But that's not the
only way to do that.

01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:42.360
There are also people,

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.930
as Congressman was talking
about, the East Initiative.

01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:48.440
So, these folks are working
through, in Arkansas,

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:51.410
there are 250 schools
in Arkansas

01:27:51.410 --> 01:27:53.500
that are participating
in this program.

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:57.310
It is a project-based,
high-tech,

01:27:57.310 --> 01:28:00.600
individualized service
learning project.

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:02.920
And so, people are going
through and learning GIS.

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.780
High schools, most high
schools in Arkansas,

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:08.270
many middle schools, and a few,

01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:11.400
even elementary schools,
kids are doing GIS.

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:14.390
And so, you can see some
map-based activities

01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:19.040
in the example on the website,
but a lot of students are going

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:20.960
through and just exploring it.

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:23.960
The two kids that are over here
on the left, munchkins again.

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:28.560
Fourth-graders who were up on
stage in 2014 doing something,

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.500
and they showed it, and
those kids saying, hey,

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:37.530
we took our balloon data,
and let's display it in 3D,

01:28:37.530 --> 01:28:39.150
and let's make a movie of it.

01:28:39.150 --> 01:28:40.560
And people came up
to me afterwards

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:43.480
and said the students are
doing things that we don't do.

01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:46.190
So once again, yep,
you can do it,

01:28:46.190 --> 01:28:48.410
if you just get the
chance to do it.

01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:52.940
And in Michigan, the Grace
Program was a very powerful

01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:55.460
thing that said we want to
start with the teachers learning

01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:57.450
about this through
geo inquiries.

01:28:57.450 --> 01:29:00.030
Mentor them to go beyond that.

01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:04.210
Maybe inspire the teachers
to get the students

01:29:04.210 --> 01:29:06.450
to do some additional training,

01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:09.740
and then the savvy kids can
qualify for internships.

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:13.580
And they had about 150 or
200 kids over the last couple

01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:17.560
of years get summer internships,
paid summer internships

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:18.860
with what they're doing.

01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:22.840
And there's a little town in
Michigan where there is a kid

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:26.700
who is working through his 12th
grade year, and he will graduate

01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:29.810
with three years in the
county GIS shop at the time

01:29:29.810 --> 01:29:34.630
that the only GIS user in
the county is retiring.

01:29:34.630 --> 01:29:38.410
He may not have to
go to college,

01:29:38.410 --> 01:29:41.210
but as Candice mentioned,
clubs are available, too.

01:29:41.210 --> 01:29:43.390
They're doing all
kinds of cool things.

01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:45.650
Here we've got the 4-H
group that is showing some

01:29:45.650 --> 01:29:48.200
of their health programs
in the background,

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:51.860
and over on the left-hand
side, in 2017, 4-H(ers) were

01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:56.810
up on stage looking at, because
they had an interstate health

01:29:56.810 --> 01:29:58.960
program that they
were looking at,

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:02.380
four states that they
were collaborating

01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:05.040
on this research project
and putting it together.

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:08.670
This was a fabulous
presentation, getting people

01:30:08.670 --> 01:30:12.890
to see what's possible
with that work.

01:30:12.890 --> 01:30:17.060
So, we've taken that and said,
okay, what we want to do is --

01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:19.590
let me smallerize this
just a little bit,

01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:22.250
see if we can wrap that -- ooo.

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:27.890
There, you get to see, actually,
the winners from this past year,

01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:30.480
the middle school and
high-school winners.

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:33.990
There's a competition that says
put together, in a team of one

01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:38.200
or two, a research project
and put together a story map.

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:41.840
So, you can go -- let me
just hit that one again,

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:44.550
so that you can see -- then
I'll give you the address,

01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:45.850
if you like.

01:30:45.850 --> 01:30:50.290
And the big national prize
across the country is you get

01:30:50.290 --> 01:30:52.510
to come to the user conference,
which is always great

01:30:52.510 --> 01:30:55.410
for students who haven't
ever been on a plane.

01:30:55.410 --> 01:30:57.690
But you get to see
all of their maps.

01:30:57.690 --> 01:30:59.580
Now it's not just for students.

01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:02.000
We've also got an
opportunity for people

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.310
to see what other
teachers are doing.

01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:06.410
So, we've created a
little challenge program

01:31:06.410 --> 01:31:07.710
for the teachers.

01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:09.170
Put together a one-minute video.

01:31:09.170 --> 01:31:10.470
Take a look at it.

01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:14.150
We're going to look across
the country at the ones

01:31:14.150 --> 01:31:17.680
that we really want to
highlight and say, here.

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:21.020
These are the ones that
people should take a look at.

01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:25.700
And so, you're seeing
science teachers,

01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:27.780
social studies teachers,
CTE teachers

01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:29.650
at all different grade levels

01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:31.510
and the things that
they're doing.

01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:35.570
It's a very powerful way to
explore this, and there are some

01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:38.260
of the teachers that are putting
out independent materials

01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:40.460
on their own for
people to work with.

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:44.360
So, there are lots of
opportunities for people

01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:48.760
to think about where do
we fit this stuff in?

01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:54.280
And what you're seeing
now is that map that shows

01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:56.910
that there are thousands of
schools across the country

01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:59.550
that are already doing
this and thousands more

01:31:59.550 --> 01:32:01.040
who haven't gotten
into doing this,

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:04.690
because they've only been
exploring the geo inquiries.

01:32:04.690 --> 01:32:08.220
And so, you can go
in and explore this.

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:12.560
Esri.com/schools will take
you to all the information

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.500
that you can shake a stick at,

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:17.680
all the information
that you really need.

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:21.200
You can get software for the
schools in your neighborhood,

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:29.570
and there are things that your
kids can do just starting in.

01:32:29.570 --> 01:32:31.560
All grades.

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:36.050
Well, Candice and I could
probably talk all the rest

01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:40.060
of the day, but you've got
more people to present.

01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:41.860
Thank you very much.

01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:53.050
[ Applause ]

01:32:53.050 --> 01:32:55.440
&gt;&gt; Tim St. Onge: Thank
you very much, Charlie.

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:56.890
All right, moving along,

01:32:56.890 --> 01:33:00.090
our next speaker is
Kathleen McGuigan.

01:33:00.090 --> 01:33:03.240
She is an education resource
specialist here at the Library

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:07.110
of Congress, with over 25 years'
experience working on behalf

01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:10.060
of K-12 education
for national groups.

01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:11.650
In her current role,
she is responsible

01:33:11.650 --> 01:33:14.630
for building online teacher
programs here at the library.

01:33:14.630 --> 01:33:16.510
So, please welcome
Kathleen McGuigan.

01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:22.400
[ Applause ]

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:23.700
&gt;&gt; Kathleen McGuigan:
Good morning.

01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:26.670
My name's Kathy McGuigan,
and I work in the learning

01:33:26.670 --> 01:33:29.720
and innovation team, and we're
part of the new center here

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:33.110
at the library, which is
called the Center for Learning,

01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:37.030
Literacy, and Engagement,
and I do have the pleasure

01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:39.500
of building teacher
programs and products

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:43.480
for educators using
libraries' collections,

01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:46.210
that's what I'm going to talk
about a little bit today,

01:33:46.210 --> 01:33:52.360
a project that we started last
summer looking at literary maps.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.000
Excuse me.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.990
So, what we're looking at are
some of the foundational steps

01:33:57.990 --> 01:34:03.090
that we're taking to visualize
the library's catalog for,

01:34:03.090 --> 01:34:06.620
and we're really focusing
on American literature,

01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:10.270
and I'll go into a little
bit more of the specifics.

01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:13.700
But I was very excited to hear
from our past two speakers

01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:17.360
about the mentoring aspect
to this and the access

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:20.750
that schools will have,
because really, what I'm talking

01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:23.220
to the -- the audience I'm
talking to you today, really,

01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:25.500
are the educators in
the crowd and talking

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:29.520
about how I'm approaching
this project

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:32.260
from the educator perspective.

01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:36.160
So, what is a literary map?

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.990
A literary map is a
map, or it's a picture,

01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:42.900
that acknowledges the
contributions of authors

01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:46.480
to a specific area or region.

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:54.470
It can also be a map, or
a picture, of locations

01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:56.800
of works within fiction.

01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:01.590
So, I want to show you
a couple of examples

01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:05.440
of some literary maps that we
have here in the collection

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:10.180
at the Library of Congress in
our Geography and Maps Division.

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:14.660
So, this map is the
pictorial chart

01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:18.910
of American Literature
from 1932.

01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:26.030
And this is a Book Lovers map
of the United States from 1949.

01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:32.690
Next up is the Iowa
literary map from 1934

01:35:32.690 --> 01:35:34.850
from the Davenport Library.

01:35:34.850 --> 01:35:41.820
And here we have the Texas
literary map of 1955,

01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:45.100
and this comes from the
Dallas Public Library.

01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:50.080
And lastly, in terms
of our examples,

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:54.360
this is the Maine Writers
map, and this comes

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:57.140
from the Maine Council
of Teachers of English,

01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:00.660
and this is from 1981.

01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:08.280
So, in approaching this
project, there was, in 1993,

01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:10.230
there was an exhibition
here at the Library

01:36:10.230 --> 01:36:12.510
of Congress called
Language of the Land,

01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:16.980
Journey into Literary America,
where these literary maps

01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:21.170
that the library houses
were put onto display,

01:36:21.170 --> 01:36:27.600
and this exhibition went on the
road and traveled to 16 states

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:32.740
and 20 different sites, and
as part of their programming,

01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:34.610
state centers for the
book, and I'll get

01:36:34.610 --> 01:36:36.910
into what a State
Center for the Book is.

01:36:36.910 --> 01:36:40.310
They started producing
literary maps.

01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:44.560
And then, those maps, as well as
other maps from the collections,

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:48.190
are in this particular book,
which is called the same

01:36:48.190 --> 01:36:50.100
as the exhibition
Language of the Land,

01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:52.100
Journeys into Literary America.

01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:55.440
This was published in 1999.

01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:00.080
And so, when I learned
about the literary maps here

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:04.620
at the Library of Congress, it's
something that has really stuck

01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:06.730
in my head since I've been here.

01:37:06.730 --> 01:37:11.280
I've been here for 11
years, and a long time ago,

01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.040
I was an English teacher, right?

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:17.000
And so, I was thinking about
how you could use these

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.770
instructionally with your
students, but beyond that,

01:37:20.770 --> 01:37:27.030
in looking at some of the maps,
right, figuring out the folks

01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:29.890
who selected the authors
that are displayed

01:37:29.890 --> 01:37:33.070
on this map may look very
different to your students,

01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:36.110
in terms of building
their own literary map

01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:41.180
and celebrating different facets
of their literary history.

01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:44.080
So, last year, I had
the pleasure of working

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:47.440
for the Center for the Book,
which is also in the Center

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:51.260
for Learning Literacy
and Engagement,

01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:57.410
and as part of that work,
the state centers --

01:37:57.410 --> 01:38:01.900
we have a state center for
the book in all 50 states,

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:05.880
and they are about reading
promotion, literacy promotion,

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.580
and celebrating poetry.

01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:10.090
So, taking some pieces
of the programming

01:38:10.090 --> 01:38:15.910
that the library does on behalf
of constituents and rolls them

01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:17.300
out through the state.

01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:22.370
And so, several states had
mentioned that they were looking

01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:26.040
at using GIS to do
their literary maps.

01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:30.430
And so, what we decided to do
was to form a committee, right?

01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:32.040
That's what you do.

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:36.070
So, we formed a committee
with several of the states

01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:39.890
who were already in this
field looking at this project

01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:44.400
and how you take your literary
map from a paper product

01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:47.110
and map that out using GIS.

01:38:47.110 --> 01:38:51.930
So, we're working with the
state of Illinois, Mississippi,

01:38:51.930 --> 01:38:58.390
Pennsylvania, Washington,
Minnesota, and Montana.

01:38:58.390 --> 01:39:04.920
And so, I just want to
show you a quick example.

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:09.910
This is a project from Montana
and the Montana Authors Project.

01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:12.960
And really, what they did
is just mapped out the books

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:17.350
that they selected from
their physical literary map

01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:20.320
and mapped it out using GIS.

01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:21.620
This is another project.

01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:23.850
This is the Washington
State Center for the Book,

01:39:23.850 --> 01:39:26.860
and this is called Finding
Books in Washington.

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:30.280
And so, they were looking at it
from an end-user's perspective.

01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:32.170
How do they serve
their constituents

01:39:32.170 --> 01:39:33.470
in getting access to books?

01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:35.650
So, they've mapped out
the public, academic,

01:39:35.650 --> 01:39:37.550
and tribal libraries, as well

01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:40.700
as independent bookstores
throughout the state.

01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:42.240
And then, the last
example I want

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:44.660
to show here is the
Illinois Center for the Book.

01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:48.900
They have a very robust
database that they maintain,

01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:51.520
which is called the
Illinois Writers Project.

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:56.610
And not only does the state
center nominate writers to be

01:39:56.610 --> 01:39:59.320
in the Illinois Writers Project,

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:03.110
but writers themselves
can self-selected nominate

01:40:03.110 --> 01:40:05.060
themselves for the
Writers Project.

01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:09.150
So, you can see, this
is a very dense project.

01:40:09.150 --> 01:40:12.740
So, one of the things
that we did in meeting

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:18.140
with the groups is to really
map out one of the paper maps

01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:21.430
and map it out on
the Esri platform.

01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:23.770
And so, here you can see
a side-by-side comparison.

01:40:23.770 --> 01:40:26.780
I'm not sure how big this
is actually showing up,

01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:31.360
but this is the Arizona Literary
map, and it is then laid

01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:35.450
out for looking at
the catalogue records

01:40:35.450 --> 01:40:37.580
that we have here
at the library.

01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:42.070
And it was just the start
what I'm going to be talking

01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:45.980
about in mapping this out.

01:40:45.980 --> 01:40:49.950
I know you all know this,
but I just want to talk

01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:53.740
about the benefits of doing
something like this is

01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:59.600
that we can talk about
exact geographic location.

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:04.690
And this becomes more
accessible to a larger audience.

01:41:04.690 --> 01:41:08.790
Again, if you take one of those
physical maps, a literary map,

01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:13.450
students might not recognize
themselves within those writers,

01:41:13.450 --> 01:41:17.620
within that particular area,
and if you put it into the hands

01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:21.040
of the students to determine
what facets they would use

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:25.300
to lay out their own map, you
know in using the Esri platform

01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:27.800
and GIS in particular,
it's a matter

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:30.910
of easily editing
the information,

01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:34.400
and most importantly, you
can incorporate large amounts

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:35.700
of data.

01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:38.080
So, and I'll get into
a little bit more

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:41.420
of what we're looking at here.

01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:45.540
And it serves as an
intuitive educational tool,

01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:50.000
as our last two speakers
have talked to you about.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.480
So, looking at the
library's records.

01:41:54.480 --> 01:42:02.370
In 2017, the library
released 25 million records

01:42:02.370 --> 01:42:06.640
of their catalog, and
as part of that release,

01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:10.420
what they did was they
also sponsored a hackathon,

01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:15.120
where they invited groups
in and at their sites

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:18.800
to start taking a
look at the data.

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:26.570
And so, there was a lot of
great work that was done,

01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:31.710
in terms of being able
to look at what is needed

01:42:31.710 --> 01:42:36.760
to extract the data
within those sets.

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.790
And we know within
the MARC records.

01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:43.500
So, what is a MARC record, for
those who are not familiar?

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:46.360
It's a machine-readable
cataloging record.

01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:52.580
So, it's the basis of the
collections here at the library.

01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:56.520
And within the fields,
and I'm not a librarian.

01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:58.920
So, for the librarians
in the crowd,

01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:01.660
I just want to put
that out there.

01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:09.170
So, but there is a field within
the MARC records, which is 651,

01:43:09.170 --> 01:43:14.120
and that is a field that locates
where the work takes place.

01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:17.590
So, if we were to look at all
of the geographical information

01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:20.260
within a MARC record,
you would have the place

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:22.090
where books are published.

01:43:22.090 --> 01:43:24.520
That is actually
in the MARC record,

01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:26.830
but you would see
a great influx,

01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:30.110
if you were taking a look at
American fictional records

01:43:30.110 --> 01:43:32.160
with that in New York.

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:34.380
So, what we're really
trying to take a look at is

01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:37.690
where does the work
of fiction take place?

01:43:37.690 --> 01:43:40.670
And that happens
within these MARC tags,

01:43:40.670 --> 01:43:44.180
and in particular, in field 651.

01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:46.960
So, this is the MARC
record for one

01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:50.520
of the most popular novels
that's taught in schools,

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.780
which is The Great
Gatsby, right?

01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:55.930
And so, taking a look
at the MARC record

01:43:55.930 --> 01:44:00.320
for The Great Gatsby,
we get to field 651,

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:03.780
and as you would expect, it
says Long Island, New York.

01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:08.260
So, taking that one step
further, mapping it out,

01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:11.600
this is transcribing the
MARC record and putting it

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:15.790
on to -- into the map.

01:44:15.790 --> 01:44:22.000
So, in talking about how do we
move forward with this project?

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.980
And again, when you start
looking at the amount of data

01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:29.710
that is out there with
the 25 million records,

01:44:29.710 --> 01:44:32.100
how do you start
making sense of this?

01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:35.550
And so, there are so many smart
people here at the library,

01:44:35.550 --> 01:44:37.460
and several of them
are in the room,

01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:40.110
and I want to thank you all for
helping me with this project.

01:44:40.110 --> 01:44:44.300
So, I sat down and talked
with a number of experts

01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:47.060
within the library, and
someone made the suggestion,

01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:48.460
you should get a junior fellow.

01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:51.640
This is an intern that comes
and spends six or seven weeks

01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:56.820
with us here at the library,
and just invite this person

01:44:56.820 --> 01:44:59.150
in to start taking
a look at the --

01:44:59.150 --> 01:45:02.430
at what they did in
the hackathon and look

01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:07.480
at what your committee is trying
to -- what their goals are,

01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:09.260
and let's play around
a little bit.

01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:14.080
So, we put the call out,
and thankfully, we got --

01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:17.350
he's now a senior at the
University of Georgia majoring

01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:19.710
in GIS and comparative
literature,

01:45:19.710 --> 01:45:21.900
and his name is Josh Clifford.

01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:26.140
And you will hear from him
in the future, I'm sure,

01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:28.320
but he couldn't be here today.

01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:31.350
So, he came on board,
and we, essentially,

01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:34.870
gave him the project
and said, good luck.

01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:40.750
And so, one of the first things
that he did was to take a look

01:45:40.750 --> 01:45:46.780
at all of the data sets and
focus in on one of the parts.

01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:51.860
So, those 25 million records
are in 41 different parts.

01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:59.090
And so, we narrowed that 41
parts down to part 41, and so,

01:45:59.090 --> 01:46:02.040
what he did is started
editing the data

01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:05.820
within that using a
tool called MARCEdit,

01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:07.120
and then he refined this.

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:11.070
For those GIS professionals in
the room, you know far better

01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:16.330
than I do how much time it takes
to really get into the data sets

01:46:16.330 --> 01:46:18.980
and make sure that
they are consistent,

01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:23.190
and then translated them
and cleaned up the records,

01:46:23.190 --> 01:46:25.910
and then, finally,
mapped them out.

01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:30.150
So, we did not get
anywhere near mapping

01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:32.450
out the American fictional
records, but I will share

01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:34.820
with you what we
were able to do.

01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:40.860
So, the part 41 that
he was taking a look

01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:44.150
at had 250,000 records.

01:46:44.150 --> 01:46:46.400
And so, the processing
power that you need

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:53.050
to even start refining the
data in this is pretty intense.

01:46:53.050 --> 01:46:59.590
And as I mentioned before, he
used MARCEdit to look at that.

01:46:59.590 --> 01:47:04.100
And then, he moved that from
MARCEdit into Open Refine.

01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:07.070
And doing these steps was just

01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:12.440
to assess how many records
had data in field 651,

01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:18.060
because it is not complete
at all, whatsoever.

01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:23.460
And more recent records may
have that data the way we want

01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:26.830
to ingest it, but older records,

01:47:26.830 --> 01:47:30.470
in some cases, will
not have that.

01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:38.100
So, then he brought it
into Excel, and we started

01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:40.010
to focus on Washington State.

01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:43.010
It was a manageable piece of
information that we could do

01:47:43.010 --> 01:47:47.180
in the six to seven weeks that
he was here in Washington.

01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:51.880
And so, we focused on the State
of Washington and identified

01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:53.820
where we could find information.

01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:58.250
In a lot of cases, you'll
see just Washington labeled

01:47:58.250 --> 01:48:03.330
and not a specific
area within Washington.

01:48:03.330 --> 01:48:09.430
So, what he did is then he
took the data and related out,

01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:13.560
and where we had
Washington identified,

01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:17.570
and his key here is
this particular area.

01:48:17.570 --> 01:48:21.880
This has 192 records,
because this just Washington.

01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:27.140
And then, the other
areas around the state

01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:33.240
where the actual
city is listed out.

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:38.040
So, this is the translation,
and looking at the title,

01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:43.350
the author, the year published,
the geographic ID, and then,

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:49.080
he went into another platform
and extracted the book cover,

01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:51.720
so that it can provide some kind

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:56.810
of visualization
with the information.

01:48:56.810 --> 01:49:03.110
So, what did we learn after this
summer is that that processing

01:49:03.110 --> 01:49:07.060
that has to happen
with the 41 parts,

01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:12.080
we need a lot more
interns and a lot of them.

01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:14.970
So, I was actually very
excited to hear about the access

01:49:14.970 --> 01:49:18.770
that the schools might
have, in terms of being able

01:49:18.770 --> 01:49:22.870
to start looking at data sets.

01:49:22.870 --> 01:49:26.240
But we also need a
better understanding

01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:30.860
of the MARC records and the
cataloging language that is used

01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:34.100
within the 651 fields.

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:36.380
And then, we're also looking

01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:38.850
at the commercial
databases that are out there.

01:49:38.850 --> 01:49:43.490
As I mentioned, Josh
would go to Amazon

01:49:43.490 --> 01:49:45.440
and actually get
the jacket covers,

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:52.010
to be able to make the project
more appealing visually.

01:49:52.010 --> 01:49:55.540
It isn't completely
necessary, but really figuring

01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:59.970
out what databases exist,
because we're looking at it

01:49:59.970 --> 01:50:05.040
from the geographic location
within the work of fiction.

01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:07.860
But there are other databases
out there that we need

01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:09.730
to incorporate their
information.

01:50:09.730 --> 01:50:13.250
So, going back to that Illinois
Writers Project, there's a lot

01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:15.620
of great data that they have

01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:18.600
that would inform this
particular project.

01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:21.170
So, trying to take a
look at the data sets

01:50:21.170 --> 01:50:23.970
that already exist
within the field.

01:50:23.970 --> 01:50:26.740
So, some of the ones that
we're looking at are Amazon,

01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:33.100
Overdrive, GoodReads, which is
also Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble,

01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:40.040
in terms of databases that
exist and what would be involved

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:43.120
with merging and
sharing that data?

01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.590
So, some of the next
steps that we are taking,

01:50:45.590 --> 01:50:49.030
we will have another junior
fellow here this summer,

01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:53.160
and this junior fellow, most
likely, will come from --

01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:58.200
will be a graduate student in
library information sciences.

01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:01.730
We'd really love to get
into the cataloging aspect

01:51:01.730 --> 01:51:04.240
to the project.

01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:07.610
And again, mentioning,
we will be examining some

01:51:07.610 --> 01:51:11.700
of the other databases,
and we'll start meeting

01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:13.340
with other potential end users.

01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:17.620
Again, we have the state
centers, which is one

01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:20.580
of the driving forces for
this project, in particular.

01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:25.550
But thinking about the students
that you work with and the folks

01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:29.600
who would be able to
implement making their own map,

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:34.680
using the robust data
that we could provide.

01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:37.120
And we're thinking,
at this juncture --

01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:38.660
I'm not making any promises.

01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:41.260
I'm not even asking permission,

01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:44.000
but we're thinking
about crowdsourcing.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:47.530
There's a project that was
done with the DC Public Library

01:51:47.530 --> 01:51:51.050
that started in 2012, where
librarians were invited

01:51:51.050 --> 01:51:55.220
into their database to
pull out passages of books

01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:58.370
that took place in different
neighborhoods in Washington DC,

01:51:58.370 --> 01:52:00.300
and they were able
to map that out.

01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:03.070
It started in earnest in 2012.

01:52:03.070 --> 01:52:08.080
I think it's not as updated
as it was in the beginning

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:12.370
of the project, but they
opened it up to library

01:52:12.370 --> 01:52:14.280
and librarian professionals

01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:19.490
to mark those records
for their needs.

01:52:19.490 --> 01:52:23.700
And so, we're trying to take a
look at what does crowdsourcing

01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:27.800
with this look like, and
what kind of information,

01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:32.630
potentially, we could get back,
versus, again, the information

01:52:32.630 --> 01:52:35.140
that becomes very
important for the library,

01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:38.670
in terms of its cataloging
and cataloging records.

01:52:38.670 --> 01:52:41.960
So, that's a little bit of what
we're looking at, but again,

01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:45.220
for the educators in the
crowd, I want you to be aware

01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:48.790
that we're really looking
at it from your perspective

01:52:48.790 --> 01:52:54.840
and how you might be able to
use this with your students

01:52:54.840 --> 01:53:00.330
and be able to really
visualize American literature.

01:53:00.330 --> 01:53:02.510
So, thank you.

01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:17.050
[ Applause ]

01:53:17.050 --> 01:53:18.900
&gt;&gt; Tim St. Onge: All
right, thank you, Kathleen.

01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:21.140
So, at this point, I'd like
to invite all our speakers

01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:23.490
from this morning
up onto the stage.

01:53:23.490 --> 01:53:26.900
What we'll do is we'll have
our speaker standing up here.

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:29.490
Any sort of questions you have,

01:53:29.490 --> 01:53:31.700
you can field to
the whole group.

01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:35.170
The only one thing we will be
doing is repeating the question

01:53:35.170 --> 01:53:38.580
back into the microphone, so
that our video picks it up.

01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:41.170
But aside from that, feel free

01:53:41.170 --> 01:53:43.570
to ask any questions
of the folks up here.

01:53:43.570 --> 01:53:46.370
We can have an open
discussion, so thank you.

01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:52.340
&gt;&gt; Charlie Fitzpatrick:
And don't be shy.

01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:58.680
Okay, we better have a pointer.

01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:00.700
&gt;&gt; Female: I'll get it.

01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:02.000
&gt;&gt; Female: Perfect.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.300
&gt;&gt; Male : I'll start.

01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:07.290
Hi. Some of you already
know me [speaking off mic].

01:54:07.290 --> 01:54:09.680
Candice, I do direct this to
you, although I'd be happy

01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:11.820
to hear from any of you.

01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:13.460
With the work that you
been doing in schools,

01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:16.420
with your GeoMentors, one
of the things that comes

01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:23.510
to my mind is how GIS can also
bring students into science

01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:24.810
and geography and things

01:54:24.810 --> 01:54:27.310
that maybe they wouldn't
have thought before.

01:54:27.310 --> 01:54:29.560
You address that a little bit
through the careers angle,

01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:34.370
but I wonder if you're seeing
[speaking off mic] the role

01:54:34.370 --> 01:54:35.670
that this can play

01:54:35.670 --> 01:54:39.730
in diversifying geosciences
and geography?

01:54:39.730 --> 01:54:41.030
&gt;&gt; Candice Luebbering:
Absolutely.

01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:42.660
Do you want me to
repeat the question?

01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:47.330
Okay, so the question, generally
speaking is how we're seeing GIS

01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:52.250
as diversifying people coming
to the geospatial industry

01:54:52.250 --> 01:54:54.300
and applications of it.

01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:56.200
You saw the one tweet,
for example,

01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:59.030
of working with the Girls'
Innovation Academy, right?

01:54:59.030 --> 01:55:01.490
So, I guess there's two
ways I look at this in terms

01:55:01.490 --> 01:55:04.810
of how it's improving the
diversity of use of GIS

01:55:04.810 --> 01:55:09.980
and also the diversity
of users of GIS.

01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:12.530
So, one, you know,
it's the challenge

01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:14.790
and there's even discussion,
right, of the different levels

01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:17.620
of spatial thinking
skills based on sex, right?

01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:20.580
Girls, versus boys, and so, even
in the types of toys they use.

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:21.880
We heard that this morning.

01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:23.830
So, when you bring
this into the classroom

01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:26.790
and exposing everyone using
this spatial thinking,

01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:30.260
I think there is
a great potential,

01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:31.560
and there is a great potential

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:34.390
of having more females
interested in STEM fields

01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:35.690
and using this technology

01:55:35.690 --> 01:55:38.030
that maybe didn't have
access to it before.

01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:39.960
And you do have people
going and working just

01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:41.260
with Girl Scouts, right?

01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:43.420
Just with Boy Scouts, with 4-H,

01:55:43.420 --> 01:55:46.230
with people who maybe
didn't have access

01:55:46.230 --> 01:55:48.240
in their typical
classrooms before.

01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:50.550
But also, we're reaching
more students,

01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:54.060
and people are getting more
understanding of different uses

01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:56.300
of GIS, because it's
being used, again,

01:55:56.300 --> 01:55:59.120
not just a geography classes,
because there are actually a lot

01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:00.920
of those, unfortunately, right?

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:03.000
But it's being used
in history classrooms.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.970
It's being used in
environmental science.

01:56:04.970 --> 01:56:08.260
It's being used in
literature, as we've seen.

01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:11.180
So, it's our way of
sneaking spatial thinking

01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:12.480
and to all these topics.

01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:13.780
It's already there.

01:56:13.780 --> 01:56:15.360
Like it's already inherently
part of the discipline

01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:18.970
in these topics, but you don't
think of may be, typically,

01:56:18.970 --> 01:56:21.600
in a literature class, let's
do some online mapping.

01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:23.200
What? Aren't we going
to just talk

01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:24.840
about metaphors and symbology?

01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:29.260
You know, or even in music
or history, even though it's

01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:31.570
so spatially grounded
and located.

01:56:31.570 --> 01:56:33.810
So, the idea that
technology just doesn't belong

01:56:33.810 --> 01:56:35.110
in an engineering classroom,

01:56:35.110 --> 01:56:36.870
and it doesn't just
belong is people interested

01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:38.850
in a certain career
track, right?

01:56:38.850 --> 01:56:40.380
We can use it in all
these different ways,

01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:41.680
all these different subjects,

01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:43.600
with all different
types of students.

01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:45.820
So, I hope that addresses
your question.

01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:49.610
But yes, we very much hope
that we're contributing to that

01:56:49.610 --> 01:56:51.780
through this program and
through Esri's donation

01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:53.150
and more students
simply getting involved

01:56:53.150 --> 01:56:54.570
in this all different ways.

01:56:54.570 --> 01:56:56.740
So, thanks.

01:56:56.740 --> 01:56:58.320
&gt;&gt; Male: As a follow-up,
have you looked at that

01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:01.280
at all systematically, in
terms of the populations

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:03.160
that you serve [inaudible].

01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:05.340
&gt;&gt; Candice Luebbering: So, as
I mentioned in my presentation,

01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:08.980
reporting from our volunteers
is really difficult to get.

01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:11.010
Again, they're excited
to go do stuff,

01:57:11.010 --> 01:57:12.410
but they don't often
tell us about it.

01:57:12.410 --> 01:57:14.290
He'll tell us about
a year later,

01:57:14.290 --> 01:57:18.110
and we don't push too
hard to systematically try

01:57:18.110 --> 01:57:21.440
and plug our volunteers for
a lot of data and feedback,

01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:24.700
because our focus is really
on them having the energy

01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:26.140
and focusing on the
outreach component,

01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:27.840
because it really is
an outreach program,

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:30.650
but I do see our community is
there is this great potential

01:57:30.650 --> 01:57:32.390
to get involved with
them and learn from them

01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:35.830
and get more information about
the engagements they've done.

01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:37.380
We've done it more
with the case study.

01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:39.610
So, about 40 of those that are
online where people are talking

01:57:39.610 --> 01:57:41.190
about how many students
they work with

01:57:41.190 --> 01:57:42.860
and what did or didn't work?

01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:44.650
What was challenging
about the environment?

01:57:44.650 --> 01:57:47.030
The constrictions of time
or curriculum or that kind

01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:48.440
of thing, and feedback,

01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:49.820
individual feedback
from students.

01:57:49.820 --> 01:57:52.610
You know, stories, anecdotally,
of students who have taken off,

01:57:52.610 --> 01:57:54.280
who have gone and gotten an
internship, or have said,

01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:55.580
"I'm majoring in this now."

01:57:55.580 --> 01:57:57.180
Or now they're working with
the county GIS department,

01:57:57.180 --> 01:57:59.140
or something like that.

01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:01.290
So, because it's been
an outreach program,

01:58:01.290 --> 01:58:02.910
we haven't had that angle of it.

01:58:02.910 --> 01:58:04.550
I'd love to, and I think
the potential is there,

01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:06.840
because we have all
these volunteers to tap

01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:08.140
that kind of information from.

01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:09.540
But yeah, it's a great idea.

01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:11.130
Yep.

01:58:11.130 --> 01:58:13.400
&gt;&gt; Charlie Fitzpatrick: If
I can just add a little bit

01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:16.100
to one of those points.

01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:21.770
In the question about students'
engagement, there are a number

01:58:21.770 --> 01:58:24.880
of students that
have been tempted

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:28.330
to leave school whose
parents have said

01:58:28.330 --> 01:58:32.320
that my child is coming
to school because they get

01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:36.220
to be a part of this class,
and they get to do GIS.

01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:40.610
There are number of people
who have said this parent --

01:58:40.610 --> 01:58:43.050
teachers have talked with me
and said this parent came up

01:58:43.050 --> 01:58:45.500
and said this child
is staying in school,

01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:47.370
in order to take this class.

01:58:47.370 --> 01:58:52.550
Or this student now has
something to look forward to,

01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:55.390
a way to feel good about school.

01:58:55.390 --> 01:58:57.370
And so, there are a
number of students

01:58:57.370 --> 01:59:02.070
who have been feeling success in
ways that they've not been able

01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:04.770
to experience in
five or 10 years.

01:59:04.770 --> 01:59:06.820
There are number
of students, also,

01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:14.540
who are in various ways
special-needs students

01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:17.970
who have found tremendous
success working with GIS.

01:59:17.970 --> 01:59:22.040
So, there's a lot of ways
of thinking about how some

01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:27.120
of these additional exposures
can influence people's lives.

01:59:30.510 --> 02:00:36.500
[ Female Speaking off Mic ]

02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:42.290
&gt;&gt; Charlie Fitzpatrick: So,
standards, models, how are we,

02:00:42.290 --> 02:00:46.830
and I'll speak for Esri on
this, addressing the notion

02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:51.240
of meeting standards,
helping people cope

02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:56.510
with the ultimate flexible tool

02:00:56.510 --> 02:01:02.840
and less flexible
educational environment?

02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:08.190
The short answer is
we are a GIS company,

02:01:08.190 --> 02:01:10.380
not an education company.

02:01:10.380 --> 02:01:19.500
And so, as broadly applicable
as GIS is, as powerful as it is,

02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:24.350
we said we can't possibly
meet, the 2-1/2 of us

02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:28.630
on the K-12 team, can't
possibly meet the needs

02:01:28.630 --> 02:01:33.350
of the 50 million students
across the country.

02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:39.540
What we are trying to do is
to help educators recognize

02:01:39.540 --> 02:01:45.120
that they can use tools in
a lot of different ways.

02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:49.260
We have any number of situations

02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:53.260
where a really good
teacher working with GIS

02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:59.010
in this department is across
the hall from a teacher

02:01:59.010 --> 02:02:02.040
in the same department
who will not use GIS

02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:07.450
because the second teacher
says he or she needs to focus

02:02:07.450 --> 02:02:11.090
on the standards, even though
the first teacher says I'm using

02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:13.470
it to meet the standards.

02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:16.320
And so, there are all kinds
of situations that we run

02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:21.860
into where, you know, as the
Congressman was talking about.

02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:23.840
Standards are important.

02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:25.140
Standards are helpful.

02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:27.620
That's why we have
said are many of them,

02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:29.870
and it's always a
challenge to know

02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:31.520
which ones you're going to meet.

02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:34.230
There are a number of
people who say we can't look

02:02:34.230 --> 02:02:37.380
at geo inquiries, if they
don't have our state --

02:02:37.380 --> 02:02:39.720
we can even look at the document

02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:41.930
if it doesn't have
our state on it.

02:02:41.930 --> 02:02:45.520
If it has a national
standard, we can't use it.

02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:49.280
We can't. So, it's
really a challenge

02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:51.610
for the educational environment.

02:02:51.610 --> 02:02:55.740
One of the biggest pieces
that we have started

02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:58.830
to notice is a number of people

02:02:58.830 --> 02:03:04.560
who are saying we're feeling
empowered to be creative

02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:08.240
in the ways that
we meet standards,

02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:11.460
because there is no
one way to meet them,

02:03:11.460 --> 02:03:16.970
and GIS will adapt to do that.

&gt;&gt; Female: So, the question
was, and I'm going to repeat it

02:03:47.370 --> 02:03:51.560
for everyone, was has the
library, as an enterprise.

02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:53.310
I'm going to use that
term as an enterprise,

02:03:53.310 --> 02:03:54.740
because I think it's
a lot easier

02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:57.060
than to just say the
Geography and Map Division.

02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:59.570
Has the library itself
made a commitment

02:03:59.570 --> 02:04:04.830
to offering these type of
data sets and/or education

02:04:04.830 --> 02:04:06.130
for the public?

02:04:06.130 --> 02:04:07.880
Short answer is not yet.

02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:10.010
Long answer is where
we want to be.

02:04:10.010 --> 02:04:13.800
I think those of you,
especially, I know the two Mikes

02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:17.950
and the Butch as John referred
to them earlier and the Bebes,

02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:21.720
all know that we had to
build the architecture first,

02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:23.020
and we talked a little bit

02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:24.860
about the geospatial
hosting environment earlier.

02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:28.140
The architecture had to
come first, but I think back

02:04:28.140 --> 02:04:31.000
to the point, and I think that
both Candice and Charlie made,

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.500
and this is where I'm going
to tie it back to my speakers,

02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:36.110
is a talked about giving
the software to people,

02:04:36.110 --> 02:04:39.150
but giving the software
to people is not enough.

02:04:39.150 --> 02:04:41.270
Candice talked about
GeoMentoring,

02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:43.050
where you actually
have people coming in,

02:04:43.050 --> 02:04:45.950
even if it's just being an
advocate for using the software

02:04:45.950 --> 02:04:47.500
or exploring the possibilities

02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:49.850
of what the software
can do for you.

02:04:49.850 --> 02:04:51.400
I think Charlie talked
a little bit more

02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:53.440
about a more systematic program,

02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:55.970
where they actually
built lesson plans.

02:04:55.970 --> 02:04:58.480
They got people excited
about doing these activities.

02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:00.860
So, they wanted to go
onto the next phase,

02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:02.630
the next phase, and
the next phase.

02:05:02.630 --> 02:05:06.760
So, I think there's a lot of
planning before you can go

02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:10.040
to that step, and I think
we'd love to be part of it.

02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:13.190

there right now.

And I'll put on my hat

02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:18.920
in working with the teachers.

02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:23.840
I would say that what we
try and do with our team is

02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:27.410
to show the resources that the
library has in its collections

02:05:27.410 --> 02:05:29.930
and look at some of
the educational uses

02:05:29.930 --> 02:05:31.700
within those collections.

02:05:31.700 --> 02:05:34.990
So, if an initiative comes
out from the library.

02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:37.850
Just recently, as
a matter of fact,

02:05:37.850 --> 02:05:43.210
I think it was October 24th,
was the crowds.loc.gov,

02:05:43.210 --> 02:05:48.830
which is a crowdsourcing project
in looking at transcribing data

02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:53.660
from the handwritten documents,
and actually laying that out.

02:05:53.660 --> 02:05:56.200
And so, what we do is work with
educators throughout the country

02:05:56.200 --> 02:06:00.140
and showing them the resource
itself, how they implement it,

02:06:00.140 --> 02:06:03.690
and I think you got to that
really well, which is it's

02:06:03.690 --> 02:06:06.530
up to the teachers to be able
to see the educational value.

02:06:06.530 --> 02:06:07.830
We can't script it.

02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:12.300
We can prescribe it, but we
do show them the resources

02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:14.790
that are available to them.

02:06:14.790 --> 02:06:18.340
And I want to go back to the one
question about standards, too,

02:06:18.340 --> 02:06:21.350
and looking at the standards.

02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:25.080
The American Association

02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:29.340
of School Librarians just
released new informational

02:06:29.340 --> 02:06:34.420
literacy standards, and it's up
to states whether to incorporate

02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:37.800
that in different
curricula around the country,

02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:40.840
but there are advocates
out there who are looking

02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:45.050
at how you can look at
these types of literacy.

02:06:45.050 --> 02:06:48.480
AASL is definitely a
thought partner in that.

02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:51.430
National Science Teachers
Association is another partner.

02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:54.930
They have the next-generation
science standards,

02:06:54.930 --> 02:06:57.890
as well is ISTE is the
International Society

02:06:57.890 --> 02:06:59.310
for Technology and Education.

02:06:59.310 --> 02:07:02.140
So, there is that conversation.

02:07:02.140 --> 02:07:06.090
Where the confluence of that
meets, it definitely comes

02:07:06.090 --> 02:07:11.310
down to, in a lot of ways, comes
down to the individual states

02:07:11.310 --> 02:07:13.640
and then rolling out
through the district.

02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:15.890
So, I just wanted to throw
that in there, but we do work

02:07:15.890 --> 02:07:18.740
with those groups,
too, and taking a look

02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:21.690
at what those standards
are, so that we can add

02:07:21.690 --> 02:07:24.810
that to our vocabulary,
in terms of working

02:07:24.810 --> 02:07:27.630
with educators throughout
the country.

02:07:33.510 --> 02:09:27.210
[ Male Speaking off Mic ]

02:09:27.210 --> 02:09:29.460
&gt;&gt; Male: I actually just
want to offer a quick comment

02:09:29.460 --> 02:09:31.730
on the standards issue.

02:09:31.730 --> 02:09:36.250
Prior to coming to
Esri, I spent 15 years

02:09:36.250 --> 02:09:40.350
as a [speaking off mic], and
you know, we worked nonstop

02:09:40.350 --> 02:09:43.840
on the K-12 project,
and the thing to know

02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:45.530
about it is geography is one

02:09:45.530 --> 02:09:53.510
of nine core academic subjects
identified in the federal law

02:09:53.510 --> 02:10:01.010
under the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act,

02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:05.370
as the core subjects that
students should focus

02:10:05.370 --> 02:10:06.670
on [speaking off mic].

02:10:06.670 --> 02:10:07.970
But of course, we
live in a country

02:10:07.970 --> 02:10:12.710
where state standards are set
at the state and local level,

02:10:12.710 --> 02:10:14.830
and the federal government can
really only have an influence

02:10:14.830 --> 02:10:16.130
by making the states
follow the money.

02:10:16.130 --> 02:10:17.430
And even though geography
has always been a core

02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:18.730
academic subject.

02:10:18.730 --> 02:10:20.030
It never had any associated
funding authorization with it.

02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:21.630
But that changed in 2015

02:10:21.630 --> 02:10:24.220
when Congress passed the
Every Student Succeeds Act,

02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:27.420
and President Obama
signed it into law.

02:10:27.420 --> 02:10:30.500
For the first time, there
two dedicated authorizations

02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:35.200
in federal K-12 law dealing
with geography education.

02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:40.510
And so, hopefully, if Congress
redoes the K-12 law again,

02:10:40.510 --> 02:10:42.480
and those authorizations are
strengthened [speaking off mic]

02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:47.830
it's an opportunity for
geography to make more inroads

02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:52.430
in what we're doing in K-12
instruction around the country.

02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:55.810
So, you know, we need to tall
our local educators the stories

02:10:55.810 --> 02:11:02.160
about what, you know, GIS can do

02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:05.630
for students, for
spatial thinking.

02:11:05.630 --> 02:11:09.790
And, you know, we need to also
work with folks, you know,

02:11:09.790 --> 02:11:16.650
across the street here, so when
they do reauthorize a K-12 law

02:11:16.650 --> 02:11:17.950
again, and it's supposed

02:11:17.950 --> 02:11:19.600
to be potentially
considered next year.

02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:20.900
They need to think about
the importance, you know,

02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:22.200
what geography means in
workforce development.

02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:23.500
So, it's a multipronged
approach,

02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:24.800
and it's something that's
evolving and it's something

02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:26.180
that can really make an
impact on [speaking off mic].

02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:28.260
[ Female Speaking off Mic ]

02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:38.010
&gt;&gt; I feel very blessed from
those asking these questions,

02:11:38.010 --> 02:11:45.520
and I'm curious to know,
are there other GIS tools

02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:52.780
that schools are using outside
of Esri that you've come

02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:58.530
across in your work or
talking with educators,

02:11:58.530 --> 02:12:00.420
the ones that you use?

02:12:00.420 --> 02:12:01.720
I'm sorry.

02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:03.250
I love Esri and ArcGIS Online.

02:12:03.250 --> 02:12:06.730
I know you're the big player in
the field, and I'm just curious

02:12:06.730 --> 02:12:11.020
to know what else is going
on out there outside of Esri.

02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:12.320
&gt;&gt; Candice Luebbering: Sure.

02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:14.590
So, obviously, we have a
great partnership with Esri,

02:12:14.590 --> 02:12:19.870
and that uniform
software donation, really,

02:12:19.870 --> 02:12:23.540
is the launching pad and what
most people use, but and Esri,

02:12:23.540 --> 02:12:25.180
I believe, and Charlie
agrees, with the concept

02:12:25.180 --> 02:12:28.650
of GeoMentor is bigger
than that, right?

02:12:28.650 --> 02:12:32.450
It's about promoting
geography, spatial thinking,

02:12:32.450 --> 02:12:35.620
and getting more students
on board and expose

02:12:35.620 --> 02:12:37.940
that in any way, shape, or form.

02:12:37.940 --> 02:12:42.070
So, we also do encourage
our volunteers

02:12:42.070 --> 02:12:45.140
to use what they
know best, as well.

02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:50.370
What maybe classrooms
are already using

02:12:50.370 --> 02:12:53.940
and what there's interest in.

02:12:53.940 --> 02:12:58.520
So, it can be open source.

02:12:58.520 --> 02:12:59.820
It can be QGIS.

02:12:59.820 --> 02:13:01.420
So many apps, of
course, as well.

02:13:01.420 --> 02:13:03.930
So Mapilary.

02:13:03.930 --> 02:13:09.560
You know, and people are using
Map Box products and Leaflet.

02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:14.450
I mean, we encourage anything
and everything, because it's all

02:13:14.450 --> 02:13:17.020
about getting kids
mapping, right?

02:13:17.020 --> 02:13:19.370
It's getting kids
thinking spatially.

02:13:19.370 --> 02:13:22.430
And so, we're not
just promoting ArcGIS.

02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:25.750
We're promoting the
bigger concept

02:13:25.750 --> 02:13:29.460
and Esri's very forward
thinking and thinking that, too.

02:13:29.460 --> 02:13:31.850
So, yeah, definitely.

02:13:31.850 --> 02:13:35.180
There are a lot of other
things being implemented.

02:13:35.180 --> 02:13:37.060
&gt;&gt; Charlie Fitzpatrick:
I'll jump in on that also,

02:13:37.060 --> 02:13:40.000
just to say that the questions
that we get from people are --

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.890
there are people on the
Macintosh platform who want

02:13:41.890 --> 02:13:45.980
to do desktop GIS, and that's
not doable with Esri technology,

02:13:45.980 --> 02:13:48.860
except under virtualization.

02:13:48.860 --> 02:13:52.410
And so, there are a number
of people that we have seen,

02:13:52.410 --> 02:13:56.330
a number, less than 10 schools
that have talked with me

02:13:56.330 --> 02:13:58.340
about can they integrate
stuff that they do with QGIS?

02:13:58.340 --> 02:14:03.040
There are a number of people who
are working with Google as a way

02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:05.030
of getting started,
and we're comfortable

02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:06.330
with whatever it is
people want to do.

02:14:06.330 --> 02:14:07.630
What we generally, as
Candice was mentioning,

02:14:07.630 --> 02:14:08.930
what we generally find
that people are looking

02:14:08.930 --> 02:14:10.390
for is a package of resources
and a variety of opportunities.

02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:11.980
And so, given that people have
access to, in a school bundle,

02:14:11.980 --> 02:14:13.360
ArcGIS Online, Community
Analyst, ArcGIS Desktop,

02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:14.660
ArcMap, the suite of apps.

02:14:14.660 --> 02:14:15.960
Survey 1-2-3 and Collector are
the most commonly used ones,

02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:17.290
but additional kinds of apps
with the ArcGIS environment,

02:14:17.290 --> 02:14:19.970
and they can do it for free, has
been sufficient for most people.

[ Female Speaking off Mic ]

02:14:37.150 --> 02:14:40.040
&gt;&gt; Kathy Hart: Yeah, so, in
higher education, they're coming

02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:44.760
in with sometimes little and
sometimes more experience.

02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:49.200
I think the higher education
market is pretty well entrenched

02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:53.080
with Esri, but there's
a lot of people

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:56.400
in the higher education arena
that are doing a lot of coding.

02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:58.940
And so, they're doing
modifications

02:14:58.940 --> 02:15:00.240
and all sorts of things.

02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:02.900
So, there's a lot of
Esri in higher ed,

02:15:02.900 --> 02:15:09.250
but there's other open source
apps being developed, as well.

02:15:09.250 --> 02:15:11.550
So...

[ Female Speaking off Mic ]

02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:06.440
So, okay, so there's a lot
of A. There's a lot of arts.

02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:08.340
There's a lot of
humanities that are working

02:16:08.340 --> 02:16:11.440
with geospatial technologies.

02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:17.990
A large, large swath of scholars
in the humanities, history,

02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:22.650
archaeology, literature that
are using GIS, either Esri

02:16:22.650 --> 02:16:27.040
or any other resource, to really
understand their topic better.

02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:28.650
So, there's definitely
the STEAM,

02:16:28.650 --> 02:16:30.180
the humanities, everything.

02:16:30.180 --> 02:16:31.480
There's a lot going on.

02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:34.670
So, I encourage everyone
to think broadly.

02:16:34.670 --> 02:16:36.080
Today, we were talking STEM.

02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:37.380
That's kind of how
it was presented,

02:16:37.380 --> 02:16:39.810
but there's definitely a
lot of other topics, so...

02:16:39.810 --> 02:16:44.660
&gt;&gt; Kathleen McGuigan: I was
just going to say, I mean,

02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:46.580
one of the things we've
always been looking at it

02:16:46.580 --> 02:16:50.100
from the STEAM perspective here
at the Library of Congress,

02:16:50.100 --> 02:16:51.440
but one of the things

02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:54.360
that I keep hearing now
is the digital humanities.

02:16:54.360 --> 02:17:00.540
And it seems to be that is what
the field is moving towards,

02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:02.480
at least in the K-12.

02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:06.230
I mean STEM, STEM, STEM has been
out there for a very long time,

02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:08.250
and then STEAM came
in, you know,

02:17:08.250 --> 02:17:10.890
at least from the K-12 area.

02:17:10.890 --> 02:17:14.870
And now, you hear a lot
about the digital humanities,

02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:17.630
and you're absolutely right.

02:17:17.630 --> 02:17:21.600
DC has a lot of codewords, yeah.

02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:24.110
&gt;&gt; Charlie Fitzpatrick: And
I'll add to that that one

02:17:24.110 --> 02:17:28.210
of the things that happened is
with the rise of story maps,

02:17:28.210 --> 02:17:30.070
we had, prior to that point,

02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:34.420
we had a hard time
getting English teachers,

02:17:34.420 --> 02:17:37.180
in particular, engaged with GIS.

02:17:37.180 --> 02:17:40.760
But as soon as story
maps came out,

02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:42.650
English teacher started
paying attention

02:17:42.650 --> 02:17:46.200
and asking us questions, and
what was happening even more is

02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:49.230
that the science and the social
studies teachers were saying,

02:17:49.230 --> 02:17:50.530
my God.

02:17:50.530 --> 02:17:54.000

better communication skills.

Who do we turn to?

02:17:57.630 --> 02:18:00.180

you met your neighbors?

Getting people to engage with
others in the disciplines.

to get people to recognize

that with GIS, you're going
to be covering everything,

02:18:11.070 --> 02:18:12.940

and here the Library of Congress
and in other institutions.

02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:05.550
So, just a couple things to
wrap up our morning session.

02:19:05.550 --> 02:19:09.300
First off, coming off of
what Charlie had mentioned

02:19:09.300 --> 02:19:10.740
about story maps.

02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:13.910
So, the Library of Congress,
if you have not heard yet,

02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:16.670
has been making our own
story maps for little while.

02:19:16.670 --> 02:19:19.270
So, that sort of represents
one of our frontward --

02:19:19.270 --> 02:19:23.340
currently frontward-facing
applications of GIS technology

02:19:23.340 --> 02:19:24.950
and getting into
web applications.

02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:27.760
So, in case you haven't
heard of it before and want

02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:33.940
to check them out, if you
go to LOC.gov/storymaps,

02:19:33.940 --> 02:19:38.840
we have about seven or
eight published so far,

02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:42.000
and this represents
different projects

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:46.490
that have been implemented
from subject matter experts

02:19:46.490 --> 02:19:47.790
from across the library.

02:19:47.790 --> 02:19:49.750
So, Prints and Photographs
Division, Geography

02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:52.430
and Map Division, and
plenty of other divisions

02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:55.520
across the library that are
showcasing different collections

02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:58.020
of the library and
using interactive maps

02:19:58.020 --> 02:19:59.320
to tell that story.

02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:04.020
So, not only do you have the
interactive maps that sort

02:20:04.020 --> 02:20:07.640
of dive you into the data
surrounding that collection,

02:20:07.640 --> 02:20:10.640
but there are also collection
items like photos and maps

02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:14.790
that -- or static maps that
illustrate those collections,

02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:17.150
and they really bring
them to life.

02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:21.110
So, I think that they're really,
really fascinating items,

02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:23.090
and you should definitely
check them out.

02:20:23.090 --> 02:20:25.860
It's LOC.gov/storymaps.

02:20:25.860 --> 02:20:29.690
And so, aside from that, thank
you very much for coming.

02:20:29.690 --> 02:20:32.870
We really appreciate you
guys joining us this morning

02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:36.310
and learning about GIS and sort
of celebrating GIS Day with us.

02:20:36.310 --> 02:20:38.510
So, thank you very much.

02:20:38.510 --> 02:20:42.500
