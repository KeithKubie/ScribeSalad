00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.310
Now let's find that horizontal asymptote. Remember what we found as the answer

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.222
to our division problem in the last quiz? What that gives us is another way to

00:00:08.222 --> 00:00:12.820
write the rational function we have here. Think about what happens as x gets

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.429
really, really big to the value of the function. That should tell you the

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.159
horizontal asymptote. Remember that this should be the equation of some

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:22.400
horizontal line.
