00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
So a few months ago, I was at a wrap party.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.760
Like when you finish filming a project and everyone gets together to celebrate

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.600
the fact that it's over and it's done and we're all unemployed again.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.540
To another existential crisis that we will never be hired again and we'll be realized as the frauds that we secretly believe we are.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.660
To another existential crisis that we will never be hired again and we'll be realized as the frauds that we secretly believe we are.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.220
*Clink*

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.900
Anyway, I was at this party

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.920
and you know how parties go.  You get into different conversations with people

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.280
some you know, some are strangers.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.880
Hi.  I'm Mikey.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.360
Oh hi, Anna.  Nice to meet you.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.460
Cool.  Haha.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.540
Five minutes into the conversation, he said

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.700
Oh cool, my girlfriend and I have a puppy.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.440
Shut up!

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.900
And I felt this immediate and huge sense of relief.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.840
And I realized that the entire time we were talking I had been doing this balancing act of trying to be friendly

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.560
but not too friendly so I wasn't leading him on

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.340
but also not trying to be a bitch.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.980
And when he finally told me that he had a girlfriend I was like ah, I can just be myself now.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.320
What?  Shut up.  Show me.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.260
I've got a video.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.500
Awwwwww!

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.680
And I started thinking, you know, some guys probably don't even realize that we have to go through this.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.140
Like a couple of weeks ago, this guy approached me in a parking lot.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.980
Hey!  Hey!  Excuse me!

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.560
Yes?

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.200
Hey, I was wondering if you wanted to go get coffee.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.020
Oh, I'm in a relationship but thank you.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.220
Yeah.  No problem.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.000
That's probably how he remembers it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.940
If he remembers it at all.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.220
But do you want to know how I remember it?

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.120
Hey!

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.660
Y-yes?

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.020
Stay calm.  Inhale lots of air in case you have to scream.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.260
Go for the eyes and balls.  Don't forget to bite--the jaw is the strongest muscle you've got.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.700
Shit--where's my phone?  Maybe I can have my fingers on 911.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.980
Let's get coffee.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.960
Oh.  Oh my God.  Thank God.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.740
Why did he run at me in an empty parking lot at night?

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.340
Jesus, that was scary.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.740
Uh, I'm in a relationship but thank you.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.340
Oh my God, why isn't he saying anything?

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.000
Why is he just staring at me?  Oh my God.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.820
Why are you just staring at me?  Oh my God!

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.260
Fine.  No problem.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.400
Yup.  You know, there's a study done awhile ago

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.200
that sums it up perfectly.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.400
Men are most afraid that women will laugh at them.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.680
Women are most afraid that men will kill them.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.860
So the next time you think that women are a little bit complicated, remember we see the world through very different perspectives.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.520
And who knows?  Maybe that guy actually thought

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.340
Hi!  Uhm.  Be brave Mike.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.280
You can do this.  You can do this.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.800
I was wondering--you can completely say no, it will be totally fine--

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.440
Uhm.  She's just a girl.  She's not that scary at all.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.180
Do you want to go get coffee sometime?

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.500
No!!!!!!!!!

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.520
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.560
This is Beetle.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.600
Oh my God, he's purring.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.280
Oh my God.  I want to say thank you so much to my BFF Audible for sponsoring today's video!

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.220
Oh my God you guys!  Thank you!

Audible has an unmatched selection of audiobooks, original audio shows, news, comedy, and so much more you guys!

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.120
Right now, I'm listening to "The Name of The Wind."

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.040
Because Game of Thrones left like a gaping hole right here in my heart and I need to fill it with some more Fantasy.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.100
And my favorite, because I live in L.A., is I get to listen to Audible whenever I get stuck in traffic or whenever I'm doing laundry

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.340
or whenever my eyes are full but I really want to fill my ears.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.780
