<i> Susan Kim is the owner </i>

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:04.404
<i> of Elizabeth Albert,
 a boutique that sells</i>

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:07.373
<i> some of the top women's
 fashions on the Burbank strip.</i>

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:10.109
<i> But lately, she's noticed
 that sales have taken a dip.</i>

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:11.377 line:0%
- People are buying less,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.246 line:0%
or they're really tightening
their belt.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.048
<i> - It could be because,
 in a neighborhood</i>

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:17.183
<i> populated largely
 by young couples,</i>

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:20.153
<i> Susan was forgetting
 all about the men.</i>

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:21.221
<i> So I paid her a visit
 with a way</i>

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.189
<i> to keep couples happy
 in her store.</i>

00:00:23.222 --> 00:00:25.725 align:end position:100%
To be honest with you,
as a guy,

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:27.293 size:88% position:56%
this store is pretty boring.

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:28.661 align:start position:0%
- 'Cause it's
a women's store.

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:30.463
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:32.799 align:end position:100%
- So, if I came in here
with my girlfriend,

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:34.167
hypothetically speaking--
- Mm-hmm.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.369 align:start size:59% position:41%
- I don't have a--
have a girlfriend--

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:39.072 align:start size:31% position:69%
um, but...

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.474 align:end position:100%
you know, I think
I'd be nagging her to leave.

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:45.178 align:start position:0%
- 'Cause men
don't like to spend time

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.647 align:start position:0%
in a women's clothing store
anyway.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.282
<i> - Until now.</i>

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:51.317
<i> You see,
 when a guy has nothing to do,</i>

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.719
<i> the woman he's with
 feels a psychological pressure</i>

00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:55.621
<i> to leave,
 which will often keep her</i>

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:57.690
<i> from staying longer
 and buying more stuff.</i>

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:02.695
<i> A dedicated Man Zone
 where guys can chill and relax</i>

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:04.063
<i> while the women shop.</i>

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:07.033 align:start position:0%
- That's--
sure, that makes sense.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.234 align:end position:100%
- I mean, trust me,
I know guys.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.336 align:end position:100%
All we need
is a beer in our hand

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.472 align:end position:100%
and a bro by our side,
and we are out of the way.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:15.741 align:start position:0%
- I never--
I've, in fact, never heard

00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:17.376 align:start position:0%
any guy saying that.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.047 align:start position:0%
"If I had a brew
and a bro, I'm fine."

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.715 align:end position:100%
- I totally hear you,
but leave it to me

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:24.317 align:start size:56% position:44%
for the guy stuff.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.718 align:start size:28% position:72%
Trust me.

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:27.353 align:start position:0%
- Okay.

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:29.422
<i> - Susan was on board,
 and we decided</i>

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:32.158
<i> that her back storage area
 would be the perfect spot</i>

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:33.626
<i> for the new Man Zone.</i>

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.828
<i> So the next day,
 I had my team bring in</i>

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.164
<i> all the essentials
 to make this room</i>

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:41.400
<i> the ultimate hangout den
 for guys.</i>

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:43.269
<i> And once everything
 was in its place,</i>

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:45.738
<i> all we had to do was wait
for the first couple to come in</i>

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.640
<i> to see if my Man Zone
 would work.</i>

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:49.275 align:start size:69% position:31%
Just so you guys know,

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:51.744 align:start size:66% position:34%
Elizabeth Albert has
a dedicated Man Zone,

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:53.679 align:end position:100%
so that means
while the lady shops,

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:55.481 align:start size:50% position:50%
you have a place
you can hang out

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:56.716 align:end position:100%
that's both comfortable
and geared

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.451
towards your masculine needs.

00:01:58.484 --> 00:01:59.285
[both laugh]

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:01.053 align:end position:100%
So, if you wanna
come hang out there

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:02.155 align:end position:100%
and let--
give her time to shop--

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.156 align:end position:100%
You want?
It's up to you.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.757
- You do that, okay?
- Yeah.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.692 align:end position:100%
- Don't leave this, uh,
bro hangin', dawg.

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:08.194
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:09.795 align:end position:100%
- Great, and we'll be having fun
in there,

00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:10.796 align:end position:100%
so take as much time
as you need.

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.099
- All right, thank you.
- Yeah, no problem.

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:15.034
<i> I knew it wouldn't be
 too much of a challenge</i>

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:16.335
<i> to lure guys into the Zone,</i>

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.272
<i> and once they saw it had
 everything a guy could want,</i>

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.674
<i> I was hopeful
 they wouldn't want to leave.</i>

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:23.176
Free at last,
free at last, huh?

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:27.113 align:end position:100%
I mean,
do you feel free?

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:28.615 align:start position:0%
- Yeah.

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.418
<i> - Things were off
 to a good start.</i>

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:34.620
<i> The guy's girlfriend
 was leisurely shopping,</i>

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:35.621
<i> while back in the Zone...</i>

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:38.124 align:start size:81% position:19%
You know what I feel like?

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.792 align:start size:66% position:34%
A mother-effin' beer.

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:43.529
<i> It was just boys being boys...</i>

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:45.198 align:start size:34% position:66%
Nice catch.

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:47.400
<i> Just two dudes doing
 what guys do best...</i>

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.202 align:start size:50% position:50%
Crack that shit.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:51.137
<i> Hanging out,
 grabbing a brewski,</i>

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.738
<i> and watching
 royalty-free football.</i>

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.074 align:start size:28% position:72%
Oh, yeah.

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:57.310 align:end position:100%
Tampa Bay Bandits
versus Houston Gamblers.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.045 align:start size:19% position:81%
Enjoy.

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:03.482 align:start size:56% position:44%
Big tackle coming.

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:05.218 align:start size:38% position:63%
There we go.

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:06.686
<i> I thought
 he was having a good time,</i>

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.355
<i> but then,
 something bad happened.</i>

00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:10.523 align:start position:0%
- I'ma go.
I'ma head out.

00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:12.024 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Okay.

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:13.359
<i> The guy decided
 to leave the Zone</i>

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:16.562
<i> and go back to his girlfriend
 after only four minutes.</i>

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:20.433
<i> And even worse, moments later,
 they left the shop entirely.</i>

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.635
<i> This was not
 what I had promised Susan.</i>

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:25.338
<i> I worried that if I lost
 another guy that quickly,</i>

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.206
<i> there would be
 no winning her back.</i>

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.741
<i> So when the next couple
 came in,</i>

00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:30.376
<i> I had to somehow
 figure out a way</i>

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.278
<i> to keep the guy
 chilling for longer,</i>

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:34.514
<i> or else my Man Zone
 didn't stand a chance.</i>

00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:36.081 align:end position:100%
- You know
what I feel like?

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:39.218
- Oh, yeah?
- A mother-effin' beer.

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:41.754 align:start size:34% position:66%
Oop. Sorry.

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:43.289 align:end position:100%
Just meant to do
a little move.

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:44.490
- Okay. Oh, cool.
- There you go, man.

00:03:44.523 --> 00:03:46.259
- I appreciate it, bro.
- Enjoy.

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:49.128
<i>So far, things were working out
 with my second guy...</i>

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:50.196
- That's not good.

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.330 align:start size:59% position:41%
- Gotta let it set.

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:54.200
<i> As he was relaxed
 and enjoying his beer.</i>

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:56.335
<i> But when I put on
 football again,</i>

00:03:56.368 --> 00:03:59.171
<i> for some reason,
this guy wasn't into it either.</i>

00:03:59.204 --> 00:04:00.506 align:end position:100%
Great touchdown celebration
coming up.

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:04.110 align:start size:69% position:31%
Love that celebration.

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:07.246
<i> Just a few minutes in, I could
 tell I was losing him quick.</i>

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.715
<i> And with his girlfriend
 just starting to shop,</i>

00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:12.518
<i> I desperately needed
 to turn things around.</i>

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:15.187
<i> But that's when I realized
 I hadn't yet bro'd down</i>

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.791
<i> about the one thing
 that's on every guy's mind.</i>

00:04:18.824 --> 00:04:20.059 align:end position:100%
You know what I like
more than anything?

00:04:20.092 --> 00:04:22.128
- What?
- Sex.

00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:23.329 align:start position:0%
- Se--oh, yeah.
Hell yeah, man.

00:04:23.362 --> 00:04:24.263 align:end size:59% position:59%
You can never get
too much sex, man.

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:26.332
- Yeah, exactly.
- Never too much sex, bro.

00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:27.733
Oh, yeah.
- Definitely, definitely.

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:31.337 align:start position:0%
- Oh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.774 align:end position:100%
- What's your favorite,
uh, posish?

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:36.442
- From the back.
- Hmm?

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:38.277 align:start position:0%
- From the back, yeah.
From behind, yeah.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.313
- Oh, nice.
- Straight damage, bro.

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:41.714
- Mine's missionary.
- Missionary?

00:04:41.747 --> 00:04:43.149
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:45.584 align:end position:100%
- Guy on top,
girl on the bottom.

00:04:45.617 --> 00:04:47.253 align:start position:0%
- There you go.
Nothing's wrong with that, man.

00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:48.721 size:81% position:41%
Nothing's wrong with that.

00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:50.556
<i> - The sex talk was working,</i>

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:52.825
<i> and the guy was loving
 every minute of it.</i>

00:04:52.858 --> 00:04:53.726 align:start size:78% position:22%
Bareback or use a condom?

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.328 align:end size:66% position:66%
- Oh, bareback, man.
I love the feeling.

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.395
- Only way.
- All the way, bro.

00:04:56.428 --> 00:04:57.797
- Only way.
- Only way.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.131 align:end position:100%
- It feels much--so much better
without a condom,

00:04:59.164 --> 00:05:00.066 align:start size:66% position:34%
you know what I mean?

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
- Aw, hell,
definitely, dude.

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:02.568 align:end position:100%
- It's like so much stuff
these days, it's like,

00:05:02.601 --> 00:05:04.337 align:end position:100%
"Oh, you gotta use protection,"
all this stuff.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.771
- Absolutely, absolutely.
- But, like, whatever.

00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:06.672 align:end position:100%
You pull out,
you're fine, right?

00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:08.607 align:start position:0%
- Absolute--
as long as you pull out, man.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.242
- As long as you pull out.
- That's the key.

00:05:10.275 --> 00:05:13.045
- Gotta pull out.
- Have to pull out, bro.

00:05:13.078 --> 00:05:14.313
You have to.
- Sometimes I get close.

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:15.514
You know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah, like, "Whoo!"

00:05:15.547 --> 00:05:16.749
Almost got me right there!
- Sometimes I get real close!

00:05:16.782 --> 00:05:18.551
[both laugh]
Yeah!

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:19.585
- Exactly, bro.
- Yeah.

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:21.153
<i> I did it.</i>

I just like to see everything,
man, you know.

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:37.803 align:start position:0%
You can't--

when they're alone.

00:05:57.656 --> 00:05:59.558 align:end position:100%
- I don't care what they do

in there drinking beer.

00:06:02.094 --> 00:06:03.629

00:06:03.662 --> 00:06:06.065

 now had a place</i>

00:06:06.098 --> 00:06:08.000

 could be themselves.</i>

- There have been times

00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:17.743 size:84% position:42%
it's pretty much the only
position that works for me.

00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:19.042 align:start size:59% position:41%
- That makes sense.
