00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.680
[Trace]Gotta get ready.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.479
That hole in the ozone layer you know that's
some serious stuff.

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.960
[Julian] Hey that's not a thing anymore
[Trace] WHAT?

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.960
IT'S GONE?!

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.360
Howdy chlorofriendocarbons, you've found your
way to DNews, thanks for that!

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.360
Welcome!

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.360
I'm Trace.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.280
If you are a Millennial, you've probably spent
your whole life hearing about the "hole" in

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.660
the ozone layer.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.500
Before you can understand the hole, though,
you gotta know what the ozone layer is.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.580
The ozone layer isn't really its own thing,
instead 90 percent ozone floats around the

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.190
stratosphere: about 6 to 30 miles above our
heads.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.510
Ozone is three oxygen atoms linked together1,3,
Oh-three.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.070
When in the stratosphere, ozone absorbs harmful
UV-B radiation, protecting us and other life

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.260
here on the ground (in the troposphere).

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.000
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
people were just beginning to harness the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.190
power of refrigeration using toxic gasses
like ammonia, methyl chloride, and sulfur

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.190
dioxide.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.219
In 1928, an enterprising inventor at General
Motors created a non-toxic chemical for refrigeration

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.140
called CFC -- chlorofluorocarbon.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.750
It was patented as Freon by DuPont, and sold
in air conditioners, fridges, bug sprays,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.409
spray paints, hair conditioners, and healthcare
products.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.490
At it's peak companies were making a million
metric tons of CFCs every year.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.680
Then, in a 1974 study in Nature found this
great nontoxic refrigerant was wreaking havoc

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.680
on the atmospheric ozone layer.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.049
Sure, at sea level, CFCs are nontoxic and
safe for humans, but if they get into the

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.010
upper atmosphere, they're subject to photodissociation:
where UV radiation breaks a Chlorine atom

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.500
off the CFC!

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.750
If that free chlorine finds a molecule of
ozone (O-three) it will react with it, destroying

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.320
the ozone by ripping off one of its oxygen
atoms to make Chlorine Monoxide, leaving regular

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.820
old O2, or oxygen, in its wake.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.009
Then the Chlorine Monoxide gets hit by UV
and broke up again… so it has to find another

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.829
O3 molecule to stabilize it…and the cycle
repeats itself.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:47.829
It's bad.

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.229
In 1977, we were studying the ozone layer
and it was fine.

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.880
By 1981, there were hints something was amiss.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.470
Then in 1984, scientists suddenly registered
a giant hole in the ozone layer.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.320
They published their findings and in 1987,
the Montreal Protocol was signed, beginning

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.280
the phasing out CFCs shortly thereafter.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.879
Meanwhile even though the house was clearly
on fire, Du Pont and other companies insisted

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.430
everything was fineand fought tooth and nail
to keep CFCs legal.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.709
But they finally relented after scientific
evidence became indisputable.

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.700
A looming environmental disaster that pitted
corporations against the scientific community…

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.379
where have I heard that before?

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.809
Though CFCs can hide in the atmosphere for
40 to 150 years, without the emission of new

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:33.609
CFCs, eventually that free chlorine cycle
will stop.

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:38.309
If the chlorine runs into some methane 
up there, it would break it up forming hydrogen

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.680
chloride  which is stable enough to rain
down to Earth.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.299
In 2015, about 30 years after the Protocol
was signed, the ozone hole reached the largest

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.749
size EVER.

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:51.340
But since that peak (due mostly to volcanic
eruptions that sprew bromine, another Ozone

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.189
depleting gas), scientists have finally started
to see the ozone layer repair itself!

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.199
A study published in Science this year found
the hole had decreased in size from the year

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:04.609
2000, and most of that decrease was specifically
because of the Montreal Protocol!!

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.150
International Policy, for the win!

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.199
Without the chlorine wafting up into the stratosphere,
ozone was able to form naturally -- when UV

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:15.900
light breaks up regular old oxygen from O2
into O3.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.549
Without the chlorine to mess it up, this process
could restart!

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.939
It can still be messed up by volcanic eruptions,
but overall without our meddling, the ozone

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.870
layer may someday be back to normal!

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.639
Based on this new study, the Ozone layer might
be back to 1980 levels by 2040!

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.939
You can actually see how the Ozone layer is
doing right now, on NASA's website!

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.780
We'll put the link in the description for
you.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.249
Of course, this is science, so we can't have
all happy endings.

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:44.279
We still need AC and fridges, and the replacement
gas, HFCs, are a potent greenhouse gas.

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:46.569
So now, global warming is a concern.

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:47.569
Sigh.

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:48.599
We can never win.

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.659
But hey, at least that thing we fought for
as kids is getting better, right?

00:03:52.659 --> 00:04:25.759
But...why is there air in the first place?
