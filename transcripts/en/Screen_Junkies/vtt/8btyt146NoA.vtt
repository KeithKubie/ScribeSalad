00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.000
What's going on guys!

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.120
Mother's Day, it's coming up

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.860
And here at Screen Junkies we have a semi-annual Mother's Day tradition

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.920
Where I watch an inappropriate movie with my mother

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.180
A movie you wouldn't want to watch with your parents

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.840
Ah, the previous ones:

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.020
The Human Centipede

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.700
Uh oh

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.280
Fifty Shades of Grey

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.920
Wow

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.500
Exercise Room

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.880
Um, you could call it that

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.220
And today, to continue that tradition

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.600
We have my mom Deborah Rudnick

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.840
Mom, thanks for being here

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.160
I'm very happy to be here, but I'm not very happy to watch an inappropriate

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.600
I was hoping it would be more like a Disney film

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.080
Well FYI this ain't no Disney film

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.940
We are gonna watch...the next installment of the Fifty Shades series

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.040
Let's embark on a journey into Fifty Shades Darker

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.900
Well that's a nice scene you see the world coming up

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.620
That's just the Universal Pictures logo

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.040
Ha ha....oh she caught him looking

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.740
Caught looking

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.260
You ever get caught looking?

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.880
That's not my problem

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.140
Yeah, I try, I take a peek once in a while

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.320
You know I I I I definitely

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.420
Once in a while? You kidding you hit on two women yesterday

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.660
In front of your mother

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.580
No strings attached

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.520
That's all it took for her to agree?

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.640
He gave her a gift

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.140
Yeah, whats...

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.600
I thought he was bringing a pizza

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.320
Oh it's a bar around the corner

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.760
You should come

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.060
Have you ever heard the expression don't s*** where you eat?

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.280
Do you have to talk like that to me? That's vulger Hal

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.180
Sorry, don't s*** where you work

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.980
Is that better?

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.220
As the clothes come off

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.520
The soundtrack goes up

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.360
Oh boy

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.560
Oh my goodness

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.360
Oh my god!

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.720
And he leaves his pants half on?

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.500
Yeah he didn't even uh...he didn't even have time to take his pants off

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.060
And there we go

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.020
Oh there they must have taken them off somewhere

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.280
Kinky f***ery

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.620
I don't know what that is but I like the sound of it

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.080
What was that phrase mom?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.960
I didn't..catch that

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.300
Kinky f***ery

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.000
Oh kinky f*** kinky

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.780
Yeah well he is kinky alright

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.300
Well they keep the camera high at least

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.320
That lipstick?

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.860
Yes

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.920
She's playing connect the dots with his cigarette burns

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.940
Oh that's what that is

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.220
Wouldn't it be cool if like she connected all the dots and it turned out to be a picture of a giraffe?

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.600
How am I supposed to wear those?

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.080
Well

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.840
You have to get them wet first

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.780
Mom what is happening?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.960
I have no idea?

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.580
Oh my god

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.860
Mom can you tell the viewing public what just happened?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.320
Something crazy is happening here

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.740
Oh he is smacking her

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.260
Yup

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.040
Oh gotta shut your ringer off mom

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.700
I'm sorry

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.940
Man

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.340
Good thing we are not in the movie theatre

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.020
Keep this part in

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.060
This is a public service

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.000
Kids

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.420
Shut your phone and ringer

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.720
Here is one thing I'm learning

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.420
Fifty Shades Darker is a good movie to check your phone in

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.920
Leave it on vibrate for the show

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.660
Now we are back...surprised he leaves the door open to that

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.160
Yeah

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.420
That should be like you need a retinal scan to get in that room

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.080
Do you know what a retinal scan is?

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.480
Well....I don't even want to think about that

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.140
No, its...there's nothing

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.420
Oh the retinal, oh the eye

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.120
The retinal scan

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.360
That's an eye scan yeah

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.320
What did you think I was talking about?

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.380
I'm not gonna.....

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.000
Like the...like in the uh

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.320
No no no no no

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.040
Like in the rear end or something

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.940
What's this?

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.600
Does he manufacture these things?

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.020
No, I think he just buys them

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.460
Just goes on Amazon and buys them

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.360
Tying her up like Hannibal Lectre

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.980
Maybe he's gonna hang her

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.860
From someplace

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.780
Oh, may...oh!

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.240
Special extender bar

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.720
That's not gonna be too good with arthritis

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.240
Oh look at this!

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.780
Wow! Oh my god

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.240
What he do huh?

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.720
Gave her a real twist

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.220
Yeah

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.920
He, used that thing like a steering wheel

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.680
Aye aye aye

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.560
Man he must have had a f***ed up childhood

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.760
Ill kill him

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.020
No no please don't go don't go don't leave

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.280
Please go in there

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.300
Please go in there so we can get like the first...legit action of this movie

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.960
Don't, don't go fight on my behalf, great!

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.420
OH and they cut away without seeing that f***ing guy get his a** kicked

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.340
Sorry mom for the language but

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.580
Like I thought we were about to see some...like...one cool thing

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.940
So her boss got fired and now she is.....

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.540
She's the head of the company

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.720
She's the head of the.....

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.100
He bought her a company right

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.060
Must be nice

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.600
Fire the the lecherous a-hole

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.860
But get someone who is qualified

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.820
Well what does he care?

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.380
He, he is so wealthy

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.060
HE doesn't care but I care

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.200
Don't get so upset Hal

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.440
I'm very upset about....about the wellbeing of this publishing house

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.840
This company is going to Hell in a hand basket

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.840
And it's all that god damn pompous billionaire Christian Grey's fault

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.180
And now she is taking her underwear off at the dinner table

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.180
In the middle of a restaurant?

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.740
Great! In the middle of a restaurant

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.800
No Christian!

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.560
This movie would have been a hundred times better if she had put a bullet in Christian Grey right there

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.720
I get off on punishing women, women who look like you

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.220
Like your mother

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.700
What if I had that problem?

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.480
Do you?

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.720
I don't know?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.040
Thankfully no!

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.800
When were you going to tell me about your birthday?

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.680
He asked her to marry him

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.020
And she doesn't even know when his birthday is!

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.740
I feel like his beard just got thicker over the course of this scene

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.340
It did

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.220
Yeah

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.520
That's ridiculous

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.800
He has a full beard!

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.660
And the, and the scene before he had no beard

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.760
Uh oh, Christian Grey is going down!

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.620
And I don't mean on Anastasia

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.820
He's landing it

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.000
The perfect man make the perfect landing

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.940
We'll see

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.360
Uh oh!

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.020
"Sources tell us their helicopter..."

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.220
What the hell are you all doing here?

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.180
Great

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.960
The most boring result

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.080
Look he is fine

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.120
He is looking into bondage

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.740
She sure she wants to do this?

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.620
Take that yes back and put a no

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.980
Yeah she already signed the contract

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.000
He's tying her up now she's gonna she the worst of the worst that's what she's getting herself into

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.500
I guess so

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.500
She has oil on her bosoms mother!

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.480
He's a licenced masseuse

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.980
Uh...throw down!

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.140
Marcia Gay Harden and Kim Basinger please exchange blows

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.140
Nothing really happens in this movie

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:09.640
No

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.100
It's like euh

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.560
It's just a series of random nonsense

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.000
There is like a..threatening boss, he gets taken care of

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.340
There's his ex who's kind of stalkery she gets taken care of

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.000
He has a helicopter crash

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.040
Everything's fine

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.840
It's like inconsequential nonsense

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.220
Wow!

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.360
We introduced a conflict literally in the last minute of the movie

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.480
To set up

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:41.860
A third movie

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.240
That no one wants

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.560
How boring can you get

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.340
That was Fifty Shades Darker

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.620
What was your review of the movie mom?

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:52.740
Boring!

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.440
I have to agree

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:56.960
Um

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.220
It didn't go anyplace

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.020
It just like

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.200
There was, there was no real action

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.560
Even sexy scenes weren't really sexy

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.380
No the sex scenes weren't that sexy

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.880
Too much boredom before...I don't know

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.300
It just wasn't realistic

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.880
Here's the thing

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.660
Like...if you're making this sexy movie and you're not making me uncomfortable sitting here with my mom

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.120
You're doing something poorly

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.040
We might end up watching the third one right here

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.800
Uhhhhhhh no I think you better bring something more than popcorn

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.620
