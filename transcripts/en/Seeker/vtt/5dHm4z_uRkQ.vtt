00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.710
There’s a robot about to complete a marathon
on Mars!

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.579
The finishing line could be hiding some of
the most exciting science yet.

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:11.780
Hello!

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.820
I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer for Discovery
News.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.550
I want to focus on an awesome little NASA
robot that has become an extraterrestrial

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.400
off-roading champion.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.840
Already a Solar System distance record holder
-- after beating the 1972 driving record held

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.070
by the Soviet Lunokhod 2 moon rover last year
-- NASA’s Mars rover Opportunity is about

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.750
to reach its next big milestone.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.579
Since landing on Mars it has traversed over
26 miles of Martian terrain.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.980
When it reaches 26.219 miles, it will have
roved the equivalent distance of an Olympic

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.980
marathon.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.749
Opportunity landed on Mars on January 26,
2004, and was designed to last only 3 months.

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:49.640
But 11 years later, the rover is still soldiering
on.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.409
Although it’s having some age-related illnesses,
it’s showing little sign of slowing down.

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:59.739
Sadly, its sister rover Spirit, which landed
on the other side of Mars in 2004, was lost

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.550
in 2010 after becoming stuck in a sand trap.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.260
Although Opportunity continues to do amazing
science in the harsh alien environment, some

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.160
of its instrumentation is failing.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.420
Most recently, it has been afflicted with
some serious memory problems.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.080
Opportunity’s computer was never designed
to be used for this long, so a section of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.650
the robot’s flash memory has become corrupt.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.720
This causes all kinds of operational issues.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.950
Data keeps getting lost and unexpected reboots
have hindered its progress.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.070
But Opportunity’s mission team have now
switched the rover to a “no-flash” mode

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.830
- This is where the day-to-day science data
is uplinked to NASA’s Mars Odyssey and Mars

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.560
Reconnaissance Orbiter satellites.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.960
The data is then sent to Earth without being
saved to the flash memory before the rover

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.530
powers down each night.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.390
Over the coming weeks, NASA engineers hope
to send new software up to the rover’s computer

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.110
in an effort to fix this memory issue.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.960
But for now, Opportunity is doing what it
does best -- conquering Mars.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.100
Opportunity will likely cross the marathon
“finishing line” over the coming days

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.450
at a location nicknamed “Marathon Valley.”

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.800
Orbital images of the region has revealed
that Marathon Valley contains interesting

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.580
clay deposits that Opportunity will be tasked
to study.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.390
At the entrance to the valley is a small impact
crater nicknamed “Spirit of Saint Louis

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.510
Crater,” so Opportunity will make a pit
stop there before rolling on.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.090
The mission has studied clay deposits around
Endeavour Crater before, revealing that Mars

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.010
was a lot wetter than it is now.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.601
But not only that, these clay minerals would
have formed in water with a neutral pH -- in

00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:18.730
other words, water we could drink.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.940
Both Opportunity and Mars’ newest resident
Curiosity have uncovered compelling evidence

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.170
of extensive water that would have existed
on Mars millions of years ago.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.000
So these surface missions, along with the
growing number of orbiting Mars satellites,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.920
are trying to piece together Martian past
habitability and why the red planet turned

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.860
from a wet world with all the components for
life, to a now dusty and frozen world that

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.810
seems inhospitable for life as we know it.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.450
So as Opportunity rolls into its 12th year
on Mars, soon crossing the marathon finishing

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.730
line, we’ll be cheering her on, hoping for
more awesome science from one very tough little

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.730
robot.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.260
Is Opportunity your favorite Mars rover?

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:58.200
