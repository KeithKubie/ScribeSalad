00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:03.881
- [Voiceover] So let's see
if we can subtract 25 from 83

00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:07.337
or if we can figure out
what 83 minus 25 is.

00:00:07.337 --> 00:00:08.812
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:10.971
and see if you can work through it.

00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:13.269
So I'm assuming you've had a try.

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:14.639
And when you try to work through it,

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.759
you probably first went to the
ones place right over here.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.147
And you probably said, "Hey,
I have three ones on top

00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:23.686
"and from that I want
to subtract five ones."

00:00:23.686 --> 00:00:25.584
But you said, "Wait, I can't subtract

00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:27.467
"five ones from three ones.

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:29.316
"Five is more than three.

00:00:29.316 --> 00:00:31.172
"What do I do?"

00:00:31.172 --> 00:00:33.550
And what you do is what
I'm about to show you.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.956
You do something called regrouping.

00:00:35.957 --> 00:00:39.079
You take some of the value
that's in the tens place

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.150
and put it into the ones place.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.896
What am I talking about?

00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:44.536
I'm gonna do it three different ways.

00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:47.399
So you really hopefully
understand what's going on.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.578
Well, you want this three to be more ones.

00:00:49.578 --> 00:00:53.625
You want it to be at least
as large as five or larger.

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:54.980
So how do you do that?

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.839
Well you could take a
10 from the tens place.

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.906
So instead of having eight tens here,

00:00:59.906 --> 00:01:01.324
you could take one of them away

00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:03.586
and then you're going
to have seven tens here.

00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:05.416
And then if you take a 10,

00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:06.708
you could just put 10 away from here.

00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:08.829
You put in the ones place,
that's going to be 10.

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.354
So 10 plus three is 13.

00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:14.716
10 plus three is 13.

00:01:14.716 --> 00:01:16.461
So what did I do again?

00:01:16.462 --> 00:01:19.599
83 is eight tens and three ones.

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:24.485
You could also think of it
as seven tens and 13 ones.

00:01:24.485 --> 00:01:25.952
And I'm going to do it again in a couple

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:27.919
of different ways to make that clear.

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:30.011
But let's just work through this now

00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:33.711
because now you have
13 ones minus five ones

00:01:33.712 --> 00:01:36.397
which is going to be eight ones.

00:01:36.397 --> 00:01:38.958
And then you go to the
tens place and you say,

00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.873
"Seven tens minus two tens,

00:01:41.873 --> 00:01:44.140
"well that's going to be five tens."

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.146
So your answer is going to be

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:47.956
five tens and eight ones or 58.

00:01:47.956 --> 00:01:49.846
Now I said I would do this several ways

00:01:49.846 --> 00:01:52.780
so that it makes a little bit
more sense so let's do that.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.305
So another way that you could write

00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:57.138
83 is you could write this,

00:01:57.138 --> 00:02:00.056
this is the same thing as

00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:04.765
80 plus three.

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:06.553
80 plus three.

00:02:06.553 --> 00:02:08.097
That's the same thing as 83.

00:02:08.097 --> 00:02:11.232
Eights tens, three ones,
eight tens, three ones.

00:02:11.232 --> 00:02:15.702
And 25 is the same thing

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:19.072
as 20 plus five.

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:21.637
20 plus five.

00:02:21.637 --> 00:02:24.558
Now we're going to subtract 20 plus five.

00:02:24.558 --> 00:02:27.566
So let's write this instead as...

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:29.086
We're going to subtract 20.

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:30.715
We're going to subtract two tens

00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:34.381
and we're going to subtract five ones.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.597
So subtracting 25 is the same thing

00:02:36.597 --> 00:02:39.763
as subtracting 20 and
then subtracting five.

00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:43.725
So now let's try to work
through it just like we did.

00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:45.191
Well we go to the ones place again.

00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:46.492
Ones again was a five.

00:02:46.492 --> 00:02:48.601
If I want to take five away from three,

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:51.096
that's hard, I don't know
how to do that just yet.

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:53.423
But what if I take ten from here?

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:56.607
So if I take a 10, if
I take 10 from there,

00:02:56.607 --> 00:02:58.460
that's going to be 70.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.998
And if I put that 10 in the ones place,

00:03:00.998 --> 00:03:05.709
well 10 plus three is going to be 13.

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.799
Notice, I haven't changed
the value of the numbers.

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.662
70 plus 13 is the exact same thing

00:03:10.662 --> 00:03:13.203
as 80 plus three which is 83.

00:03:13.203 --> 00:03:15.350
But what's useful about this is now,

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.066
in the ones place, I can
subtract five from 13.

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:23.299
If I subtract five from
13, I'm gonna get an eight.

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.067
And then if I subtract
two tens from seven tens

00:03:26.067 --> 00:03:30.138
or 20 from 70, I'm going to get 50.

00:03:30.138 --> 00:03:32.056
I'm going to get 50.

00:03:32.056 --> 00:03:34.658
So this is going to end
up being 50 plus eight

00:03:34.658 --> 00:03:36.986
which is the exact same thing as 58.

00:03:36.986 --> 00:03:38.898
Five tens and eight ones.

00:03:38.898 --> 00:03:40.472
Now I said I would do the third way.

00:03:40.472 --> 00:03:41.536
And these are all the same way.

00:03:41.536 --> 00:03:43.801
I'm just writing it
down in different ways.

00:03:43.801 --> 00:03:46.707
So I could also write 83.

00:03:46.707 --> 00:03:50.641
I could write this down as eight tens

00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:55.593
plus three ones.

00:03:55.593 --> 00:03:57.009
All right, this is the tens place.

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.857
This is the ones place.

00:03:57.857 --> 00:04:00.076
Eight tens, three ones.

00:04:00.076 --> 00:04:03.339
I'm gonna subtract two tens and five ones.

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:04.890
So I could write...

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.821
So this is going to be minus

00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:12.621
two tens

00:04:12.621 --> 00:04:14.744
and minus three ones.

00:04:14.744 --> 00:04:17.188
I'm sorry, and minus five ones.

00:04:17.188 --> 00:04:20.445
Minus five ones.

00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:24.382
25 is the same thing as 20 and five.

00:04:24.382 --> 00:04:26.506
If I'm subtracting 25,
that's the same thing

00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:29.121
as subtracting 20 and
then subtracting five.

00:04:29.122 --> 00:04:30.579
And that's the same thing as subtracting

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:32.945
two tens and then subtracting five ones.

00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:35.103
Two tens and five ones.

00:04:35.103 --> 00:04:38.092
So let's then work this out.

00:04:38.092 --> 00:04:40.344
So this is going to be...

00:04:40.344 --> 00:04:42.028
Well, as soon as we try
to subtract five ones

00:04:42.028 --> 00:04:44.355
from three ones, we say,
"It doesn't make any sense."

00:04:44.355 --> 00:04:45.971
Let me make the value here larger.

00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:48.981
And I'm gonna do that by
regrouping from the tens place.

00:04:48.981 --> 00:04:50.545
Instead of writing this as eight tens,

00:04:50.545 --> 00:04:52.213
I'm gonna take one of those tens away.

00:04:52.213 --> 00:04:53.996
I'm gonna write it as seven tens.

00:04:53.996 --> 00:04:56.169
And then put that 10 in the ones place.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.905
Well one 10 is equal to 10 ones.

00:04:59.905 --> 00:05:04.866
So if I added it to the three,
this is going to be 13 ones.

00:05:04.866 --> 00:05:05.962
And now I can subtract.

00:05:05.962 --> 00:05:10.364
13 ones minus five ones is eight ones.

00:05:10.549 --> 00:05:15.549
And seven tens minus
two tens is five tens.

00:05:15.644 --> 00:05:18.264
Five tens.

00:05:18.264 --> 00:05:19.007
We are done.

00:05:19.007 --> 00:05:21.168
These are all different ways of doing

00:05:21.168 --> 00:05:25.975
the exact same problem with regrouping.
