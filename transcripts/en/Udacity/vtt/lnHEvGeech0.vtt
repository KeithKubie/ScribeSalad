00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:04.800
We started off and we create a static map of only the countries and

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.870
drawn them without any of the data from our World Cup attendances.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.690
The next improvement we've made is that we added bubbles or circles

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.040
corresponding to the home country and the total attendance for that year.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.790
Making what's often called a thematic map by combining our static geographic map

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.130
with some data.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.480
The theme in our case being the World Cup.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.850
The next step of this improvement was to create the stem of our

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.160
martini glass and an author driven narrative.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.160
Where we leveraged animation to cycle through all the years of the World Cup,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.110
displaying both the participating countries and

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.030
teams and where the world cup was hosted and what its attendance was.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.660
And remember, through both the animation, and

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.040
the negative space created by only showing the participating teams.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.050
We could see that in the early tournaments of the World Cup, the participating

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.010
teams and countries, were often localized to where the tournament was held.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.750
Now, I'm sure there's plenty of causes for

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.190
this, and I don't want to fall victim to confusing correlation with a cause,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.360
but intuitive exclamation that world travel wasn't what it is today.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.430
In crossing the Atlantic and the Pacific, especially before airplanes became

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.650
commonplace, could be considered quite difficult.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.250
The second takeaway from our author-driven narrative is that in addition to

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.780
conveying all the attendances of the World Cup have changed over the years,

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.420
is that we could see in the early days,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.820
the World Cup was mainly hosted either in South America or Europe.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.620
And perhaps this is one of the reasons why South America and European teams,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.260
often dominate the World Cup, both historically and in modern tournaments.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.180
And the fourth iteration of our map

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.350
was to enable a reader driven narrative through interaction.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.390
We did so by adding buttons which correspond to every year of the World Cup so

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.130
that a reader, who might be interested in one years as compared to another,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.730
could very easily see how the participants and the attendances and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.390
the host country or rather what data we have represented on

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.530
our map has changed from one year to the next.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.930
This also enabled us to compare disjoint years, which may not be sequential, for

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.840
example, comparing 1938s games with 1982s games through

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.370
animation alone we would have to wait for the entire sequence to go through.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.770
And we may not be able to remember what it looked like in 1938 compared to

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.690
the year of interest, unless we've seen the animation go through many,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.770
many times.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.157
So while in the author-driven narrative,

00:02:49.157 --> 00:02:53.720
we've communicated our interesting insights from the World Cup Games, be it

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.300
that early tournaments were often localized in the participating countries.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.930
And the tournament mainly started off both being hosted in South America and

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.040
Europe, but also having many of the participating countries from South America

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.800
or Europe which might be a reason for their dominance in the games today.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.370
They've simply been doing it for longer.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.830
The reader-driven narrative allows the user to approach our visualization and

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.800
discover their own story.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.060
And by combining both the author-driven portion and the reader-driven, we've

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.490
created a very powerful and dynamic story around the history of the World Cup.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.740
And returning to our martini glass, remember that the static map and

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.590
the bubble map or thematic map create a very solid foundation for

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.258
our interactive narrative to come.

00:03:42.258 --> 00:03:46.600
Our author-driven narrative, enabled by animation,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.940
took our reader along a narrow stem of the glass, conveying the interesting

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.230
stories that we found in the data, before the interaction of our graphic.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.400
Enable them to explore and

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.080
discover their own insights in our data through a reader driven narrative.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.820
And through all of these components, we've created an engaging and

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.440
effective visualization.
