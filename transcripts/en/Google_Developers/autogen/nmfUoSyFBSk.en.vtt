just another quick update we want to do

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610
just another quick update we want to do
 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.820
just another quick update we want to do
a recap of what's taken place the last

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830

month or so give you guys a little bit
of heads up on some new features that

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830
of heads up on some new features that
 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.040
of heads up on some new features that
came out possibly do some changes that

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050
came out possibly do some changes that
 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.269
came out possibly do some changes that
may have taken place that you should be

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279
may have taken place that you should be
 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.460
may have taken place that you should be
aware of so with that we'll just get

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470
aware of so with that we'll just get
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.259
aware of so with that we'll just get
started and get right into it in it and

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269
started and get right into it in it and
 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:34.729
started and get right into it in it and
you're going to take it away with a

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739
you're going to take it away with a
 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.200
you're going to take it away with a
little bit about analytics Jess and some

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
little bit about analytics Jess and some
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.939
little bit about analytics Jess and some
collection changes yep and actually we

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949
collection changes yep and actually we
 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.259
collection changes yep and actually we
got a couple changes to a cookie domain

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269
got a couple changes to a cookie domain
 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:43.939
got a couple changes to a cookie domain
configuration and cross domain stuff so

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949
configuration and cross domain stuff so
 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:45.289
configuration and cross domain stuff so
we'll check it out right now so the

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:45.299
we'll check it out right now so the
 

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:46.369
we'll check it out right now so the
first thing I wanted to highlight was

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379
first thing I wanted to highlight was
 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.509
first thing I wanted to highlight was
that we now have this thing called

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519
that we now have this thing called
 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.910
that we now have this thing called
automatic cookie domain configuration so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
automatic cookie domain configuration so
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.609
automatic cookie domain configuration so
before with analytics j/s or even ghas

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:52.619
before with analytics j/s or even ghas
 

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.820
before with analytics j/s or even ghas
you had to specify what domain you

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830
you had to specify what domain you
 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.469
you had to specify what domain you
wanted the cookie to be reading on now

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479
wanted the cookie to be reading on now
 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.450
wanted the cookie to be reading on now
we let you supply this auto argument for

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
we let you supply this auto argument for
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.549
we let you supply this auto argument for
analytics j/s and what that means is

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559
analytics j/s and what that means is
 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.500
analytics j/s and what that means is
when you do that analytics Jas is going

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510
when you do that analytics Jas is going
 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.299
when you do that analytics Jas is going
to write the cookie at the highest level

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309
to write the cookie at the highest level
 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.280
to write the cookie at the highest level
domain possible so for example you were

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290
domain possible so for example you were
 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.600
domain possible so for example you were
trying to write a cookie or if your site

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
trying to write a cookie or if your site
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.570
trying to write a cookie or if your site
was example code UK analytics chest

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
was example code UK analytics chest
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.460
was example code UK analytics chest
would try to write to coat UK that would

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
would try to write to coat UK that would
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.470
would try to write to coat UK that would
obviously fail in the next domain we

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480
obviously fail in the next domain we
 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.930
obviously fail in the next domain we
would try would be example co uk that

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940
would try would be example co uk that
 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.250
would try would be example co uk that
would succeed so that's where we'd write

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260
would succeed so that's where we'd write
 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.170
would succeed so that's where we'd write
the cookie too so this is kind of the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180
the cookie too so this is kind of the
 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.940
the cookie too so this is kind of the
new default way to set up your cookie

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950
new default way to set up your cookie
 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.100
new default way to set up your cookie
domain and it should work in all the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
domain and it should work in all the
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.020
domain and it should work in all the
main use cases like one site with

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
main use cases like one site with
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.580
main use cases like one site with
multiple subdomains or if you're working

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
multiple subdomains or if you're working
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.440
multiple subdomains or if you're working
with multiple domains setter so it

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450
with multiple domains setter so it
 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.660
with multiple domains setter so it
simplifies that whole process sure so

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
simplifies that whole process sure so
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.450
simplifies that whole process sure so
this is but actually polyus recently

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460
this is but actually polyus recently
 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.740
this is but actually polyus recently
announced that change logs and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
announced that change logs and
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.690
announced that change logs and
officially added today right yeah we

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700
officially added today right yeah we
 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.860
officially added today right yeah we
actually had it out for a bit but we

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870
actually had it out for a bit but we
 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.480
actually had it out for a bit but we
just added at the docks and we updated

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
just added at the docks and we updated
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.070
just added at the docks and we updated
all our code snippets on website so this

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080
all our code snippets on website so this
 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.020
all our code snippets on website so this
is now like the default way to implement

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
is now like the default way to implement
 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.120
is now like the default way to implement
perfect vehicle cool so the next update

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
perfect vehicle cool so the next update
 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.460
perfect vehicle cool so the next update

that will automatically append the

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870
that will automatically append the
 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.330
that will automatically append the
parameters that you need to any links

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
parameters that you need to any links
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.130
parameters that you need to any links
that are pointing to another domain so

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140
that are pointing to another domain so
 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.840
that are pointing to another domain so
that you can track across those domains

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
that you can track across those domains
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.180
that you can track across those domains
successfully but what we just added with

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
successfully but what we just added with
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.830
successfully but what we just added with
this update it was the ability to make

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
this update it was the ability to make
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.710
this update it was the ability to make
this work for forms so both get and post

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
this work for forms so both get and post
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.710
this work for forms so both get and post
forms you add this true argument at the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720
forms you add this true argument at the
 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.820
forms you add this true argument at the
end here

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830
end here
 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.010
end here
that will will try to upend those

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020
that will will try to upend those
 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.310
that will will try to upend those
parameters to the end of the form action

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320
parameters to the end of the form action
 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.260
parameters to the end of the form action
as well so one thing about this one

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270
as well so one thing about this one
 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.520
as well so one thing about this one
though you definitely make sure you test

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530
though you definitely make sure you test
 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.810
though you definitely make sure you test
this on your site before you actually

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820
this on your site before you actually
 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.270
this on your site before you actually
deploy it so maybe some cases where this

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280
deploy it so maybe some cases where this
 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.770
deploy it so maybe some cases where this
if you have something custom going on

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780
if you have something custom going on
 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.840
if you have something custom going on
with JavaScript on that page it might

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850
with JavaScript on that page it might
 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.120
with JavaScript on that page it might
not work in all cases but it should work

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130
not work in all cases but it should work
 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.410
not work in all cases but it should work
in mode so just make sure you test it

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420
in mode so just make sure you test it
 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.240
in mode so just make sure you test it
out before you to play it and again just

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250
out before you to play it and again just
 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.440
out before you to play it and again just
another way to make things simpler for

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450
another way to make things simpler for
 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.130
another way to make things simpler for
cross domain tracking and then the last

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140
cross domain tracking and then the last
 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.800
cross domain tracking and then the last
one last update this was actually out

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810
one last update this was actually out
 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.270
one last update this was actually out
for a little bit as well but we just got

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280
for a little bit as well but we just got
 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.490
for a little bit as well but we just got
it documented this is enhanced link

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
it documented this is enhanced link
 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.980
it documented this is enhanced link
attribution for analytics jas so this

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990
attribution for analytics jas so this
 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.040
attribution for analytics jas so this
was a feature that existed for gijs what

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050
was a feature that existed for gijs what
 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.740
was a feature that existed for gijs what
it does is it lets you let's here in

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750
it does is it lets you let's here in
 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.330
it does is it lets you let's here in
page it makes your in-page analytics

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340
page it makes your in-page analytics
 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.850
page it makes your in-page analytics
reports more accurate because it allows

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860
reports more accurate because it allows
 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.250
reports more accurate because it allows
you to disambiguate between links on the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260
you to disambiguate between links on the
 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.870
you to disambiguate between links on the
same page that are pointing to the same

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880
same page that are pointing to the same
 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.050
same page that are pointing to the same
URL so really quickly the way this one

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060
URL so really quickly the way this one
 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.530
URL so really quickly the way this one
works once you load the link ID plug-in

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540
works once you load the link ID plug-in
 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.860
works once you load the link ID plug-in
which you'll see they're basically if

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870
which you'll see they're basically if
 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.970
which you'll see they're basically if
you have a link on the page that's

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980
you have a link on the page that's
 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.710
you have a link on the page that's
pointing to a URL in this case like page

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720
pointing to a URL in this case like page
 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.340
pointing to a URL in this case like page
2 when a user clicks on that link we're

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350
2 when a user clicks on that link we're
 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.190
2 when a user clicks on that link we're
actually going to write the link ID to a

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200
actually going to write the link ID to a
 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.259
actually going to write the link ID to a
cookie and if that link for example if

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269
cookie and if that link for example if
 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.150
cookie and if that link for example if
that anchor element didn't have an ID we

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160
that anchor element didn't have an ID we
 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.310
that anchor element didn't have an ID we
would look up in the Dom to try to find

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320
would look up in the Dom to try to find
 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.229
would look up in the Dom to try to find
a parent element that did have an ID and

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239
a parent element that did have an ID and
 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.550
a parent element that did have an ID and
would use the first one that we could

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560
would use the first one that we could
 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.030
would use the first one that we could
find and then on the next page when you

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040
find and then on the next page when you
 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.890
find and then on the next page when you
actually send the page view will include

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900
actually send the page view will include
 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.020
actually send the page view will include
whatever that element ID is in the hit

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030
whatever that element ID is in the hit
 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.270
whatever that element ID is in the hit
as part of this link ID parameter and

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280
as part of this link ID parameter and
 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.650
as part of this link ID parameter and
that's the way we're able to in the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660
that's the way we're able to in the
 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.810
that's the way we're able to in the
in-page analytics report tell that users

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820
in-page analytics report tell that users
 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.210
in-page analytics report tell that users
came to this page to not from some other

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220
came to this page to not from some other
 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.220
came to this page to not from some other
link but from this specific next button

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230
link but from this specific next button
 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.860
link but from this specific next button
for example so because of all that

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870
for example so because of all that
 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.990
for example so because of all that
because we rely on element IDs to make

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000
because we rely on element IDs to make
 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.570
because we rely on element IDs to make
this work it's really going to be most

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580
this work it's really going to be most
 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.400
this work it's really going to be most
accurate when all of your links have

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410
accurate when all of your links have
 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.120
accurate when all of your links have
unique IDs or at least their parent

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130
unique IDs or at least their parent
 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.340
unique IDs or at least their parent
elements should at least have unique IDs

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350
elements should at least have unique IDs
 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.830
elements should at least have unique IDs
so it looks it'll look up the actual Dom

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840
so it looks it'll look up the actual Dom
 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.750
so it looks it'll look up the actual Dom
to check if there's IDs above rendering

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760
to check if there's IDs above rendering
 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.190
to check if there's IDs above rendering
the parrot elements exactly and that's

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200
the parrot elements exactly and that's
 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.990
the parrot elements exactly and that's
actually configurable so you'll see I

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000
actually configurable so you'll see I
 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.280
actually configurable so you'll see I
think we're showing you an example of

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290
think we're showing you an example of
 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.330
think we're showing you an example of
the code snippet but you'll see that

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340
the code snippet but you'll see that
 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.830
the code snippet but you'll see that
there's a couple configuration options

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840
there's a couple configuration options
 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.210
there's a couple configuration options
you can configure like the name of the

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220
you can configure like the name of the
 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.740
you can configure like the name of the
cookie how long that cookies going to

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750
cookie how long that cookies going to
 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.420
cookie how long that cookies going to
last but you can also tell us how many

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430
last but you can also tell us how many
 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.840
last but you can also tell us how many
levels up in the Dom you want us to look

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850
levels up in the Dom you want us to look
 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.090
levels up in the Dom you want us to look
for that element ID cool that's a nice

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100
for that element ID cool that's a nice
 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.390
for that element ID cool that's a nice
little addition yep okay moving on to

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400
little addition yep okay moving on to
 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.420
little addition yep okay moving on to
the AP is we just like last week or so i

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430
the AP is we just like last week or so i
 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.950
the AP is we just like last week or so i
think it was we renounced three

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960
think it was we renounced three
 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.340
think it was we renounced three
different changes for the multi-channel

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350
different changes for the multi-channel
 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.680
different changes for the multi-channel
funnels I call reporting and managed may

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690
funnels I call reporting and managed may
 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.810
funnels I call reporting and managed may
pass there's a few things some of its

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820
pass there's a few things some of its
 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.240
pass there's a few things some of its
new data and a couple different features

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250
new data and a couple different features
 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.770
new data and a couple different features
so the first thing is multi-channel

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780
so the first thing is multi-channel
 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.540
so the first thing is multi-channel
funnels we added some additional data

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550
funnels we added some additional data
 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.140
funnels we added some additional data
around AdWords conversion pass in

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150
around AdWords conversion pass in
 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.210
around AdWords conversion pass in
interactions so it's this is more about

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220
interactions so it's this is more about
 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.010
interactions so it's this is more about
the IDS so we already had pathian

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020
the IDS so we already had pathian
 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.230
the IDS so we already had pathian
interactions for Adwords things like ad

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240
interactions for Adwords things like ad
 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.910
interactions for Adwords things like ad
group and campaign but this allows you

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920
group and campaign but this allows you
 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.190
group and campaign but this allows you
to query for IDs now that are associated

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200
to query for IDs now that are associated
 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.850
to query for IDs now that are associated
with those specific dimensions so it's

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860
with those specific dimensions so it's
 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.930
with those specific dimensions so it's
pretty straightforward you can go and

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940
pretty straightforward you can go and
 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.400
pretty straightforward you can go and
look at the reference talk for the

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410
look at the reference talk for the
 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.020
look at the reference talk for the
multi-channel funnel and see the this

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030
multi-channel funnel and see the this
 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.890
multi-channel funnel and see the this
new data is in there and get some

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900
new data is in there and get some
 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.240
new data is in there and get some
descriptions for these particular

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250
descriptions for these particular
 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.930
descriptions for these particular
dimensions the next thing is the co

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940
dimensions the next thing is the co
 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.510
dimensions the next thing is the co
reporting API we've added some new data

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520
reporting API we've added some new data
 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.930
reporting API we've added some new data
again to the corporate API the minute

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940
again to the corporate API the minute
 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.890
again to the corporate API the minute
was actually something that a lot of

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900
was actually something that a lot of
 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.450
was actually something that a lot of
people are requested to have minute

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460
people are requested to have minute
 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.010
people are requested to have minute
level data and now we actually have this

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020
level data and now we actually have this
 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.020
level data and now we actually have this
so you can query by minute which is

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030
so you can query by minute which is
 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.880
so you can query by minute which is
pretty a pretty impressive actually when

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890
pretty a pretty impressive actually when
 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.230
pretty a pretty impressive actually when
you do it for a long period of time it's

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240
you do it for a long period of time it's
 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.390
you do it for a long period of time it's
so crazy to get that much data back then

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400
so crazy to get that much data back then
 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.650
so crazy to get that much data back then
we have the enth minute which is kind of

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660
we have the enth minute which is kind of
 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.080
we have the enth minute which is kind of
an indexed value for which will show you

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090
an indexed value for which will show you
 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.000
an indexed value for which will show you
basically index values from the over the

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010
basically index values from the over the
 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.610
basically index values from the over the
time here that you've specified and then

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620
time here that you've specified and then
 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.670
time here that you've specified and then
if you have the audience reports enabled

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680
if you have the audience reports enabled
 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.630
if you have the audience reports enabled
within Google Analytics you we also

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640
within Google Analytics you we also
 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.000
within Google Analytics you we also
added some dimensions and metrics around

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010
added some dimensions and metrics around
 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.430
added some dimensions and metrics around
the audience report reporting data so

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440
the audience report reporting data so
 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.350
the audience report reporting data so
this is now available through that so if

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360
this is now available through that so if
 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.480
this is now available through that so if
you have the access to that data you can

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490
you have the access to that data you can
 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.920
you have the access to that data you can
now pull this out through the core porn

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930
now pull this out through the core porn
 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.170
now pull this out through the core porn
API and again take a look at the query

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180
API and again take a look at the query
 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.200
API and again take a look at the query
dimensions and metrics explore the link

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210
dimensions and metrics explore the link
 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.270
dimensions and metrics explore the link
is there at the bottom and this is where

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280
is there at the bottom and this is where
 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.620
is there at the bottom and this is where
you can go and look at all these new the

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630
you can go and look at all these new the
 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.990
you can go and look at all these new the
new data and see exactly descriptions

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000
new data and see exactly descriptions
 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.340
new data and see exactly descriptions
and things like that and whether they're

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350
and things like that and whether they're
 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.200
and things like that and whether they're
alive in segments as a minute is that

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210
alive in segments as a minute is that
 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.570
alive in segments as a minute is that
also new in the front end as well yes

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580
also new in the front end as well yes
 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.950
also new in the front end as well yes
this was also so you might have seen it

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960
this was also so you might have seen it
 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.750
this was also so you might have seen it
also in the front end to the web

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760
also in the front end to the web
 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.070
also in the front end to the web
interface you would have seen it shown

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080
interface you would have seen it shown
 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.780
interface you would have seen it shown
up there and then it was released

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790
up there and then it was released
 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.730
up there and then it was released
through the API a few days later so go

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740
through the API a few days later so go
 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.670
through the API a few days later so go
yep available at those places

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680
 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.719
we also enabled segmentation for a few

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:30.729
we also enabled segmentation for a few
 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:32.730
we also enabled segmentation for a few
different so there's source medium this

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740
different so there's source medium this
 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.040
different so there's source medium this
is a new relatives we added source

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050
is a new relatives we added source
 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.210
is a new relatives we added source
medium which is combination or

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220
medium which is combination or
 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.400
medium which is combination or
concatenation of source and medium so

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410
concatenation of source and medium so
 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.100
concatenation of source and medium so
this is also now allowed in segments and

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110
this is also now allowed in segments and
 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.689
this is also now allowed in segments and
then we have local item revenue which is

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:42.699
then we have local item revenue which is
 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:45.840
then we have local item revenue which is
also an out allowing segments so not all

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:45.850
also an out allowing segments so not all
 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.010
also an out allowing segments so not all
dimensions and metrics can be used in

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.020
dimensions and metrics can be used in
 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.800
dimensions and metrics can be used in
segments and you can go to the

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810
segments and you can go to the
 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.670
segments and you can go to the
dimensions and metrics Explorer again

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680
dimensions and metrics Explorer again
 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.740
dimensions and metrics Explorer again
there's actually an option to select on

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750
there's actually an option to select on
 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.689
there's actually an option to select on
the front page there's a little checkbox

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:54.699
the front page there's a little checkbox
 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:55.890
the front page there's a little checkbox
there and you can you can select that

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900
there and you can you can select that
 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.810
there and you can you can select that
and I'll show you which dimensions and

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820
and I'll show you which dimensions and
 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.760
and I'll show you which dimensions and
metrics are allowed in segments and then

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770
metrics are allowed in segments and then
 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.900
metrics are allowed in segments and then
also if you view the description of any

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910
also if you view the description of any
 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.279
also if you view the description of any
dimension or metric it'll indicate

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:02.289
dimension or metric it'll indicate
 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:03.779
dimension or metric it'll indicate
whether it's a lab in segments so these

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:03.789
whether it's a lab in segments so these
 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:05.969
whether it's a lab in segments so these
two have now been changed to yes allowed

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:05.979
two have now been changed to yes allowed
 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:07.969
two have now been changed to yes allowed
in segments and local item revenue is

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979
in segments and local item revenue is
 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:10.320
in segments and local item revenue is
revenue in the local currency the

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330
revenue in the local currency the
 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.570
revenue in the local currency the
currency yes exactly yeah okay cool the

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580
currency yes exactly yeah okay cool the
 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.360
currency yes exactly yeah okay cool the
next thing is the data table response

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.370
next thing is the data table response
 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.830
next thing is the data table response
format that we've added to the core porn

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840
format that we've added to the core porn
 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.740
format that we've added to the core porn
API so this is if you let use the

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:22.750
API so this is if you let use the
 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.089
API so this is if you let use the
corporate API and you make and you made

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:24.099
corporate API and you make and you made
 

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:25.830
corporate API and you make and you made
any requests you'll know that the data

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840
any requests you'll know that the data
 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.540
any requests you'll know that the data
comes back and there's kind of two main

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.550
comes back and there's kind of two main
 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.070
comes back and there's kind of two main
components that data is the column

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.080
components that data is the column
 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.080
components that data is the column
headers and then there's a rose object

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.090
headers and then there's a rose object
 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.810
headers and then there's a rose object
and the rose contains all of the data

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:32.820
and the rose contains all of the data
 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.770
and the rose contains all of the data
ordered by dimensions and followed by

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:34.780
ordered by dimensions and followed by
 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.899
ordered by dimensions and followed by
metrics so in this example we have some

00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:36.909
metrics so in this example we have some
 

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:38.370
metrics so in this example we have some
data for the query that says it's google

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:38.380
data for the query that says it's google
 

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.439
data for the query that says it's google
nexus 7 is the mobile device info i

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:40.449
nexus 7 is the mobile device info i
 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:42.060
nexus 7 is the mobile device info i
think is the dimension in this case and

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:42.070
think is the dimension in this case and
 

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.010
think is the dimension in this case and
then the metric of 180 so this is kind

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:44.020
then the metric of 180 so this is kind
 

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.899
then the metric of 180 so this is kind
of the default standard response you

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:45.909
of the default standard response you
 

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:47.219
of the default standard response you
would always see with the cobra point

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:47.229
would always see with the cobra point
 

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:49.589
would always see with the cobra point
api however we know what that lock

00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599
api however we know what that lock
 

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:51.089
api however we know what that lock
people want to take this data and use it

00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:51.099
people want to take this data and use it
 

00:07:51.099 --> 00:07:53.040
people want to take this data and use it
in some sort of visualization and one

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.050
in some sort of visualization and one
 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.230
in some sort of visualization and one
visualization tool you pray that we have

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240
visualization tool you pray that we have
 

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.980
visualization tool you pray that we have
here obviously is the charts API so part

00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:58.990
here obviously is the charts API so part
 

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.390
here obviously is the charts API so part
of the charts API one of the format's

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400
of the charts API one of the format's
 

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.920
of the charts API one of the format's
that's used quite extensively is this

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:01.930
that's used quite extensively is this
 

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.080
that's used quite extensively is this
data table format so we've added some

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:04.090
data table format so we've added some
 

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.310
data table format so we've added some
capabilities now to the core reporting

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:05.320
capabilities now to the core reporting
 

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.469
capabilities now to the core reporting
API that allows you to get data back

00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479
API that allows you to get data back
 

00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:10.050
API that allows you to get data back
return in this data table format so this

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:10.060
return in this data table format so this
 

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.339
return in this data table format so this
is what the default response would look

00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:11.349
is what the default response would look
 

00:08:11.349 --> 00:08:12.870
is what the default response would look
like and this is what the response would

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:12.880
like and this is what the response would
 

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.020
like and this is what the response would
look like with this new parameter so if

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:16.030
look like with this new parameter so if
 

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.100
look like with this new parameter so if
you make a query to the core reporting

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:17.110
you make a query to the core reporting
 

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.290
you make a query to the core reporting
API now you can specify this output

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:19.300
API now you can specify this output
 

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.089
API now you can specify this output
query parameter and if you set it to

00:08:21.089 --> 00:08:21.099
query parameter and if you set it to
 

00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:22.800
query parameter and if you set it to
data table you'll get something that

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:22.810
data table you'll get something that
 

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.870
data table you'll get something that
looks a little bit like this so instead

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:24.880
looks a little bit like this so instead
 

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.719
looks a little bit like this so instead
of the Rose object sitting within the

00:08:27.719 --> 00:08:27.729
of the Rose object sitting within the
 

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:28.920
of the Rose object sitting within the
response you're going to have a new data

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:28.930
response you're going to have a new data
 

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.219
response you're going to have a new data
table object and that's going to contain

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:31.229
table object and that's going to contain
 

00:08:31.229 --> 00:08:34.110
table object and that's going to contain
two separate lists there's going to be a

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.120
two separate lists there's going to be a
 

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.870
two separate lists there's going to be a
columns list which indicates the IDS

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880
columns list which indicates the IDS
 

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.100
columns list which indicates the IDS
labels things that this is the data

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:38.110
labels things that this is the data
 

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.449
labels things that this is the data
table format for basically column

00:08:39.449 --> 00:08:39.459
table format for basically column
 

00:08:39.459 --> 00:08:40.510
table format for basically column
headers

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:40.520
headers
 

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.830
headers
you'll get that and then you'll also get

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:41.840
you'll get that and then you'll also get
 

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.720
you'll get that and then you'll also get
the rose but this is within the data

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:43.730
the rose but this is within the data
 

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.980
the rose but this is within the data
table you get this rose which contains

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:44.990
table you get this rose which contains
 

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.140
table you get this rose which contains
your data so it's a similar set of data

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:47.150
your data so it's a similar set of data
 

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.000
your data so it's a similar set of data
but it's in this data table format the

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.010
but it's in this data table format the
 

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.050
but it's in this data table format the
cool thing about this is that you can

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:50.060
cool thing about this is that you can
 

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.110
cool thing about this is that you can
take this data table extract that out of

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120
take this data table extract that out of
 

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.270
take this data table extract that out of
the object and actually feed it right

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:55.280
the object and actually feed it right
 

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.340
the object and actually feed it right
into google charts the visualizations

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:57.350
into google charts the visualizations
 

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.920
into google charts the visualizations
and it'll just work with that particular

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:58.930
and it'll just work with that particular
 

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.510
and it'll just work with that particular
like there's pie charts just columns

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:01.520
like there's pie charts just columns
 

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.500
like there's pie charts just columns
there's all these different different

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:02.510
there's all these different different
 

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.960
there's all these different different
visualizations are available and this

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:04.970
visualizations are available and this
 

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.820
visualizations are available and this
response format works directly with them

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:06.830
response format works directly with them
 

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.530
response format works directly with them
so yeah just makes a little bit easier

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:08.540
so yeah just makes a little bit easier
 

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.720
so yeah just makes a little bit easier
to get people to go from like requiring

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:10.730
to get people to go from like requiring
 

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:11.740
to get people to go from like requiring
the data to actually getting it in

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:11.750
the data to actually getting it in
 

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.230
the data to actually getting it in
insurance I know it's awesome so it's

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240
insurance I know it's awesome so it's
 

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.160
insurance I know it's awesome so it's
really nice and easy so another

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:18.170
really nice and easy so another
 

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.900
really nice and easy so another
important change that you should be

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:19.910
important change that you should be
 

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.690
important change that you should be
aware of your using these dimensions and

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:22.700
aware of your using these dimensions and
 

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.400
aware of your using these dimensions and
metric here is that we've deprecated

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:24.410
metric here is that we've deprecated
 

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.610
metric here is that we've deprecated
three columns here so one is the is

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:27.620
three columns here so one is the is
 

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.100
three columns here so one is the is
mobile so this is that this was a

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:30.110
mobile so this is that this was a
 

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.300
mobile so this is that this was a
dimension that indicated yes or no

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:31.310

also what you should do and what steps

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240
also what you should do and what steps
 

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.060
also what you should do and what steps
you should take next when we actually

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.070
you should take next when we actually

just cleaning things up a little bit

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:33.530
just cleaning things up a little bit
 

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.890
just cleaning things up a little bit
making it more consistent for this

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:35.900
making it more consistent for this

so with this change was also affected

00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399
so with this change was also affected
 

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:44.249
so with this change was also affected
something in the management API so we

00:10:44.249 --> 00:10:44.259
something in the management API so we
 

00:10:44.259 --> 00:10:46.410
something in the management API so we
have default segments in the management

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:46.420
have default segments in the management
 

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.850
have default segments in the management
API you're probably familiar with this

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:47.860
API you're probably familiar with this
 

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.889
API you're probably familiar with this
there's always a list of default

00:10:49.889 --> 00:10:49.899
there's always a list of default
 

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.389
there's always a list of default
segments we provide like and one of them

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:51.399
segments we provide like and one of them
 

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:54.239
segments we provide like and one of them
was mobile traffic and then there was

00:10:54.239 --> 00:10:54.249
was mobile traffic and then there was
 

00:10:54.249 --> 00:10:56.730
was mobile traffic and then there was
one like tablet traffic but that mobile

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:56.740
one like tablet traffic but that mobile
 

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.769
one like tablet traffic but that mobile
actually included tablet so it was kind

00:10:58.769 --> 00:10:58.779
actually included tablet so it was kind
 

00:10:58.779 --> 00:11:00.540
actually included tablet so it was kind
of like confusing maybe a little bit for

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:00.550
of like confusing maybe a little bit for
 

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:01.410
of like confusing maybe a little bit for
some people in terms of what they were

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:01.420
some people in terms of what they were
 

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.869
some people in terms of what they were
getting so we've cleaned this up and

00:11:03.869 --> 00:11:03.879
getting so we've cleaned this up and
 

00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:06.299
getting so we've cleaned this up and
we've changed these around just a little

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:06.309
we've changed these around just a little
 

00:11:06.309 --> 00:11:09.900
we've changed these around just a little
bit so you'll know in the if you use the

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:09.910
bit so you'll know in the if you use the
 

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.340
bit so you'll know in the if you use the
management API you'll know that the

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:11.350
management API you'll know that the
 

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.379
management API you'll know that the
default statements have an ID associated

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:13.389
default statements have an ID associated
 

00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:14.910
default statements have an ID associated
with them so they're actually negative

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:14.920
with them so they're actually negative
 

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.210
with them so they're actually negative
numbers and prior to this change the

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:18.220
numbers and prior to this change the
 

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.970
numbers and prior to this change the
negative 11-11 was was just mobile

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:20.980
negative 11-11 was was just mobile
 

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.249
negative 11-11 was was just mobile
traffic and it's been renamed to mobile

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:23.259
traffic and it's been renamed to mobile
 

00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:25.230
traffic and it's been renamed to mobile
and tablet traffic so includes both of

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.240
and tablet traffic so includes both of
 

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.819
and tablet traffic so includes both of
those now so we include mobile tablet

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:26.829
those now so we include mobile tablet
 

00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:28.710
those now so we include mobile tablet
that actually hasn't changed from a data

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720
that actually hasn't changed from a data
 

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.720
that actually hasn't changed from a data
perspective you wouldn't see any change

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:30.730
perspective you wouldn't see any change
 

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:36.239
perspective you wouldn't see any change
there actually but we've also changed we

00:11:36.239 --> 00:11:36.249
there actually but we've also changed we
 

00:11:36.249 --> 00:11:37.530
there actually but we've also changed we
just made sure the name is consistent we

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:37.540
just made sure the name is consistent we
 

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.230
just made sure the name is consistent we
have tablet traffic for the negative 13

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240
have tablet traffic for the negative 13
 

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.889
have tablet traffic for the negative 13
ID and its tablet only now and the

00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:43.899
ID and its tablet only now and the
 

00:11:43.899 --> 00:11:45.540
ID and its tablet only now and the
definition of that segment is device

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:45.550
definition of that segment is device
 

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.329

tablets are and finally we added a news

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:56.110
tablets are and finally we added a news
 

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.840
tablets are and finally we added a news
segment this is a new default segment it

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:57.850

so if you've been using these segments

00:12:10.139 --> 00:12:10.149
so if you've been using these segments
 

00:12:10.149 --> 00:12:12.629
so if you've been using these segments
make sure if you check your queries that

00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639

these new segmentation default segments
 

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.039
these new segmentation default segments
that we have and you can go and review

00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:23.049
that we have and you can go and review
 

00:12:23.049 --> 00:12:26.039
that we have and you can go and review
this at the management API reference

there's a explains me how to list these

00:12:28.739 --> 00:12:28.749
there's a explains me how to list these
 

00:12:28.749 --> 00:12:31.559
there's a explains me how to list these
out and get this data back oh so this

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:31.569
out and get this data back oh so this
 

00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:33.360
out and get this data back oh so this
also obviously affects core important a

where you get the segments and decor
 

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.739
where you get the segments and decor
port and API is where you actually use
