00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.907
When x=1, 3x+2=5.

00:00:03.907 --> 00:00:10.147
When we substitute 1 in for
x, we get 3(1)+2,

00:00:10.147 --> 00:00:14.874
which equals 3+2, which equals 5.

00:00:14.874 --> 00:00:19.961
When x=5, 3x+2=17.

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:23.630
When we substitute 5 in for x,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.555
we get 3(5)+2 ,which is 15+2,
which is 17.

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:34.744
When x=-2, we get -4.

00:00:34.744 --> 00:00:38.705
Substituting -2 in for x,

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:45.642
we get 3(-2)+2, which equals -6+2.

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:48.195
We get -4.
