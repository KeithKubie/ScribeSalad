ALAIN DE BOTTON:
It's a real pleasure

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.280
to be here, not least
because this book was

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.070
written on Google Docs.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.750
Is anyone here-- who here is
on-- are you guys building it

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.780
here?

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.750
It is the most wonderful tool.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.830
And actually a book before
this, called "Art as Therapy,"

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.246
I co-wrote with a colleague
in Tasmania on Google Docs.

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:26.620
And we would work
simultaneously.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.460
And it would not have been
possible without your work.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.860
So really from my
heart, thank you.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.400
You guys are doing a great job.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.270
What I want to talk
about today is a book

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.970
which is all about
information and how

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.880
we are categorizing
it and using it.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.217
So it's kind of a
Google topic, very much.

00:00:44.217 --> 00:00:46.300
But the kind of information
that I'm talking about

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.640
is news, news information.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.090
We're very confused
I think as a society

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.690
as to the way we are using news.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.400
I think it's one of the most
inefficient uses of our time.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.290
Of anything that
we do in the day,

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.890
the way that we
access information

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.730
through this thing, this massive
entity called "the news,"

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.100
right, is full of redundancy.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.450
It's full of quirks.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.750
It's full of perversions.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.910
It's not working as it should.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.670
There's an enormous opportunity
to make news go better.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.270
And that's what
my book is about.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.020
Trying to imagine how, in
a different range of areas,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.487
we could make news go better.

00:01:22.487 --> 00:01:24.320
Because I think it's
terrible at the moment.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.778
Not terrible, I'm
being hyperbolic.

00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:26.380
But not great.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.860
Part the problem, of course,
is we are not educated in it.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.210
So when we go to
school, people will

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.480
tell us a little
bit about paintings

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.480
and how to look at them.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.342
And people will tell us a little
bit about drama and literature.

00:01:35.342 --> 00:01:37.050
But no one tells you
what on earth you're

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.341
supposed to do when you come
across this kind of thing,

00:01:39.341 --> 00:01:41.130
or this kind of thing.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.350
We're not
systematically inducted

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.910
into the weirdness
of the news world.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.735
One of the problems, of course,
is information overload.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.870
Way back in the
18th century, there

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.600
was some promises
made about what

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.497
would happen if news became
widely and freely available.

00:02:01.497 --> 00:02:03.080
The great promise
of the Enlightenment

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.140
is put information out there,
people will read it, use it,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.020
and society will improve.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.539
OK, that's the dream.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.190
It hasn't really
worked out that way.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.490
It's almost nowadays as
though you've got two options.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.430
If you want to try and
keep a population passive,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.140
supine, not really able
to understand reality,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.240
OK, the first option is
the North Korean option.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.410
You throttle the pipe of news.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.380
No news, right.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.880
Then people don't know what's
going on and they're confused.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.140
But the other way to make sure
that people don't know what's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.889
going on and are
confused is you give them

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.810
so news they don't what
on earth is going on.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.394
I mean, you guys
unusually clever.

00:02:37.394 --> 00:02:39.060
But most people don't
know what on earth

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.170
was happening last week.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.010
We don't know because there
is too much information.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.340
And most of it is orphaned.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.920
It's ripped out of
context, et cetera.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.040
And therefore, the
promise of news

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.830
has been seriously undermined.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.660
In many ways, news
replaces this religion.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.280
Just as in the
olden days, you used

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.990
to go to religion and
religion would tell you

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.290
what was right and wrong, what
the important issue of the day

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.790
is.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.180
Now, we switch on the news.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.750
That will tell us
what is important,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.770
what's right and wrong.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.880
But, of course, huge
assumptions there.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.540
And just as you can be
an agnostic, a skeptic,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.560
an atheist in
relation to religion,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.894
so all those tags can
apply also for the news.

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:16.560
And I would probably
characterize myself

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.480
on the more
skeptical/agnostic/aethist end

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.160
of the business.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.950
Nevertheless, I recognize
the unbelievable importance

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.700
of this stuff.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.730
If you're planning a coup,
always drive your tanks not

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.010
to the homes of the computer
programmers, the poets,

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.880
the historians, the novelists.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.750
You take your tanks
to the news HQ

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.070
because that is where
social, political reality is

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.950
made in the consciousness
of the population.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.919
So it's an incredibly
valuable and important area.

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.460
But it's going wrong
in lots of ways.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.376
Let me run you through
some of the areas where

00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:50.900
I think it's going wrong.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.107
One of the things is
the very important stuff

00:03:53.107 --> 00:03:55.565
of life, all right, used to be
at the top of the headlines.

00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:57.106
It used to be at
the top of the news.

00:03:57.106 --> 00:03:58.870
The important
stuff is at the top

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.810
and the kind of frothy
stuff is at the bottom.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.030
The news, what is news,
should be important.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.255
And that's why we tune in.

00:04:07.255 --> 00:04:10.170
And that's why news can
command our affection.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.810
However, nowadays,
if you put something

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.760
like this on the front
page of your site

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.880
or your news bulletin, the
greatest news story on Earth,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.209
your ratings will plummet.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.740
No one is interested
in this at all.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.196
However, if you put her on,
wow, Taylor Swift, everybody's

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:26.320
interested in Taylor Swift,
particularly in shorts.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.390
This is one of the perennial
favorites of all news

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.057
organizations, endless
photos like this.

00:04:31.057 --> 00:04:32.681
OK, what are we going
to do about this?

00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:34.820
Well, one response of
many serious journalists

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.660
is to despair.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.980
They're prone to despair.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.020
And this fact really leads
them to take to the hills,

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.550
and hunker down, and
escape civilization.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.340
I'm hopeful because I know about
the history of the Renaissance.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.920
And in the Renaissance,
the Catholic Church

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.470
knew that it had an awful
lot of complex messages

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.720
to get across to people, arduous
messages, difficult messages.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.720
Really about how to live
like Jesus Christ, kind

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.640
of difficult, all about
the Gospels, et cetera.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.340
So when they set about
doing their altar

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.440
pieces of giant advertisements
for their faith,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.120
they realized that they had
to do some particular things

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.930
in order to get
the message across.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.840
So if you've got
something important to say

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.160
and you simply put it in
the hands of the bearded guy

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.640
there on the bottom right, with
a big book and the big beard,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.790
no one listens to guys
with big beards like that.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.540
You're just not going
to sell the message.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.846
That's why they took the
Taylor Swifts of the day, who

00:05:22.846 --> 00:05:25.050
are in the centerpiece,
and gave them

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.160
very lovely clothes, and
hair, and svelte appearance

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.821
in order to sell the message.

00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:32.570
So in other words,
they realized that they

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.030
were in the business
of popularization,

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.870
not merely the gathering
of important information,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.820
but it's conveyance, all
the techniques of artistry.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.100
They realized they
had to work very hard,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.400
not just to gather
what Jesus said,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.140
but to make sure
the what Jesus said

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.430
was going to be listened to.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.940
And that might
involve them getting

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.995
Giovanni Bellini to
make an altarpiece.

00:05:52.995 --> 00:05:55.120
It's kind weird because
most news organizations now

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.150
see themselves as data
driven businesses.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.314
We bring you the data,
the important facts.

00:05:59.314 --> 00:06:01.980
And we leave it on the table and
you will read it and consume it

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.750
and then you will
be overwhelmed.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.159
The Catholic Church, much wiser.

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:06.950
If you simply put the
Gospels on the table,

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.005
with the guy with the
beard, no one will listen.

00:06:09.005 --> 00:06:10.380
You need to work
a little harder.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.340
So this altarpiece is a
symbol, a metaphor if you like,

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.620
for that extra work we're
going to need to do.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.370
The other thing about
the news, of course,

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.120
is there's too much
of it, as I mentioned.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.270
But there isn't
really too much of it.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.574
What there is is stories that
keep saying they're brand new

00:06:24.574 --> 00:06:26.990
and they're never happened
before in history of the world.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.948
But in fact, of course
they've happened before.

00:06:28.948 --> 00:06:31.850
It's just we're taught
by the news organizations

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.360
not to recognize what we
could call archetypes.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.660
The news is full of archetypes.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.190
In my book I say that there
are 32 archetypes that

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.650
keep running round and round.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.080
They're the same stories.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.630
It just keeps running.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.540
The Kiev story,
it's an archetype.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.087
It's been running since 1789.

00:06:48.087 --> 00:06:49.920
Of course, the news
will never tell me that.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.320
No.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.611
For the news, it's totally new.

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:54.180
Something completely
unbelievable has happened.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.260
But it doesn't want you to
understand the threads that

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.420
are running constantly
through human life.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.690
This happens just with less
significant stories as well.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.560
Let me show you a story which
looks like lots of stories,

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.850
but in fact only one story.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.750
So there's this guy
and there's this lady.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.756
And there's these guys.

00:07:11.756 --> 00:07:13.630
Now basically, that
looks like three stories.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.230
It's about only one story
because what it's a story of is

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.310
there's Prince William,
a high and mighty guy,

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.200
wrestling with a car
seat, with a baby seat.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.390
Wow and amazing.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.240
This is Taylor Swift
again and she's

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.740
at Whole Foods buying lettuce.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.240
Amazing.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.260
A high and mighty
person buying things.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.195
And this is a high
and mighty son of God.

00:07:30.195 --> 00:07:31.950
But he's born in
humble circumstances.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.199
He could have been in a place.

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:34.090
It's the same story.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.260
It's emotional
structure is identical.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.640
But the news is
not in the business

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.380
of sharpening our eyes to the
similarities between stories,

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.532
reducing the number
of phenomena.

00:07:45.532 --> 00:07:47.240
I come from the
background of philosophy.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.932
It's all about trying to reduce
phenomena down to some noumena.

00:07:51.932 --> 00:07:53.640
The news works in the
opposite direction.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.681
Everything is always new.

00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:57.029
We've never seen it
before, et cetera.

00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:58.070
That makes life dizzying.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.240
It makes it harder to navigate.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.140
The area that we
know as foreign news,

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.670
OK, the great promise
of foreign news

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.420
used to be you send
out some reporters.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.800
You give them some
fiber optic cables.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.920
You give them a satellite.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.420
They will tell you
about stuff going

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.760
on in other parts of the world.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.850
And then people will care.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.500
They will agitate for change
and the world will improve.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.140
Nonsense.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.550
None of that happens.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.080
Last week, 200
people were killed

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.080
in fighting in the
Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.200
None of you know that.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.500
I only know that because
I'm in the business.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.490
It just washes over us.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.770
And the reason is, again,
this problem of data.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:31.760
People think.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.450
News organizations believe that
you can go out there and get

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.919
the facts, like 200 people died.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.620
And people go, oh, my goodness,
how awful, how terrible.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.950
We must do something about it.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.325
We must write to
the congressman.

00:08:41.325 --> 00:08:43.620
You don't do anything about
it because you don't care.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.578
And the reason you don't
care is why should you

00:08:45.578 --> 00:08:48.150
care about the death of 200
people whose lives you never

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.949
knew existed?

00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:50.490
You didn't know that
they were alive.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.698
So who cares if they're dead.

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:53.380
I mean it's like a mirage.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.125
If I put you in a
performance of "King Lear,"

00:08:56.125 --> 00:08:58.500
you might be weeping at the
end of a performance of "King

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.975
Lear" for a guy who
what, didn't even live.

00:09:00.975 --> 00:09:02.270
So there you are.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.550
You're weeping about
people who never lived,

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.870
written 300 years ago.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.161
And meanwhile, you're totally
indifferent about someone

00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:10.020
who did live yesterday.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.380
So what's going on?

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.260
Are we monsters?

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:12.900
Are we crazy?

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.400
No.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.270
Again, it comes back to
the fact that information

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.189
needs to enter our imaginations.

00:09:18.189 --> 00:09:19.980
And it can only do that
through a technique

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.200
which I will call art.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.190
Art is the discipline
that's designed

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.670
to get important
concepts powerfully

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.430
into our imaginations.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:33.560
And the art form that is most
relevant to news gathering

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.954
is photojournalism.

00:09:34.954 --> 00:09:36.620
I come from the
background of philosophy

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.703
and most philosophers are
quite depressive people.

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:40.940
But, boy, you haven't
met a depressed category

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.230
like photojournalists.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.490
They are really depressed.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.265
And the reason is no one is
paying for their work anymore.

00:09:46.265 --> 00:09:48.640
So people like Magnum are in
panic and all the rest of it

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.560
because the value of
photojournalism is gone.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.710
Now, what is good
photojournalism?

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:54.960
And why might we need it?

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.140
What's a good photograph?

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:56.990
What's a bad photograph?

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.900
What's a good photograph?

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.400
It is something
that you could spend

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.180
years of your life
trying to figure out.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.340
But I'm going to tell you
the answer in one second.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.060
I think that a
good photograph is

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.280
one which advances your
understanding of a situation.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.480
It's rich in information.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:09.560
OK.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.390
I don't care about the
color balance, or the field,

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.880
the thing, and
whether it's wonky.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.520
It's how much information,
new information does it carry?

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.260
And a bad photograph is
one which many confirms,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
corroborates information
which you have probably

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.560
gathered nonpictorially before.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:28.144
It's an image of corroboration,
not an advancing of knowledge.

00:10:28.144 --> 00:10:29.560
Let me show you a
good photograph.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.920
This is a good photograph taken
by a woman Stephanie Sinclair,

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.294
who spent some
time in the Yemen.

00:10:33.294 --> 00:10:35.560
She won a Pulitzer Prize
for this photo essay

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.330
on child marriage in the Yemen.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.880
Now, we think you know about
child marriage in the Yemen.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.120
But we don't really.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.495
And this photograph
tells us why.

00:10:42.495 --> 00:10:44.203
You see when you look
at that photograph,

00:10:44.203 --> 00:10:45.990
you realize that
it's not children.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.110
It's not girls getting
married to men.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.902
Those aren't girls.

00:10:48.902 --> 00:10:51.235
If you look at their faces,
these are little old ladies.

00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:54.080
The trauma of what they've been
through has aged them 40 years.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.666
And similarly, the
men are not men.

00:10:55.666 --> 00:10:57.040
They don't, you
know, in command.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.664
These are boys.

00:10:57.664 --> 00:10:58.980
These are lost boys.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.184
It's far more poignant,
weird, disturbing

00:11:01.184 --> 00:11:02.350
than one might have thought.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.060
So this is a picture
rich in information.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.560
It's bringing you
something that you

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.250
didn't know without the picture.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.990
And we need to make
a case for that,

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.440
for good photographs as
bearers of information.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.915
This is true in all areas.

00:11:13.915 --> 00:11:16.040
I mean this is a bad
photograph of President Obama.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.360
It's a dead photograph.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.360
The reason it's dead is
you don't learn anything

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.144
about the guy.

00:11:20.144 --> 00:11:21.560
Everything you
knew about this guy

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.117
is not advanced one iota
by seeing this photograph.

00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:25.950
Here's a good photograph
of President Obama.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.880
This was taken by Pete Souza,
who is the White House press

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.750
photographer.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.960
Now, we know that Obama lies all
the time, lies to get elected.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.010
We didn't know that
Obama lies in order

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.670
to please the child
of a White House

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.969
staffer, who is into Spiderman.

00:11:37.969 --> 00:11:40.260
And that's kind of charming,
and cute, and interesting.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.093
And hm, yeah, great.

00:11:41.093 --> 00:11:43.670
So there's stuff going on here.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.530
And that's good photography.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.180
So good photography is
a route to information,

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.045
having its proper
due impact on us.

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:57.260
But let me move on now to
kind of an awkward topic.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.364
You guys seem really nice.

00:11:58.364 --> 00:11:59.780
And on a good day,
I'm quite nice.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.540
And people out there
seem quite nice.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.250
And it's very easy to think that
people are quite nice until you

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.830
read a news article and you
go, as they say in the trade,

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.197
below the line and you find
out about the comments, what

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:13.280
people are saying, what
all the people are saying,

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.800
on social media too.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.145
And then you're in for a
shock because you realize then

00:12:17.145 --> 00:12:18.520
that actually
people aren't nice.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.640
They're crazy, vindictive,
bitter, angry, furious, just

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.270
insane.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.750
This is some comments I found
at the bottom of a "Guardian"

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:30.750
article on the chancellor of
the Exchequer, the money guy

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.240
at the British government.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.169
He's very much hated.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:34.210
People are insulting him.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.110
One guy wants to put a
pillow over his face.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:39.080
The other one wants to
kick him up the thing.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:39.907
It's violent.

00:12:39.907 --> 00:12:40.490
It derogatory.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.170
You have this in
the States as well.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:43.420
This is the modern phenomena.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.995
People go celebrate
social media,

00:12:44.995 --> 00:12:46.546
how lovely it is
about social media.

00:12:46.546 --> 00:12:47.920
Then you find this
is what you're

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.110
hearing about social media.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.901
So what's going on?

00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:51.010
Are we crazy as a species?

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:51.510
No.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:52.870
No, We're not crazy.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.279
We just writing our
journals in public.

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.070
You know how it is when
you keep a journal.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.820
And you've got a bad day.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.450
And then you go up
to your bedroom.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.952
And you take our your journal.

00:13:01.952 --> 00:13:03.160
And you say, I've had enough.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.951
I'm killing myself.

00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:04.710
I hate everybody.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:05.630
I hate myself.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.970
I'm a loser, everybody's thing.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.712
And your tears are
mixing with the ink.

00:13:09.712 --> 00:13:11.420
And it's all very
poignant and emotional.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.128
I'm just being a little
autobiographical.

00:13:13.128 --> 00:13:15.610
And you put the journal away.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.942
Then you rejoin group life.

00:13:16.942 --> 00:13:18.650
And it's very, very
important that no one

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.260
knows what you wrote
in that journal.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.640
Because if they do, they can't
look at you the same way again.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.860
It's really bad information
to know about you.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.650
So you got to keep that private.

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:29.670
Now, I believe the same
holds true in a way

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:30.920
with these comments.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.810
These are just journal entries.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.340
And because we've got to get
out there, and trust people,

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.820
and love, and do
business with people,

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.210
it's really important that
we don't know certain things

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.760
about our fellow human beings.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.310
Because if we do, it'll make
a lot of things very hard.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.790
So I don't know if you
guys are working on this.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:50.620
But I have serious doubts
about the social validity

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.137
of some of these comments.

00:13:52.137 --> 00:13:54.470
We're not quite understanding
what they do to our minds.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.260
But we're living in communities.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.840
And this is giving
us information

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.673
about communities we
might not want to hear.

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:02.420
So something to bear in mind.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.880
Look, here's something
else now about the news.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.240
This is a guy and his
five-year-old son.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.470
And shortly after this
picture was taken,

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.490
the man took this
boy and his sister,

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.630
who is a couple of years older,
he took them into his car.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.750
And he stabbed them with a knife
and then he killed himself.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.040
And this took place in a little
lane in the south of England.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.810
And the car was found a few
days later, with the bodies,

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.310
and the blood everywhere.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.050
And when this story ran in the
world's most popular English

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.720
language website, which is
called the "MailOnline," which

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.989
none of you have
ever read I hope,

00:14:33.989 --> 00:14:35.530
so when this ran in
the "MailOnline,"

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.360
this was the most popular story
that they ran two years ago.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:38.960
OK.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.630
So what's going on?

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.130
Are we sick?

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:40.860
Are we mad?

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.960
What are we doing?

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.371
Will we care, how horrible, ugh.

00:14:44.371 --> 00:14:45.120
What are we doing?

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.090
OK, let's go to Aristotle, who
has some interesting insights.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.920
Now, Aristotle, in
the 4th century BC,

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.430
was very aware that his fellow
Athenians did a weird thing

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.230
every year.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.280
They went out and
looked at tragedies,

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.190
plays by Sophocles
and Euripides,

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.920
on the foothills
of the Acropolis.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.810
They looked at
this sort of stuff.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.020
They looked at stories
of incest, and of murder,

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.047
and all kinds of
disastrous events.

00:15:06.047 --> 00:15:07.880
And Aristotle made a
very fascinating point.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.130
He said look, it is horrific.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:10.840
It is ghastly.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:16.910
But properly appreciating
the dynamics within tragedy

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.020
is part of the
civilizing process.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.640
An education in
horror has a role

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.250
to play in symbolizing
in civilizing

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.470
you, a very weird point.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:26.886
Now, why is Aristotle
saying this?

00:15:26.886 --> 00:15:29.990
Because he felt that in the
hands of a great tragedian,

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:34.250
like Sophocles or Euripides, a
story can be told in such a way

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.776
that rather than
calling the guy who

00:15:35.776 --> 00:15:37.150
has murdered his
family a weirdo,

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.060
or a nut case, or
et cetera, you start

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.550
to see something very,
very frightening indeed.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.320
Which is that all of us
are capable of anything

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.966
if pushed in a certain way.

00:15:46.966 --> 00:15:49.340
That all of us are capable of
doing this to our children,

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:49.970
for example.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.480
And I know it
sounds unreasonable.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.860
But that's what he believed.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.190
And I think he was right.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.240
We are on the edge of a
precipice all of time.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.320
And when we don't
do these things

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.140
it's because we've not
been pushed hard enough

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.931
or we've been blessed
by a certain capacity

00:16:00.931 --> 00:16:01.890
for self-restraint.

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:02.640
But it's there.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.130
The fear should be there.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.960
So we should feel pity
for the tragic hero,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.180
who has ruined his or her life.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.200
And we should feel
fear for ourselves,

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.800
how close we come
to the precipice.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.060
All of that is available.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.920
And as so often
happens in the news,

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.640
the news takes us to
an interesting place

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.000
and then doesn't capitalize.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.210
The news is full of
undigested meals.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.000
It is full of raw
ingredients that

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.810
have not been properly combined.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:31.120
And one of its mainstays,
which is tragic news,

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.560
is on the precipice, on the edge
of something very interesting.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.202
And it doesn't take us to
the most interesting thing.

00:16:37.202 --> 00:16:38.910
This also goes on with
this, car crashes.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.215
I mean car crashes
are hugely popular.

00:16:41.215 --> 00:16:42.590
Everybody loves
a good car crash.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:43.923
The news loves a good car crash.

00:16:43.923 --> 00:16:46.569
There's been snow, a
massive pile-up, many dead.

00:16:46.569 --> 00:16:48.110
But of course as
you'll know, nothing

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.690
beats this, a really
good plane crash,

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.460
preferably a wide-bodied
airliner, huge explosion,

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.040
fireball, and many dead,
off the scale popular.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.350
Again, are we monsters?

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.900
No.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.570
We're searching for
the meaning of life.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:00.790
In looking at
these things, we're

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.320
searching for the
meaning of life.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.069
Back in the Middle Ages, it
used to be a classic piece

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:09.780
of Interior decoration to
put a skull on your table

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.410
or have a picture of
a skull on your wall.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:13.290
Why?

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.369
Because the thought of
death, the reminder of death,

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.460
is a very important
part of leading

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.760
you to focus on what
is important in life.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.880
So it is not in order to
make life meaningless.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.930
But it is in order to
try and separate out

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.013
the things that are
meaningful and the things that

00:17:31.013 --> 00:17:32.150
are less rich in meaning.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.770
And in a way, these are
our modern memento mores.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.430
These are our modern
skulls on a table.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.590
We don't really
use them as such.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.716
So again, we're not quite
using the information

00:17:43.716 --> 00:17:45.090
which is on the
edge of something

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:50.311
very interesting in the
way that it should be used.

00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:50.810
Look.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:52.976
At the end of the day, what
the news is trying to do

00:17:52.976 --> 00:17:54.650
a lot of the time
is terrifying us.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:58.050
It's trying to suggest that we
cannot survive and that there

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:01.050
are bad things on the
horizon, bird flu, a snowfall.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.680
I mean my goodness, the snow.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.080
Everything that is supposed to
be bad is coming on the horizon

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.970
and we are meant
to be terrified.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.050
And that's why when we break
down on a cold, dark night

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.400
and we have to go and seek
out the help of a stranger,

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.820
we know that we are going to
be chopped up in small pieces

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.220
and put in the trunk because
we have read the news.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.719
And we know that
everybody out there

00:18:20.719 --> 00:18:23.160
is a serial killer, a murderer,
or a pedophile, et cetera.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.080
And then we come across
a stunning realization

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.490
that, of course,
people are really nice.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.391
And always go, oh, I
was stuck in a snowdrift

00:18:28.391 --> 00:18:30.140
and you know what,
people are really nice.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.431
Of course, they're really nice.

00:18:31.431 --> 00:18:34.470
We've got an unbelievably
crooked sense of statistics.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.430
By its very nature,
news overrepresents

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:38.890
the weird, dark stuff.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.850
But because it's
on all the time,

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:44.470
we tend to think nowadays that
the weird, dark stuff is us.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:45.950
It precisely isn't us.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:47.130
That's why it's in the news.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.740
But we miss that
very basic point.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:54.050
The human brain is very bad at
holding on to this distinction.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.850
And it matters a
lot because the news

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.500
start to influence
what we think it

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.060
means to live among Americans.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.146
What are Americans like?

00:19:00.146 --> 00:19:01.520
Well, they're on
the whole crazy.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.103
And they shoot people
in huge numbers.

00:19:03.103 --> 00:19:05.150
And, well, that's because
we've read the news.

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:06.330
So it's very harmful.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.100
There's very little
of our information

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.410
nowadays that is gathered
through our own senses,

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:12.670
through our own experiences.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:16.460
We have offloaded the task
of making up our minds

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:20.510
in large measure to people
like the news industry,

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.800
like the "New York Times."

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.240
Think of that asinine
comment, asinine strap line,

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.170
"all the news that's
fit to print."

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.200
If ever there was a
more hubristic comment.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.747
All the news, are
you sure, are you

00:19:30.747 --> 00:19:33.080
really sure you've got all
the news that's fit to print?

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.080
Oh, yes, yes, absolutely.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.470
We've gone out there and
we looked at everything.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:35.970
All right.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.320
So anything, anything
happening in Wall Street,

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.870
a few blocks from your offices?

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.170
This is 2006.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.040
And he goes anything
happening at all?

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.350
Oh, it all seems fine, yeah.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.280
And Ben Bernanke told
us it's all fine.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.560
And we're over-- OK, great.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.440
So you just walked past the most
major calamity, systemic errors

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.900
in the banking crisis, all
the news that's fit to print.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.740
It is not "the news."

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.640
It is some news,
gathered together,

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.370
often by very mediocre
people, in a hurry,

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.270
drinking cups of
Styrofoam coffee,

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:03.592
and not thinking too hard.

00:20:03.592 --> 00:20:05.300
And they've scooped
up this stuff for you

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.990
in order to make reality
seem like it has a narrative.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.960
It's full of holes and errors.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.180
And we just have to keep
our eyes open all the time.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.694
Look, I was talking about fear.

00:20:14.694 --> 00:20:16.610
The other thing, of
course, the news sometimes

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.580
does is to make us
hopeful, particularly

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.890
around the area of
science and technology.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.290
You guys will know about this.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.164
That's why you guys are
in the news so often.

00:20:24.164 --> 00:20:27.820
The news is to the best friend
of science and technology.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.000
Because it's all
about saying that we

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.590
are advancing towards
a sunlit uplands.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:35.020
And so soon, very, very soon,
everything will be solved,

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.400
all human problems
will be solved.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.931
This is the kind of progeny
of the Enlightenment dream.

00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:41.930
And that's why the news
is constantly telling us

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.140
that if you drink more cranberry
juice or less cranberry juice,

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.834
or have walnuts
before desert, or have

00:20:46.834 --> 00:20:48.250
an aspirin, or
[INAUDIBLE], you'll

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.446
delay Alzheimer's
or kidney diseases.

00:20:50.446 --> 00:20:51.570
This is like a major thing.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.944
There's a constant story going
round and round and round.

00:20:53.944 --> 00:20:56.640
And what the news is not telling
you is you're going to die.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.135
Whatever happens, you will die.

00:20:58.135 --> 00:20:58.635
OK.

00:20:58.635 --> 00:21:00.260
This is this vital
piece of information

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.410
that has been delayed.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.795
So death, it seems like a rumor.

00:21:02.795 --> 00:21:04.920
It comes from a airliner
or a car crash, et cetera.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.628
It's not telling you
that-- and the thing

00:21:06.628 --> 00:21:08.576
that the news
replaced, these guys,

00:21:08.576 --> 00:21:09.950
all right, for
all their faults--

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.810
I'm speaking to you
as a Jewish atheist--

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.690
these guys at least
knew that it was coming.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:19.090
And they reconciled it to
you in a sober context.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.300
It was not going
to be by surprise.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.100
The news does not induct
us into the steady state

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.280
of the human condition,
which is death

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.310
is inevitable,
around 80 years old.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.810
OK.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.160
There's going to be no
discoveries unless Google

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.040
has something we don't know.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.340
But, you know.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:34.840
OK.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.750
The other area is celebrity.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.990
Now, celebrity news
upsets a lot of people.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.429
Because when we think
about celebrity news--

00:21:42.429 --> 00:21:44.470
when serious people gather
together late at night

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.502
and worry about the condition
of the human soul, they think,

00:21:47.502 --> 00:21:49.710
oh, yes, we live in a culture
where the kids are only

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.550
interested in celebrity news.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.292
And this kind of lady here
doesn't add to the argument.

00:21:54.292 --> 00:21:55.000
I mean it's true.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.240
Yeah.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.721
There's a lot of
this stuff around.

00:21:56.721 --> 00:21:58.220
So what are we going
to do about it?

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.428
Well, the thing to do is to
get rid of celebrity news

00:22:00.428 --> 00:22:01.720
and just live quietly.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.580
Now, my view is we can't.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.060
Celebrity is really important.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.800
We need celebrities.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.050
We need to admire.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.100
We need role models.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.100
Every functioning society,
every functioning civilization

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:12.940
has had role models.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.470
You can't do away with them.

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:17.049
We don't know how to be
without looking at others

00:22:17.049 --> 00:22:18.590
and modelling our
behavior on theirs.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:19.690
It's very normal.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:22.130
We need to adjust to it.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:24.550
So the thing to do is not
to get rid of celebrities,

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:27.544
but to find our way to the
right sort of celebrities.

00:22:27.544 --> 00:22:28.710
How are we going to do that?

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.160
Well, you can see
sort of hints of this.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.780
The other day, Natalie Portman
took her son to the park.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.360
OK.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.990
And it's really boring going
to the park with your child.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.750
I don't know if you've got kids.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:40.610
It's cold.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:41.909
And then it's so boring.

00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:44.450
And it's quite nice to think,
well, I took my kid to the park

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:45.910
and so did Natalie Portman.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:46.780
That's pretty nice.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:47.280
Yeah.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.970
So the light of glamor
shines for a few moments

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.525
on an ordinary activity.

00:22:52.525 --> 00:22:53.400
And that's very good.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.080
So for a small moment, Natalie
has become Saint Natalie

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.520
of taking your
child to the park.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.330
And, of course, these
guys who came before

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:03.230
knew that the role of saints
is to bolster behavior

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.570
in areas where it
needs bolstering.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:06.920
So we need celebrities.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.500
We just need the right sort.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.440
And the problem is that
the high-minded types who

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.577
run the more high-minded
news organizations

00:23:13.577 --> 00:23:14.910
are not interested in celebrity.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.030
They think it's bad.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.680
And so what do we end up with?

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.499
We end up with celebrities,
but celebrities

00:23:19.499 --> 00:23:21.290
that were made-- and
celebrities are always

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.200
made-- by news
organizations of the lowest

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.054
common denominator sought.

00:23:26.054 --> 00:23:27.220
So let's brain up celebrity.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:33.430
We should have some celebrities
of a more ambitious nature.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.190
Now, here's something
else that the news

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:36.270
does to us all the time.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.760
And we should be ready for it.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.520
You'll know this guy, won't
you, working in the industry?

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.880
You know who he is?

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.380
Yeah.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:43.879
OK.

00:23:43.879 --> 00:23:45.629
So here's this man, Elon Musk.

00:23:45.629 --> 00:23:46.920
And he's very, very successful.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.040
Here's his wife.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.420
And he's got now five children.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.878
And he's just doing
amazing things.

00:23:50.878 --> 00:23:51.720
And he's just great.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.590
And often you get a Sunday
supplement or a Saturday--

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:56.920
you know weekend magazine.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.900
And there will be
a story about Elon

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.349
at home with his
kids, a nice piece.

00:24:02.349 --> 00:24:04.890
Or maybe Elon's-- I don't know--
discovered how to cook pasta

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:05.431
or something.

00:24:05.431 --> 00:24:08.330
And we're supposed to be
interested and charmed

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:12.060
and then put the newspaper
down and get on with our lives.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.280
How on Earth are we
going to do that?

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.870
It used to be the
case in the news

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.610
when there was kind of
strobe lighting or something,

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.318
there would be a
warning coming up going,

00:24:19.318 --> 00:24:21.780
strobe lighting coming,
or look away, et cetera.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:26.470
There should be a major warning,
envy, envy warning, right?

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.480
Many stories in the news
drive us insane with envy

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.620
because we live in
meritocratic, mobile societies,

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.150
where, if you've
got a good idea,

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.200
or you could be the
next Larry, et cetera.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.200
So it's constantly tantalizing
us, the sense of possibility.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.079
And it's the news that
brings us this information.

00:24:45.079 --> 00:24:46.620
The thing is that
we still live under

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.710
a Judeo-Christian heritage
which thinks very badly of envy.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:53.720
You're not supposed to think
about envy, a very bad person.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.040
The thing is about envy,
envy is really important.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.530
It's really important to be
envious quite a lot of the time

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.900
because envy is a
confused, but in some

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.825
ways telling story about
who you want to be.

00:25:05.825 --> 00:25:08.200
And the thing to do with envy
is rather than squashing it

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.450
and pretending everything's
fine and it doesn't exist,

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.240
you need to analyze
your envy to sort out

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.698
the wheat from the
chaff and to get

00:25:13.698 --> 00:25:17.190
to the root of what the
envy might be telling you.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.370
I recommend that we
keep an envy diary

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.990
where we see the patterns
of all the people

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:24.280
who have made us envious
over the last day.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.250
And we gather this up.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:27.250
And we'll see patterns emerging.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.945
When I start to analyze
my envy for Elon Musk,

00:25:29.945 --> 00:25:33.330
I realize I don't really what
I found Paypal or be there

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.700
when e-Bay was starting.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.860
That's not really me.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.490
And his wife is very
nice, but so is mine.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:41.590
So it's not really that.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.620
But why I really admire this
guy is that he's courageous.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.000
He's unbelievable.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.810
Time and time again,
he's got an idea.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:48.980
Everybody thinks he's crazy.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.876
And he goes for it
and he bets big time.

00:25:50.876 --> 00:25:52.000
That's the honorable thing.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.370
That's what I want
to learn from that.

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:54.860
The news is not in the
business of doing that.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.310
It's just telling us how he's
cooking pasta or his latest

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.390
project on Mars.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.540
The information
is presented to us

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.240
without any
understanding of what

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.220
it's doing to us, making
us crazy with envy,

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.096
or how we might
transcend that envy

00:26:07.096 --> 00:26:08.470
and take it
somewhere productive.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.550
So again, what you'll
notice through everything

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.250
I've been saying
is the news isn't

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.220
totally on the wrong thing.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.220
It's just constantly not doing
some key moves that it should

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.160
be doing to render the
information that it presents

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.910
to us effective.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:26.180
It's stalled at the
last minute before doing

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.670
something interesting.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:29.045
Now, look, here's
something else.

00:26:29.045 --> 00:26:31.620
I want to talk about
bias now in news.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:35.280
Now, bias in news has got
a really bad reputation.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.380
And when we think of a
bad news organization,

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.910
we'll think of like Fox
News or the "MailOnline"

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:43.845
very biased sources
of information.

00:26:43.845 --> 00:26:45.470
And when we think of
good news sources,

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:48.860
we'll think high-minded
people, and those guys at NPR,

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.510
very balanced sort of people,
or maybe the guys on the BBC.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:55.600
I mean the BBC, it's for my
country, but it's everywhere.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.370
They're the most
high-minded organization.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:59.260
And they do not present
bias because what

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.290
they do when they present
the news is they just

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:04.850
like to say that they're
giving you the information,

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:07.630
and then they're giving
you opposing viewpoints,

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:09.830
and they're leaving it to
you to make up your mind.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:12.529
So if they're doing a feature
on genital mutilation,

00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:14.945
they'll get someone who's very
against genital mutilation.

00:27:14.945 --> 00:27:16.570
And in the interest
of balance, they'll

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:18.330
get someone who's
pro-genital mutilation.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.871
If they're doing a
story on genocide,

00:27:19.871 --> 00:27:22.016
well, someone who's
very pro-genocide,

00:27:22.016 --> 00:27:24.140
anti-genocide, just to get
both sides of the story.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.421
The only time they ever came off
the fence was over apartheid.

00:27:27.421 --> 00:27:29.420
After much soul searching,
they thought about it

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.110
and then they realized
apartheid was a bad thing.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.443
And they were going to say that.

00:27:32.443 --> 00:27:34.871
But until then, they're just
leaving it to us viewers

00:27:34.871 --> 00:27:35.370
to look.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:39.022
And that's a characteristic of
high-minded news organizations

00:27:39.022 --> 00:27:39.730
around the world.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:40.810
It's disastrous.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.380
We do not need a lack of bias.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.480
We need good bias.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.470
What is bias?

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.880
Bias is simply a way
of evaluating data.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.000
Trying to work out what
does it mean, what should

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.730
a reasonable person think,
where's it going, et cetera.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:55.780
If I told you that President
Obama is weighing up

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.180
whether to build that pipeline
between the tar sands of Canada

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.790
and the Gulf of Mexico
and then I said,

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:01.540
well, look, I'm just
giving you the facts.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:02.730
You make up your own mind.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.380
You want to go no, come on,
you've been thinking about it.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.050
You're the BBC.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:07.420
Just tell me what
should I think?

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.290
The BBC's line is
very patronizing.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:13.040
It sort of assumes that the
audience is incredibly easily

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.030
influenced.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.890
And whatever is said to them,
they'll kind of bowled over

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:20.085
And could go jump off a
cliff if told to by somebody.

00:28:20.085 --> 00:28:21.460
So the very
important thing to do

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.990
is not to tell them anything.

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:25.590
But, of course, most of us, ever
since we've been sort 3 or 4

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.990
are so good at filtering
out bias that we don't like.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.349
When your parents told you
it's fish fingers time.

00:28:31.349 --> 00:28:32.640
Come and sit down at the table.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.580
No, it's not.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.950
We are very good at blocking out
any lesson that we don't want.

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:38.930
This is just second
nature, right?

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:44.840
We are very good at recognition
and also blocking it.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.790
We need a take on
the big questions.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.580
We need the media not
just to present us

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.490
with a narrow range
of information.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.030
All this comes to the fore with
the financial crisis, which

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:59.120
is just the key because it
happened in living memory.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.600
It's a key moment when
information gathering failed

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.520
on a spectacular scale, an
information interpretation.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.125
Despite the unbelievable
plethora of news outlets,

00:29:10.125 --> 00:29:11.697
the story didn't get through.

00:29:11.697 --> 00:29:14.030
The story that there was a
systemic problem in the banks

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.470
didn't get through.

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:19.700
Part of the reason for that
is the agenda was very narrow.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.200
If you talk to news
journalists now,

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.480
they'll go, well,
everything's fine in our world

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.790
because anyone, anyone
can publish a newspaper.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.410
Anyone can set up
a Twitter account.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:31.440
And you want to go,
yeah, of course they can.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.074
But only very, very few
people ever get listened to.

00:29:34.074 --> 00:29:35.490
So this argument
about like, well,

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.540
everybody's got a Twitter
account, yeah, sure.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.810
Everybody's got 50 followers.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.290
Only a very few people have
got 49 million followers.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:44.120
So this is really
the difference.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.870
And the problem with
the financial world

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.780
and the financial crisis is that
it wasn't properly analyzed.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.820
We do not have a
media in this country,

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.440
or in many countries,
that properly

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.235
analyzes the way
the economy works.

00:29:57.235 --> 00:29:59.610
And it sound striking because
how could that be possible?

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.372
Well, it's possible
because you've

00:30:02.372 --> 00:30:03.580
got the proof of the pudding.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.390
You hear outrage
out in the street.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.320
Think of the Occupy
Movement, OK.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.460
The Occupy Movement
is the progeny

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.590
of our news organizations.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:16.990
In other words, it generates
outrage and total confusion.

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.647
These guys are outraged.

00:30:18.647 --> 00:30:19.730
They want to do something.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:20.570
They're very nice.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:21.871
They're very lovely people.

00:30:21.871 --> 00:30:24.370
And in a few weeks, the police
will come along and hose them

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:25.030
down.

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:27.080
And nothing will
happen because in order

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.870
to change the world, as you
guys know, you need ideas.

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.210
Passion is not enough.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:34.230
You need passion plus ideas.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:37.640
It is to some extent the
responsibility of the news

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.860
to give us those ideas.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:40.440
It didn't.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.680
These guys were
starved of ideas.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.530
Part of the problem
is that the news

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:48.700
keeps thinking that the
problems of the world

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.130
can neatly be identified
with a few bad apples.

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:54.100
If you open the hearts
of most journalists,

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.870
you will find inscribed on their
heart the word "Watergate."

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:01.090
Watergate remains the
most mesmeric occasion

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:01.920
for journalists.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.570
Because it involves things that
they love, right, a secret.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:08.610
A chance for the journalists
to behave like a spy

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.780
and go in and find
the secret, and then

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.070
the humiliation of the powerful.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:14.680
They just live for this stuff.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.082
The problem is very nice.

00:31:16.082 --> 00:31:17.540
The problem is most
of the problems

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.240
in the world do not
fit that paradigm.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.290
You're not going to
catch the problems

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:23.640
if you think it's a secret.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.770
The real problem is that
many of the things that

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:27.820
are most wrong with the
world are not secrets.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.920
All this stuff about Edward
Snowden, et cetera, nonsense.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.280
The really important
information is in public hands.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.337
You know it already.

00:31:34.337 --> 00:31:35.920
The thing is it's
not pulled together.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.240
It's not analyzed properly.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.602
So it's about
getting the nasty guy

00:31:39.602 --> 00:31:40.810
and putting the handcuffs on.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:44.390
It's about analyzing the
systemic faults in our society.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:46.445
And this, the news
is very bad at doing.

00:31:46.445 --> 00:31:48.320
Look, I'm just going to
pull it together now.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.690
But the fundamental
assumption of news

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.440
is the most important
things in the world

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.340
have happened very recently.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.240
I mean I'm just being
childishly simple.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.531
But that is the basis, right.

00:32:00.531 --> 00:32:03.030
The most important things have
happened relatively recently,

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:05.321
possibly since the last
bulletin or since the last time

00:32:05.321 --> 00:32:06.420
you checked Twitter.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:10.130
Now, that is sometimes
very true, sometimes very,

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:12.710
very true, but almost never.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:15.650
It's very rarely true that the
most important things in life

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:17.950
happened very recently.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.590
Mankind has a very,
very long history.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:21.630
And there are lots and
lots of truth way back.

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:25.820
Those truths are news because
news is really important stuff

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.980
that no one's thinking about.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.840
So "Plato's Republic," which no
one is thinking about, is news.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.390
It's in a way as
much news as what's

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.547
going on in Kiev
because it's important

00:32:37.547 --> 00:32:38.880
and no one is thinking about it.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.620
And it needs to be
brought to our attention.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.080
But the news doesn't
recognize that.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.640
I mean, boy, if you advance that
argument with the average news

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.300
editor, they'll-- well,
they'll have you marched out

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.050
of the building.

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:50.167
So we need to bear that in mind.

00:32:50.167 --> 00:32:52.750
We need to bear that it's called
the news, but it's some news.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.541
At the end of the day,
we have to make sure

00:32:54.541 --> 00:32:57.580
that Wi-Fi never
arrives on airplanes.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.290
Because we need time, all
of us, to try and find out

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.510
the news from other
sources, other

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.690
than these
mass-produced machines

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:06.980
called newspapers,
websites, et cetera.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.814
We need to find out the news
from ourselves, from inside.

00:33:09.814 --> 00:33:12.230
I mean part of the problem of
news is it's so respectable.

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:13.690
It's so prestigious.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:16.460
If you're sitting down at
home on a Sunday morning

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.500
and somebody says, so
what are you doing?

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.071
You go, I'm reading the news.

00:33:20.071 --> 00:33:20.570
All right.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.990
Oh, carry on reading the news.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:25.240
And if you go a bit of you
know-- rerun that scenario,

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.315
so what are you doing?

00:33:26.315 --> 00:33:28.410
Well, I'm just sitting out of
the window and kind of-- I'm

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:28.980
remembering something.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.790
When I was 12 and I had a kind
of insight when a breeze was--

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:33.530
Come on, get and
do the washing up.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:37.057
It's simply not respectable to
daydream, to free associate.

00:33:37.057 --> 00:33:38.640
And yet, of course,
as we know, that's

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.404
where often the
insights are made.

00:33:40.404 --> 00:33:41.320
That's when they come.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.870
Without noticing, there
are lots of things

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:44.536
that don't make it
in the news this guy.

00:33:44.536 --> 00:33:45.580
He makes it in the news.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:46.740
But he's out there.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:50.380
He's a metaphor for a lot of
the stuff that we keep missing.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.161
Here's a little
autobiographical endpoint.

00:33:52.161 --> 00:33:53.410
I'm a philosopher by training.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.760
And philosophers really
think they're right, right?

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.130
They're an embattled minority.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:58.620
But they really think
they have the truth.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.270
And they're going to go
to their deaths with it.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:02.241
The problem is no one
cares and no one listens.

00:34:02.241 --> 00:34:04.740
The average work of academic
philosophy in the United States

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:08.699
sells under 300 copies,
under the 300 copies,

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:10.800
important information,
300 copies.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.830
And I mentioned
the "MailOnline,"

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:15.670
the English language's most
popular global website,

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:18.570
the "MailOnline," 40
million hits a day.

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:20.824
So 40 million hits
a day and 300.

00:34:20.824 --> 00:34:22.199
That's the world
we're living in.

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:23.050
That's the kind of challenge.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:24.050
Anyway, I was
having a late night

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:25.020
chat with some
philosopher friends

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.969
and we were tossing
these ideas around.

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:30.550
And then one insomniac night,
I was thinking about this.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:32.489
And I thought, OK,
look, why don't we

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:35.639
get some philosophers to
rewrite the "MailOnline?"

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:38.530
We'll use all the same stories,
all the dramas, the disasters,

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:42.310
et cetera, except we won't
have their slant towards kind

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.409
of racism, and
bigotry, and melodrama.

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:46.570
We'll look at truth, and
complexity, and subtlety,

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:47.580
and justice, et cetera.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.510
And we'll start a
new news outlet.

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:50.250
So we did that.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.730
And it's called "The
Philosophers' Mail."

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.822
And you can see it at
philosophersmail.com.

00:34:55.822 --> 00:34:58.260
And it's in many ways
a practical application

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:01.010
of many of the ideas that
are worked out theoretically

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.570
in my book.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.810
I recommend it to you.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.937
Now on that note,
some questions.

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:07.270
Thank you so much for listening.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.285
But come back with
your questions.

00:35:09.285 --> 00:35:09.785
Thank you.

00:35:09.785 --> 00:35:11.240
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:14.721 --> 00:35:17.220
AUDIENCE: I think you may be a
little optimistic about bias.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.920
I mean areas where
I know the story,

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.620
I find that you either
get Democrat news

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.744
or you get Republican news.

00:35:22.744 --> 00:35:25.390
You don't get honest news.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:25.890
Yeah.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.440
I can pick lots of areas I know.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.540
But one area I'll pick is why
is it in the United States

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:36.140
that we only get only
part of what's going on,

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.019
even in Israel?

00:35:38.019 --> 00:35:39.560
I mean you can't
see the stories that

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.080
show up in "Haaretz," in the US.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.144
I mean you'd have
people accusing you

00:35:43.144 --> 00:35:44.060
of all sorts of stuff.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.732
Nobody in the US
Congress have the courage

00:35:46.732 --> 00:35:48.190
to say what's
happens in "Haaretz."

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:48.810
Why is that?

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:49.290
ALAIN DE BOTTON: Yeah.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.665
Look, I think part
of the problem

00:35:50.665 --> 00:35:54.890
is that-- you said it's
left wing, right wing bias.

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:57.220
I mean it's crazy that at
this stage in civilization,

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:00.540
we're still dominated by this
idea of left wing, right wing

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.420
bias.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.000
Can we just have
a bit more bias?

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.170
I mean let's imagine we
had a Buddhist bias, OK.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:07.590
So what's Buddhist bias?

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.930
So the Buddha, the
five-fold truths, et cetera,

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:11.680
there's a take on the world.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.660
Imagine reading the news
through a Buddhist lens.

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.990
You could do that.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:18.219
And it would pick out
all sorts of things.

00:36:18.219 --> 00:36:20.510
Imagine reading the news
through a psychoanalytic lens.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:23.090
Imagine reading the
news through a lens

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:25.040
where the sensibility
of Walt Whitman

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.970
would be programmed
into the machine.

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:28.951
And you would start to
see the sort of things

00:36:28.951 --> 00:36:31.450
that Walt Whitman might picked
up and been-- in other words,

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:33.860
we're at the dawn of bias.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.080
So I agree with you.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.370
We're getting such a limited
set of biases around Israel.

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:42.230
But I don't think
the answer is, well,

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:43.750
we're getting the
right wing bias

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:45.500
and I wish we could
have left wing bias.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.410
I mean let's open it up.

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:50.881
There's a lot of other kind
of perspectives we could have.

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:56.520
AUDIENCE: I love all your
works, especially the ones

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.150
that you did earlier.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:59.310
I'm wondering how you did--

00:36:59.310 --> 00:36:59.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:00.950
ALAIN DE BOTTON: I'll
remain stoic on that.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:01.450
That's OK.

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.317
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:03.317 --> 00:37:04.400
Anyone likes to hear that.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.630
It's like someone saying
to you, you look great.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:08.850
But you looked better younger.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:09.930
But you look great.

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:10.430
Yeah.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.846
Great.

00:37:10.846 --> 00:37:11.346
Yeah.

00:37:11.346 --> 00:37:12.504
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:37:12.504 --> 00:37:15.170
AUDIENCE: Specifically referring
to "Consolations of Philosophy"

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:17.690
and Proust's book.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:19.850
But how do you
determine your topic?

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:25.400
Because you covered a
range of topics, travel,

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.840
I guess work, love,
different direct statement

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.100
on philosophies.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.090
And my second
question is are there

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.920
any works that you're
particularly proud of

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.945
or particularly sort
of not proud of?

00:37:38.945 --> 00:37:39.861
ALAIN DE BOTTON: Good.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:44.910
So, look, I think
what really motivates

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:48.090
me is what I could broadly
called emotional intelligence.

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:50.030
There's all kinds of
visions of intelligence.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:52.420
I'm interested in the
emotional intelligence part.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.280
And that's broadly
speaking, wisdom,

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.280
a very [INAUDIBLE] time.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:55.970
What is wisdom?

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:59.340
Wisdom is the part of knowledge
that is not merely true,

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.030
but is also useful and helpful.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:02.790
And I'm very interested
in that tradition,

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:04.500
which is a neglected tradition.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.910
And I'm from the
humanities background.

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:11.005
And my interest is in reading
the history of culture,

00:38:11.005 --> 00:38:15.190
the history of the humanities,
with an eye to wisdom

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:16.830
and pulling that stuff out.

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:20.080
And I'm interested
in how to get it

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.220
to have an impact in the world.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:27.220
And when I'm in despair
in the middle of night,

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:30.790
I sometimes think, ah,
do books do anything?

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:32.530
What should I be doing?

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:34.220
So a few years ago
I founded a school,

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.190
called the School of Life.

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:36.100
It's going really well.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.030
We're opening branches
all over the world now.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:41.830
And that's a school where
people go and they take lessons

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:45.470
in how to break up with someone,
and how to negotiate things

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:47.460
with their parents,
and how to die.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.520
And there are
moments of community.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.290
So I'm very proud of having
started up the School of Life

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:53.570
and how well it's going.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:55.040
And now I'm
interested in online.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.520
And I'm thinking--
I did an app--

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.666
I did a book called
"Art as Therapy."

00:38:59.666 --> 00:39:01.040
And when we did
it, we did an app

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:05.610
to go with it, which paralleled
pictures with some text that

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:09.350
brought out the redemptive
moral of the picture.

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:10.661
And that had 2 million hits.

00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:12.910
And I thought, wow, that's
great because the book only

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:14.120
sold 50,000 copies.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.120
And you think, whoa,
that's kind of interesting.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.830
So I'm about wisdom.

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:21.470
And then I'm about
looking for channels

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:23.990
down which to get
that information.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:25.396
That's what keeps
me up at night.

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:26.645
That's what I'm interested in.

00:39:26.645 --> 00:39:28.050
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:29.050
ALAIN DE BOTTON: Thanks.

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:30.570
AUDIENCE: So allow me to
play devil's advocate here.

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:30.820
ALAIN DE BOTTON: Yeah.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.490
AUDIENCE: So presume
have this vision

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:34.239
of bias-- sorry to
keep returning to this.

00:39:34.239 --> 00:39:36.330
But suppose we have this
vision of Buddhist bias,

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:38.780
and poet bias, and all that.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:44.840
It would be good given the
sheer volume of this stuff

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:49.609
to have some kind of
central organizing force

00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:51.775
to pull all these biases
together, sort of give them

00:39:51.775 --> 00:39:53.700
to you as an
aggregational function.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:59.630
So if you allow that that
is a natural conclusion

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.450
from the construction
inside your system,

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:05.785
that's seems awfully familiar
to you have your left

00:40:05.785 --> 00:40:07.910
leaning expert, you have
your right leaning expert,

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:10.470
you have your Langston
Hughes leaning expert.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:13.600
And the role of the news
agencies in this situation

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.637
would be to take all these
smaller, very undistributed

00:40:17.637 --> 00:40:19.470
sources of bias and
aggregate them together.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.220
And I would like to
hear your response did

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:28.440
the proposition that the
system of decentralized bias

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.710
will inevitably, given the small
bandwidth of the distribution

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:36.270
of ideas, tend towards some
kind of aggregating force, which

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:40.039
will return to the
status that we're in now?

00:40:40.039 --> 00:40:42.580
ALAIN DE BOTTON: Look, I think
we've got more bandwidth maybe

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.000
than you suggest.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.620
I think that the bandwidth
is currently clogged up

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.510
with what you might call
orphaned pieces of information.

00:40:52.389 --> 00:40:53.930
Because we're talking
here at Google,

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:56.930
I'm just trying to
frame it in language

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:58.310
that would seem natural to you.

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:00.610
You guys are all about
ordering information.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:05.300
Now, the news is also
about ordering information.

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.440
The thing is I guess I'm
interested in the more

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.460
psychological, philosophical
level of ordering.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:16.800
If I tell you $100 million
has gone missing from the bank

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.940
account of the
president of Uganda,

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:22.020
OK, that's a piece
of information.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.190
That is a piece of news.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:25.880
$100 million has gone.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.560
That information
is at this moment

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.730
not properly contextualized.

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:32.180
In other words, I
think about that

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.840
and I think, oh,
that sounds bad.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.370
But I don't know
what to do with it.

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:38.030
If you say to
people-- in Africa,

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:39.770
they have-- in that
part of the world,

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:42.810
they've got a vision
of the clan, which

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:46.150
means that the president did
not think he was stealing.

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:47.760
He was giving to his family.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.750
He was being an honorable man.

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.090
In other words, that's very
different from stealing.

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:56.030
So you guys are applying
a stealing narrative

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:59.050
on that story and I want
to apply an African clan

00:41:59.050 --> 00:41:59.550
narrative.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:00.550
And it becomes
completely different.

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:01.040
OK.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.190
Now, we do this with
any number of stories.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:04.840
Now, suddenly that story about
the $100 million going missing

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.790
becomes a lot more interesting.

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:09.250
It's starting to get lively.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.710
It's starting to be more than
just another boring, orphaned

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:12.740
fact.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.290
And I think what we need
to do with the news is

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:22.080
get a lot better at reconnecting
orphaned pieces of information

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:27.370
with the question, the context,
the theme, which will properly

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:28.880
bring out its interest.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.400
I think that the news,
the way we consume news

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.930
is a little bit like having
about 40 novels constantly

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:37.360
presented to us where we're
allowed to read one sentence

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.350
and then the novel is removed.

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:40.780
Then another novel is given
us, and another one, another.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.020
We can't follow.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.200
We can't hold onto it.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:47.380
It's very disorganized.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:49.850
And I'm not sure that quite
answered your question.

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:52.430
But I think I'm circling
the dilemma perhaps

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.226
you're circling.

00:42:54.226 --> 00:42:56.078
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:56.078 --> 00:42:59.627
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:59.627 --> 00:43:01.960
ALAIN DE BOTTON: Perhaps we
can chat later or something.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.808
AUDIENCE: I'll get out
of the way, just to--

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:09.820
AUDIENCE: So you've painted
quite a troubling picture

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.320
I think.

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.490
You've explained
that fundamentally

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:16.750
the aim of news agencies is
to astound and terrify us

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:19.860
with recent news
and that everyone

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:20.980
has 50 Twitter followers.

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.790
So it's very hard for
anyone to change that.

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:24.724
So how do we fix it?

00:43:24.724 --> 00:43:26.140
ALAIN DE BOTTON:
How do we fix it?

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:26.639
OK.

00:43:26.639 --> 00:43:28.400
Well, I think
there's two things.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.330
Ideas, we got to get
the ideas straight.

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:33.900
And then we've got to
go and get some money

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.116
to do something about it.

00:43:36.116 --> 00:43:37.990
That could sound sort
of terribly idealistic.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:40.280
I've met quite a lot of
people, with lots of money,

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.240
in positions of power.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:46.630
And my number one conclusion
is they're not necessarily that

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:50.140
sure what they're doing
or what they could do.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.745
Sometimes you think,
Rupert Murdoch,

00:43:51.745 --> 00:43:53.510
he knows exactly
what he's doing.

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:55.190
He's got his--
scheew, he's doing it

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:56.563
because he's committed.

00:43:56.563 --> 00:43:59.230
And he's kind of sticking
around and someone brings him

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:01.040
this idea, someone
brings him that idea.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.890
There's a little more fluidity.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.680
So I'm kind of optimistic about
the way the world is in a way

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.080
because what you need
to do is to think

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.740
through the
anomalies of the news

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:14.835
and then start a proper
news organization that

00:44:14.835 --> 00:44:15.710
will put it to right.

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:18.530
And that will cost
about a billion dollars,

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:21.450
which is not that much and
Google should give it to me.

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:22.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:25.160
And I will spend it wisely.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:27.690
You do need, unfortunately--
you know my real problem

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:30.300
as an author is that I've
realized that for years, I've

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.150
been writing books going the
world should be like this,

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:34.566
and you should do that, and
you should do this, et cetera.

00:44:34.566 --> 00:44:37.600
And no one cares because
the position of the author

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.480
is a romantic figure,
from the 19th century.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.040
It's this idea of
like a genius guy

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.630
like comes in and has
a great idea and then

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:44.540
the world changes.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:45.210
Nonsense.

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.120
It doesn't change.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.960
The only way the world changes
is through institutions,

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.450
agglomerations of people
working in discipline

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:53.590
for a common goal.

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:55.872
It's the only way to do it.

00:44:55.872 --> 00:44:57.330
In other words,
what I presented to

00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:59.250
you here is some of the thought.

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.930
And now it requires an
institution and money

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:04.660
to get these things going.

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:06.280
There are examples,
Glenn Greenwald

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:10.027
going to Pierre Omidyar
and getting lots of money.

00:45:10.027 --> 00:45:11.860
My problem with Glenn
Greenwald's journalism

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.100
is it's missing out on an
awful lot of stages here.

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:17.730
It's based on the idea-- that's
what it's completely based on,

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:19.140
the Watergate paradigm.

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.640
It's also based on the idea
that information in itself

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.320
is enough.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.020
And the darker and
more shocking it

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:27.830
is, the more people
will be impressed by it

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:30.060
and the more action will be
taken, which I don't think

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:30.560
is true.

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:33.580
So, as well, I think
intellectual quirks there.

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:35.360
But I think that's
the kind of model.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.631
That's the way it should go.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.490
AUDIENCE: You were saying
that the plane crashes and car

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.490
crashes are the
reminders of death

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:46.360
that the news presents to us.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.380
But then in the next
section on science,

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:51.176
you said that the news
is trying to avoid

00:45:51.176 --> 00:45:52.550
the fact that
we're going to die.

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:53.470
So can you [INAUDIBLE] that--

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.830
ALAIN DE BOTTON: Yes.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:54.913
AUDIENCE: --contradiction?

00:45:54.913 --> 00:45:56.840
ALAIN DE BOTTON: I
think what the news does

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:01.560
is to make death a bizarre,
catastrophic spectacle that

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.440
happens occasionally,
rather than, as we know,

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.710
a daily event.

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:08.820
So by making it so
spectacular, by focusing death

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.795
on the spectacular
moments, very rarely

00:46:10.795 --> 00:46:13.480
do you a story about
octogenarian's heart

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:16.410
gives out peacefully
after a short illness.

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:18.100
That is not news.

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.710
So in a way, death
becomes this kind

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:24.600
of massive pornographic event
that happens very occasionally

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:29.580
off the screen, rather than
a daily, steady reality.

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:32.110
And the daily, steady
reality is hang on guys,

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:33.245
science is getting there.

00:46:33.245 --> 00:46:36.380
The guys at MIT has the
next wave of whatever

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:39.052
and perhaps miniature
robots, et cetera.

00:46:39.052 --> 00:46:40.510
Rather than going,
it's going to be

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:42.090
too late for anyone
reading this.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:44.365
Anyone reading this
is going to die.

00:46:44.365 --> 00:46:47.134
the eternal life is at
least 600 years away.

00:46:47.134 --> 00:46:48.050
It will probably come.

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:50.525
It will come, but
600 years away.

00:46:50.525 --> 00:46:52.650
AUDIENCE: We only have time
for two more questions.

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:53.640
ALAIN DE BOTTON: OK.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.390
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:57.390
So you mentioned
kind of the dichotomy

00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:01.330
between the 40 million hits on
a website versus 300 books being

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:01.830
sold.

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:03.460
And I think it's an
interesting idea.

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.680
As someone who has come from
academia and [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.686
and was kind of disillusioned
by it, or putting

00:47:07.686 --> 00:47:09.560
in hours and hours of
research into something

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.393
that nobody is really
reading, and it really

00:47:11.393 --> 00:47:14.430
doesn't become
actionable or practical

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:15.630
in most people's lives.

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:18.120
On the other hand, you have
information that's really--

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.078
everybody's reading, but
there's nothing there.

00:47:20.078 --> 00:47:22.600
Do you see any news
outlets or any sort

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.267
of form of communication
that's bridging the gap?

00:47:25.267 --> 00:47:26.850
Because I kind of
see the ivory tower.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:28.308
And most of the
professors at least

00:47:28.308 --> 00:47:31.552
that I worked with, they
thought writing anything that

00:47:31.552 --> 00:47:33.260
could be understood
by the general public

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.415
was beneath them--

00:47:34.415 --> 00:47:34.800
ALAIN DE BOTTON: Yeah.

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.300
AUDIENCE: --which
is problematic.

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.340
So do you see a space
there that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:40.340
ALAIN DE BOTTON: Look,
there is totally a space.

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:41.381
There is totally a space.

00:47:41.381 --> 00:47:42.800
This is where our era is.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.580
I mean we are
living in that era.

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:50.170
Because the architecture of
news and of the authority around

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:51.480
news has broken down.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.090
It used to be the case the
"New York Times" would tell us

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:54.580
something, oh,
everybody listens.

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.410
Now, "Upworthy" could tell you
something or "The Huffington

00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:58.630
Post," et cetera.

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:01.440
It's kind of a chaos of
the marketplace, which

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.300
means that if you've got
serious things to say,

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.060
you can very easily get lost.

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:08.760
And I think the only
solution in a market system

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:14.270
is the most serious people get
into bed with the people who

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:16.472
can sell stuff, and
who are the artists.

00:48:16.472 --> 00:48:18.430
And look, I mean I don't
want to be idealistic,

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:20.072
but let's think of
Shakespeare, right?

00:48:20.072 --> 00:48:22.030
Shakespeare, the great
thing about Shakespeare,

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:23.620
is that he was a popular writer.

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:25.490
He was saying the most
interesting things.

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:28.540
But he was a business person
who wanted to fill the theater.

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:31.190
And so he wanted like the
local guys from the fish market

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.990
to come in.

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:33.448
And so he got a
little bit of blood

00:48:33.448 --> 00:48:36.100
and guts some guns and things
just to keep them happy.

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.680
And then he also wanted to
explore the deeper stuff.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.306
And this is where we are.

00:48:40.306 --> 00:48:41.680
This is the kind
of age we're in.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.010
So we're needing to
be nimble in a way

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:49.240
that perhaps serious people
didn't need to be 20 years ago.

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.240
Yeah.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:54.380
AUDIENCE: So you may have
alluded to this slightly.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:57.080
But the problem I
see is that we have

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.180
news concentrated in
the hands of a few.

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:02.760
And the few may have
realized that this

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:06.360
is a tool that can be used
for mass psychology and mass

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.460
propaganda.

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:10.650
And I think we're seeing
some of that happening now.

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:14.100
And one way to spot it is
by looking at any big story,

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:15.360
let's say Syria.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:20.720
And you look at what the major
US outlets put out on Syria

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.680
and it's all aligned
along the same view.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.250
Now, something as
complex as that

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:27.020
is going to have
two, three, maybe

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:30.670
a dozen very
different viewpoints.

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:31.930
But they're never heard.

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:38.890
So there's some collusion
going on in my view

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:41.820
within the major news.

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.702
And I want to get your comment.

00:49:43.702 --> 00:49:45.160
ALAIN DE BOTTON:
Look, I think it's

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.470
even worse than a collusion.

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:48.136
I mean this is the
kind of Chomsky line.

00:49:48.136 --> 00:49:53.294
The Chomsky line says there
are elderly white males sitting

00:49:53.294 --> 00:49:54.877
somewhere, controlling
the media, sort

00:49:54.877 --> 00:49:56.418
of pulling the
strings, trying to get

00:49:56.418 --> 00:49:58.940
us to think in certain ways,
in the interests of war

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:01.014
and the military machine.

00:50:01.014 --> 00:50:02.430
I think it's even
worse than that.

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:03.890
Because if there
really were these guys,

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:05.265
we can go out
there and get them.

00:50:05.265 --> 00:50:06.960
We could do a scoop on them.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:10.920
The problem is it's
largely unconscious.

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:15.050
It's unconscious bias
of the worse sort.

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:17.500
People just-- in
any area you look

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:23.480
at, education, Syria, housing,
interest rates, economic income

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.510
distribution, et cetera,
there's the questions

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:27.240
you're allowed to
ask and the questions

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.290
that sound a bit weird.

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:31.790
And I've been on
news programs where

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:35.220
I've raised a weird question and
boy do they get you out fast.

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:37.690
It's like, oh, what's this
question you're asking?

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:40.602
We thought you were coming to
talk about classroom sizes.

00:50:40.602 --> 00:50:43.060
And now you're starting to talk
about what education is for

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:44.670
and what learning is about.

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:45.890
Off the stage.

00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:48.155
There's censorship of
this kind of thing.

00:50:48.155 --> 00:50:50.530
I think we need to keep asking
those really uncomfortable

00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:55.800
questions, yeah, and be aware
of it, Look, I don't know.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.400
This is where I am.

00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:00.540
This is the battle really.

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.600
Let's keep fighting
against that blindness.

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.690
We have surrendered an
awfully big part of our brains

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:08.090
to organizations.

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:11.930
And it used to be the case
that you knew-- you know,

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:14.430
a friend of mine who used
to live under communism,

00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:16.650
would say, under
communism, the great thing

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:18.880
was we knew it was all
wrong in the media.

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.160
So we thought quite hard.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.427
The problem is nowadays
people think it's right.

00:51:22.427 --> 00:51:23.760
And so they've stopped thinking.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.027
That's the problem.

00:51:25.027 --> 00:51:25.860
Thank you very much.

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:26.526
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:51:26.526 --> 00:51:27.060
Thank you.

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:30.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:31.910
ALAIN DE BOTTON: Thanks.
