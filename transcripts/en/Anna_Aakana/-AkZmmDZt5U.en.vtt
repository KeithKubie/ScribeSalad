00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:01.575
It's always a little awkward when

00:00:01.575 --> 00:00:03.608
your friends find out you're single now.

00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:04.814
Oh, uhm...

00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:07.150
We're...We're not together anymore.

00:00:07.483 --> 00:00:08.678
Do you need to cry?

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.224
(voice breaks) No...

00:00:10.224 --> 00:00:11.988
Are you sure you're okay?

00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:15.769
I cried all the...all the tears
I have already...

00:00:16.164 --> 00:00:18.979
But it's even more awkward
when the internet finds out.

00:00:18.979 --> 00:00:19.479
(gasp)

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.949
So what you're telling me is...

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.518
(slow-mo) There's a chance?

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:27.330
Yes, I went through a breakup recently.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.708
And breakups...

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:30.570
are the worst thing in the world.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.741
Because you cry,

00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:32.602
you lie on the floor,

00:00:32.602 --> 00:00:33.479
you cry,

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:34.362
you eat ice cream,

00:00:34.362 --> 00:00:35.101
you cry,

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.449
you give yourself a pep talk...

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.208
SOMEDAY SOMEONE'S GONNA LOVE YOU!

00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:40.619
I SWEAR TO GOD!

00:00:40.802 --> 00:00:43.301
And eventually, when all the crying stops,

00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:45.300
you have to think about dating again.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.832
And there are all these questions like,

00:00:46.832 --> 00:00:49.601
"When do you tell someone that you have
4 cats?"

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:51.132
Hey, nice to meet you, I'm Brad.

00:00:51.132 --> 00:00:52.300
I have 4 cats.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.239
You're really hot.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.480
"Where do you even go
to meet people?"

00:00:57.708 --> 00:00:59.906
You may try to download Tinder.

00:00:59.906 --> 00:01:01.300
Oh, a dick pic.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.239
How nice.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.705
Eh, I'll swipe right.

00:01:05.754 --> 00:01:07.922
You may try to download Grindr.

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:09.814
Yeah, I sent him a picture of my boobs

00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:10.815
and he blocked me.

00:01:11.313 --> 00:01:12.079
And then,

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:12.852
it hits you.

00:01:12.852 --> 00:01:15.201
You...are a serial monogamist

00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:17.049
who, for the past 10 years,

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.779
have jumped from relationship to relationship
to relationship,

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.930
never being single for more than 3 months,

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.609
searching for the one, the dude, the partner,

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.140
who's gonna put a ring on it,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.976
who's gonna be with me

00:01:26.976 --> 00:01:28.353
(slow mo) FOREVER.

00:01:28.353 --> 00:01:30.018
And then you realize that's crazy.

00:01:30.018 --> 00:01:31.369
And then you realize, "Wow,

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.433
maybe, just maybe,

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:35.492
you should commit to yourself."

00:01:35.492 --> 00:01:38.049
I've decided that I'm gonna spend the next year

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.267
single,

00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:41.430
and I'm gonna focus on my career,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.445
and on becoming a better person,

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:45.610
and on my mental health, obviously.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.232
Look, Ray's a great person.

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:48.370
I love him very much,

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.174
and I am always going to respect him.

00:01:50.174 --> 00:01:51.461
And he gave me Congress,

00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:52.609
so...we're cool.

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.579
But, as amazing as he is,

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.548
and as amazing as I'd like to think I am,

00:01:56.548 --> 00:01:57.733
we didn't work out.

00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:00.201
And, I really want to spend this next year

00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:02.810
focusing on the aspects of myself

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.462
that I can change for the better.

00:02:04.462 --> 00:02:07.585
And go to gay clubs with my friends
to dance the pain away. (scoffs)

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:10.402
So I'm gonna say thank you to Audible
for sponsoring me,

00:02:10.402 --> 00:02:14.180
and this accent is going to be a mystery.

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.140
Yes, normally I tell you what the accent is,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.962
this time you have to guess.

00:02:18.962 --> 00:02:21.319
Because I feel like that'll be more fun.

00:02:21.763 --> 00:02:22.932
Alright ready?
Here we go.

00:02:22.932 --> 00:02:24.054
[clears throat]

00:02:24.054 --> 00:02:27.492

Currently, I'm listening to The Five Love Languages,

00:02:39.518 --> 00:02:41.580
for obvious self-help reasons,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.885

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.739
My life is a mess~

00:02:57.174 --> 00:02:59.679
I feel like I'm going crazy~

00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:03.270
At least I've got cats~

00:03:04.278 --> 00:03:06.498
To keep me company~

00:03:07.018 --> 00:03:09.400
I have to focus with a potted plant~
