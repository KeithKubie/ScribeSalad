00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.700
Welcome to "Learning the YouTube
APIs in 10 Minutes."

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.030
I'm your host, Jeremy Walker.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.140
I'm a YouTube developer
advocate.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.870
So let's get started.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.100
I'm first going to talk to you
about the Analytics API

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.080
itself, and then I'm going to
talk to you about defining a

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.940
report and taking that
information and testing your

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.830
report so you can basically
get an idea of if

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:27.810
it's working or not.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.870
And then from there, we'll
take that information and

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.740
quickly move it into
some code.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.260
Now, the first three sections,
doesn't matter what language

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.950
you're using.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.050
The last section, I will use
Java, but you can see from the

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.490
end of it when you actually go
through it that you can apply

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.200
this to any language you
want to go with.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.670
So, the YouTube Analytics
API--

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.400
if you're used to YouTube, you
know that there's a bunch of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.680
data, and we provide an
Analytics window where you can

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.350
get a lot of that
in a dashboard.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.960
But you may want to mash up
those reports in different

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.970
ways, or combine it with other
data, or even automate

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.990
processes to handle that data.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.310
And we let you do that
through our API.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.350
It's a HTTP RESTful API.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.500
So you can write the URIs
yourself, or we provide nine

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.430
libraries, so you can
pick the library

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.550
that fits your language.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.290
We also have a lot of examples
so you don't have to write

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.150
code from scratch.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.640
You can just grab ours and
tinker with it a little bit to

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.770
fit your needs.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.650
So let's get started and
define your report.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.610
So there's two types of
reports you can get.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.890
You have a channel and a
content owner report.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.730
Today we're going to cover
channel report, which is

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.670
basically just getting
information just for a

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.700
specific channel.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.010
For partners who have multiple
channels, they can do a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.090
content owner report, where they
can get information on

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.140
one of their channels or all of
their channels and kind of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.440
bundle it together.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.850
I will be giving a talk on
that at I/O that will be

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.410
recorded, so you'll be able to
watch that as well if you're

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.030
interested.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.740
But again, this presentation
here actually applies to both,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.840
so I would definitely recommend
going through this

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.580
and then jumping to that.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.760
So when you start with a report,
after you've decided

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.180
on whether it's going to be a
channel report or a content

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.960
owner report, now you have
to decide OK, what

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.100
information do I need?

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.430
And that's where the big
three come into play.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.640
So there's metrics, which are
the most important one.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.290
Those are going to be any sort
of activity or user activity

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.990
that we record--

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.090
so views, likes, uniques,
subscribers added, loss, all

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.610
that great stuff.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.440
So that's kind of the metric
you're looking for-- well,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.670
metric, of course.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.160
And then we kind of bundle those
together in what are

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.940
called dimensions.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.160
So when you get views, you have
to get a dimension on it

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.130
so you can decide on, you want
it by days, or you want it by

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.240
week or month, or maybe you
want it by country.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.600
So we give you a bunch of those
options because you can

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.670
kind of bundle it
how you want.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.090
Now if you don't want all that
information and you want to

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.800
filter it a little bit, we have
filters, so you can--

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.830
for instance, if you want views
and you take them by

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.810
country, but maybe you're only
interested in Japan, then you

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.580
can set a filter to
only get Japan.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.950
And after you come up with the
metrics and dimensions and

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.340
possible filter you want, then
you're going to want to look

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.150
at our page that's labeled
Available Reports.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.340
And I can show that
to you right here.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.460
So if you just search for the
YouTube Analytics API, this

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.540
will be what comes up.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.650
And under reports, because you
have to choose one, you can

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.730
choose Channel Reports which
is what I'm doing here.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.260
And you can see available
reports.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.580
So what this is is it's a bunch
of information about

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.530
what metrics and dimensions work
with each other because

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.380
you can't just throw them
all together and

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.320
hope it will work.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.910
There's only certain
reports that will

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.140
work with each other.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.320
So you have to kind of go
through this and make sure

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.910
it's working.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.740
So in this case, I'm actually
going to look at

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.670
just getting the views.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.310
Now, you can see here,
for metrics, I

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.340
combined a bunch of these.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.480
I could combine views, comments,
favorites added, a

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.410
bunch of stuff.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.830
And then I can do it on a
dimension by day, seven-day

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.990
totals, or a month.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.480
I'm actually going to show
you an example--

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.380
a month--

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.399
but you can combine those two,
and on the right, you can

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.839
filter, either by country or by
video, which is a video ID,

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.840
and then from there by country
if you choose to do so.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.190
So again, you kind of put your
report together, get a rough

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.100
idea with the big three, and
then you look at the available

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.660
reports for either the content
owner or channel-- in our

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.610
case, channel--

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.540
and you decide what you
want to do from there.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.720
So now that you've kind of got
the report you want, or

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.170
possibly reports you want,
the next step is to

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.320
go to the API Explorer.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.290
Now this is a really, really
powerful tool that's available

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.810
on our website that basically
lets you run reports without

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.690
writing any code, including
authorization.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.140
Because with the Analytics
API, you do have to

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.700
authorize--

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.050
this is really important.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.370
Because then you get the report
working and in great

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.830
shape before you
go to the code.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.905
I see a lot of people who start
writing code and then

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:08.810
they say they're having
problems, when it's just that

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.260
they never had a proper
report to begin with.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.820
So always start with this.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.640
That's a best practice.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.080
And how this works is, again,
you just search YouTube

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.120
Analytics API, and this
will come up.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.720
And if you go the Reference
link, you'll see we have some

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.540
great information.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.370
Again, there's a RESTful API,
so if you want don't want to

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.550
use our libraries and you want
to just construct the URLs

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.910
yourself, you can do that.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.590
We list all the parameters.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.860
And then we even provide some
examples in Python,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.220
JavaScript, in Java and Ruby,
and then we have some more

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.350
libraries beyond that.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.210
But at the bottom of the page is
this API Explorer, is what

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.920
we call it.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.070
And so this is where you can
try out your reports before

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.010
you dive into code.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.610
So you can see in the
right here, there's

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.000
this Authorize Request.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.080
I just hit that I want
to authorize that.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.650
And then now it's authorized,
so now I can run requests as

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.180
if I've gone through the whole
OAuth 2 process, which

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.130
actually is done on
the background.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.860
So let's get started.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.310
So you can see at the bottom
here, we have Metrics,

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.900
Dimensions, Filters,
which were the big

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.660
three I'm talking about.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.290
You can see above that Start
Date and End Date.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.120
It's pretty self-explanatory.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.090
But at the top, you
can see IDs.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.770
And this is what you actually
use to specify which channel

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:27.450
report you want.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.810
So do you want a channel
report, or a

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.070
content owner report?

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.100
If you're doing a content owner,
you'd just type in

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:39.720
contentowner== and then
your content owner ID.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.400
But in this case, we're doing
a channel report, so you'd

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.830
just do channel== and then
you'll do your channel ID.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.670
Now, you're probably not going
to know your channel ID.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.530
Most people don't.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.250
It's this long string with a
bunch of numbers and letters.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.110
So that, actually, you have
to get from the Data API.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.290
So we have another API that's
part of the YouTube API family

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.940
which is called the Data API.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.760
And this lets you do
most everything

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.000
you can do on YouTube.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.190
And one of those things
is to get

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.170
information on your own channel.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.330
So we're going to actually
do that.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.310
And if you just search for the
YouTube Data API, it'll be the

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.390
first thing that comes up.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.200
It's also in the same area
as the Analytics API.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.630
But here you see V3 comes up.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.320
And if you expand the
reference, you'll

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.800
see there's a channel.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.400
And I will actually want
the list function.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.140
Again, this lists out.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.010
This looks pretty probably
almost just like what you just

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.920
saw in the Analytics API page.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.010
But you can see we list all the
parameters so you can make

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.430
the URL yourself.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:44.110
And then at the bottom, we have
the API Explorer again,

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.230
so this is great.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.140
This will actually give me my
channel ID, so I'm just going

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.960
to authorize this
really quickly.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.760
And then I'm just going
to put the ID--

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.350
I could put "snippet" in if
I want more information.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.010
And what's nice is you can just
set mine equal to "true."

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.800
So this will get the channel
associated with my account,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.440
which is right here, which
is the perfect one.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.020
And here is the ID.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.600
So I'm just going to grab
this and drop it here.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.690
Now I'm pretty much set to go,
so I can start setting dates.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.420
I'm actually going to run a
monthly report, so I'm going

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.140
to run it for October
and November.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.720
So I just set my times here.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.790
My metric, I just want "views."
Dimensions, I'm going

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.800
to do "month." And then I'm not
going to do any filter at

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.760
this point.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.590
But I hit execute, and then you
can see it constructs the

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.020
actual URL that goes out, and a
little bit more information,

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.669
and then actually shows
you the response.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:43.799
You can see I got 1,100
views in November and

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.530
about 2,000 in October.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.440
So this is kind of
a great tool.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.590
You can kind of mess around a
lot with it until you get your

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.130
report just right.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.080
And if you wanted to see filter,
let's say I wanted to

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.460
see country.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.430
We'll go with Brazil, see
what that pulls up.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.330
And OK, I have one in three
views in Brazil.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.320
So that's just an example
of what you can do.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.120
If I wanted to, I could also
drop a video in here and grab

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.660
the video ID and put that in
there, or whatever it may be.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.380
So anyway, I have my report.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.310
I'm all set.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.550
Everything's looking good.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.080
The nice thing now is when I
jump into coding, a lot of

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.960
these parameters here map
directly to the client

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.740
library, so you pretty much know
where to plug and play.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.680
So let's jump into that.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.050
So I've told you a little
bit about the API.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.130
We've defined a report.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.130
We've actually run it.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.030
Everything looks good.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.330
Now we just add it
to our code.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.330
So in this case, I'm
going to use Java.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.530
If you look here, I'm actually
constructing a HTTP transport

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.690
object in a JSON factory.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.750
These are just to handle the
requests and responses.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.980
And you'll see here
is a credential.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.380
I don't have all the
coding here.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.036
Again, this is an example
that's online, so

00:09:58.036 --> 00:09:59.790
you can go grab it.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.580
There's a larger function
that takes care of the

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.010
credentials for you.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.630
I'm not going to go over that,
but it takes care of the whole

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.790
OAuth 2 process, so you can
have a look at that.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.150
But the gist of this page is
that, hey, I'm setting up a

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.090
YouTube object and a YouTube
Analytics object.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.240
And the YouTube object maps to
the Data API because I need to

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.150
get my channel ID, right?

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.620
The other one is YouTube
Analytics, which is where I'm

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.780
going to run my report.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.600
So next thing I need to do is
first get the channel ID.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.300
And you can see I just call in
the YouTube object Channels

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.200
List, and then I set mine, which
if you look at the API

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.880
Explorer, it's pretty much
exactly what I set.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.260
So again, you don't actually
need snippet.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.810
I was just showing that so you
could see it was my channel.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.780
So I just set ID there,
because I just

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:50.480
really need the ID.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.740
I execute it, and then I would
get a list back of channels.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:58.270
And the first one would
be my default one.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.810
So now that I have that,
I just run a report--

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.590
analytics.reports.query--

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.760
and then I just drop in
the same information--

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.000
channel== and then that channel
ID, and then I do the

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.170
dates, and then set
the dimensions.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.810
And then if I had any
filters, I could set

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.080
them there as well.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.180
And then I execute that.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.730
That'll give me a result table
object that will have all the

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:22.870
information that I can run
through with, my own function.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.730
So let's see what
that looks like.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.940
So this is all that stuff
you just saw.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.870
And I'll actually clear this
out, and I'll rerun it.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.415
So this is actually going
out, and I've

00:11:33.415 --> 00:11:34.900
already set up the OAuth.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:39.370
So you can see it pulled from
my default channel, and you

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.370
can see the numbers
are the same.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.850
So that gives you an idea how
to get started really quick.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.060
I've gone over the Analytics
API, kind of what it's used

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.090
for, to match up reports,
automated things, and combine

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.480
maybe external data
with your data.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.800
I've gone over defining a
report, testing it out with

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.190
the API Explorer-- which is
very, very important.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.900
Make sure you do that.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.440
That's a big, big
best practice.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.760
And then you port that
over to your code.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.660
I happened to show Java, but
again, you could have done

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.140
this in Ruby, Objective
C, whatever you want.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.560
So now you should be set to go
and have some fun with the

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.610
Analytics API.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:18.900
So if you want to learn more,
search YouTube Analytics API.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:24.320
