00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.680
You'd think, from a distance, that astrophysics and religion would have very little to say to each other.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.380
Astrophysicists care about the composition of planets, they tend to be fiercely rational,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.300
very uninterested in teaching us how to live and not ones to raise big moral questions.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.080
Religious types, for their part, are passionate about faith,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.180
very suspicious of reason and desperate to teach us how to live.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.040
Now, our natural sympathies tend to be with the astrophysicists.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.900
But here's a strange thing:

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.520
whenever one spends time with the subject matter of astrophysics,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.100
one's liable to experience some pretty unusual feelings,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.560
which are not at all unlike those you sometimes get when you spend time around religion.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.740
It seems that beneath all the differences, there are some fascinating points of connection

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.740
between astrophysics and the faiths.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.820
Two stand out in particular...

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.520
At their best (and we stress, their best)

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.400
religions are very good at making us feel a sense of awe:

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.080
at how small we are next to the big almighty things out there.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.220
And they're also pretty good at reminding us that we should be kind,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.660
think of others and sense our kinship with strangers.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.680
However, it's a problem with religions, that their power to evoke awe

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.180
and their recommendations about kindness,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.240
tend to be bound up with a lot of superstitious and sometimes rather obscure material,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.420
which puts many otherwise well-meaning people off these topics.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.120
Now, strangely enough, when it comes to awe and kindness,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.700
astrophysics (though it has absolutely no stated mission in these areas)

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.900
can have an extraordinarily effective impact.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.620
Let's start with awe.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.360
For centuries, in people's minds, God was the most awesome thing around,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.840
but you don't have to spend long with astrophysicists

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.140
to start coming across things more inspiring than anyone could previously have conceived of.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.340
For example, the fact that on the very clearest nights,

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.860
we can see up to two thousand five hundred stars from Earth,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.280
but this is only a 100 millionth of the stars...

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.460
in our galaxy.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.940
There are around 300 billion stars in this galaxy

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.320
and then, there are roughly an equal number of galaxies in the observable universe.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.160
In other words, for every star in the milky way,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.620
there's a whole other galaxy out there; for every grain of sand on every beach on Earth, there are 10,000 stars.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.000
This kind of awe is strikingly helpful when it comes to our mental well-being.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It restores perspective.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.980
We're constantly losing sight of what's truly significant, and what doesn't in the end matter so much.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.500
We're so bad at seeing things in their proper relationships,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.520
so we dramatize, lose our tempers, make mountains of mole hills.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.360
For all this, astrophysics can help us, reminding us of our proper place in the grand scheme of things

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.080
and thereby, making us a little less likely to lose our composure and our hold on reality.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.600
Then, there's kindness.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.940
Nothing is more natural than to think only of ourselves, to care very little for other people,

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.480
let alone animals or the planet itself.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.440
Religions once tried to give us holy commandments to develop our ethical sense,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.900
but astrophysics gives us something even more powerful:

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.940
a sense of how extraordinarily rare and fragile all life is.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.000
There are 500 quintillion or 500 billion billion Sun-like stars

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.640
and probably a hundred billion billion Earth-like planets,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.060
and yet, it seems, we are the only living things in space and time.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.880
We are isolated beautifully freakish phenomena on a tiny blue dot in a quiet corner of an infinite universe.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.300
This recognition can have a wondrous effect as ethically powerful as any other.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.440
Suddenly we look at other people not as our enemies or competitors,

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.220
but as fellow breathing things who've also evaded momentous odds

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.740
and are clinging on to the one very vulnerable temporary thing we all have in common:

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.540
LIFE.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.940
A sight of the Earth from space, can foster a planetary as opposed to a merely individual consciousness.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.420
It edges us towards an intra human compassion; the barriers between people break down.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.520
It can also inspire an interspecies compassion.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.180
We, the earthworm, the crab, the camel and the hawk, and even the oak tree in the pampas grass,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.120
all partake of the same miraculous chemical good fortune.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.660
Once you think about this, a curious sense of global kinship develops.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.840
Far more effectively than the ten commandments or the gospels,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.000
but in an analogous way we break out of our customary egoistic cocoons

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.320
and our narrow orbits, and we refrain ourselves as all of us co-tenants of a sublime vulnerable dot.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.300
Astrophysicists don't directly care about any of this,

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.940
and yet their work leads us to these emotions as effectively as any religious texts.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.340
They may not give a damn, but we should.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.000
We should, for example, perhaps build up public planetariums in a slightly different way.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.880
Admitting that we're coming here, not necessarily or principally to learn all about the universe;

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.420
we're coming here to acquire a new more compassionate and more conscious perspective

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.220
on our lives on Earth.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.300
Our planetariums are more than fit take on the ethical and psychological functions

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.660
once given to temples and churches.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.500
We can value astrophysics

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.140
not because we're all going to become scientists or a very interested in deep space in and of itself,

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.400
but for another, nowadays, far less mentioned reason:

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.540
because the galaxies are, miraculously, the conduits to helping us develop into slightly wiser,

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:46.560
more conscious, more mindful and generous humans, on our painfully isolated fragile blue dot.
