00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now we keep using the words get, keep, and grow, but this get, keep, and grow

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
actually refers to human beings not just random ideas.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And one of the things we need to understand is what's the archetype

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
or the persona of our customers that we're actually wanting to get and so one of the things

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that's kind of hard for startups is to realize that getting customers isn't some abstract idea--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
you really need to understand who your customers are

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and this is not just thinking about selling to consumers.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Even in corporations, there are human beings with titles that you need to figure out

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
almost the same things as you would in a consumer company.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And so what you need to understand--what are the roles of these individuals you're trying to sell to.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Who are they? If its in a company, what's their position? What's their title?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What's their organization, and by the way not just on the org chart.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
How do they get influenced to? Who do they influence?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And if there are actually buyers, how do they buy. I mean how do they hear of our products,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
how do they know about you, and as we'll see later one of the interesting things is

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
there are some customers that are users like in Google--

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
There are people who use search, but there are people who are payers

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
who are actually a whole different customer segment.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
You need to understand that these people--this archetype I'm trying to define

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
are they users or the payers, are they regulators, or they're somewhere else in the buying process.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And what you really are trying to understand, if you remember from the value proposition

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and customer segment lectures, is you're trying to understand what pain is being solve for them

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and what gain is your product creating for them, and if the core is you're trying

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to derive an archetype of who they are and so what we tend to do is suggest there are startups that

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
you would literally start with a series of hypothesis and you get out of the building

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and in your customer discovery process, you're going to start refining archetypes.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It turns that most companies are selling to multiple archetypes.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
If you have two or three, don't worry--that's probably fine.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
If you have 20, it means you voted none of the above and you really need to refine it more,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
but then we suggest the company is actually pick a representative picture of who that persona is--

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
who the person would most represent that archetype.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Put together a poster and post it on the wall of your engineering department

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and say, "Here's who you're building the product for"--it's they.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
He might be a young urban professional, 21 to 30, lives in the large cities, buys x or y.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Or it could be Sally, a Midwest mother of 45 to 55 in the MIdwest of the United States or

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
someone in India or China--it doesn't matter.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
What you need to do is have an opinion based on some fact that gets refined.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It helps you understand these are the people we're trying to acquire

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and don't angst about your first hypothesis,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
but understand the whole goal of customer discovery is to continually to refine--

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
these are the people we think are most likely to buy in the early stages of our company.
