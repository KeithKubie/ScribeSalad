MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK:
All right.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.810
I think we're going
to get started.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:03.820
My name is Michael
Weiss-Malik.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.250
I'm an Engineering Director
on Google Maps.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.270
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL: My name's
Andrew Lookingbill.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.810
I'm one of the Founding
Engineers on

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.050
Project Ground Truth.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.260
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: And we're
here to talk about Ground

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.030
Truth, accurate maps by
algorithms and elbow grease.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.790
So first off, I'm a big fan of
data, Google is a big fan of

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.690
data, and we like to
visualize data.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.760
So this is data on
the presentation.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.040
This is the content of
the presentation.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.100
We are intending to spend a
little bit of time on what

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.150
Ground Truth is, a little bit
of time on why Ground Truth

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.270
is, a bunch of time on how we
actually do Ground Truth, and

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.240
that's really the meat of the
presentation, how is it that

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.260
we make maps?

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.490
And finally, we'll wrap up with
a little bit of where we

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.220
have done Ground Truth so far.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.176
So first, let's focus
on the what.

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:41.520
So what is Ground Truth?

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.370
This is a little wordy, but it
says it exactly right, a

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.680
project to create accurate and
comprehensive map data by

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.690
conflating multiple inputs via
algorithms and elbow grease.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.300
And that's really wordy, but we
are going to break it down.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.140
And the first thing is,
what is map data?

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.910
What are we actually talking
about when we talk about a

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.610
project to make good map data?

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.330
Well, for purposes of this talk,
we're going to define

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.379
map data as the vectors
on the map.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.900
This is basically everything
you see on Google Maps that

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.790
isn't an image.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.310
It's the roads, it's the postal
codes, it's stuff that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.560
you don't see like speed limits,
city boundaries,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.050
everything that makes Directions
work, Search work,

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.240
all of that data.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.320
That's the data that we're
talking about creating.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.690
So, having answered, what is map
data, there's actually a

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.790
bigger question-- what
is Google Maps?

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.460
Because the reason for Ground
Truth has to do with a whole

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.460
ecosystem of considerations.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.940
So to answer that, we're going
to go on a slight segue.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.590
Let's pretend that map data is
stored as movie film, just to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.650
make a really simple
analogy, OK?

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.920
If you define it that way,
basically the way that Google

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.870
Maps has traditionally displayed
map data, is we've

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.170
had a data provider who went and
took measurements of the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.270
world using--

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.060
here, through the analogy-- a
movie camera, and created that

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.990
film that they then tossed
over a line to us.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.950
So there's the data provider
on one side and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.570
Google on the other.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.890
So what do we do
with the film?

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.480
We project it onto a screen.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.490
In this case, it's a
drive-through screen, or your

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.250
laptop screen, or whatever,
but this is

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.590
the traditional ecosystem.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.980
A data provider sits on
one side of the line.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.430
They collect the data, they
toss it over to us, and we

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.420
take care of distributing
it to users.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.110
Another way to look at this is
actually similar to a movie

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.050
rental store.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.930
So basically, we have
to go and pick out

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.010
what titles are available.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.380
And the arrangement suffered
from the same problems that

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.940
old VHS rental stores
suffered from.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.450
The selection was limited.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.290
The movie studios weren't
necessarily making the movie

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.420
that you wanted to make.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.450
You had to pick from what
it was that they

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.220
were interested in.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.060
And of course, the movie studio
didn't like it very

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.610
much if you edited the movie
before you returned it back.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.290
So all these considerations,
this gets us back to, What is

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.810
Ground Truth?

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.630
Ground Truth is a completely
different ecosystem for

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.850
producing movies.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.280
Basically, instead of this
rental model and this model

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.360
where there's a data provider
on one side of the line and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.000
we're on the other,
we've now become a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.210
movie production studio.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.020
We are making our own maps,
hence the graphic at the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.500
beginning of the presentation.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.840
So that covers the what
of Ground Truth.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.890
We're making maps.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.490
We're making Google Maps,
Google Map data.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.985
Why?

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.780
Why would we want to do this?

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.710
So this is motivated, actually,
by a couple of

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.800
considerations, not just the
inconvenience of the rental

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.320
model but actually all the data
that we had lying around.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.220
This is some really cool high
resolution aerial imagery of

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.120
some backyards.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.110
And I'm from Phoenix, so I
immediately recognize in this,

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.140
at the top of there is a tiny
little hose in a pool.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.970
That's actually an automatic
pool cleaner hose.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.610
It's literally the
size of my wrist.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.070
We can spot this stuff
from the air now.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.490
And that's nice, and that's good
eye candy, but what it

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.630
really means is that when we
look at roads, we can spot the

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.100
roads from imagery and
accurately map them.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.770
We can accurately map
where you can turn,

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.810
where you can't turn.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.670
You can literally
trace out a map.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.560
And so a lot of the impetus for
this came from the fact

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.220
that Google had so much data
inside that we thought we

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.540
could leverage to make
good map data.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.510
And of course, we have
Street View as well.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.280
From Street View, we get a
tremendous amount of mapping

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.820
information.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.270
We can see one-way streets, we
can see bicycle lanes, types

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.410
of roadways.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.360
You can confirm street names,
you can confirm address

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.410
numbers, you can even extract
business logos.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.390
And as we'll get to a little
later, we can do a lot of this

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.210
autonomously.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.120
We can actually automatically
recognize numbers in Street

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.750
View imagery and run some
algorithms on them, and out

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.060
the other end pop millions of
addresses that we've actually

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.339
created in Google Maps, purely
from Street View imagery and

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:22.589
computer vision algorithms.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.860
So it's not just enough
to have the data.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.890
Why do we actually want to go
through all of this effort?

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.330
And it basically amounts to,
it benefits our users.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.550
And there's a couple different
benefits that it offers.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.170
The first is that through this
process, we wind up working

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.340
directly with authoritative
data providers.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.430
In the movie analogy, we're
dictating the actors.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.740
We're not going through
a studio.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.885
So we get to pick if we want to
talk to a postal service or

00:04:46.885 --> 00:04:49.110
a national park service, we work
directly with them and

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.860
get the best data
that can be had.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.580
We also get to match our
investment to our user needs.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.010
Google is a very
global company.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.910
We have users in a lot of
different countries.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.370
Map data providers may or may
not be investing in the same

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.790
places that we really want to
invest, so this lets us match

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.660
up to our users much,
much better.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.930
And then lastly, speed,
speed, speed.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.130
This is a big theme
of Ground Truth.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.810
We do things quickly, and it
enables Google to do a lot of

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.400
things quickly.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.210
We want to be able to publish
updates to the map, we want to

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.140
be able to accept updates to the
map, and the only way to

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.580
really do that on a tight cycle
is if you own the entire

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.620
map production.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.980
Because previously, if you had
to report a problem with, say,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.500
the map data in the US, you'd
have to go to one of our data

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.420
providers, wait six to 18 months
and hope that they

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.500
actually fix it, and then they'd
have to send the data

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.470
to us and then we'd have
to publish it.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.540
Now, since we own the data, we
own the whole ecosystem, we

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.770
can actually publish that update
immediately and you can

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.240
come directly to us for that.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.930
So that's the what
Ground Truth is.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.570
That's the why we did it.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.560
Now we're going to get to the
meat of the presentation which

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.900
is how it actually works, which
I keep hand waving.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.090
So Ground Truth is basically
three pieces stacked on top of

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.930
each other.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.950
The first, as I've kind of
already talked about, is

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.320
authoritative data.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.990
We go directly to postal
services, we go directly to

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.690
governments, we go directly
to really well-known map

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.590
providers themselves,
and we get the data

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.580
directly from them.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.440
We work out arrangements
where we can

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.140
absorb that data directly.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.020
We combine that with internal
data that Google has.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.760
This is one of the best
leverages that we have because

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.390
we're one of the few companies
that has all this satellite

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.230
and aerial imagery and all this
Street View imagery, and

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.490
you can conflate those two
together and correct

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.290
one with the other.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.800
So even though you've got, say,
your roads from the city,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.760
it turns out, when you look at
road data and you compare it

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.000
to satellite imagery,
it doesn't

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.210
always line up so great.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.340
So you can correct the road
imagery and make it even more

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.760
accurate by snapping it
to what you see in

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.840
the satellite imagery.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.730
Then the last chunk is
algorithms and elbow grease,

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.700
the byline of the talk.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.100
This is actually where the meat
of everything happens,

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.010
and this is what we're
going to demo.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.580
We apply a variety of stages of
work where we take the raw

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.100
data that we got from the
provider and we clean it up

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.000
successively.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.400
For example, we actually take
the streets that they gave us

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.640
and we drag them manually to
match all of the roads that we

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.100
see in satellite imagery.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.750
So there's a variety of manual
processes that go on as well

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.880
as a bunch of automated
algorithms like the computer

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.090
vision that I mentioned from
Street View, and we go through

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.230
successive stages of work where
we clean up different

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.370
aspects of the data, and out the
other end pops a map that

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.550
is higher quality than the
sum of its inputs.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.480
So we're really going to focus
on this algorithms and elbow

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.360
grease part.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.170
And to accomplish the algorithms
and elbow grease

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.900
part, we built a tool internally
called Atlas, and

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.070
this is a screenshot
from Atlas.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.610
It's fully homegrown.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.910
It's, unfortunately,
internal only.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.550
You're going to get to see
some of it, but you

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.030
don't get to use it.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.650
It's actually used by a team
of what we call operators,

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.930
Ground Truth operators, and this
is a dedicated internal

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.660
workforce that goes through a
huge amount of training on

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.780
policies, procedures, and the
tool itself so that they know

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.250
how best to implement the
policies that we've come up

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.090
with that result in a
high-quality map.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.040
It's worth noting, we're going
to demonstrate a whole lot of

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.120
the elbow grease because
basically, algorithms are

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.110
really boring to demo.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.170
It's no fun if we hit a button
and all of a sudden, there's a

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.390
name on a street.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.660
So that's less visual.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.920
It's more fun to work on
sometimes, but we're just

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.760
going to show some of
the manual stuff.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.020
So with that, I'm going to hand
it over to Andrew and see

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.460
if the video setup here works.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.880
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL: Hi.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.380
So this is Atlas, the in-house
mapping tool we developed.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.480
I'm biased, but it's actually
my favorite client for

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.590
consuming Street View
and satellite data.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.110
In addition to what we've
published on maps.google.com,

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.679
where we have sub-meter
resolution imagery for 75% of

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:42.240
the population, we also have
access to assets that we don't

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.760
necessarily publish either for
age or aesthetic reasons.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.820
This allows us to track changes
to an area over time.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.580
We can also cleanly overlay
vector data, comparing one

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.700
against the other.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.400
We also, in the tool, have
access to the five million

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.870
miles of driven Street
View data, 3,000

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.570
cities in 50 countries.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.800
And again, even when immersed in
a panorama, you can cleanly

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.150
overlay vector data.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.980
This is important for
maintaining spatial context.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.320
Similar to the smooth
transitions into and out of

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.760
the Street View imagery, this
isn't just eye candy.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.570
It increases productivity
because Ground Truth operators

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.240
don't need to pause to
reorient themselves.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.530
Finally, you're looking at an
internal-only fisheye viewer

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.750
that we can use even in the
top-down mode to quickly

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.550
select a panorama of interest.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.020
Now, sometimes when the source
data comes to us, it's in

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.290
pretty rough form.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.920
This is actually TIGER road
data, the free, public domain

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.470
dataset we started
with in the US.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.750
And if you look at it paired
over satellite imagery, you

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.260
can spot some problems.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.280
Not only are there alignment
issues, but there are also

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.460
occasional connectivity
problems.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.320
For this reason, the first
step that a Ground Truth

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.560
operator takes is to actually
bring the geometry into

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.380
alignment with satellite
imagery.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.020
They can drag intersections to
deform entire sections of the

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.100
road network at once, and then
replace existing geometry with

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:02.990
new vertices.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.780
One of the reasons we do this
instead of creating the road

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.790
network from scratch--

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.010
which, with our tools, might
be even faster--

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.660
is that in this way, we maintain
attributes of the

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.600
data such as names,
address ranges,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.690
speed limits, et cetera.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.580
Now, even geometry editing
actually requires a decent

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.910
amount of policy and a deep
understanding of how to model

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.930
road networks.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.910
For example, here, we're
splitting a road into its left

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.660
and right halves, but doing
so creates a number of new

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.690
intersections that also
require careful

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.620
handling and policy.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.230
Now, treating these details
consistently across a country

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.630
allows our products--

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.590
like driving directions,
et cetera-- to behave

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.410
consistently across a country
worth of data.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.920
And this is one of the reasons
why operators require a good

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.780
deal of training before they're
fully proficient.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.560
It's also critical for Project
Ground Truth that we get every

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.280
turn restriction for every
intersection correct.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.130
An example of a turn
restriction, for instance, is

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.960
not being allowed to turn left
at a given stop light, or

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.270
perhaps not being allowed
to make a

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.360
U-turn on a given segment.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.640
Now, here in the tool, you can
see if you enter along the

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.070
yellow arrow, you can exit along
any one of the green

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.920
arrows, but not along
the red arrow.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.430
Editing this complex
data can be tricky.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.930
In Atlas, we streamline the
process by providing a set of

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.530
keyboard shortcuts that allow
an operator to quickly hop

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.680
between all of the various
entrances and exits from an

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.800
intersection, perfecting
the turn restrictions.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.240
They're often able to do this
based on the pavement markings

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.790
they see in aerial imagery, but
we also heavily rely on

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.400
integration with Street View.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.260
In fact, they can even make
annotations, such as this one,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.845
clipping a sign, to kind of
leave a trace of what they

00:11:40.845 --> 00:11:42.980
were looking at when they
made a decision.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.390
In fact, these clipped
annotations are even visible

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.370
in the top-down view, correctly
oriented to speed

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.630
the work of people
who come after.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.460
Although in this situation,
we've chosen to focus on a

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.860
manual extraction of a piece of
information from the Street

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.290
View imagery, we actually have
computer vision algorithms

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.750
that do a fantastic job of
extracting a number of road

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.030
signs, as you'll see along the
southern part of this road.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.630
So you have a number of people
editing very complex data

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.500
concurrently.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.720
You start to worry about
data consistency.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.890
What you need is a smart,
automated system that suggests

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.400
when possible errors might exist
in the data, sort of

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.540
like compiler warnings, that
might want warrant a human

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.400
second check.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.670
In fact, in this case, we use
the same anonymized traffic

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.140
data on maps.google.com to
suggest that in fact, what we

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.950
have modeled in our data as a
two-way road might in fact be

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.340
a one-way road.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.370
An operator claims the issue and
uses the available tools

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.520
and the Street View and
satellite imagery to determine

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.880
that yes, in fact, this road
should be one way.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.270
They update the vector
data and move along.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.090
But, if they had claimed this
issue and decided that it was

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.480
a false positive, they would
have resolved the issue in

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.360
such a way that that same issue
would never flag on that

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.610
same data again in the future.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.650
Now sometimes, the data we
take in has strange,

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.770
consistent islands of error.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.730
For instance, an entire
neighborhood worth of roads

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.830
might be offset by 1,000 feet,
or there might be consistent

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.290
errors with scale or rotation.

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.590
Correcting these one at a time
would be cumbersome.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.040
Luckily, we have a few bulk
transform tools, such as the

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.600
one you see here.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.940
An operator defines the area
over which they want the

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.260
transform to take effect and
then begins defining pairs of

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.620
control points.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.900
Each pair of control points says
that this point on the

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.420
road network corresponds to
this point on the ground.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.440
An operator can see a preview
of the transform vectors and

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.640
then continue to add pairs of
control points until they're

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.520
satisfied with the warp.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.240
After they're satisfied that the
warp is going to do what

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.530
they expect, they can choose to
preview the warp and then

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.410
hit Save, which will actually
bulk transform all

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.880
of the data at once.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.460
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: So as you
saw, these are a couple of the

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.620
different kinds of stages of
work that we go through where

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.630
we clean up different
aspects of the data.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.470
There's other stages where we
look at freeway signs and get

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.770
the freeway text, we look at
speed limits, we look at road

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.460
type, distinguish highways
from local roads.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.820
So on the left is what
we started with.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.240
Andrew mentioned TIGER.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.400
This is actually a public domain
set for the US put out

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.160
by the Census Bureau.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.320
The Census Bureau cares
about counting houses.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.450
They don't care so much about
freeway off ramps, so it's

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.510
kind of a disaster
on the left.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.050
After many, many stages of
clean up from us, on the

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:42.690
right, is what results for
the Ground Truth data.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.230
One other example, a little
more zoomed in.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.810
This is actually just around
the corner from Google's

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:46.970
Mountain View campus.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:50.380
Again, on the left, there's
a freeway interchange and

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.470
everything's just
modeled wrong.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.770
The connectivity is wrong.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.030
The alignment is terrible.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.820
We go in, we clean it up stage
after stage, and out the other

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.700
end pops polished data.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.250
So that takes care of
what, why, how.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.000
Now, we thought we'd talk
a little bit about

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.100
where we've done this.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.720
So in a nutshell, Brian
McClendon, during the keynote

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.640
this morning, actually talked
about this a bit.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.360
The green countries here are
where we've done Ground Truth.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.440
We've done it in 43 countries
and regions.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.810
They launched over the
past five years.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:22.200
This is a ridiculous rate of
speed for mapping, actually.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.580
We're quite proud of it.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.360
And in these nine separate
launches that

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.900
are detailed below.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.510
So it's been a long effort and
a lot of work, actually.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.340
So the natural question that I
get whenever I show this is,

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.260
where are we going
to map next?

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.680
And this is probably the most
frequently asked question.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.210
And unfortunately, the answer
is silence and crickets.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.860
We don't like to speculate
about future

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:42.980
products and services.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.860
What I can say, though, is that
this is an incredibly

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.380
efficient mapping machine
that we've built.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.820
We're not about to
turn it off.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.570
We do want to map more, and
these will not be the last of

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.350
the countries that
you hear of.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.230
So in theory, that takes us
through what, why, how, and

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.660
where, but you get
a little bonus.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.670
We're going to talk about beyond
Ground Truth and what

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.010
happens after we initially
publish the data.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.210
The biggest challenge for any
mapmaker is that as soon as

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.870
you publish a map,
it's out of date.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.330
By fixing it in any kind of
solid form, the world is

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.170
changing, the fixed
form is not.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.870
So the world is updating,
the map has to update.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.610
So the story doesn't end
with the mapping

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:16.230
for the first time.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.950
You have to map for
the rest of time.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.500
One of our main mechanisms
is something that we

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.980
call Report a Problem.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.900
Users can click a link in the
lower right corner of the

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.680
map-- it also appears in a few
other spots in the UI--

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.260
and they're taken to a dialog
flow that lets them submit any

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:29.930
type of problem.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:31.900
You can tell us that your house
is in the wrong place,

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.040
you can tell us that your city's
named wrong, you can

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.120
tell us that a street
has a wrong name.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.430
And you submit that, and the
same operators, basically,

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.550
that do mapping, some of them
have been trained on how to

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.490
receive these reports.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.300
And we receive several thousands
of these every day,

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:50.210
and we process them manually,
and get back to you.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.470
Additionally, that's desktop.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.060
You can also do this
on mobile.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.970
On iOS, if you have the Google
Maps app, at any point in the

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.580
app, you just shake it and it
vibrates and pops up a little,

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.340
hey, do you want to send
some feedback?

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.140
One of those feedback flows
allows you to submit map data

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.819
corrections the same way
that desktop does.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:11.329
On Android, you can press and
hold anywhere on the map and

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.585
basically bring up a Location
Pin, and then there's a Report

00:17:13.585 --> 00:17:14.800
a Problem link from there.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.060
Or in Driving Directions, the
little More menu has a Report

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:18.640
a Problem link.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.900
So you can tell us that you
can't turn left here.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.930
Or you can turn left here, why
isn't Google suggesting it?

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.109
Now the fun part, of course, is
that when you accept user

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:29.810
reports, you accept anything
and everything.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.720
This is an actual report that
came in just after the

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.740
launch of the US.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.170
"There's a field of
marijuana here.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.890
Please call the cops." We really
do get anything and

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:39.390
everything.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.370
This is somewhere in Michigan,
I guess, but

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:45.200
that's just how it goes.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.030
If you want to go a step beyond
reporting a problem,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.110
you can actually fix the
data directly yourself.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.110
We offer a product called
Google Mapmaker,

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.686
mapmaker.google.com.

00:17:52.686 --> 00:17:54.860
It lets you directly
edit the map data.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.880
It's kind of like the tool Atlas
that Andrew has been

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.870
demonstrating, but
for the web.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.640
It's a web-based map editor.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.060
And when you submit edits on
Mapmaker, they go through a

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.360
moderation system.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.460
So we, or a trusted external
user, actually validates the

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.805
edit that you suggest and
confirms whether it conforms

00:18:13.805 --> 00:18:16.240
to all of our policies.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.620
So we're going to demo
that a little bit.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.650
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL: Excellent.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.940
As Michael mentioned, we get
thousands of Report a Problem

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.580
reports every day, and the video
we're about to show--

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:26.890
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK:
Hopefully.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.110
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL: --fingers
crossed, is actually a life

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.595
cycle for one of
those reports.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:36.684
Actually, that's
the indoor one.

00:18:36.684 --> 00:18:38.870
But--

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:39.760
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK:
One second.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.170
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL: OK.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.080
At any rate, what you're
actually going to see in the

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:48.720
video is a user who asks for
directions to a certain place,

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.290
gets the directions back, and
actually feels like telling us

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.340
that, in fact, the left turn
that they're directed to take

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.650
isn't possible in reality.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.980
As a result, they try and
Report a Problem.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.080
Now, using the interface that
Michael just showed you, it's

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.450
possible to select which
exact step you think

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.060
contains the problem.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.330
The report's then sent to a
Ground Truth operator who uses

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.600
all of the tools and the imagery
that you've just seen

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.680
discussed to decide whether or
not the report has merit.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.780
If they decide that yes, in
fact, the data needs to be

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.090
updated, they make the changes
and as soon as it's saved, all

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.380
of a sudden, other users
aren't given

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.490
data with that error.

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:32.440
So that's the Report
a Problem flow.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.670
The Mapmaker one?

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:34.430
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: Yeah,
we'll switch to Mapmaker.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.770
Sorry.

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:36.200
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL: Excellent.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.640
Also, Michael mentioned
Mapmaker.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.370
Many of our users take all of
the stuff we've discussed and

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.790
want to take it a
step further.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.180
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK:
Hang on one second.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.430
Something is not going right.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:05.090
OK, that one's queued up
for now, real quick.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.680
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL: So this is
the Report a Problem flow I

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.780
just mentioned.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.710
It's actually the left turn
that seems problematic.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.560
You'll watch them Report
a Problem.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.080
The nice thing is, you can
select the exact turn.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.940
That in turn helps
the operator.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.630
Feedback goes to one of our
Ground Truth operators.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.300
They use the tool just as you've
been seeing so far.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.690
They can look at the text as
well as what they see in the

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.350
area, the various state of the
intersection and the turn

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.510
restrictions we've been
discussing, all of the

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:35.980
overlaid vector data, and also
the imagery to decide that

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.720
yes, in fact, this left turn
shouldn't be allowed.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.500
They restrict it and then
the edit goes live.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.092
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: And one
second for Mapmaker.

00:20:47.092 --> 00:20:49.140
Sorry, we're doing a backup
presentation method.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.260
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL: So as we
mentioned, a lot of users want

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.580
to take this one step further,
everything we've been talking

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.120
about today.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.880
They want to actually edit the
map data directly, leveraging

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.280
their local expertise.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.850
And for that, as Michael
mentioned, we have Mapmaker.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.660
Here you actually see a video of
a user who's familiar with

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.310
a particular area.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.460
They're taking a road and
they're starting to update

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.950
certain attributes of it,
including the name, the speed

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.080
limit, and whether or
not it's paved.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.530
As the video goes on, you'll
actually see them use the

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.465
satellite imagery to perfect the
geometry of the segment so

00:21:20.465 --> 00:21:22.820
that it exactly matches
reality.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.510
Once they're done with their
edit, they'll submit it for

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.840
moderation, and once moderated,
the change will go

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.090
live within minutes on
maps.google.com.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.550
It's a little long.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.100
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: So it's
very similar to Atlas editing,

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.510
but it's in a web editor so it's
very accessible to the

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.760
average user.

00:21:52.712 --> 00:21:55.220
So we'll cut that off there.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.495
Sorry about the technical
difficulties.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.250
All right, and then the last
topic that we wanted to talk

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:06.790
about on that is indoor mapping,
what we call the

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:07.530
final frontier.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.650
And there was actually just a
session on this, otherwise we

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:11.530
would be telling you
to go to it.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:12.300
But basically, it's not

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.560
sufficient to map the outdoors.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.580
We want to be able to give you
walking directions from your

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.160
terminal at the airport when
you land to your next gate,

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.730
and all sorts of things
like that.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:26.010
So we're going to, hopefully,
have a demo video of that.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:28.070
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL: So if you
attended Sarah and Waleed's

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.600
session on indoor mapping, you
know that we're starting to

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.110
bring the characteristic Google
Maps experience to the

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.580
interior of buildings as well.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.050
So in theory, this is just an
extension of what we already

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.210
know how to do as far as map
data creation is concerned.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:52.810
Take data, iterate on it, and
improve on it using our

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:53.910
existing tools.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:56.250
In practice, however, there are
a couple of problems with

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.230
this, one of which being, we
can't actually do a good job

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:01.980
of tracing indoor maps from
satellite imagery because the

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.000
roofs of the buildings
get in the way.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.490
You can see an exact
example of this.

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.560
This is Terminal 2 for SFO.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.610
What's going on inside?

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:11.050
We have no idea.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.290
Luckily, we have a few tricks
up our sleeve as well.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:16.420
By partnering with building
owners, we can acquire digital

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.920
floor plan data.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.310
We can align this in Atlas to
match with the building's

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.950
footprint so that Ground Truth
operators can begin the

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:27.350
process of mapping and modeling
things like security

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:31.110
checkpoints, elevators,
escalators, restrooms,

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.500
changing stations, et cetera.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.000
Now, while in theory, this just
requires a little extra

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.940
toolwork to make sure that we
can visualize and edit things

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.650
on multiple floors, and also
cope with a feature density

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.730
that's up to three orders of
magnitude higher than for

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:49.030
outdoor mapping, the rest of
it's just business as usual.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.690
In fact, you see here that we
even take pains to model the

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.370
indoor road network.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.490
This corresponds to where you're
allowed to walk or not

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:56.740
walk inside the airport.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.420
And as a result, if you're using
Google Maps for mobile,

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.680
we can direct you to your
connecting gate as soon as you

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.930
step off the flight.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.750
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: So let's
talk a little bit about what

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.290
this all amounts to in
terms of mapping at

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:12.270
the speed of Google.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.300
We get thousands of these
Report a Problem

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.590
submissions a day.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.140
Most of them are responded
to, actually,

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.760
within 24 to 48 hours.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.450
We don't backlog them, so
we have to keep up.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.150
Most of the edits that result
from these reports and from

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.760
Mapmaker go live within
minutes of approval.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.420
I can't stress how
amazing this is.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.620
We have multiple data centers
worldwide, multiple products,

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.830
we have a million
API websites.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:39.060
All of them get updated, usually
within minutes, of

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.250
most edits being accepted.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:45.480
So when we rename a road,
it happens pretty quick.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.850
Additionally, all of that
happens within the context of

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:49.790
the rest of mapping at the speed
of Google in terms of

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.120
our products and services.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.430
Our tiles that are served for
Google Maps-- these are the

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.750
images that load in in blocks
as the web page loads--

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.410
they have an average of 75
milliseconds for their serving

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.510
latency, which, if you are a
techie at all, is sort of

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.710
mind-blowing at the scale that
this is going on at.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.970
We maintained four and a half
nines of uptime over the last

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:08.940
three years, which is
really, really high.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.320
This actually means that if
Google Maps is down, chances

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.790
are it's your internet
provider, not us.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:16.090
And at our peak, we
have served 1.6

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.010
million queries per second.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:21.310
That's 1.6 million of those
little tiles going out every

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.930
second to users around
the world.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.380
This stuff blows me away.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.330
We also accept updates from
more than just our users.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.840
We've talked a lot about our
user strategy here, but we go

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.360
back to our authoritative
sources.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.030
We do have arrangements with
them where we refresh data.

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.450
We also, of course, are
re-driving Street View on a

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:40.130
regular basis, and in fact, some
of those re-drives happen

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:41.580
in response to user issues.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.300
We do, in fact, go out and drive
places where we need to

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.960
clarify a mapping problem.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.750
And then satellite imagery and
aerial imagery are constantly

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:49.960
being refreshed.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.560
This is the other utterly
amazing thing to me.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.840
Every two weeks, just every two
weeks, Google publishes as

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.770
much new imagery as all
of Google had in 2006.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:01.680
That's how quickly we're
updating the aerial and

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.640
satellite imagery.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.180
So we regularly drop issues
where we might not have a

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:08.210
clear enough view of the
intersection, and we go back,

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:12.020
then, when the imagery has
updated and fix the problem.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.530
We also have this fun thing that
we call internally, the

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.880
Crystal Ball Report, and it's
basically a system that we

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.780
have for scanning social media
and news sites, and we try to

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.040
proactively identify issues
that users are complaining

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.210
about, but that they may not be
sending directly our way,

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.470
because it's also a source
of information.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.750
So in some cases, we try to fix
things before they become

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:33.760
a story, and that's been
very effective.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.440
So all of that amounts to
a map of the world.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.500
And where is Google Maps
at this point?

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.040
We've talked a lot about Ground
Truth, we've talked a

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.230
little bit about Mapmaker.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.470
But basically, this is the
present picture, and this was

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.310
presented in the keynote
this morning as well.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.270
Google has, as of recently,
200 countries

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:51.310
mapped around the world.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:54.380
We finally got North
Korea mapped.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.700
The video rental model that I
spoke about in the beginning

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.960
is still in play in quite a
number of countries, and it is

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.220
actually an important
model for us.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.190
In some cases, it's
what we prefer.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:06.130
Ground Truth has launched in
43 countries and regions.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.140
The most recent was Thailand
and Indonesia

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.370
just a few weeks ago.

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.030
And then the blue countries
are completely Mapmaker

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:14.270
sourced, and these are the
countries where users are the

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.160
ones that are generating the map
and we're just providing,

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.310
basically, a platform
for them to do so.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.950
It's also worth mentioning that
many of the Ground Truth

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:23.540
countries have Mapmaker
launched as well.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.520
So in the US, in the UK, in a
number of other countries, you

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.590
can directly edit the data.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.540
And it's our intention that
wherever we do Ground Truth

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.400
mapping, we do want to support
Mapmaker as a venue for users

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.410
correcting the data.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:37.950
So that's about all
we have for today.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.210
Thank you all for coming,
and we'd be

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.480
happy to take any questions.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:47.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:50.010
AUDIENCE: Hi my name
is [? Thibault. ?]

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:53.580
I work with a business software
and they usually have

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:57.880
warehouses and they don't want
to put their indoor maps on

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.100
the public internet.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.750
Is there a possibility
to do indoor

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.350
marketing for private locations?

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:05.370
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: So
there is a product.

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:08.910
Google Maps Engine will cover
some of that use case.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:11.590
It's basically an online data
store but it's private.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.400
It's [? ACL-ed ?]

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.540
with access restrictions so
that you can have private

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.640
instances of a map and you can
control who has access to it.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.840
And I believe there's probably
sessions and probably some

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.590
demos as well.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:22.150
AUDIENCE: Can you repeat
the name, please?

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:23.450
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK:
Google Maps Engine.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.220
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.620
AUDIENCE: One data source you
didn't mention is the hundreds

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.240
of millions of people walking
around using Google Maps on

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.610
their phones, and I would think
you'd be able to track

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.100
where they are and that you'd
know those were real roads and

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:37.990
real sidewalks.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.200
Is that something you do,
or why not if you don't?

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.110
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: So we do
leverage anonymized traffic

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:44.910
data for a lot of our
mapping processes.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:47.360
Andrew demoed the one-way
detection that we did, and

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.430
that's one example of it, and
there's other places in the

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:50.790
data where we do try
to leverage that.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:54.750
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:58.380
Could you go into a little bit
more detail about the computer

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.410
vision that you utilize?

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:01.970
I know you talked a little bit
about some sign detection and

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:05.080
stuff, but I wasn't quite clear
on whether you actually

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:10.860
look at the Street View or the
satellite imagery and infer

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.510
the roads from the
actual imagery?

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:18.150
And just a little bit more,
maybe, about the automation,

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:22.030
because I know you wanted to
talk more about the user

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.482
interface, but if you could
just go a little

00:29:23.482 --> 00:29:24.490
bit more into that.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:26.040
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: Yeah, we
have a wide mix of manual

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.040
stuff and automated stuff.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.100
The ones that we really like to
talk about are Street View

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.700
is the really big example.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.100
We read numbers off of street
signs, we match templates and

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.280
spot street signs.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.190
You can actually see-- a No Left
Turn in some countries is

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.160
always the same shape, and
so you can spot those

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.550
automatically.

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:48.820
There's also instances where we
can confirm street names.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.430
I had one other and it
just slipped my mind.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:53.500
But it's varied.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.452
There's a wide variety
of them.

00:29:55.452 --> 00:29:56.950
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.950
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
about how many people do you

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:04.810
have working on Google Maps
[? fitting ?] it themselves?

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:05.910
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK:
Work on, sorry?

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:08.710
AUDIENCE: How many people work
on the Google Maps themselves?

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:09.610
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK:
The operators?

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:10.750
AUDIENCE: How many operators
are there, yes?

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:11.850
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: Yeah, so
we don't like to talk about

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:12.890
the exact size of
the workforce.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:15.330
We do say, though, it takes
hundreds of people to map the

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:20.280
typical country, so it's a
very large-scale effort.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.640
AUDIENCE: Hi, and please correct
me if this is going to

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.110
be addressed elsewhere in the
conference, but I have a

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:29.690
question about public transit
data, and in particular, are

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:33.180
you guys incorporating real-time
live transit data

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.210
into your directions?

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:37.300
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: Yeah.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.110
I'm not an expert on this, but
the two forms of transit data

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:43.500
that I'm aware of, we have a
data format that's public.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's GTLS.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:45.170
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: Yes.

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:48.630
And so people can publish the
basic static transit info.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:51.785
And I do know that we serve
live transit info--

00:30:51.785 --> 00:30:54.820
ETAs for trains, and where is
the current train, things like

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.000
that-- for a select
number of cities.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.180
I don't know how many, and I'm
not sure of exactly how that

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.310
works, though.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:03.620
AUDIENCE: G'day.

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:08.100
My company uses a lot of Google
Maps stuff, and I'm

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.190
just wondering, is there any
way that users can put in

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:14.490
colloquial names for places
or is there any--

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:15.450
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK:
Sorry, put in what?

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:18.465
AUDIENCE: Colloquial names
for places, so Joe's Pub.

00:31:18.465 --> 00:31:20.046
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: Does
Mapmaker support that?

00:31:20.046 --> 00:31:21.590
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL: Mapmaker
does support that.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.280
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: Yeah.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:26.500
So there's a whole schema and
set of classifications for how

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.640
you name things, whether it's a
city or a road, and we model

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.870
that in intricate detail and
flag something as its local

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:36.730
name, its obscure name that
maybe we shouldn't show but we

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.640
should show in response
to searches.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.220
All that, we have modeling
internally for that, and much

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.610
of it is reflected on
Mapmaker so you can

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:43.840
directly edit that data.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.980
AUDIENCE: What's the process
to upload that to you guys?

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.550
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: We don't
have a method right now for a

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:49.900
mass upload.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.420
It would be for individual
corrections.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.320
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:58.495
I was wondering, how do you
deal with updates to the

00:31:58.495 --> 00:31:59.270
mapping data--

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:02.680
new projects, new roads,
or roads get blocked?

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.650
Is there a process that you
guys follow for that?

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:07.880
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK:
It's the things

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.180
that I outlined, basically.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.170
We mostly rely on users.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.410
Users are very proactive, and
actually wind up alerting to

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:15.120
us about most things.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.150
The Crystal Ball Report is
really good, particularly for

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:19.390
large changes, even before
they happen.

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:21.670
We'll find out that a freeway
interchange construction is

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:23.990
going to finish, and we might be
able to open it on Maps the

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:26.330
same day that it opens
in the real world.

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:30.020
And then we do these re-drives
and re-flies of imagery, and

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.430
we revisit things
that we weren't

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:33.350
completely sure about before.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:35.810
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:37.370
AUDIENCE: One of my questions
was around the

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:39.150
date timing of things.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:41.710
If an interchange is about
to open, or a bridge

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:46.690
construction, or something like
that, is it date stamped

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.500
where you can release a new
version of the map on a

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.180
particular day?

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:52.420
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: So the way
that our systems work, we

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.850
don't actually model,
say, it's going

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:56.050
to open in two weeks.

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:58.760
There's no way in Mapmaker
to mark that.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.080
But we have the ability for
big changes to kind of

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.740
synchronize and make sure
that we push it out

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.730
at the right time.

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:05.560
We're republishing
continuously.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.140
It's actually not even as simple
as saying that we're

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.070
currently running a map that
was created a week ago,

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:13.750
because it's literally moment
by moment, there's users

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:14.250
interacting with it.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:15.990
AUDIENCE: So that kind of
brings up my next one.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:20.020
You've got incidents or events
with traffic data, right?

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:23.580
Is there any way to tie that
to longer-term events like

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.205
construction, road closures,
that kind of stuff?

00:33:26.205 --> 00:33:28.200
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: Tie it
to it as far as what?

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.780
AUDIENCE: Like if a lane is
going to be closed for two

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.480
weeks, or a month, or a year,
that kind of stuff?

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.070
Or bridge construction, or--?

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:38.100
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: So we
have some guidelines

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.930
internally where if something's
going to go on for

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:43.160
more than a certain period of
time, we turn it into an

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.630
actual map data change.

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:47.000
If it's really transient in
nature, it shows up on the

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.200
traffic layer as like a little
warning sign or something, but

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.010
we don't modify the
data itself.

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:53.830
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.940
AUDIENCE: Just a question
on business data in less

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.250
developed countries, so things
like knowing the names of

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.180
businesses and their
GPS locations.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.095
I used to live in Indonesia and
you were just saying you

00:34:05.095 --> 00:34:07.840
just recently did Ground Truth
for there, but how do you do

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.290
the business part of it?

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:11.550
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: So we
haven't talked a lot about

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.820
what we call local data, which
is business listings.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.139
Map data is a piece of cake
compared to local data.

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:18.239
Particularly in some
countries like

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:19.900
Indonesia, it can be a challenge.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:21.560
And there's no one answer.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:25.449
We go into a country and we
source whatever we can, and in

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:27.199
some countries, that's
pretty high quality.

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:29.170
In other countries, it's
a little lower.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:31.000
But we also rely
on users a lot.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.699
India is pretty much exclusively
mapped by its

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:37.880
users, and it's a surprisingly
well-mapped country given that

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.840
starting point in many places.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.719
So users are actually taking
ownership of whole

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:43.540
neighborhoods and curating
the businesses there.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.949
So there's different strategies

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:47.639
for different places.

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:49.270
AUDIENCE: So sort of related
to that, you mentioned that

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:52.810
sometimes you prefer
user-submitted maps over

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:54.600
Project Ground Truth or some of
the other things that you

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.590
do, and I'm curious why that
would be the case.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.080
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: If I used
the word "prefer," that's

00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.910
probably a strong word.

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:01.790
Ground Truth is very expensive
and difficult and

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:03.110
takes a lot of time.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.850
It's going to take us a while
to map the countries that we

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:07.590
do want to map, and we just make
careful trade-offs and

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:10.110
try to figure out, what's the
best way to bring something to

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.860
market to users quickest?

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.410
And in the case of India, we
started Mapmaker there in

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:18.930
2008, 2009--

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.300
one of those two--

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.490
and so it got a huge jump start
long before we would

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:27.800
have been able to address
it with Ground Truth.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.100
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.400
I'm Eric, and I was wondering
if you guys were going to do

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.670
parking, because I see you guys
are able to pull business

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.480
logos, and you guys obviously
have a lot of city data as

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:41.120
well, and obviously when we
drive anywhere, that's a big

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.040
part of what our actual
destination is?

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.270
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: Yeah, I
mean, parking information is

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:46.670
something of interest to us.

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:48.980
Ultimately, we basically want
to model the entirety of the

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.200
real world on the map.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.250
It should be possible for you
to answer any question that

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.880
has a place using the map.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.490
AUDIENCE: So following up on
India, you mentioned that you

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:01.530
rely entirely, or almost
entirely, on user-submitted

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.370
mapping, and other countries
as well.

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:05.570
So it's my understanding
that this is

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.430
entirely a closed system.

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:09.360
So do you ever give back?

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.430
It's kind of like users
are sort of doing your

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:12.120
business for you.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.130
Do you ever give back to
them, or are they just

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:15.180
contributing for free?

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:15.690
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: Yeah.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:18.590
So we do, in a number of
countries, actually give back.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.460
I don't remember if India's
one of them or not, but

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.690
there's a list of countries that
have humanitarian needs

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:23.930
that we make the data
available to

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:26.130
NGOs free of charge.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:29.060
It is the case that you can't
directly download the data.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.310
We've taken the approach that
we believe that this type of

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.510
ecosystem is going to be
the most effective.

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:36.740
If they download it and they try
to fork it or they try to

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.790
modify it, it's unclear what
you'd want to do with it.

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:42.520
Additionally, we really feel
that the Maps API is sort of

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.870
the optimal way to leverage the
geodata, so we do want to

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:49.110
enhance the API over time to do
anything that you'd want to

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:53.240
do by downloading the data.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.970
AUDIENCE: So my question is
related to Ground Truth data

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:57.560
for indoor maps.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:02.730
So if I get it correctly right
now, they're focusing on users

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:05.090
to give indoor maps
information.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:08.530
So what's your thought about--

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:11.260
you have self-driven cars for
outdoor environments--

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:14.370
something like that, close to a
robot, to go around, collect

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:16.220
the data for you, for Ground
Truth information?

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.010
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: So you're
asking if we are going to make

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:21.470
robots to roam the airports
and map the interior?

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:23.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah, or self-driven
cars indoors

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.700
which would help you?

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.100
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: I think
that's a great idea, and you

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.900
should go track down Larry or
Sergei and apply for a job at

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:33.100
Google X. It's a hard problem,
and it's also a scaling

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.820
problem and questions
of logistics.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.280
So is it easier to
put humans there?

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.770
Is it easier to put
robots there?

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.920
And who would be better at it?

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.800
AUDIENCE: I guess like the
sensors they've been using

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:46.340
right now are just Wi-Fi, so if
you had sensor information

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:49.940
from cameras and stuff, visual
information, it would be

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.020
easier to map those locations.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.535
Or do you have any sensor inputs
from the users that

00:37:55.535 --> 00:37:57.230
they could give for visual
information?

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:58.070
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK:
That's conceivable.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:01.020
It's an interesting idea, and
it's not far off from--

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:05.800
Brian, in the keynote, he showed
that interior 3D photo

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.820
tour, and there's a lot of
information being constructed

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.840
there about the interior
of a famous place.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.030
So it's an interesting idea.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:13.560
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL: And this
does give us a chance to pitch

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.930
a talk that's occurring tomorrow
on localization.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.530
We're incredibly agnostic about
what we use as far as

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:21.760
sensors and technologies,
so we'll try anything.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.690
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: Do you know
the title of the talk?

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:24.780
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL: No, but it
might have localization in it.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.570
If you can find me afterward,
I'll make--

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.580
AUDIENCE: Internationalization
and localization,

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:29.130
something like that?

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:29.500
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL:
It's not that one.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.160
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK:
It's localization

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.770
in a spatial sense.

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:33.330
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL: If you can
find us afterward, we'll give

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:33.950
you the information.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:37.000
AUDIENCE: Thanks a lot.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:42.060
As some of you guys might know,
there's another project

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:44.420
that's doing a lot of this,
Open Street Map.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.360
And I'm wondering if you could
talk a little bit about your

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.700
relationship with them, and
has that changed at all?

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.650
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: Yeah.

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:54.200
I, and virtually everybody in
Google Maps, are huge fans of

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:54.880
Open Street Map.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.890
I think it's a really
cool project.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:59.350
To date, we haven't worked
very closely with them.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:00.810
We've supported them
in the past with

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:03.080
some funds or something.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.570
They have a very different
approach.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:07.910
They're doing a very
open approach.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:11.560
We are, as was commented, it's
a more closed ecosystem.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:17.850
But competition is awesome, and
it's not a zero sum game,

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.400
as Larry was saying, and it's
not a win all or take all

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.370
because in some places, one
model might work better.

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:23.980
In some places, others will.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.410
So we'll just have to see.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:26.050
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:26.920
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL:
With 30 seconds

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.120
left, maybe last question.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.130
AUDIENCE: How do you to report
a problem which is not

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:35.570
specific to a location, but
probably a wrong algorithm?

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:36.240
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: Probably
wrong what?

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.790
AUDIENCE: A wrong algorithm.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:38.820
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: Can
you give an example?

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:42.500
AUDIENCE: In my city, if you
look for a street and you

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:46.980
don't specify the first name of
the person of the street,

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.550
you don't find the result.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:50.990
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK: You
should come talk to us.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:53.880
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL: Come find us
after, but a larger answer

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.530
to that is, we accept
incredibly

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.120
general input on RMI--

00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.720
AUDIENCE: And I think it
happened when Ground Truth was

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.570
introduced last year.

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:02.710
ANDREW LOOKINGBILL:
Come find us.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:03.720
MICHAEL WEISS-MALIK:
It's hard to get

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.090
everything exactly right.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:07.620
But as Andrew was saying, if you
report a problem, even if

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.760
it's general, it does
flow into a

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.740
larger bucketing system.

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.805
And we address all scale
of complaints.

00:40:12.805 --> 00:40:14.310
I think we're out of time.

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:15.740
Thanks everybody again
for coming.

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:20.657
[APPLAUSE]
