&gt;&gt;Nicole: As a K-5 teacher, we
understand that it's really important

00:00:06.246 --> 00:00:08.496
to integrate the curriculum
as much as possible.

00:00:08.806 --> 00:00:12.846
So if you're doing a lesson in the
computer lab, if it's combining some

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.526
of the reading skills, writing
skills, language art skills,

00:00:15.526 --> 00:00:18.656
or their knowledge about
a certain subject area,

00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:20.846
I think that it makes
learning a lot more meaningful.

00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:37.896
&gt;&gt;Nicole: A few years ago,
the District had to do a lot

00:00:37.896 --> 00:00:40.546
of cutbacks on tech spending.

00:00:40.546 --> 00:00:43.306
And I started to see that
there was an advantage

00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:47.456
of using the cloud-based,
or free web apps.

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:51.206
And anybody who has a computer or
internet, they can access them,

00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:54.516
not only from school, but at home,
so my goal is to get them so excited

00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:57.296
that they go home and continue
on with their learning.

00:00:57.516 --> 00:01:01.496
For example, they can do their
digital art, or digital drawings

00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:06.626
in programs such as Sumo Paint, or
Psycho Paint inside of Google Docs,

00:01:06.626 --> 00:01:09.206
Google Drawing, PhotoSketch,
SketchUp.

00:01:09.206 --> 00:01:11.356
Those are just a few
choices that I give them.

00:01:11.646 --> 00:01:14.816
&gt;&gt;Student: This is a list
of different applications

00:01:14.816 --> 00:01:18.536
that you can use to like
make music or do art.

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:21.546
It's just a variety of them
that Ms. Dalesio put together.

00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:23.156
&gt;&gt;Nicole: And then we also
take advantage of a lot

00:01:23.156 --> 00:01:26.656
of the free software that comes
built into our Apple computers,

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:30.806
so we utilize iLife
a lot for our photo

00:01:30.806 --> 00:01:34.476
and video editing inside
of iMovie, or in iPhoto.

00:01:34.926 --> 00:01:38.516
And we also use things like
Garage Band and iTunes for them

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:41.356
to do their audio recordings
or create music.

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:44.026
&gt;&gt;Nicole: You know, you get your
ingredients together in the folder,

00:01:44.316 --> 00:01:47.086
and then when you mix them together,
this is what you're doing in iMovie.

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:50.006
And then when you export it out, it's
sort of like you're baking the cake.

00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:51.806
&gt;&gt;Nicole: I gave them
several choices

00:01:51.806 --> 00:01:53.516
on the assignment that
they had to do.

00:01:53.516 --> 00:01:54.966
And all of them had to use iMovie.

00:01:55.206 --> 00:01:58.716
The first one was to make
a life story with pictures

00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:00.526
from their childhood
under three minutes.

00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:04.446
And another one was that
they could do a poem.

00:02:04.686 --> 00:02:09.286
And another choice was that they
could create a tutorial explaining a

00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:10.816
concept that they had learned,

00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:12.606
they knew how to do,
such as a math concept.

00:02:12.986 --> 00:02:16.156
And then the other one was that
they could do a personal narrative

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:17.966
or other fictional story
that they had written,

00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:20.746
and turn that into video
in under 90 seconds.

00:02:20.746 --> 00:02:22.516
&gt;&gt;Nicole: And what's
your project about?

00:02:22.516 --> 00:02:24.126
&gt;&gt;Student: I did this
personal narrative,

00:02:24.126 --> 00:02:26.066
and I went to this place
called Pismo Beach.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:29.456
&gt;&gt;Nicole: Oh, okay, so you did
the story about Pismo Beach.

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:29.936
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:33.146
&gt;&gt;Nicole: Where are the photos that
you're going to use for that project?

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:35.616
&gt;&gt;Student: They're on the
server and in the iMovie folder.

00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:36.526
&gt;&gt;Nicole: Okay, perfect,

00:02:36.526 --> 00:02:39.146
so you already transferred
them over from home?

00:02:39.476 --> 00:02:39.566
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:02:39.696 --> 00:02:43.076
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, we have to
make like a movie project.

00:02:43.076 --> 00:02:49.776
So you kind of have a topic,
and with your topic you speak

00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:53.156
into a microphone, and
then you draw pictures

00:02:53.156 --> 00:02:56.016
to go with what you're saying.

00:02:56.156 --> 00:02:57.496
&gt;&gt;Student: Sad is the
color of dark blue.

00:02:57.496 --> 00:03:00.776
Sad sounds like sobbing
and deep misery.

00:03:01.076 --> 00:03:02.756
Sad feels as heavy as sharp bricks.

00:03:02.756 --> 00:03:04.976
Sad smells like tears
on a damp pillow.

00:03:05.126 --> 00:03:09.726
&gt;&gt;Student: When I go in the lab
and do like an iMovie project.

00:03:09.726 --> 00:03:11.936
And I'm just going to do
one of these poems in here.

00:03:11.936 --> 00:03:14.886
And I'm going to-- there's
this thing called "Kid Pics."

00:03:14.886 --> 00:03:19.306
I'm going to like load it on,
like into little like sections.

00:03:19.306 --> 00:03:23.066
Put it all together, and I'm going
to put music in the background,

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:25.976
and I'm probably going to talk
about it, too, a little bit.

00:03:26.286 --> 00:03:30.076
&gt;&gt;Student: And then look at your
audio, and you put it in iTunes.

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:31.136
&gt;&gt;Student: So go to
this, put all your--

00:03:31.406 --> 00:03:33.086
&gt;&gt;Student: They're in order.

00:03:33.086 --> 00:03:35.976
&gt;&gt;Student: No, but
put them all together.

00:03:36.056 --> 00:03:36.716
&gt;&gt;Nicole: If you create
an environment

00:03:36.796 --> 00:03:40.226
where they can collaborate with each
other, then they get better ideas

00:03:40.226 --> 00:03:43.806
with each other, but also they help
each other to finish their projects.

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:45.896
&gt;&gt;Student: My story
is about basketball.

00:03:46.396 --> 00:03:52.836
Right now I'm working on adjusting
how long each photo is going to take,

00:03:53.896 --> 00:03:56.216
and seeing where I need
to place the photos.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.866
&gt;&gt;Nicole: You've got the writing
skills and the reading skills

00:03:58.866 --> 00:03:59.766
and the speaking skills

00:03:59.766 --> 00:04:02.596
and the technology skills
collaborating with each other.

00:04:02.596 --> 00:04:06.296
Organization skills all put together.

00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:09.156
&gt;&gt;Student: We both
were doing tutorials.

00:04:09.946 --> 00:04:12.956
We got the audio first
recorded outside.

00:04:12.956 --> 00:04:16.456
And then we took a screen
recording of what we were doing

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:17.866
on like this painting website.

00:04:18.556 --> 00:04:21.976
And we like just filmed what we
were going to show on the tutorial.

00:04:22.226 --> 00:04:26.896
Then on iMovie we put the video
and mixed it with the audio.

00:04:27.396 --> 00:04:31.326
And cut off some portions of audio
or clipped some portions of video

00:04:31.526 --> 00:04:33.976
for it to kind of match up.

00:04:34.076 --> 00:04:34.736
&gt;&gt;Student: Cool technique, huh?

00:04:35.006 --> 00:04:37.516
Okay, now we can try
something a little bit harder.

00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:40.776
How about, I guess, 25 times 25.

00:04:40.776 --> 00:04:44.356
&gt;&gt;Nicole: How many people got
their iMovie projects uploaded

00:04:44.356 --> 00:04:46.316
and on their digital portfolios?

00:04:47.046 --> 00:04:48.656
&gt;&gt;Nicole: And then the
next thing would be able

00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:49.856
to share it with other people.

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:54.376
I think it makes it all the more
meaningful in terms of if they think

00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:57.026
that somebody else might see it,
you know, you have the whole concept

00:04:57.026 --> 00:04:58.316
of the authentic audience.

00:05:03.806 --> 00:05:06.216
Another important concept that
I want students to know is

00:05:06.216 --> 00:05:08.686
that it's not just me teaching them.

00:05:08.686 --> 00:05:10.226
We're all here to teach each other.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:13.266
And each one of us is, you
know, a citizen in this class,

00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:16.246
and I want them to participate
and contribute to their learning.

00:05:16.356 --> 00:05:20.246
So definitely want to encourage them
to be sharing and to collaborate

00:05:20.246 --> 00:05:22.856
with others and to always
be a lifelong learner.
