00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.740
There is a lot that holds us back from trying out psychotherapy.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.400
There is the idea that you have to be a little mad

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.400
or harbor some huge and strange problem

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.400
to go and see a therapist.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.800
It can be hard to see that therapy isn't in fact

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.800
for the select, disturbed few,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.260
it's for everyone.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.400
Because, actually it's entirely ordinary

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.400
to be rather confused,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.400
a bit anxious,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.400
and sometimes challenged by relationships,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.400
family life,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.400
and the direction of your career.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.400
So really, the only qualification for going to therapy

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.400
is to be a normal human being.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.640
There is also the worry about the strangeness of it all.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.600
It will be you and someone you've never met,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.600
to whom your expected to divulge nothing less than

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.100
your inner life.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.100
Why not talk to a friend?

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200
Well, firstly, because friends aren't properly trained

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.600
to listen.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.600
As one would have noticed,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.000
they interrupt, a lot.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And secondly, because it's sometimes easier

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to tell someone who has no prior knowledge

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
or expectations of you

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the big and important things about who you are.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.800
Furthermore,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.800
Therapist are the last people ever to judge.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.400
Their concept of a normal human being

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.400
is far more expansive than that held by society at large.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.800
They know how unsual and surprising we are,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
especially around sex and anxiety.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Their whole training

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
takes them into the recesses of their own and others minds.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.320
They know how surprising we can all be.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.300
It doesn't frighten them - it intrigues and motivates them.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.300
That's why they became therapists in the first place.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.800
They are in the end,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.400
interested in mental health,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.800
that means, in helping out.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.200
Then there's the cost.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.800
Isn't it all a fortune?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.000
It might be the price of going out for dinner with friends,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.400
which is both a lot, and not so much.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.400
It really just depends on the value you place on it.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.400
This is the crux of it:

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.600
Therapy is valuable,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.400
because so many of our problems come down to

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.600
not having enough insight

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.600
into how our minds work:

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.400
What we want? What we fear?

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.680
Why we act the way we do?

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.920
and are overwhelmed by certain feelings?

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.900
The goal of therapy is

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.400
self-knowledge.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.000
By talking a lot to someone who listens very carefully,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.600
over many weeks

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.800
you come to deeper insights

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800
into the mind you inhabit.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.400
Patterns start to emerge,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.800
a particular way of approaching relationships,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.600
or dealing with defeat,

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.000
a recurrent, not very helpful, approach to jealousy,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.400
an ongoing thing with your sister or father -

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.400
This is the stuff of therapy.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Knowing how to live isn't an instinct,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.900
we are not born with it.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.400
It's a skill.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.800
And one of the places you learn it

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.200
is in the outworldly, slightly unusual

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.200
but in fact, deeply normal and productive setting

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.400
of a therapist's office.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.040
It isn't a sign of disturbance to go to therapy

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.000
it's the first sign of sanity

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and of a proper, grown-up commitment

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
to mental health.
