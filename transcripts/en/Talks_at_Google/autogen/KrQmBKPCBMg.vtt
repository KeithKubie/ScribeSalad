&gt;&gt;Susan Wojcicki: So good morning.
So I'm very, very pleased to have Marlee Matlin here.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.769
And I'm very pleased to introduce her and

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.670
have her come up here and tell us her story and tell us about some

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.619
of the causes that she is committed to.
[ Applause ]

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:30.619
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, Susan.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.820
And speaking of not everyone knowing who I
am, it's true.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.510
There isn't.
I don't know if any of you -- well, I have

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.409
to admit this, but I was a huge -- I actually
had a huge weakness, when I have the time

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.010
to watch a little television, because I have
four kids, and it's difficult to watch.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.089
And I have one teenaged girl who is 14, and
she's a huge fan of "The Bachelor."

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.040
You all know the show "The Bachelor."
It just so happened that on "Dancing with

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.479
the Stars" when I was there, I happened to
meet the -- what's his name?

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:07.010
Jake -- I actually met Vienna, who is the
woman who grabbed Jake, or who Jake chose

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.140
on this year's bachelor.
And she came up to me and said, "Are you an

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.150
actress?"
And, of course, clearly, it proves that not

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.200
everybody knows who I am.
[ Laughter ]

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.200
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Anyway, I am so happy to
be here today at the coolest place, the mecca

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.710
of the Internet world, Google.
Google is a sign -- what's the sign?

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.830
This is the sign -- Google headquarters.
It's like that moment when Darth Vader said,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.830
"Luke, I am your father."
And everyone gasped and said, "No way!"

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.330
I can't believe it's happening.
It's the ultimate cool to be here today.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.550
And there's free food, too.
You guys have free Red Bull, free food.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.180
I can't believe it.
It's really great.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.990
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: So is there a resume that

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.860
I need to give you if I want to apply for
a job here?

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.490
Maybe I could play pool all day.
I don't know.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.280
Anyway, thank you.
It's a fun place to be.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.560
Thank you for having me here.
More importantly, being here with you, I can

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.670
finally see some of the faces behind the news
and the entertainment and the information

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.620
that the world has come to rely upon.
And now that I see you, I want to say thank

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.260
you for all that you are doing.
You are fantastic.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.600
Thank you very much.
Well, I know that you're anxious to have me

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.480
talk about my book, that book that is called
"I'll Scream Later."

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.090
And some of you may wonder where that title
came from.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.819
Well, I have to admit that if you didn't know
already, I am a recovering drug addict.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.069
And today it's been 23 years, two months,
and 20 days.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.400
And just --
[ Applause ]

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.870
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Thank you.
[ Applause ]

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.870
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: And just after I won the
Golden Globe for best actress in "Children

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.950
of a Lesser God," I checked myself into rehab
at the Betty Ford Clinic.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.950
Unlike today, where my entire journey would
have been covered by TMZ and Perez Hilton,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.980
back then, way back then, there was no such
thing as being able to -- there was no such

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.400
thing as those things, so I was able to check
in in secret.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.700
While I was there, I was nominated for an
Academy Award for best actress.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.640
If you can imagine, I must be the only person
to get that, "Congratulations, you've been

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.680
nominated," call while working on my sobriety
at the Betty Ford Clinic.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.879
So, anyway, when the phone call came in from
Jack here, who -- by the way, this is Jack

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.790
Jason, my interpreter, if I didn't introduce
him already, sorry.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.290
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: I don't have a male voice.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.069
I just wanted to let you know that.
[ Laughter ]

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.819
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Well, maybe after a couple
of cigarettes.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.160
No, anyway.
Anyway, he asked me for reaction or a statement,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.709
which wasn't going to be, "Staying sober.
Thank you for the nomination, but I'm staying

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.410
sober, keeping sober."
I didn't want to say that.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.459
So instead, I said, tell them I'll scream
later.

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:19.000
And that phrase stuck with me ever since.
And I think it strikes the right tone of humor

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.360
and irony coming from this Deaf gal, because
as you'll see in my book, I may be Deaf, but

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.729
I'm probably one of the loudest people you'll ever meet.

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:35.729
My good friend and mentor, Henry Winkler,
put it perfectly when he told me, "If you

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:42.889
will it, it is not a dream."
For me, if you will it, it is not a dream.

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:48.050
It's about intention.
And for me, even though I was different than

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.650
everyone else, I had the will and the desire
to make something happen for myself.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.550
And everything else just followed.
But times have changed.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:06.550
Though today I'm an actress and a film producer,
as well as an advocate for children and disability-related

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.860
causes, and most recently a dancer on "Dancing
with the Stars" -- I hope you voted for me.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.809
Did you vote?
Okay.

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:21.210
I'm also a mother of four.
And as a result, I'm a cook and a car-pool

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:28.099
driver and a room mother and a conflict mediator,
and a closet organizer and a pretend math whiz.

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.629
Seriously, life is good.

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:39.629
It's been 23 years since critics said that
I won my Academy Award out of pity and that

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:44.080
I would never work in Hollywood again simply
because I was Deaf.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.259
And I'm still here.
The barriers that many had predicted would

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:56.259
stop my career dead in its tracks have virtually
vanished, thanks to many working actors like

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:02.629
me who are Deaf or differently abled, attitudes
have changed.

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:07.939
Now, most of the barriers I face are more
humorous than they are distressing.

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:12.419
Here are a couple of examples.
Once when I was working on a television show

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:17.289
with Mark Harmon called "reasonable doubts."
Many of you are probably too young to even

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:22.939
know this program was on the air.
But, anyway, an NBC executive came to visit

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:26.999
the studio where we were shooting the show.
After watching me work for a little while,

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:31.349
he said to the executive producer of the show,
you know, that Marlee Matlin is great.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:38.349
Is she going to be Deaf for the whole show?
[ Laughter ]

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:46.129
It's okay, I'm over it.
And once while I was ready to appear live

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:52.509
on CNN, in front of millions of viewers, as
you know CNN has, the director was counting

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:57.319
down the seconds, and I was getting my makeup,
Jack was sitting with the reporter on the

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:01.279
other side of the camera, as we were counting
down, with just three seconds, she leaned

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:06.710
over to Jack and said, "Could you tell Marlee
that my dog is deaf just like her."

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.169
And suddenly I was live on television, and
I'm thinking, what does she want me to --

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.259
does she want to throw me a bone?
Does she want me to say woof?"

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:18.719
I don't know.
Okay.

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:24.159
And this doesn't only happen in Hollywood.
It happened to me a couple of times.

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:28.099
I don't know about you, those people who are
Deaf, but I'm on a plane, ready for the plane

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:31.649
to take off.
I'm set, my seat belt is on, and Jack and

00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:34.939
I are signing to each other.
The flight attendant comes over, sees me signing,

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:39.069
waves, gives me a menu.
As soon as she sees me signing, she grabs

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:42.839
the menu out of my hand, goes to the galley
and returns with a new menu in Braille.

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:49.839
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Actually, they have to think

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:57.050
about it for a moment, too.
And she's like, "Yes, so what's wrong?

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.309
Don't you need the Braille?"
I'm like, "No, I'm Deaf, not blind."

00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:08.309
And then she realizes it, and then I never
see her for the rest of the flight.

00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:14.839
I use these stories not to trivialize the
barriers facing people like myself, because

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:20.909
every day, there is still discrimination against
differently-abled people and people who are Deaf.

00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:24.439
And whether being in front of the camera,

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:31.089
out and about, being a mom, or working on
behalf of some of my favorite charities, my

00:08:31.089 --> 00:08:37.340
message has always been the same and one that
I got from my parents, that no matter what

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:44.340
abilities we possess, all of us not only deserve
respect, we deserve to be heard.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:52.490
In my book, I chronicle that it wasn't always
easy, that sometimes I was made fun of out

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.310
there and sometimes I fell.
But it was all a part of growing up.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:04.310
Just because I was Deaf, my parents felt that
I should not live a sheltered life.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:10.150
And far from it.
They believed that it was important for me

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:17.150
to embrace life, both the good and the bad.
So even though I danced in front of 25 million

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:26.110
people each week on "Dancing with the Stars,"
or stood my ground as strong characters who

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:32.440
just happened to be Deaf on shows like "The
'L' Word" and on "The West Wing," I still

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.490
have days when I feel like I'm going out that
front door of my parents' house for the first

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:42.020
time to prove that I can do anything except
hear.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:49.020
And oftentimes I still find myself explaining
that, yes, I do drive a car; and, yes, I can

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:56.220
have children; and, yes, I am a working actress.
Well, fortunately, with your commitment here

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:04.940
today to creating greater accessibility, you
at Google have demonstrated that you get it.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:11.830
You get it.
Because what you're doing here today with

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:16.460
YouTube and automatic captioning is nothing
short of extraordinary.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:23.460
I cannot tell you how much I've come to rely
on the Internet for my communication needs.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.760
And many others out there, many millions of
others out there.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:33.450
I'm sure you've probably heard of the irony
of the invention of the telephone, that when

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:39.810
Alexander Graham Bell, who had a Deaf wife
and a Deaf mother, wanted to find a way to

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:44.740
help them communicate, he thought of the television
 -- excuse me, the telephone as a tool that

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.680
would help them.
But little did he realize that the telephone

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:54.380
would be one of the greatest barriers when
it came to communication between the Deaf

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.800
and the hearing world.
Right there.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:08.230
Twenty years ago, I lobbied, and I succeeded
in getting the film which inspired me to be

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:14.270
an actress, "The Wizard of Oz," to be closed
captioned for the first time.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:21.260
Because captioning was crucial in bringing
the words that you all take for granted

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:26.700
to my world.
And the following year, in 1990, I took it

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:33.700
one step further, and I went to Capitol Hill
to lobby on behalf of the legislation that

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:41.780
all televisions 13 inches or larger should
be equipped with closed captioning technology.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:48.810
Like the critics who doubted my ability to
be an actor because, in their eyes, my Deafness

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:57.120
put me on a level below my peers, TV manufacturers
and programmers thought that millions of Americans

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.660
who were Deaf or hard of hearing didn't deserve
equal access through closed captioned.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:08.040
But with the hard work and determination,
we were successful in getting the decoder

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.030
bill passed.
Six years later. And legislation was passed that

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:19.780
required that all broadcast television be
100% closed captioned.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:25.780
But like the irony of the invention of the telephone
telephone, the Internet eventually became

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:32.670
a bigger barrier than one could ever imagine
when it came to closed captioning content on

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.760
broadband.
Here's a good example.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:42.760
Just last October, the "The Wizard of Oz"
celebrated a wonderful milestone, the 75th

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.280
anniversary of its initial release.
And for the first time in broadcast history,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.740
it was going to be streamed live to every
single American who had access to a computer

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.200
for free.
So -- absolutely free.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:05.010
So I was eager to share the film with my children,
particularly my then-five-year-old daughter,

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:12.010
in whose eyes I saw the same sense of wonderment
and excitement that I had when I was 7 watching

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:17.800
the film for the first time about the young
girl with the Ruby slippers who dreamt of

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:23.370
someplace over the Rainbow.
But when I opened up my laptop and hit the

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:30.370
"play" button, I was horrified to find that
the film that I had lobbied to get closed

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:37.400
captioned 20 years earlier was shown without
captions.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:44.400
I was told that the technology was not out
there and that I had to be patient and to

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:52.970
wait.
Well, as I said, I like to make noise.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:14:00.560
So I tweeted like crazy to the thousands of
followers that I had on Twitter, and I made

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:07.950
sure that my friends, like Ashton Kutcher
and Alyssa Milano knew what was going on and

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.430
 -- what was going on with closed captions
on the Internet.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:16.750
And I encouraged them to re-Tweet.
And they did.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:23.750
Then I found out there was actually no problem
with the technology, and, in fact, the technology

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:29.230
is out there to stream content with closed
captions.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.520
When it came down to the same issue, a lack

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:39.900
of understanding, it was a lack of understanding,
and a large percentage of manufacturers said

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.870
that -- we said, "You need to provide access
for the millions of users who are Deaf or

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:48.540
hard of hearing.
So by providing closed captions, they can

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.080
get access."
More importantly, they failed to understand

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:58.050
that original programming had captions, but
that the Internet had to have the captions

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.730
as well.
Eventually, the frustration increased so much,

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:08.730
because I had to fight to make -- to do what
I did 20 years ago all over again.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:16.870
The ultimate irony came during the unveiling
of the celebration of Helen Keller's life.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.150
There was a statue being unveiled in the capitol
rotunda.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:27.850
It was streamed live without captions.
Here we're celebrating and honoring a woman

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:33.779
who fought for equality and accessibility
over 100 years ago, and who I looked up to

00:15:33.779 --> 00:15:38.070
as a role model, and I wasn't even able to
share the celebration of her life.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:45.070
It was simply unacceptable, unacceptable.
But you at Google, you changed all that.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:53.730
Just as you did when you pioneered the search
engine, you are helping to ensure the commitment

00:15:53.779 --> 00:15:59.920
and standards and legislation that we work
for in access in broadcast TV are continuing

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:06.310
here with your efforts in getting hundreds
and thousands of videos on YouTube broadcast

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:13.310
with closed captions.
So today, I am proud to premiere the pilot

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:20.740
episode of a show that I produced which I
hope will become a series either on network

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:26.480
or Web, called "My Deaf Family."
And the show chronicles a family from right

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:33.080
here in the San Francisco Bay Area that is
made up of both Deaf and hearing family members.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:40.080
It's told from the perspective of 15-year-old
Jared Firl, who is hearing.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:46.240
Jared's parents are Deaf, and they work nearby
here at the California School for the Deaf

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.190
in Fremont.
And Jared also has three siblings, two of

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:57.270
whom are Deaf and one who is hearing.
I like to think of it as a Deaf version of

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:02.089
'Little People, Big World'.
And I even pitched it to TLC in the hopes

00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:09.089
of creating the first reality show of its
kind ever showing what life is like for millions

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:15.459
of Americans who are Deaf and hard of hearing.
Unfortunately, TLC seemed more interested

00:17:15.459 --> 00:17:20.959
in doing a show about killing moose with Sarah Palin.

00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:22.589
Fine.
That's okay.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:26.189
That's all right.
If TLC won't have me, I figure I'll do it

00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:33.189
my words and using Ms. Palin's words, I'm
going to go rogue and broadcast it on YouTube,

00:17:35.119 --> 00:17:41.960
where I can call the shots and where I can
be guaranteed that the show will be broadcast

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.580
with captions.
Thank you, Google, for making this happen.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:53.580
I also want to say that though I may be Deaf,
silence is the last thing the world will ever

00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:58.369
hear from me.
And that the real handicap of Deafness does

00:17:58.369 --> 00:18:04.499
not lie in the ear; it lies in the mind.
Thank you for your commitment to breaking

00:18:04.499 --> 00:18:10.659
through the barriers and providing access
to YouTube through automatic captioning.

00:18:10.659 --> 00:18:17.249
Through your example, you're helping to open
the minds of those who choose to handicap

00:18:17.249 --> 00:18:22.820
millions of people like myself who are Deaf
or hard of hearing and who don't provide closed

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:29.669
captioning content through broadband.
Your efforts today will guarantee the hard-fought

00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:36.559
victory we won so many years ago can move
forward into the 21st century.

00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:43.559
So without any delay, please enjoy the premiere
of "My Deaf Family" on YouTube.

00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:52.600
But before I say this, hold on, one second.
I want to introduce to you one of the stars

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:58.830
of "My Deaf Family," of this program, Bridgetta
Bourne-Firl is here with us today.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.659
Could you please stand up.
[ Applause ]

00:19:01.659 --> 00:19:08.539
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Thank you for coming out,
taking time out of your busy schedule to be

00:19:08.539 --> 00:19:11.860
with us.
I want to thank the children and the students

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.720
from the California School for the Deaf who
are with us today, who came out today with

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.230
us.
[ Applause ]

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:23.230
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: So just two things.
Enjoy the show, and I'm going to think about

00:19:24.259 --> 00:19:26.259
where to find my glasses so I can read some
more.

00:19:26.259 --> 00:19:28.159
Okay.
Let's go.

00:19:28.159 --> 00:19:32.659
[ Video playing ]

00:19:32.659 --> 00:19:37.330
My name is Jared, I'm 15 and I have a family
of six.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.629
My dad's name is Leslie.
My mom's name is Bridgetta...

00:19:54.139 --> 00:19:57.240
[Video ends]
[ Applause ]

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.330
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: So, there you go.
There you go.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:06.890
This was something that we had been hoping
for a long time.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.690
And now we have the opportunity to put it there on YouTube.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.190
And we hope that millions of people worldwide

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:16.450
will have the chance to see this.
And this makes it even bigger than just the

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:21.960
pilot.
And thank you, Bridgetta.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.289
Thank you, Bridgetta, for letting us come
into your home, for letting us into your home.

00:20:25.289 --> 00:20:32.289
And this was shot just in one and a half days.
That's all we had, just one and a half days

00:20:32.779 --> 00:20:34.239
to shoot.
And, you know, it's almost unheard of in the

00:20:34.239 --> 00:20:38.200
reality programming business to make a pilot
that only covers one and a half days of a

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.539
family's life.
But I'm very proud of it.

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:45.799
And I hope that you all enjoyed it.
And I think that we also might be having some

00:20:45.799 --> 00:20:49.139
 -- do I need to give you the microphone?
Do we have questions and answers?

00:20:49.139 --> 00:20:54.879
&gt;&gt;Susan Wojcicki: I'm going to ask a few questions.
And then I'd really like to open it up to

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:58.820
the audience.
And I'll just start by saying that you're

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.529
such an inspiration and that your story is
fantastic and wonderful.

00:21:02.529 --> 00:21:06.570
And thank you for coming and sharing.
And, again, it really is a commitment of ours

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:11.999
as a company to make information accessible.
So I'm so pleased that you can be here and

00:21:11.999 --> 00:21:14.159
we can share that common goal.
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Thank you.

00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:19.129
&gt;&gt;Susan Wojcicki: So I'll start with, given
that we have people in the company here who

00:21:19.129 --> 00:21:25.690
are probably engineers, probably salespeople,
across the company, and they're all people

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:31.139
who can work on some of the accessibility,
what are some of the things that you would

00:21:31.139 --> 00:21:37.330
like to see us doing on the Internet and how
can we make the captioning even better?

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:42.889
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Well, I mean, first of all,
if you could make all the captions purple

00:21:42.889 --> 00:21:45.119
with the yellow background -- no, I'm just
joking.

00:21:45.119 --> 00:21:48.980
I'm just joking.
Or a different font, perhaps we could go to

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:53.110
Helvetica.
Do you have the ability to change the font?

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.230
Do you?
You can change the font.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.850
I like that.
That answered my question right away.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.139
Listen, you're doing it, you are doing it
already.

00:22:02.139 --> 00:22:04.739
You're doing it all.
I applaud you all for what you've done so

00:22:04.739 --> 00:22:05.749
far.
I don't think there's any -- I don't know

00:22:05.749 --> 00:22:11.409
what more I could ask for.
I know that you can't do it immediately perfectly

00:22:11.409 --> 00:22:16.419
in terms of automatic captioning so that the
voice recognition works, you know, 100%.

00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:19.029
&amp; there might be some confusion.
It takes time.

00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:20.679
It certainly takes time.
But you're putting it out there.

00:22:20.679 --> 00:22:24.580
And there's room to make it perfect.
I'll be patient.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.360
&gt;&gt;Susan Wojcicki: Great.
We'll definitely be working on it.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:33.039
I looked at some last night, and like, I noticed
sometimes when people put them on manually,

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:38.440
you can't always tell who is speaking.
For example, that, like, I watched your interview

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.929
on Larry King, and I didn't know when it was
 -- like, if I didn't hear it, I wouldn't

00:22:42.929 --> 00:22:47.480
have been always possible to know when you
were speaking versus your -- Larry King or

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.690
the interviewer was speaking.
I thought that would be one example is that

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:55.700
we always have connotation of who is the speaker,
for example.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:02.700
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: You know, listen, when captions
first came out on television, it was, like,

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.820
three's company was the first show that had
captions.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:10.080
I was just fascinated with the fact that there
were words on screen.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.139
It was a dream we had.
It would be great to think of having words

00:23:13.139 --> 00:23:14.989
back then.
Now it's a reality.

00:23:14.989 --> 00:23:21.360
When they first came out, it took a little
bit of getting used to and adjustment to know

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:27.570
who was talking and to be able to understand.
But then, eventually, they made adjustments

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.820
so that they had one person speaking on one
side of the screen and one person on the other

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.179
side with the captions.
It's just a matter of time.

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:39.419
It's -- I wouldn't like it if they put two
different colors on there, as they do in some

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:41.559
countries with captions.
I think it's too confusing.

00:23:41.559 --> 00:23:46.489
I think that's too confusing.
I personally don't care for that kind of captioning.

00:23:46.489 --> 00:23:47.470
So....
&gt;&gt;Susan Wojcicki: Okay.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:50.739
Great.
So I'll ask one more question, then I'd love

00:23:50.739 --> 00:23:55.879
to hear from the audience here.
But what kind of -- is there any legislation

00:23:55.879 --> 00:24:01.359
or any ways that we could work with policy,
meaning Google, the company?

00:24:01.359 --> 00:24:03.379
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Well, there's a law called
HR-3101.

00:24:03.379 --> 00:24:09.049
I didn't mean to interrupt.
But -- she knows.

00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:13.350
So HR-3101 is on the Hill.
We want to get it passed so it would allow

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.809
for that accessibility on the Internet as
we were talking about today.

00:24:15.809 --> 00:24:19.080
It's just not been passed yet.
&gt;&gt;Susan Wojcicki: Can you say a little bit

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.159
about what it is, just so everyone here knows.
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Well, Jack can do that better

00:24:23.159 --> 00:24:27.509
than I can.
&gt;&gt;Jack Jason: It's basically --

00:24:27.509 --> 00:24:31.019
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Talk --
&gt;&gt;Jack Jason: Yes, as Marlee said, back in

00:24:31.019 --> 00:24:36.759
1990 and then again in 1994, legislation was
passed that required broadcasters to closed

00:24:36.759 --> 00:24:40.879
caption, because they wouldn't do it themselves.
Now, with everything moving to the Internet,

00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:45.049
it seems the information that's there captioned
isn't moving with captions.

00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:51.730
They're still not captioning it.
HR-3101 is intended to force Internet providers

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:58.149
to caption what's already been captioned.
So it's applying that law to the Internet.

00:24:58.149 --> 00:25:01.609
There's a lot of complaints.
Well, a lot of it is user-generated.

00:25:01.609 --> 00:25:04.230
We can't caption that.
How are you going to force us to do that?

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:08.889
I mean, a lot of stuff on YouTube is made
by people who go to YouTube.

00:25:08.889 --> 00:25:11.399
Well, you guys solved that problem with automatic
captions.

00:25:11.399 --> 00:25:15.489
Now it's time for the other people to do that.
So that's what HR-3101 is intended to do.

00:25:15.489 --> 00:25:19.019
We're waiting for the vote, or at least to
be even brought up.

00:25:19.019 --> 00:25:23.889
I'm not familiar with the legislative process.
But we're waiting for sponsors.

00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:27.450
And the health care bill took up a lot of
attention.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:31.979
And everybody was focused on that.
So now, hopefully, we can move to this and

00:25:31.979 --> 00:25:34.190
 --
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: I've been working very closely

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:40.730
with the National Association of the Deaf.
And hoping that their efforts -- I mean, in

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.809
their terms, I'm their spokesperson when it
comes to closed captioning.

00:25:43.809 --> 00:25:47.429
And, hopefully, we can work together to make
sure that this legislation passes.

00:25:47.429 --> 00:25:50.580
&gt;&gt;Susan Wojcicki: Great.
Well, what questions do people -- want to

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:55.429
come to the audience -- come to the -- I'll
hand the mike over.

00:25:55.429 --> 00:26:00.049
&gt;&gt;&gt;A special question for you.
My colleague is actually blind.

00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:05.460
And we've just watched your reality TV.
And there were certain points where the text

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:09.940
appeared, but there was no audio.
So she couldn't actually hear what was going

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.460
on.
So it would be really cool if you could find

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.999
a way to make that happen.
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Well, I understand.

00:26:13.999 --> 00:26:18.389
And I believe that they're working on that
audio description technology for people who

00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:23.080
have low vision or who are visually impaired.
People who can hear.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:28.009
There certainly needs to have some sort of
description, audio description on screen.

00:26:28.009 --> 00:26:33.059
I believe that they're working on that here.
And I'll bring up Naomi to explain that.

00:26:33.059 --> 00:26:37.529
&gt;&gt;Naomi Bilodeau: This is the perfect opportunity
for me to put in a plug for the access eng

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:40.359
team.
We have head count in our team.

00:26:40.359 --> 00:26:43.749
And if you would like to come and help us
work on these problems, we have a list of

00:26:43.749 --> 00:26:46.440
interesting problems we're working on right
now.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.840
There are ways of doing audio description
in YouTube right now.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.049
You do it by mixing in the audio.
It's called open audio.

00:26:52.049 --> 00:26:57.340
And if anybody is curious, I can send out
an e-mail maybe through the authors team list

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.710
that include some links to videos that have
that.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:03.570
So I'm going to hand this back to somebody
before I babble too much.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:07.269
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Absolutely, Naomi.
It's important.

00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:09.549
&gt;&gt;Susan Wojcicki: Great.
Other questions?

00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:13.940
Sure.
You guys can also stand up at the mike there.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.330
&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi.
A couple of comments and a question.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:24.049
First, for making the captioning technologies
at Google become a possibility, we -- there

00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:29.470
is one person I would like to recognize.
That's my good friend Ken Harrenstien, sitting

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:30.679
right there.
And --

00:27:30.679 --> 00:27:33.689
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: I was planning to do that.
Yes, Ken Harrenstien.

00:27:33.689 --> 00:27:39.279
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah, he has been pushing tirelessly for

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:44.419
this to happen in the past few years.
And he happened to be my first office mate

00:27:44.419 --> 00:27:47.489
when he joined Google seven years and two
weeks ago.

00:27:47.489 --> 00:27:51.019
And my other office mate was Greg Badros,
who was hard of hearing.

00:27:51.019 --> 00:27:55.570
And I was designing servers.
And I had these big, loud machines in my room,

00:27:55.570 --> 00:28:01.979
and I had the perfect roommates.
They never minded.

00:28:01.979 --> 00:28:08.979
So -- and the question is, I'm an engineer,
so I was curious, like, when we -- hearing

00:28:11.129 --> 00:28:16.059
people in a room want to attract attention,
we usually, like, use a glass or something

00:28:16.059 --> 00:28:20.399
to make a noise so everybody -- attract everyone's
attention.

00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:27.399
I wonder if, for people who don't hear, how
do you do that?

00:28:28.239 --> 00:28:29.039
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: (Stamping foot).
&gt;&gt;&gt;Really?

00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:32.539
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: No, we flash the lights.
We just flick the lights off and on or we

00:28:32.539 --> 00:28:34.850
wave.
But that's -- 'cause that's very visible.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.979
I can see it, because my peripheral vision
is very good.

00:28:37.979 --> 00:28:42.830
My eyes are the means of which I depend on
to use, just as you depend on your ears to

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:45.549
hear and you can hear anything.
I'm very visual.

00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:50.409
If you do this (indicating) or this (indicating),
like, when there's paparazzi, a good example,

00:28:50.409 --> 00:28:53.539
when I go to paparazzi.
At first when I came into the business, they

00:28:53.539 --> 00:28:57.950
would call my name, Marlee, Marlee.
And I would stand there like, what -- Whoopi

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.999
Goldberg said, "She's Deaf.
You can't yell at a Deaf woman."

00:29:00.999 --> 00:29:06.309
And then, of course, they'd do this, they'd
just make -- do pretend sign language, and

00:29:06.309 --> 00:29:07.720
then I would look, and then they'd take my
picture.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:11.289
And then some more pretend sign language,
and I'd look, and they'd take my picture.

00:29:11.289 --> 00:29:13.419
They've learned this.
They still do this to this day.

00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:15.820
It works.
It works for me.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.629
For you to get the attention of someone who
is Deaf, who can't hear, you just do this

00:29:19.629 --> 00:29:25.669
or tap their shoulder or -- I mean, anything
that involves hands movement or flashing the

00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:28.309
lights, that usually works.
Or throw something.

00:29:28.309 --> 00:29:28.850
&gt;&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:32.230
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: You know, spit ball that
way.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:37.330
&gt;&gt;&gt;Then one suggestion, and this is more
for Ken, actually.

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:42.720
You talk about like, when you have captions,
you -- sometimes you can can't really tell

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:48.259
which one on screen is talking.
Since we have this automatic captioning technology

00:29:48.259 --> 00:29:54.809
mostly related to voice recognition, we can
probably also recognize the tone in the voice,

00:29:54.809 --> 00:30:01.809
like the pitch in the voice to tell whether
it's male or female or other traits of the

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.669
actors.
Then, as you said earlier, we can font --

00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:08.269
 we can put different fonts.
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: I'd be really curious to

00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:11.450
see that.
&gt;&gt;So we can use a softer font when it's

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:17.830
a softer voice and use a square font when
it's a strong voice, for example.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:21.340
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Hmm.
Go for it.

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:26.239
What are you waiting for?
Thank you.

00:30:26.239 --> 00:30:33.239
Thank you for your comments.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I am a father of five-year-old blind son.

00:30:35.419 --> 00:30:42.419
So if you were actually back to five years
old, what do you want to ask your parents,

00:30:43.499 --> 00:30:50.499
what do you want from them mostly?
Or -- sorry, English is my second language.

00:30:52.489 --> 00:30:57.919
So --
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Mine, too.

00:30:57.919 --> 00:31:01.799
I mean, I think if I were in your child's
shoes, --

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:03.489
&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes.
Five years old.

00:31:03.489 --> 00:31:06.809
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: -- five years old.
&gt;&gt;&gt;If you were.

00:31:06.809 --> 00:31:10.159
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: What I would want from my
parents?

00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:15.289
&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes.
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: I would say or ask for that

00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:22.289
you take good care of me, that you don't deny
me anything, and that you let me be who I

00:31:23.299 --> 00:31:27.330
am.
Don't try to restrain me from any experiences

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:31.830
in life.
Let me go out there, explore the world.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:38.569
Let me feel, let me touch, let me meet.
Treat me as if I could see.

00:31:38.569 --> 00:31:40.889
&gt;&gt;&gt;Okay.
Thank you.

00:31:40.889 --> 00:31:44.830
Actually, captions are very helpful for me
to understand English.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.919
So I'm --
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: See.

00:31:46.919 --> 00:31:49.269
There you go.
Thank you very much for your comment.

00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:52.279
Thank you.
[ Applause ]

00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:57.009
&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi.
Thank you very much for coming here.

00:31:57.009 --> 00:32:01.789
One of the things I find challenging about
using video and audio content is how long

00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:06.299
it takes to get the information from it compared
with reading written content.

00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:11.419
And I was wondering whether there's anything
that you've been thinking about or working

00:32:11.419 --> 00:32:17.229
for to enable basically the faster playing
of captions or faster getting of information

00:32:17.229 --> 00:32:22.779
from video content and audio content.
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: I'm going to give your question

00:32:22.779 --> 00:32:25.579
to Ken, because he's more adept at answering
that question, perhaps.

00:32:25.579 --> 00:32:32.579
&gt;&gt;&gt;He said the answer's "yes."
&gt;&gt;Ken Harrenstien: The answer is yes.

00:32:34.129 --> 00:32:40.599
We are working on it.
We've got that going now for businesses, Google

00:32:40.599 --> 00:32:45.659
Video for business.
Do you want to explain some, Naomi?

00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:49.729
&gt;&gt;Naomi Bilodeau: So if you guys look at our
internal videos on Google Video for business,

00:32:49.729 --> 00:32:52.769
you can see there's a slider that has a rabbit
and a turtle.

00:32:52.769 --> 00:32:55.340
If you slide it up to the rabbit end, it goes
faster.

00:32:55.340 --> 00:33:00.700
And this was worked on by Daniel Steinberg.
It's pretty amazing.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:05.049
If you speed it up audio normally, the pitch
would be really high and sound like the lecture

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:08.609
was being given by chipmunks.
We changed the pitch so it sounds kind of

00:33:08.609 --> 00:33:11.729
normal.
I turn that off, because it annoys me even

00:33:11.729 --> 00:33:13.609
though we changed the pitch.
I just watch the captions.

00:33:13.609 --> 00:33:17.330
If you look at our internal videos from, like,
our all hands meetings, you can see those

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.279
with captions and you can watch them at two
and a half times the speed.

00:33:20.279 --> 00:33:24.470
This isn't just an internal Google thing.
Anybody who has Google Apps has access to

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:28.470
this technology if they turn it on.
&gt;&gt;Susan Wojcicki: Have a question here.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:33.570
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: This is so out of my world.
I'm so amazed.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:34.840
But I'm learning.
I'm learning.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:41.619
&gt;&gt;Susan Wojcicki: We have one comment here.
It's of (inaudible) who wanted to comment

00:33:41.619 --> 00:33:47.429
on the previous question of the parent who
has the blind son.

00:33:47.429 --> 00:33:54.429
&gt;&gt;&gt;Just to give a background, I'm blind myself.
I mean, just to add to that, one thing I would

00:33:55.179 --> 00:34:00.049
definitely like to tell you is, don't treat
your kid any different.

00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:07.049
Trust me, if you let him or her go, they will
reach the extremes that will surprise you.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.300
Don't treat them any, any, any different at
all.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:16.300
Because as I see, a disability is -- every
human being has a limitation.

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:22.780
A blind person just has a limitation of not
being able to see.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:27.380
But, trust me, they can use their other senses
to reach the sky.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:32.580
So just let them go.
Let them achieve anything and everything that

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.780
they want.
That is going to be the most, most important

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:39.500
thing for them in their life.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Thank you.

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.020
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Thank you.
[ Applause ]

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.780
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Just following up to your
comment.

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.060
Thank you very much for your comment, by the
way.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:51.610
Just as you said, you know, all a blind person
can't do is to see, and all a Deaf person

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:56.620
can't do is to hear.
Otherwise, it's all available.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:01.360
I need to ask one question before you do.
Well, no, go ahead with your question first.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:04.120
Go ahead.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually, I have a question, just from

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.310
a Deaf person's perspective who's here working
at Google.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:14.240
You know, I've been here -- starting as a
young person and even now, I've seen many

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:19.160
challenges and seen how things have changed
over the years with captions on YouTube now.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.520
And with your presentation today, I'm wondering
if you want to see more captions for Deaf people.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:30.350
Like, in the future, in ten or so years from

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:34.300
now, what is it that you're looking for and
ways that we can help Deaf people more?

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:38.910
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: I get this question every
day, because, as an actor -- in reality, and

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:43.590
I speak on behalf of all actors -- only 3%
of actors work.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:47.740
You know, people who are in the actor's union,
only 3% of us work.

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:52.080
It's hard to find jobs, regardless of whether
one is Deaf or hearing.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:57.040
But if you're talking specifically about Deaf
actors, I think it's probably harder.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.730
I still struggle myself.
Believe it or not, I still struggle.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:06.500
As I stand here today, I had to put up my
video in order to sell it, in order to get

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.650
people to pay attention to it to see how it
would go.

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:13.620
A lot of Deaf children come up to me and say,
"I want to be an actor like you.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.460
How is it that I can do it like did you it?
Or how is it?"

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:20.100
And I say, look, first of all, you need to
finish school.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:25.340
If you want to go to college, go to college.
It will certainly do you well in terms of

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:30.290
your future.
And then see what it leads you to, whatever

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:37.290
you want to be.
I'm not the president of the Deaf world.

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:44.370
I'm just an actor who just wants to do movies.
And I'm a person who also happens to advocate

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:49.990
on behalf of a number of charities, charities
that I believe in, charities that I believe

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:54.900
need assistance or attention.
And I struggle.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.680
Sometimes I succeed and sometimes I fail.
But, you know, what, I get back up on my feet

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.560
again and I try.
And I do what I can to find work.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:06.660
And it's just a matter -- there are wonderful
Deaf theaters out there, for example, in Los

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:11.230
Angeles, as well as the National Theater of
the Deaf. Wherever you are in the country,

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:14.260
there are places Deaf people can go to school, colleges.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:19.590
There are so many choices out there.
As much as I would love to be able to own

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:24.670
a studio like Warner Brothers so everything
is captioned and everybody can have access,

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:25.530
it doesn't work that way.

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:32.030
It doesn't work that way.
By the way, my name sign is this (indicating). 

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:33.530
There you go.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:35.130
All right.
Well, I guess that's it.

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:41.950
&gt;&gt;Susan Wojcicki: How about last comment.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah, just one story that I remember hearing

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:48.220
when I was younger was, I went to go hear
Vint Cerf, who is one of the founders of the

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:54.000
Internet protocol that we all use today, TCP,
at George Mason University.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.390
He spoke about his wife who was Deaf, but
she got a cochlear implant, and the invention

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:04.320
of the cochlear implant they learned about
on the Internet while they were browsing around

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.660
on mosaic Web browser, which is also very
old.

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:16.340
But -- and this is just an amazing thing to
me to see just the way that these technologies

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:19.510
impact our lives.
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: It's amazing.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:20.550
Thank you.
Thank you for your story.

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:26.790
See how technology has changed people's lives,
and people are more accepting of others who

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:30.020
are different and working together and making
things happen.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:37.020
It's amazing.
&gt;&gt;Susan Wojcicki: Do you want to -- last comment?

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:45.160
&gt;&gt;&gt;Thank you.
That was very inspiring.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.700
Just -- I've always loved traveling and sharing
cultures.

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:53.880
I thought there was a wonderful opportunity
to share some cultural learnings here.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:59.100
So I learned from a friend a long time ago
that signing applause is this (indicating),

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:03.070
so I thought it might be -- for other people
in the room who didn't know, I thought it

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:07.630
might be interesting for us to share the applause.
&gt;&gt;Susan Wojcicki: Can everyone -- can everyone

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.400
say thank you?
[ Applause ]

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:14.800
&gt;&gt;Susan Wojcicki: And I'd like to say thank
you to Marlee for coming, and I'd like to

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:19.630
say thank you for the teams at Google that
work on accessibility and for leading that

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:22.910
and for making this happen.
It shows what a big impact you can have and

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:27.740
how you can use technology to make people
who you never meet, people across the world,

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.800
make their lives better.
So thank you.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:35.020
Thank you for making this all happen.
&gt;&gt;Marlee Matlin: Thank you, Google, for making

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:38.800
me find my recipes -- looking for recipes
so much easier.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.700
