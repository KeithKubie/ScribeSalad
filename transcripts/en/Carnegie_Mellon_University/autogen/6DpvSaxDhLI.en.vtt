infrastructure and replicate a model

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:12.570

impossible to replicate that model and

in our international activities maybe he
 

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.710

applicability we see that the
 

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.410
applicability we see that the
interdisciplinary nature of the

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:21.420
interdisciplinary nature of the
 

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.730

those 150 territories around the globe
 

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.070
those 150 territories around the globe
and are 150,000 people and try to figure

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080
and are 150,000 people and try to figure
 

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.870
and are 150,000 people and try to figure
out what are some common denominators

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880
out what are some common denominators
 

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.690
out what are some common denominators
that we can talk about there's one so

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:51.700
that we can talk about there's one so
 

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.950
that we can talk about there's one so
far that we've come up with and that's

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960
far that we've come up with and that's
 

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.740
far that we've come up with and that's
education because there's not one leader

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:55.750
education because there's not one leader

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:58.450
in any of our network of firms that are
 

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.659
in any of our network of firms that are
out there that don't see where they are

00:18:00.659 --> 00:18:00.669
out there that don't see where they are

anywhere in the globe education being a

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280
anywhere in the globe education being a

key issue to the success of their local

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:06.520
key issue to the success of their local
 

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.580
key issue to the success of their local
marketplace as well as the success of

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:08.590
marketplace as well as the success of
 

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.590
marketplace as well as the success of
the global marketplace and I think it's

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:10.600
the global marketplace and I think it's
 

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.330
the global marketplace and I think it's
important to look at education very

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:12.340
important to look at education very
 

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.090
important to look at education very
holistically and so it's one thing to go

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:15.100
holistically and so it's one thing to go
 

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.610
holistically and so it's one thing to go
in and to talk specifically about the

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:17.620
in and to talk specifically about the
 

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:20.280
in and to talk specifically about the
training the courses technology the

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:20.290
training the courses technology the
 

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.870
training the courses technology the
different ways to do it but I think we

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:21.880
different ways to do it but I think we
 

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.490
different ways to do it but I think we
also have to realize that there are some

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:23.500
also have to realize that there are some
 

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.100
also have to realize that there are some
things that are standing in the way of

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:25.110
things that are standing in the way of
 

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.840
things that are standing in the way of

issues just getting children to school
 

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:35.430
issues just getting children to school
and I and I think part of the things

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440
and I and I think part of the things
 

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.960
and I and I think part of the things
that we really wrestle with and we're

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:36.970
that we really wrestle with and we're
 

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.700
that we really wrestle with and we're
seeing it in the US and and it's

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:38.710
seeing it in the US and and it's
 

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.620
seeing it in the US and and it's
something we have to help people manage

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:40.630
something we have to help people manage
 

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.680
something we have to help people manage

activities and those are all great but
 

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:06.659
activities and those are all great but
there's not as much learning and we've

00:19:06.659 --> 00:19:06.669
there's not as much learning and we've
 

00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:09.960
there's not as much learning and we've
said compared to other China and India

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:09.970
said compared to other China and India
 

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.210
said compared to other China and India
and other places we do some things

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:12.220
and other places we do some things
 

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.280
and other places we do some things
really well but we're not spending the

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:14.290
really well but we're not spending the
 

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.250
really well but we're not spending the
time teaching especially in K through 12

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:17.260
time teaching especially in K through 12
 

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.980

as is happening in other places and so

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:19.990
as is happening in other places and so
 

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.720
as is happening in other places and so
that's really become something that we

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:21.730
that's really become something that we
 

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.450
that's really become something that we
can talk about globally around PwC

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:24.460

what's happening in the US as the US
 

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.650
what's happening in the US as the US
certainly takes the lead on some things

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:28.660
certainly takes the lead on some things
 

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.840
certainly takes the lead on some things
but what can we learn and then how can

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:30.850
but what can we learn and then how can
 

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:31.790
but what can we learn and then how can
we use

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:31.800
we use
 

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.490
we use
the size and in our leverage to then

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500
the size and in our leverage to then
 

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.750
the size and in our leverage to then
talk to school districts around the

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760
talk to school districts around the

talk to school districts around the
country to figure out how we can do it

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:37.050
country to figure out how we can do it
 

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.660
country to figure out how we can do it
different here but I think there's a lot

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:38.670
different here but I think there's a lot
 

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.540
different here but I think there's a lot
of other barriers to education and you

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:41.550
of other barriers to education and you
 

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.100
of other barriers to education and you
really have to start at that most

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:43.110
really have to start at that most
 

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:46.160
really have to start at that most
fundamental young level because that's

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:46.170
fundamental young level because that's
 

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:47.450
fundamental young level because that's
what's going to set the stage for the

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:47.460
what's going to set the stage for the
 

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.370
what's going to set the stage for the
future and that's really what's going to

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.380
future and that's really what's going to
 

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.280
future and that's really what's going to
be what we need to change so years from

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:52.290
be what we need to change so years from
 

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.750
be what we need to change so years from
now we're not looking back and saying

that's going to be because you hired

00:19:58.790 --> 00:19:58.800
that's going to be because you hired
 

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.760
that's going to be because you hired
somebody fifteen years ago and they're

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:01.770
somebody fifteen years ago and they're
 

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.200

Jerry talked about Ed's and meds and it
 

00:24:17.779 --> 00:24:20.230
Jerry talked about Ed's and meds and it
was a very positive spin on it and we

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240
was a very positive spin on it and we
 

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.090
was a very positive spin on it and we
put a slightly negative spin on Ed's and

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:22.100
put a slightly negative spin on Ed's and
 

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.379

will be more than half our GDP which

00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:27.409
will be more than half our GDP which
 

00:24:27.409 --> 00:24:29.440
will be more than half our GDP which
doesn't make sense right so the cost of

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:29.450
doesn't make sense right so the cost of
 

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.740
doesn't make sense right so the cost of
these things is going up really fast

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:31.750
these things is going up really fast
 

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.149
these things is going up really fast

me that the program that Jerry laid out
 

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.230
me that the program that Jerry laid out
and maybe we should know more about this

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:41.240
and maybe we should know more about this
 

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.779
and maybe we should know more about this
the only program which allows for

00:24:43.779 --> 00:24:43.789
the only program which allows for
 

00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:46.200
the only program which allows for
customized education at reasonably

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:54.220
 

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.639
yes we're betting on that and it's why

there's a really interesting question I
I think this is relevant to this

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:06.200
I think this is relevant to this

to happen how do you go from the Dozen

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:26.870
to happen how do you go from the Dozen
 

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.629
to happen how do you go from the Dozen
courses to the say thousand that we need

00:25:31.629 --> 00:25:31.639
courses to the say thousand that we need
 

00:25:31.639 --> 00:25:34.029

when you consider that each of those

00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039
when you consider that each of those
 

00:25:34.039 --> 00:25:35.860

courses is cost like a million dollars

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:35.870
courses is cost like a million dollars
 

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:38.080

to put the other and let's suppose we

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:38.090
to put the other and let's suppose we
 

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.129
to put the other and let's suppose we
can get the cost down to one hundred

00:25:39.129 --> 00:25:39.139
can get the cost down to one hundred
 

00:25:39.139 --> 00:25:41.740
can get the cost down to one hundred
thousand dollars still a huge amount of

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:41.750
thousand dollars still a huge amount of
 

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.139
thousand dollars still a huge amount of
money and so how do you get from the

00:25:44.139 --> 00:25:44.149
money and so how do you get from the
 

00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:47.529
money and so how do you get from the
pilot stage to a scaled-up stage and you

00:25:47.529 --> 00:25:47.539
pilot stage to a scaled-up stage and you
 

00:25:47.539 --> 00:25:49.629
pilot stage to a scaled-up stage and you
know every one of us in this audience

don't know what the business model is
and you can't ignore it and I think that

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:41.530
and you can't ignore it and I think that
 

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:42.810

that's really critical we're working

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:42.820
that's really critical we're working
 

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:46.200
that's really critical we're working
with several universities because one of

than just an accounting background and
 

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.430
than just an accounting background and
so how does ethics fit into that

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:02.440
so how does ethics fit into that
 

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.830
so how does ethics fit into that
equation how does sustainability fit

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:04.840
equation how does sustainability fit
 

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.090
equation how does sustainability fit
into that equation how does

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:06.100

globalization fit into that equation not

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080
globalization fit into that equation not
 

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.560
globalization fit into that equation not
just accounting courses and so we've

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:10.570
just accounting courses and so we've
 

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.810
just accounting courses and so we've
come in and helped universities to

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:12.820
come in and helped universities to
 

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.549
come in and helped universities to
develop courses around corporate

00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559
develop courses around corporate
 

00:27:14.559 --> 00:27:16.620
develop courses around corporate
responsibility in a more holistic sense

responsibility in a more holistic sense
 

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:18.659
responsibility in a more holistic sense
because that's the kind of thinking that

00:27:18.659 --> 00:27:18.669
because that's the kind of thinking that
 

00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:21.000
because that's the kind of thinking that
we now need as most of our people come

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.010
we now need as most of our people come
 

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:22.470
we now need as most of our people come
in and they're working on multinational

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480
in and they're working on multinational
 

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.530
in and they're working on multinational
clients and so that's a way to build

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:25.540
clients and so that's a way to build
 

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.810
clients and so that's a way to build
these partnerships which is critical

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:27.820
these partnerships which is critical
 

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.669
these partnerships which is critical
because there's not one group that's

00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679
because there's not one group that's
 

00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:31.560
because there's not one group that's
going to solve these issues and so we

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:31.570
going to solve these issues and so we
 

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:32.880
going to solve these issues and so we
have to find ways that we can work

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:32.890
have to find ways that we can work
 

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:34.830
have to find ways that we can work
together with nonprofits and companies

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:34.840

and governments to really make a dent in
this because it's too costly and nobody

this because it's too costly and nobody
 

00:27:40.059 --> 00:27:41.370

really have the resources to do it on
 

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:45.930
really have the resources to do it on
their own you mentioned cost as a great

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:45.940

I me not in real time so there is a way

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720
I me not in real time so there is a way
 

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.499
I me not in real time so there is a way
to do credentialing from a distance but

00:37:18.499 --> 00:37:18.509
to do credentialing from a distance but
 

00:37:18.509 --> 00:37:21.710
to do credentialing from a distance but
it requires I think institutions that

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720
it requires I think institutions that
 

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.299
it requires I think institutions that
will do the credentialing to think about

00:37:23.299 --> 00:37:23.309
will do the credentialing to think about
 

00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:25.759
will do the credentialing to think about
this in a very different way from the

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:40.460
authentication is that for example by
test with text messages there by nature

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:40.470
test with text messages there by nature
 

00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:42.950
test with text messages there by nature
asynchronous and so you don't you lose

kind of the assessment feature that you
 

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:46.340
kind of the assessment feature that you
get with the open courseware it can

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:46.350
get with the open courseware it can
 

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:47.870
get with the open courseware it can
actually analyze how students are

actually analyze how students are
performing and my other question is is

00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:49.590
performing and my other question is is
 

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:50.630
performing and my other question is is
whenever you're doing this and you're

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640
whenever you're doing this and you're
 

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.310
whenever you're doing this and you're
handing out credentials with it how do

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:52.320
handing out credentials with it how do
 

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.630
handing out credentials with it how do
you authenticate the person on the other

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:01.050
who's performing the work we take the
 

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:03.640
who's performing the work we take the
final question from there and then we

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:03.650
final question from there and then we
 

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:14.200
final question from there and then we
come back to the pow that's

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:14.210
 

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:17.720

political science tool and and and
 

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:03.950
political science tool and and and
because I was very concerned about you

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:03.960

know the political situation in the
 

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:07.850
know the political situation in the
country and they can say that we have

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:07.860
country and they can say that we have
 

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.100
country and they can say that we have
made you know a lot of progress in terms

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:10.110
made you know a lot of progress in terms
 

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:13.870
made you know a lot of progress in terms
of political reforms in the country but

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:13.880
 

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:17.480
there are still some problems that are

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:17.490
there are still some problems that are
 

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:21.920
there are still some problems that are
you know structural that our / ears for

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:21.930
you know structural that our / ears for
 

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:23.570

my country's economic development and
and so we need to differentiate between

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160
and so we need to differentiate between
 

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.350
and so we need to differentiate between
developing countries and developing

00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:30.360
developing countries and developing
 

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:34.130
developing countries and developing
countries so so you can have developing

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140
countries so so you can have developing
 

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:37.930
countries so so you can have developing
countries like China or India or Brazil

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:37.940
countries like China or India or Brazil
 

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:41.150
countries like China or India or Brazil
who have mail or progress and in

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160
who have mail or progress and in

industrialization and economic
 

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:45.110
industrialization and economic
development but there are also countries

development but there are also countries
 

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:49.130
development but there are also countries
like mine honduras nicaragua south south

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:49.140
like mine honduras nicaragua south south
 

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:53.180

don't have the leverage to all the

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160
don't have the leverage to all the

attractiveness to get foreign investment
 

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:04.040
attractiveness to get foreign investment
or to get into the the global economy so

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:04.050
or to get into the the global economy so
 

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:07.190
or to get into the the global economy so
my question is you know how the new war

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200
my question is you know how the new war
 

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.290
my question is you know how the new war
economy and the process of globalization

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:09.300
economy and the process of globalization
 

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:13.180
economy and the process of globalization
will help you know this you know little

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:13.190
will help you know this you know little
 

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:17.200
will help you know this you know little
countries that you know like

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:17.210
countries that you know like
 

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:19.370
countries that you know like
industrialization and are mostly you

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:19.380
industrialization and are mostly you
 

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.290
industrialization and are mostly you
know gradient societies and and

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300
know gradient societies and and
 

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:24.180
know gradient societies and and
therefore have been you know left behind

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:24.190
therefore have been you know left behind
 

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:27.240
therefore have been you know left behind
out of the global economic global

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:27.250
out of the global economic global
 

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:33.990
out of the global economic global
economy so actually I can make it quick

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000
economy so actually I can make it quick
 

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.670
economy so actually I can make it quick
I can answer the authentication question

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680
I can answer the authentication question
 

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.260
I can answer the authentication question
the simple answer is yeah it's indeed

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:37.270
the simple answer is yeah it's indeed
 

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:39.870
the simple answer is yeah it's indeed
possible to do that the only slight

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:39.880
possible to do that the only slight
 

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.670
possible to do that the only slight
problem with that is that it raises

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680
problem with that is that it raises
 

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:45.900
problem with that is that it raises
significant issues of privacy and a

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:45.910
significant issues of privacy and a
 

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:48.000
significant issues of privacy and a
whole lot of policy oriented issues or

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:48.010
whole lot of policy oriented issues or
 

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:49.680
whole lot of policy oriented issues or
technically it's not difficult or

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:49.690
technically it's not difficult or
 

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:52.020
technically it's not difficult or
impossible to authenticate but in terms

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:52.030
impossible to authenticate but in terms
 

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:53.490
impossible to authenticate but in terms
of deploying the authentication

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:53.500
of deploying the authentication
 

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:56.550
of deploying the authentication
mechanism using biometrics for example

00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:56.560
mechanism using biometrics for example
 

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.290
mechanism using biometrics for example
there's a whole lot of privacy issues

00:51:58.290 --> 00:51:58.300
there's a whole lot of privacy issues
 

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.240
there's a whole lot of privacy issues
that open up that I think we as a

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:00.250
that open up that I think we as a
 

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:02.460
that open up that I think we as a
society have not given much thought to

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:02.470
society have not given much thought to
 

00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:05.220
society have not given much thought to
or much as much serious thought to right

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:05.230
or much as much serious thought to right
 

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:07.050
or much as much serious thought to right
so that's a quick answer to your

00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:07.060
so that's a quick answer to your
 

00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:08.160
so that's a quick answer to your
question and I just want to make one

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:08.170
question and I just want to make one
 

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:09.839
question and I just want to make one
point the last question here and then

00:52:09.839 --> 00:52:09.849
point the last question here and then
 

00:52:09.849 --> 00:52:13.079
point the last question here and then
I'll shut up I think the way to think

00:52:13.079 --> 00:52:13.089
I'll shut up I think the way to think
 

00:52:13.089 --> 00:52:15.809
I'll shut up I think the way to think
about leverage is not to say oh I'm a

00:52:15.809 --> 00:52:15.819
about leverage is not to say oh I'm a
 

00:52:15.819 --> 00:52:17.370
about leverage is not to say oh I'm a
poor country I don't have leverage I

00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:17.380
poor country I don't have leverage I
 

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:19.260
poor country I don't have leverage I
think think about it is a wave of

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:19.270
think think about it is a wave of
 

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:21.599
think think about it is a wave of
economic expansion that is happening and

00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:21.609
economic expansion that is happening and
 

00:52:21.609 --> 00:52:23.940
economic expansion that is happening and
it is being attracted by forces of

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:23.950
it is being attracted by forces of
 

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:27.270
it is being attracted by forces of
economics which is basically inexpensive

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280
economics which is basically inexpensive
 

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.010
economics which is basically inexpensive
and highly qualified labor to do the

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:29.020
and highly qualified labor to do the
 

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:31.170
and highly qualified labor to do the
same job that is being done at a more

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:31.180
same job that is being done at a more
 

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:33.569
same job that is being done at a more
expensive place right now and my

00:52:33.569 --> 00:52:33.579
expensive place right now and my
 

00:52:33.579 --> 00:52:36.450
expensive place right now and my
instinct or feeling is that education is

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:36.460
instinct or feeling is that education is
 

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:39.720
instinct or feeling is that education is
that force of attraction so if the

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:39.730
that force of attraction so if the
 

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:41.790
that force of attraction so if the
country is able to create a highly

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:41.800
country is able to create a highly
 

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.559
country is able to create a highly
educated workforce or a reasonably

00:52:43.559 --> 00:52:43.569
educated workforce or a reasonably
 

00:52:43.569 --> 00:52:45.540
educated workforce or a reasonably
educated workforce over time you will

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:45.550
educated workforce over time you will
 

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:47.880
educated workforce over time you will
create the basis to attract that wave of

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:47.890
create the basis to attract that wave of
 

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:50.480
create the basis to attract that wave of
economic expansion to your country and
