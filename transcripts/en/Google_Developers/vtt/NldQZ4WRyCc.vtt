BOB MEESE: So, hi.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.850
Thank you.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.340
My name is Bob Meese.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.530
I manage the games
business development

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.699
group for Google Play.

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.240
And I'm going to
present to you today

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.870
on best practices for
success on Google Play.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.460
The guys this morning,
the first section,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.350
they focused mainly on
our newest products,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.500
what we're launching right
now or very recently.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.360
And I'm going to
focus on some things

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.610
that have been around
maybe a little bit longer,

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.140
but that we're
really excited about

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.950
and that we, as
the partner team,

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.144
are encouraging
developers to adopt.

00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:34.560
And so first,
before we start too,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.935
I really want to
thank everybody.

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:37.304
This is a great turnout today.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:39.720
There's a lot of different
ways to spend your time at GDC.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.690
And we're really
grateful for you

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.940
guys to spend it here with us.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.616
So thank you.

00:00:43.616 --> 00:00:44.700
All right.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.360
So heroes has been our theme.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.376
And us, as the partner team,
it's very easy to convince us

00:00:50.376 --> 00:00:51.750
that you guys are
all the heroes.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.760
Our job is working
with all of you,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.870
bringing all of
your great feedback

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.340
into the team at Google Play
and Google more broadly,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.100
and working with
you to adopt all

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.330
of these exciting new products
that are being announced.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.720
As the partner team, I'll focus
on five things here today.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.800
So the first brief section
will be on benchmarking

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.980
and on working with more of you.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.040
Our team has grown over
the past several years.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.800
And so it used to
be the case we were

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.559
working with some developers.

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:23.600
Now, we're working with
more and more developers.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.016
We want to be working with as
many developers as possible.

00:01:26.016 --> 00:01:27.240
And so we'll talk about that.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.781
In terms of the
products, we'll focus

00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:30.000
on store listing experiments.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.280
It has been out since
Google I/O last year,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.110
but has been very successful.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.520
Pre-registration is another
thing that we'll talk about.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.036
Play games services is another.

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:40.660
And then finally,
talking a bit further

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.600
on in the future in terms of new
technologies and new platforms.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.839
So first on benchmarking
and working with all of you.

00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:51.130
So retention benchmarking is
something to keep in mind.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.400
And so this is public data
that was launched last year

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.960
in terms of what the retention
curves for top games look like.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.420
And I bring this up just
because as mobile games,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.549
as the market
evolves and matures,

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.090
many times when you're trying
to get a player into your game,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.119
you're competing with
what that person is

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.410
doing right now, which is
probably playing other games.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.909
And so it's really
important to keep

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.950
in mind what your
metrics need to look

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.230
like to make a
successful long-term game

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.180
and having that discipline
even before you're launching.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.940
And so we're increasingly
working with developers

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.410
to help them have these best
practices, understanding what

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.310
is the state of the art and what
are the best developers doing

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.640
today.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.690
Also, I would
encourage-- so many

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.150
of you we're already
working with.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.180
For any developers that are in
the audience today that are not

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.500
yet working with the
Play Games BD team,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.010
I would definitely encourage
you to check out this link,

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.110
g.co/play/gamesBD.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.880
So it's a quick form.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.540
We review every
single submission

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.820
we get into this form.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.784
And we're trying to manage
more and more developers.

00:02:54.784 --> 00:02:56.200
But we will ask
you for some data.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.699
We can't manage
every single person,

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.860
but we want to manage as
many of you as possible.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.609
So that's the quick intro part.

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.400
Just to get into store
listing experiments,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.524
it's something that we're
very, very excited about.

00:03:06.524 --> 00:03:09.740
It's been a very successful
product for us overall.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.540
And so here was Congregate and
their game Epic Skater here.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.860
We launched this product
at Google I/O last year.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.640
And this is the game
we launched with.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.770
As you can see here,
they initially started

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.890
with that top icon
and then moved

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.960
to the yellow icon
down at the bottom

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.560
on the basis of their use
of Google Play Store listing

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.390
experiments.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.150
If you go to the major
mobile app stores today,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.390
you will find that that
yellow icon is still

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.599
the Epic Skater icon
across all of those stores.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.890
And so the developer is
getting that return on the work

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.360
that they did a year
ago, and it continues

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.776
to pay dividends
for them in terms

00:03:43.776 --> 00:03:46.557
of higher conversion even now.

00:03:46.557 --> 00:03:48.140
Another developer
that we worked with,

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.860
Dots, took a really
analytical and really cool

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.660
approach to breaking down
all of the different elements

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.040
of the Play Store listing page.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.200
And so you can see here
that on the left side

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.500
the icon was the most impactful
change that they made.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.620
It was around 8% lift on
impressions to installs.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.220
You can look though-- this
actually does multiply across.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.380
And so while each individual
element in this case

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.120
was about an 8% in the most
case, across all of it,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.418
you're getting a 30%
plus lift across all

00:04:19.418 --> 00:04:20.459
these different elements.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.850
And so by using this tool,
you can get a big lift.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.575
And then get back to Congregate.

00:04:27.575 --> 00:04:30.540
So on the basis of the
success in Epic Skater,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.210
they decided to move
on to other games,

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.930
including Global
Assault. This chopper

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.830
icon has become
somewhat famous now

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.310
within our team for a 91% lift.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.240
And one thing that I
really want to point out

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.739
that's really
fascinating about this

00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:45.400
is, beyond just the numbers,
when you look at that control

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.930
icon, before using
Play Store Experiments,

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.310
Congregate had actually
tested that control

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.980
icon in another
test, and it had won.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.460
And so the difference was
that, before using Play Store

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.680
Experiments, the only
way for Congregate

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.922
to test this icon was to do
media buys across ad networks.

00:05:02.922 --> 00:05:04.380
But that's a
different environment.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.580
The best way to
test your icon is

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.990
in situ in the context
of the Play Store,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.240
because that's the environment
in which somebody makes

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.550
that install decision, to
see it and decide whether

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.340
or not to install.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.020
And so it's a
really powerful way

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.000
to directly integrate
experiments.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.260
And they'd be testing directly
into the Play Store itself.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.630
And so these are some really
good examples of experiments.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.210
We've shared some
of these before.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.100
One thing we haven't
talked about previously

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.750
though is Monster Strike and
its international expansion.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.370
And so I'm sure many of you are
familiar with Monster Strike.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.640
It's an extremely
popular game in Japan,

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.300
but not been as success
in other markets.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.490
But they used the Google
Play Store Experiments

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.120
to help them expand into
the US market in particular.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.430
And this is probably
my favorite slide

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.060
of the presentation,
where it demonstrates

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.420
that over the course
of a couple months,

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:03.140
Mixi was able to make a 68%
improvement in their conversion

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.900
based on a lot of
different experiments.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.520
And so you can see
here that there

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.070
are dots that are colored
a bunch of different ways.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.486
And they were testing various
elements of their Play Store

00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:12.130
listing page that
I'll go into in more

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.380
detail in the future slides.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.810
But this was a really
successful experiment for them

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.320
that encouraged them
actually to invest further

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.160
into localization for this game.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.300
And so again in
this case, the icon

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.720
did have the
biggest improvement.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.850
We found that
dragons-- cultures have

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.681
different interests in terms of
what a dragon should look like.

00:06:32.681 --> 00:06:34.180
The Japanese dragon
can be different

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.130
from a Western dragon, in this
case, a bit more aggressive,

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.320
making eye contact.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.890
And so changing to
this more Western style

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.450
had a big impact in this game.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.960
Also, here's the
short description.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.150
The short description
was changed as well.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.010
And that also had a big impact.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.400
Remembering back to that slide
on Dots, where they broke down

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.380
the different elements
of conversion,

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.630
while the icon had the biggest
impact in the case of Dots,

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.130
the short description and
that changed optimization

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.390
had the second biggest impact.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.560
And so this can also
make a really big change

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.476
for your games.

00:07:08.476 --> 00:07:10.460
And then third, your screenshot.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.990
So you can see here
really emphasizing

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.050
the ricochet mechanic, which is
the core mechanic of the game,

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.740
through all of
these screenshots,

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.080
and also focusing on
a much cleaner style.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.770
Mixi was really focused
on having a less busy

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.210
graphical style in this game.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.918
And so these screenshots
really bring out

00:07:27.918 --> 00:07:29.790
how it's a more Western
style in this game.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.044
In the screenshots, going
back to that Dots' example,

00:07:33.044 --> 00:07:35.210
Dots had found that it was
the third biggest impact.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.230
And so getting a sense
of what you're changing

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:38.811
and the relative
impact of this, you

00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:40.810
can find these things out
by using store listing

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.880
experiments.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.130
Finally, for the
Play Store elements,

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.460
changing the video as well
too, its another element.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.710
The Play Store has emphasized
video for a long time.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.920
You could see from Morgan's
talk that we're adding

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.370
playable units as well too.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.036
But video is very important
to get higher conversion.

00:07:59.036 --> 00:08:00.660
And then not just
from the Play Store--

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.076
this is another
interesting thing,

00:08:02.076 --> 00:08:03.540
where, based on
the success, Mixi

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.700
continued to evolve their
Play Store listing elements,

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.420
but then also went into deeper
localization in the game

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.270
itself.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.230
And so here you can see the
start screen, which, again,

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.330
emphasizes that ricochet.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.665
It is a much more cleaner style.

00:08:16.665 --> 00:08:19.040
If you're familiar with the
Japanese version of the game,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.630
it's a lot busier and focuses
on many, many characters.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.720
And then finally, in terms
of the start screen here,

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.774
so you have a much
more Western style.

00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:30.190
And they're emphasizing a lot
of the core visual elements.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.830
And so this is a
big success, where

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.610
Mixi, just on the basis of
initially using Play Store

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.350
listing experiments,
has really broadened

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.159
the audience for their game.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.240
If you're like
me-- they actually

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.220
launched a lot of these
changes last month.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.920
Monster Strike is a
great game, but it

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.754
had been kind of hard for me,
as an American, to play it.

00:08:50.754 --> 00:08:52.920
But I've been into it a lot
more over the last month

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.294
now that they made
these changes.

00:08:54.294 --> 00:08:58.520
So I'd encourage you guys
to check it out again.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.330
And this is the last
part of this slide.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.620
But just really saying
that having experiments

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.727
directly built into the
platform was really powerful.

00:09:06.727 --> 00:09:08.310
It's a really key
advantage and allows

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.890
them to have rapid iteration
in terms of the changes

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:11.630
they're making.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.200
And so this is a
really great example

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.450
for the power of this product.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:17.870
Next, going into
pre-registration.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.286
And so this is another product
that we launched originally

00:09:20.286 --> 00:09:23.220
last year that has some
limited availability

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.684
but is showing some really
positive initial steps.

00:09:25.684 --> 00:09:27.350
And when I think about
pre-registration,

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.834
I think about big game launches.

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:30.750
And so one of the trends
in the industry right

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.240
now is towards fewer, bigger.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.582
When you talk to a
lot of developers,

00:09:36.582 --> 00:09:38.540
what feels like the
dominant strategy right now

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.130
is to focus more of your
resources, more of your team's

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.050
energy into a fewer
number of games

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.320
and really emphasizing
on making them the best

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.499
they can possibly be.

00:09:47.499 --> 00:09:49.040
And so not just
focusing on your game

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.980
when it launches,
but definitely,

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.050
as Ben was talking about,
supporting your game

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.444
post-launch for hopefully
long periods of time.

00:09:56.444 --> 00:09:57.860
But what
pre-registration is about

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.950
is supporting these games
even in the pre-launch period.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.060
And so we'll talk
more about that.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.830
Here, on our part
within Google Play,

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.280
we have a significant interest
in keeping the store fresh.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.854
We talk a lot about somebody
comes to the Play Store,

00:10:11.854 --> 00:10:13.770
and they don't want to
see just the same games

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.570
and the same apps
over and over again.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.340
And so when we think about
a developer's interest

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.810
in promoting their game
before it actually launches

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.400
and our strong interest
in having a fresh store,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.500
that's where pre-registration
comes into play.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.592
And when we're choosing
to work with developers,

00:10:30.592 --> 00:10:32.550
it's also important that
this be a partnership.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.250
And so we're helping support
these games before they launch.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.750
But it's very
important here, as you

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:42.090
can see, across promo unit
in Jelly or social support

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.430
in the case of
Clash Royale, we're

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.870
working together with developers
to amplify and magnify

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:48.850
these bigger launches.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.685
We're seeing this trend
towards developers

00:10:50.685 --> 00:10:52.810
focusing more attention
towards these big launches.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.140
And we want to find the best
way to help them do that.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.004
OK.

00:10:58.004 --> 00:10:58.765
Cool.

00:10:58.765 --> 00:11:00.495
All right.

00:11:00.495 --> 00:11:01.910
And so just more
mechanically how

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.680
this works here--
so on the left you

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.430
can see that the
pre-registration button--

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.030
so where you would expect to
see an install button typically

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.645
within the Play Store, that will
be a pre-registration button.

00:11:11.645 --> 00:11:13.020
And then on the
right, you'll see

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.090
that you'll be made aware that
the game will be available,

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.926
and you'll receive a
notification at launch.

00:11:20.926 --> 00:11:23.050
And this is something,
again, that's very powerful.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:24.883
We're looking for a lot
of the features that

00:11:24.883 --> 00:11:27.040
are most powerful when
built into the store.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.700
And so when I talked
about experiments,

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.450
and it's most
powerful whenever you

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.450
can test within the context
of the Play Store-- here,

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.680
one of the benefits that
you get of integrating

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.890
Play pre-registration
is the ability

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.600
to have people become aware of
the game whenever it launches.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.680
And so just to repeat,
pre-registration

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.290
is still not fully
a public product.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.110
We're very cautious
of the user experience

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.510
and making sure that the
games that start into Google

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.100
Play pre-registration, that
there's a really good user

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.110
experience and they
launch shortly afterwards.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.360
But this is something that
we're interested in working

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.330
with more and more
developers in the future.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.550
And this is another great
quote from Glu Mobile,

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.200
talking about the benefit
of pre-registration.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.709
The key thing here is
a clear call to action.

00:12:09.709 --> 00:12:11.125
And so developers
are doing press.

00:12:11.125 --> 00:12:12.160
And they're doing PR.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.240
They're doing marketing
advance of games.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.272
But without a clear call to
action, you get a lot of loss

00:12:17.272 --> 00:12:18.980
in terms of people
hearing about the game

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.850
but not necessarily
installing it at launch.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.450
And so this is a
really helpful tool

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:26.950
to help people convert more of
their marketing into installs.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:27.580
Cool.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.550
Next, talking about
Play Games Services.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.630
And so Play Games Services
is our global games network.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.790
This is being used by a
very, very large population

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.770
of developers and players today.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.500
And as we talked
about earlier, we're

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.080
integrating more and
more developer services

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.210
into Play Games Services.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.600
And then there's other cool
programs, like the Indie

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.070
Corner, that we'd
announced, where

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.327
eligibility for the
Indie Corner requires

00:12:50.327 --> 00:12:52.160
developers to integrate
Play Games Services.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.210
And so you can think
of this game network

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.850
as the underlying
layer, upon which

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.270
we're going to build a lot of
other programs and developer

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.425
tools.

00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:02.050
And just some of the tools that
I'll talk about in this context

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.580
today are the player stats
API, player analytics, and then

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.742
some of our video
recording features.

00:13:07.742 --> 00:13:09.200
Some of these were
covered earlier.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.076
But these are really important
ones, so I want to emphasize.

00:13:12.076 --> 00:13:13.950
Again, talking about
what we, as the BD team,

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.450
are encouraging
developers to adopt,

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.770
these are some of the biggest
priorities that we see.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.470
And so in terms of
the player stats API,

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.890
machine learning has been
a really hot and fun topic

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:24.890
at Google.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:27.181
I don't know if anybody else
has been watching AlphaGo,

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:30.060
but it's been a lot of
fun over the last week.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.220
And there's a lot
of machine learning

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.500
that's happening in
the context of Google

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.960
and this is our
ability to expose

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.340
some of those great
tools to more developers.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.420
And so here, really
focusing on prediction.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.450
Ben had talked a bit about this.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.660
But churn prediction and spend
prediction is really powerful.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.470
And so a lot of the
really cool technology

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.690
that Google is
building and developing

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.990
for generalized
uses in other cases,

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.790
we're applying that to Play Game
Services to the player stats

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.200
API.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.175
And again, so the
Underwater Apps guys

00:14:00.175 --> 00:14:01.550
are becoming a
bit of a favorite.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.400
But this was really
powerful, where just

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:08.110
that ability for developers
of all sizes-- this is quite

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.910
a small developer--
to be doing more

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:14.224
advanced segmentation based
on prediction around spend.

00:14:14.224 --> 00:14:15.890
And Ben had shared
some of these results

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.130
around a 15% increase in the
number of in-app purchase

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:22.210
transactions and a 17%
increase in the amount of ad

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.170
spend for advertising.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.990
And so here, you
get this benefit

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:28.830
just by using Play
Games Services,

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.140
of having Google's machine
learning technology that you

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.181
can apply into your game.

00:14:32.181 --> 00:14:35.085
And we think that
that's really powerful.

00:14:35.085 --> 00:14:37.039
And then also, getting
into player analytics

00:14:37.039 --> 00:14:39.080
reports-- and so I had
mentioned at the beginning

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.420
about retention curves
and how important that is.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.450
I know that retention
can be hard.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.130
There's a lot of different
ways to measure retention.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.820
But player analytics includes
a retention report, which

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.160
is a good default. If
you're unsure how you're

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.170
measuring retention,
we strongly encourage

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.770
you to be using these reports.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.540
And then the sources
and sinks report

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.690
gives you a sense of how much
currency you're generating

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.870
versus how much your
players are consuming.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.390
Again, the Underwater Apps guys
had a lot of success with that.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.440
And one of our hero developers
from last year, Bomb Squad,

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.570
also had a lot of success with
this sources and sinks report.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.880
And so I encourage you to
check both of these out.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.780
Again, as Ben had mentioned,
just with Max Games,

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.800
with this funnel
report on the left,

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.880
it's another more
recent report that we're

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.400
creating for developers that
we think has a lot of value.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.000
And then on the right,
with cohorts as well too.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.490
And so we want to talk with
more and more developers

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.700
about using these reports,
using these services

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.910
and getting your feedback
into what's working for you

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:39.770
guys, what's not.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.600
We know that when you're getting
to running your business--

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.960
Keith has been great, trying
out a lot of our stuff.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.550
And we want to be working with
more and more of all of you,

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.591
both in terms of managing
you, as well as working

00:15:49.591 --> 00:15:53.190
with you on products like this.

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.490
And then finally, in the
Play Games Services part,

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:59.490
video recording is a
big opportunity for us.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.260
Obviously, you see
YouTube here as part

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:06.360
of this, where, by combining
the size and power of Android

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.022
and Google Play, with
distribution through YouTube,

00:16:09.022 --> 00:16:11.480
there's a ton of potential for
this product within a Google

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.500
context.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.480
And so as you can see
here, this is a product

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.080
that we launched last year
initially through the context

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.715
of the Play Games app, where
you can see-- when this resets,

00:16:21.715 --> 00:16:22.920
it will start.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.310
So here's the beginning of
it-- where you press record,

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.070
you go into a game.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.880
And then there, you count down.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.200
And then you're
playing and narrating

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.400
over top of that optionally.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.010
And then you're just editing in
YouTube and then sharing out.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.460
And so it's pretty easy.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.840
By combining Google Play
as well as with YouTube,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.710
you can reach a
very large audience

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.140
by integrating the
video recording

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.790
products that we have.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.139
We started by doing that through
the Google Play Games app.

00:16:51.139 --> 00:16:52.680
And now, we've just
announced that we

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.080
have an API as well
too, where we already

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.570
have a couple developers who
have adopted that, including

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.924
Minecraft Story Mode and
Summer Wars as well too.

00:16:59.924 --> 00:17:01.840
And so you'll start to
see the video recording

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.970
API integrated directly
into more and more games.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:06.520
All right.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.339
So almost done with this par.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:10.239
So new technologies
and platforms.

00:17:10.239 --> 00:17:11.780
After my session
now too, we're going

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.377
to have a bunch of
lightning talks.

00:17:13.377 --> 00:17:13.960
They're great.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.774
I encourage you guys to
stick around for all of them.

00:17:16.774 --> 00:17:18.940
It's a really great format
that we started last year

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.361
and was just really
entertaining to watch for me.

00:17:21.361 --> 00:17:23.069
I'll just touch on
some of these briefly,

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:24.970
but I just wanted to queue
up some of the topics

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:27.136
that we'll be talking about
in some of the lightning

00:17:27.136 --> 00:17:34.200
talks with Vulkan, with Android
TV, and with our VR products.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.720
So quickly on Vulkan-- so
we talked a bit about that.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.600
But as a business
guy myself, it's

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.280
like, why is this relevant?

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.370
You saw the short tornado
piece, which is amazing.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.600
But better performance
in your games

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.820
is obviously really valuable.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.130
We're really focused
on not just all gamers,

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.870
but high end games is
increasingly a focus for us

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:56.370
too.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.320
So we want to make sure
that there's-- Android is

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:58.903
for everybody.

00:17:58.903 --> 00:18:01.422
And so it's going to be massive
reach in terms of casual.

00:18:01.422 --> 00:18:03.630
But we also have people who
are dedicated to focusing

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.500
on high end gaming and
people who are really focused

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.540
on Vulkan in that context.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.580
And then on just
having thinner drivers,

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.550
just having more
maintainability on your side.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.360
So not relying on driver vendors
to update their software,

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.122
but giving more control to the
game developers themselves,

00:18:21.122 --> 00:18:23.080
so that you don't need
to deal with differences

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.990
across the hardware ecosystem.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.710
So there's a lot
of value to Vulkan.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.580
And we're supporting
that in Android

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.770
in a standards-based way.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:34.030
And so we're very
excited about its future.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.822
Next onto Android TV,
where Nathan Camarillo will

00:18:36.822 --> 00:18:38.280
talk about our
living room products

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.236
in general in the
lightning talks.

00:18:41.236 --> 00:18:42.860
So in terms of the
progress we've made,

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:47.210
so great partnerships
with Sony, Sharp, Philips,

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.260
various other service providers.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.230
For us, when we look at
the majority of Android TV

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.460
deployments to date, it's
been more casual gaming

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.280
style, D-Pad games.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.750
And so with Pewdiepie,
Legend of the Brofist here

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.290
and then Disney
DuckTales, here's

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.600
some examples of some
of the earlier games

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.427
that have come to
the Android TV.

00:19:06.427 --> 00:19:08.010
And so I encourage
you to stick around

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:12.200
for Nathan's lightning talk
on this topic later on today.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.516
And then this is an example
too of the high end.

00:19:15.516 --> 00:19:17.390
And so Borderlands the
pre-sequel is actually

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.680
coming at the high end.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.720
So it's one of the great
things about Android

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.260
of having that diversity of
these very casual franchises,

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.830
but also these core games, these
high end games as well too.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.590
And so we're able
to stretch to reach

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.920
both of those in the
context of our living room

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.460
products and Android TV.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.330
Then finally, just
a quick shout out.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.940
We've got a lot of smart people
within Google working on VR,

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.560
and Nathan Martz is one of them.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.670
And he's going to
give a quick lightning

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:46.980
talk on our VR efforts later on
in the lightning talk session.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.170
And so that's it for my section.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.080
I just really enjoyed
sharing all of this with you.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.424
We really enjoy GDC,
where it's an opportunity

00:19:54.424 --> 00:19:56.530
to reconnect with a
lot of familiar faces,

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:57.970
but also meet a bunch of people.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.910
So all of the people
who were around earlier

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:01.052
will stick around.

00:20:01.052 --> 00:20:03.260
Thank you for spending the
time with us this morning,

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.870
and I encourage you to stay
for the lighting talks as well.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:06.370
Thank you.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.420
