00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
The only thing worse than being a third wheel to a romantic relationship,

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.200
is being a third wheel to two best friends.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.380
I've recently introduced two of my friends and it did not go the way that I thought it would.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.240
Heeey!

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.420
Hey Gaby!

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.900
Meet Allison, Allison meet Gaby!

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:22.620
[Sensual music]

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.360
Uh, guys?

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.300
Gu.. Guys, do you still wanna... Okay...

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.640
And if you're wondering, I thought it would go like this.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.240
Gaby, meet Allison, Allison, meet Gaby.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.000
Hi! Nice to meet you.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.860
Hey!

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.800
I like your shirt.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.320
Thanks!

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.780
I am the glue that holds us all together.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.400
But no!

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.040
They met and it was instafriendship.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.280
Which was great,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.740
until I realized that our whole dynamic was changing.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.660
Soon, I was gonna be the third wheel, while they're

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.400
finishing each

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.740
other's sentences!

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.220
Oh my god!

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.700
[Laughter]

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.180
The friendship third wheel is its own special kind of loneliness.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.120
It's a horror I would not wish on anyone.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.100
It's a FOMO when yo' sittin' right there tho'.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.880
[Laughter]

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.360
What are you guys laughing about?

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.040
Gaby said the stupidest thing in this video that she like kept saying and it's so funny.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.420
Can I, can I watch the video?

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.420
Oh, don't even worry about it, it's so stupid.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.180
It's honestly the dumbest.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.880
Oh it's like, it's not even worth it. It's like you'd have to see so many...

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.360
It's dumb, it's really dumb.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.200
Yeah, don't worry about it.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.780
You'd have to be a fucking idiot not to find it on your own.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.740
[Laughter]

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.080
And I felt pretty petty and I felt dumb about how jealous I was.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.800
So I tried to strengthen my bond with them.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.360
Hey! What's up?

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.620
Hey! Did you want to watch a movie on Friday?

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.380
Ah... Allison and I have plans Friday...

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.440
Oh...

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.920
Okay then... Um...

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.860
How about Saturday?

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.080
Yeah sure! I'm free Saturday!

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.080
Are you free Saturday Allison?

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.780
I'm free! Would love to hang!

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.720
Wha... Uh

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.320
What time? Probably at night, right? Because we have that...

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.320
Yeah, we're busy all day.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.680
Yeah, we have that mic...

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.000
And it got to a point where I just had to tell them about how insecure I felt

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.200
and how threatened I was by their friendship.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.400
So, I sat them down and I talked to them like the adult that I am.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.280
[Crying]

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.500
Oh no! We love you!

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.640
You're just between us!

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.280
Yeah.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.860
You're gonna be okay, we're all friends.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.120
So I think we can all agree that the moral of this story is...

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.700
Never introduce your friends to eachother!

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.920
They're yours, yours alone! Never share them with anyone.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.300
