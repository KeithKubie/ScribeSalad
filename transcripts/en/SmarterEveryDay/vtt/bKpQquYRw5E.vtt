00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey it's me Destin. So I feel like I owe you an apology for not making videos the last

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.010
couple of weeks but when I explain why I hope you will accept my apology. So it started like this.

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.030
I got something in the mail.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.070
Turns out it is the new Phantom camera.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.090
It's called a Miro M320S. So this is different.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.120
It's a lot smaller, it's more sensitive, it's better than what I've been shooting with in the past,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.130
and they're letting me try it out. There's only a few of these in the continent right now. So Miro is

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.140
Spanish for "I see", so it's kind of like "Hey I see something that

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.150
I haven't seen before", so I thought that was a pretty cool name. I took this over

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.150
9000 miles on 8 different plane trips to meet all kinds of cool people all over the country

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.180
to shoot video for you. So in a nutshell the reason I haven't been showing you videos,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.210
is because I've been shooting videos. So it started like this. I got on a plane and

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.220
I went out west, and I met a guy named Alan Sailer. Alan Sailer is "the man"

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.220
when it comes to high speed photography but he doesn't know a lot about high speed video.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.250
So Alan combined what he knew and his artistic style with what I know

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.280
as a high speed video guy, and we made some really cool videos. That'll be coming

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.290
up soon. After that in the desert a guy named Greg came out

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.290
and met me to show me a device that he had built, and we analyzed that and looked at all the math involved

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.300
in how that thing worked. That's gonna be cool as well. After that I went out

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.330
of my way a little bit and went and saw my buddies Joe and Buzz.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.340
Buzz bought me an ice cream sundae with USA drawn across it in chocolate syrup.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.360
Of course we shot a bunch of cool video and that was that. After that I got back on

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.380
a plane and went to the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo Canada

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.390
to a meeting called BrainSTEM. BrainSTEM, STEM meaning Science

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.410
Technology Engineering and Math. At BrainSTEM I met some really cool people. I met Chris from

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.420
Science Alert in Australia. I saw Michael from Vsauce again. I met Vihart

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.460
who makes math videos on YouTube. I saw Derek from Veritasium we got to shoot

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.470
some slinky footage together. I also saw Henry from Minute Physics in his office.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.490
He showed me how Minute Physics works, that was fun. He also plays the

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.510
violin and the mandolin, so we shot some really cool video of that. I was

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.520
also able to do a demonstration of high speed video using liquid nitrogen and fruit

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.530
provided by the faculty of the Perimiter Institute. They use their liquid

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.550
nitrogen for their superconducters, so I was able to use it for a less noble purpose

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.550
but it's pretty awesome. 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.560
[bang] Nice.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.560
[laugh]

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.600
I flew back to LA and I went to VidCon.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.610
VidCon is this big huge meeting of a bunch of people from YouTube basically. It was fun.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.630
I got to sit on a Physics panel with Henry from Minute Physics and Derek

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.650
of Veritasium, that was pretty cool. They got to ask them questions about theoretical physics

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.660
I answered all the really hard questions about snack cake design and stuff like that. I setup

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.690
a high speed camera and I let people just walk up and experience high speed on their own.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.730
I didn't really officially get a booth but I found a spare outlet, and they

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.980
tried to run me off once or twice but I just kinda stuck to it. But it was fun.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.420
Destin, hotel, LA.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.360
Gavin, slow-mo guy.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.770
Hello. So, you brought a high speed camera to me..

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.790
(Destin) Pretty much, yeah.
Which is awesome, cause I don't have one at the moment.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.820
So we've gotta come up with stuff to do in this regular hotel room.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.850
So I bought this shirt to wear to VidCon. I thought it'd be pretty good. I found it at a thrift store

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.880
in Arizona. Anyway it's a really adorable kitty cat and I thought hey it's YouTube,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.900
they would love kitty cats. But the problem is I chickened out. In hindsight

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.920
I made a foolish decision, I should have worn the kitten shirt. I've been compiling all this video, so

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.940
that's why I haven't released a video. I'm preparing for the future. Speaking of prepare for the future,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.950
I put a link on the main channel page that you can directly

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.970
donate to my kids scholarship. I call it a micro scholarship. That's really why I shoot

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.010
Smarter Every Day is to raise money for my kids college education and I'm serious about that.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.050
Thank you to the five people that just happened to find the link and donate. Thank you very much.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.090
Ooh, rubber band just popped. I'm gonna leave you with this. I want to introduce you to a guy named

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.120
Brady Haran. So he went to both BrainSTEM and VidCon and we became

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.130
very close over the entire week. But the thing is, we became so close that

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.150
we started picking on each other, you know, that kind of friend? So here's what I want to do.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.170
I want to introduce you, the viewing audience of Smarter Every Day to Brady's videos but I decided to make

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.190
him earn it. So here's the deal. I setup a challenge using the Miro

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.220
and Brady had to earn the right to have you link to his

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.230
stuff, and hopefully subscribe. This is kinda how that went down.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.240
My business card is not as impressive as yours Destin, but this is it.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.250
This is the world's smallest periodic table

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.270
which has been etched on a human hair. It's in this year's Guinness Book of Records,

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.300
you can look it up, and of course it's also on one of our videos on Periodic Videos.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.320
(Destin) OK so here's the deal. Brady makes

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.330
a channel called Periodic Videos at the University of Nottingham, and if you

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.340
watch Smarter Every Day you probably have figured out by now I'm pretty weak in chemistry

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.350
but this man and his team is probably the strongest channel in chemistry

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.360
and I think you should pretty much go check it out. But for now, before I give

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.390
them a link, I'm gonna make you earn it. I want to teach you..
(Brady) I'm I'm

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.420
singing for my supper am I?
(Destin) Yes you are. So I want you to set this mousetrap.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.440
So let's figure this out.
(Brady) Can I, like, you know how we were joking

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.460
around saying I don't know how to set a mousetrap? I actually don't know how

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.470
to set a mousetrap, so you just giving it to me and saying set it is kind of..

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.490
This is Smarter Every Day man, I've seen your videos, your videos teach the smartest things in the world

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.510
and here we're learning how to set a mousetrap. I think you're lowering the tone.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.530
(Destin) Put your thumb right here and don't move it.
Yeah.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.550
(Brady) Is that done it?! ohh!
(Destin) I have the high speed camera

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.590
and we were gonna do the mousetrap right?
-yeah
(Destin) I wanna see if you can

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.630
trip that with your finger without getting hit.
- And what do I

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.630
get in return for this?
(Destin) I'll provide a link to your Periodic

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.640
Videos. [laugh] Deal?
- And and

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.660
like.. oh well, alright. I have a lot of respect

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.680
for your viewers and if a few of them come to Periodic Videos I think it's worth a broken finger.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.220
(Destin) You won't break a finger if you're fast enough. [laugh]

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.750
[snap] Ooh.
(Brady) Is that the pen bending?
(Destin) 12.161. OK if you can

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.800
get out of the way in about 90ms you're good.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.830
(Brady) Man I can't even think that fast. Alright you want me to do it?

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.850
(Destin) Yeah go.
[laughs]

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.860
That was like a.. that was a practice golf swing.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.870
[snap]
(Destin) Yeah you got it! Way to go!

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.880
Alright, so.. Brady has successfully

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.900
earned your trust, so if you want to go see Periodic Videos

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.930
and a really adrenaline pumped Brady then

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.950
click on the link here, and go check out his videos. 
He actually has

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.980
a lot of channels, so if you can calm down enough to tell me what you got.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.990
Periodic Videos for chemistry, Sixty Symbols for

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.000
physics, I mean I've just displayed some physics skills there, and there's 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.020
Deep Sky Videos for people that like astronomy like Destin, there's some good space stuff.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.050
And Numberphile is a really good one for some numbery maths stuff as well.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.080
They're all at the University of Nottingham for the most part but he does things like go to Everest, I mean it's really

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.110
top notch stuff. So go check it out, I'm Destin you're getting Smarter Every Day

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:16.840
Brady's getting more manly every day. [laugh] Have a good one. Later.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.160
Yeah, stupider every day.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.170
[laugh]
