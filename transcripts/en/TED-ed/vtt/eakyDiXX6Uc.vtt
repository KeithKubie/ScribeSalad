00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.769
In 1995, the British Medical Journal

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.279
published an astonishing report 
about a 29-year-old builder.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.394
He accidentally jumped 
onto a 15-centimeter nail,

00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:22.074
which pierced straight through 
his steel-toed boot.

00:00:22.074 --> 00:00:27.634
He was in such agonizing pain that even 
the smallest movement was unbearable.

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:32.104
But when the doctors took off his boot, 
they faced a surprising sight:

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:35.858
the nail had never touched 
his foot at all.

00:00:35.858 --> 00:00:37.160
For hundreds of years,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.510
scientists thought that pain was 
a direct response to damage.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.658
By that logic, the more severe an injury 
is, the more pain it should cause.

00:00:46.658 --> 00:00:49.907
But as we’ve learned more about 
the science of pain,

00:00:49.907 --> 00:00:55.110
we’ve discovered that pain and tissue 
damage don’t always go hand in hand,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.729
even when the body’s threat signaling 
mechanisms are fully functioning.

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:05.198
We’re capable of experiencing severe pain 
out of proportion to an actual injury,

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.767
and even pain without any injury,

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:12.223
like the builder, or the well-documented 
cases of male partners

00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:18.130
of pregnant women experiencing pain
during the pregnancy or labor.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.776
What’s going on here?

00:01:19.776 --> 00:01:22.618
There are actually two phenomena at play:

00:01:22.618 --> 00:01:27.793
the experience of pain, and a biological 
process called nociception.

00:01:27.793 --> 00:01:31.628
Nociception is part of the nervous 
system’s protective response

00:01:31.628 --> 00:01:34.937
to harmful or potentially harmful stimuli.

00:01:34.937 --> 00:01:37.368
Sensors in specialized nerve endings

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:40.989
detect mechanical, thermal, 
and chemical threats.

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:43.342
If enough sensors are activated,

00:01:43.342 --> 00:01:47.965
electrical signals shoot up the nerve 
to the spine and on to the brain.

00:01:47.965 --> 00:01:50.672
The brain weighs the importance 
of these signals

00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:55.122
and produces pain if it decides 
the body needs protection.

00:01:55.122 --> 00:01:59.466
Typically, pain helps the body 
avoid further injury or damage.

00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:03.320
But there are a whole set of factors 
besides nociception

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.840
that can influence the experience of pain—
and make pain less useful.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.295
First, there are biological factors that 
amplify nociceptive signals to the brain.

00:02:14.295 --> 00:02:17.176
If nerve fibers are activated repeatedly,

00:02:17.176 --> 00:02:20.006
the brain may decide they need 
to be more sensitive

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.953
to adequately protect the body 
from threats.

00:02:22.953 --> 00:02:26.323
More stress sensors can be 
added to nerve fibers

00:02:26.323 --> 00:02:30.493
until they become so sensitive that 
even light touches to the skin

00:02:30.493 --> 00:02:33.178
spark intense electrical signals.

00:02:33.178 --> 00:02:34.385
In other cases,

00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:39.557
nerves adapt to send signals more 
efficiently, amplifying the message.

00:02:39.557 --> 00:02:41.272
These forms of amplification 

00:02:41.272 --> 00:02:44.865
are most common in people experiencing 
chronic pain,

00:02:44.865 --> 00:02:48.866
which is defined as pain lasting 
more than 3 months.

00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:53.186
When the nervous system is nudged 
into an ongoing state of high alert,

00:02:53.186 --> 00:02:56.083
pain can outlast physical injury.

00:02:56.083 --> 00:03:00.120
This creates a vicious cycle in which 
the longer pain persists,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.122
the more difficult it becomes to reverse.

00:03:03.122 --> 00:03:06.790
Psychological factors clearly 
play a role in pain too,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.404
potentially by influencing nociception and
by influencing the brain directly.

00:03:12.404 --> 00:03:15.040
A person’s emotional state, memories,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.426
beliefs about pain and expectations 
about treatment

00:03:18.426 --> 00:03:21.646
can all influence how much 
pain they experience.

00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:22.968
In one study,

00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:27.059
children who reported believing they 
had no control over pain

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:29.925
actually experienced more intense pain

00:03:29.925 --> 00:03:32.801
than those who believed they 
had some control.

00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:35.113
Features of the environment matter too:

00:03:35.113 --> 00:03:36.424
In one experiment,

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:40.592
volunteers with a cold rod placed on 
the back of their hand

00:03:40.592 --> 00:03:45.340
reported feeling more pain when they were 
shown a red light than a blue one,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.405
even though the rod was the same 
temperature each time.

00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:53.593
Finally, social factors like the 
availability of family support

00:03:53.593 --> 00:03:55.834
can affect perception of pain.

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:59.154
All of this means that a multi-pronged 
approach to pain treatment

00:03:59.154 --> 00:04:05.004
that includes pain specialists, physical 
therapists, clinical psychologists, nurses

00:04:05.004 --> 00:04:09.406
and other healthcare professionals 
is often most effective.

00:04:09.406 --> 00:04:13.985
We’re only beginning to uncover the 
mechanisms behind the experience of pain,

00:04:13.985 --> 00:04:16.639
but there are some promising 
areas of research.

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:17.749
Until recently,

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:22.833
we thought the glial cells surrounding 
neurons were just support structures,

00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:27.219
but now we know they have a huge role 
in influencing nociception.

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:31.627
Studies have shown that disabling certain 
brain circuits in the amygdala

00:04:31.627 --> 00:04:34.209
can eliminate pain in rats.

00:04:34.209 --> 00:04:37.133
And genetic testing in people with 
rare disorders

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:39.247
that prevent them from feeling pain

00:04:39.247 --> 00:04:42.860
have pinpointed several other 
possible targets for drugs

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.270
and perhaps eventually gene therapy.
