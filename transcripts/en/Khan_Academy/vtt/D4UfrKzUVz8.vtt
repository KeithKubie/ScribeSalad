00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.550
Welcome back.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.320
So we're on problem number 9.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.220
In the figure above,
AD is equal to 1.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.300
So AD, this distance right
here, this is equal to 1.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.290
DC is equal to square
root of 3.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.680
So this distance right here
is square root of 3.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.640
What is the value of z?

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.130
And they say, no, it is
not drawn to scale.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.460
Clearly.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.180
Because this is longer than
this, but it looks the same.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.660
OK, so they want to know
what the value of z is.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.820
So what can we figure out?

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.520
Well, the one thing that pops
out at me is these are both

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.320
right triangles.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.990
So this is going to deal
with right triangles.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.490
And the first thing we
see is that these two

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.510
angles are the same.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.330
So these two angles
are the same, and

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.580
this is a right angle.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.120
We don't even have to know this,
but we immediately know

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.160
this is a 45-45-90
triangle, right?

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.270
Because the angles have
to add up to 180.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.230
Two of them are the same.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.580
You could say 2x plus
90 is equal to 180,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.280
and solve for it.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.750
But what you also know is that
this is an isosceles triangle,

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.040
where two sides are the same.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.360
I don't know if you remember
from geometry class, if you

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.070
have a triangle like that, and
this angle is equal to this

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.380
angle, then this side is going
to be equal to that side.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.820
I forgot what the property's
called.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.930
I think it's just equal angles,
equal sides, or base

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.740
angles-- well, whatever.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.700
Hopefully you remember that
term in geometry.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.890
In this case, these two angles
are the base angles, so if

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.440
this is 1, then this
is also 1.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.280
This BD is also going to be 1.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.370
And this is going to be square
root of 2 or something.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.000
So that now, if we look at
this triangle, something

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.250
interesting should pop out at
you, if you're familiar with

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.370
30-60-90 triangles.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.470
This side is square root
of 3 times this side.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.440
What do we know about
30-60-90 triangles?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.450
And you could even turn back
to page-- if you don't

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.790
remember, they give
it to you, right?

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.590
They even tell you, right
here, that on a 30-60-90

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.570
triangle, on page 423 they draw
it out for you, actually.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.306
If you have a 30-60-90 triangle
like this, and this

00:02:13.306 --> 00:02:18.640
side is 30, and this side is x,
then this side is going to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.830
be x times the square
root of 3.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.580
They literally give that to you
on page 423 when they give

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.990
you their formulas.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.360
So this side is 1.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.550
This side is 1 times the
square root of 3.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.070
So z must be 30 degrees.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.980
It's a 30-60-90 triangle.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.710
If they asked you why, this
would have been 60 degrees.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.570
And then, if you wanted to know
what this side would have

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.780
been, it would have been 2, just
using 30-60-90 triangles.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.815
All right.

00:02:46.815 --> 00:02:53.310
Let's move to number 10.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.470
Hopefully that's not
too confusing.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.790
If it is, just review 30-60-90
triangles, and look at that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.540
formula on page 423.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.450
Number 10.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:16.750
If 30% of 40% of a positive
number is equal to-- so 0.3--

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.990
30% of 40%.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.990
So 0.3 times-- but I don't want
to use times, because

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.620
they want me to use
x for the number.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:35.800
So 0.3 times 0.4-- so that's
30% of 40% of a positive

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:43.230
number-- so that's x,
is equal to 20% of

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.910
w% of the same number.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:55.550
So that equals 20% of w%.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.640
So if it's w%, then we could
write that as w/100.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.650
So if w was 50, that'd be
50/100 or 0.5 times x.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.600
Well, we can divide both sides
of this equation by x.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.970
These cancel out.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.089
And then we just literally
solve for w.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:20.450
And actually, I probably didn't
even have to write it

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.200
as a decimal.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.430
30% of 40% of something--
well, we can just

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.780
multiply the decimals.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.340
What's 3 times 4?

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.130
It's 12.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.585
There's two numbers behind
the decimal.

00:04:31.585 --> 00:04:38.630
So this is 12, which
is also 12%.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.980
Is equal to-- and then we
say 0.2 times what w?

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:46.790
What number?

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.520
Let's say times w.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.320
Well, I shouldn't write w.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.910
I'm going to write this as y.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:51.520
And I'll tell you why.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.330
Because this will give
w% as a decimal.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.790
So I'm just saying 0.3
times 0.4 is 0.12.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.740
And that's the same thing
as 0.2 times what?

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.970
Well, you divide both sides by
0.2, you get y is equal to

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.980
0.12 over 0.2.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:19.130
And that is equal to 0.6.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.320
And you could review decimals
if that didn't make a lot of

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.020
sense to you.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.490
So that equals 0.6.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.510
So y is 0.6, or w% is 0.6.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.880
So the same thing
as 0.6 is 60%.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.130
So the choice is B.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.390
That might seem a little
complicated.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.410
And the tricky part is really
just making sure that you're

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.040
not using decimals and then
assuming that's a percent, or

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.660
vice versa.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.250
The important thing is
we took 30% and 40%.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.380
When you multiply those two
together, that's the same

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.410
thing as 20% times w%.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.030
And I like to put it
all in decimals.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.765
You could have put it all in
fractions as well, actually.

00:05:57.765 --> 00:05:59.520
It actually probably would've
been the easiest. You would

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.770
have said, 30% is 3/10,
times 4/10 is equal

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:13.130
to 2/10 times w/100.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.360
I took a 0 out.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.990
You could have said 30/100,
40/100, like that.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.370
And then this actually would've
been easy, because

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.670
you could have just taken the
100's off of both sides.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.050
You said 30 times 40
is 20 times what?

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.010
And then you would have gotten
w is equal to 60.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.900
Actually, that's how I
should have done it.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.120
But anyway, hopefully I didn't
confuse you too much.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.690
Next problem.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.670
Notice I do these things
in real time.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.640
The negative is maybe I don't
give you the most optimal

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:53.520
solution at first, but I think
the positive is that you're

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.960
not seeing just a
clean solution.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.320
You're seeing how someone, the
thought process that they go

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.510
through when they tackle
these problems.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.770
And I think that that's
actually a super

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.680
useful thing to see.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.310
Because when you see these very
polished presentations,

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.580
that person did the problem
ahead of time, and so they

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.340
just give you the answer.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.780
But they're not showing you kind
of how they stumbled upon

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.350
the answer.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.620
So I can only hope that
this is useful.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:13.880
All right.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.410
Number 11.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.750
This looks exciting.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.025
OK, I'll switch colors.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.030
Let me draw this thing,
and I have the perfect

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.940
tool to draw it.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.340
Oh, no, I didn't want
it like that.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.580
So a big rectangle like that.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.590
And they took half
of it like that.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.500
No, no, no.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.830
Edit, undo.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.590
I've got to go half.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.992
My eyes aren't working.

00:07:44.992 --> 00:07:46.242
It's roughly half.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.360
And then they take half like
this, and then they

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.130
take half like this.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.010
Well, they keep doing it.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.380
Like that.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.030
Then they take a half
like this, then they

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.605
take a half like that.

00:08:06.605 --> 00:08:08.370
At least drawing this is fun.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:08.890
OK.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.580
I think this is what they have.
And then they actually

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.750
shade in that last one.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.350
So let me shade in
that last one.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.550
I shaded it in in white.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.180
But anyway.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.410
In the figure above, rectangle
ABCD-- that's the whole

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:24.270
thing-- is made up of seven
non-overlapping rectangles.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.380
The two smallest rectangles
have the same area.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.020
So these two have
the same area.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.620
Each of the other rectangles
have twice the area of the

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.070
smaller rectangle.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.940
OK, and it looks that way.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.539
The area of the shaded rectangle
is what fraction of

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:41.220
the area of the rectangle
ABCD?

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.710
Well, let's just chug
through this.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.810
So let me find a
suitable color.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.040
So this is x.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.990
Oh, I'm still using the
rectangle tool.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.180
If this is x, and this
is going to be

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.020
x, this is 2x, right?

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.030
If this is 2x, then
this is 4x.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.750
Because they say that
each larger one

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.540
is twice the previous.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.040
So this is 4x.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.740
So this is going to be 8x.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.760
Am I doing this right?

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.900
8x.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.630
And then this is going
to be 16x.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.580
And then this is going
to be 32x.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.210
The area of the shaded
rectangle.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.080
And then, we could just
sum all of these.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.790
But we also know that
this is half of the

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.700
entire rectangle, right?

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.330
This rectangle right here.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.240
So the entire thing is 64x.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.520
This times 2.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.300
Because this makes up half
of the entire thing.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:43.680
So the entire thing is 64x, so
x is going to be 1/64 of the

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.380
entire rectangle.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:46.680
There.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.580
That's it.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.370
All right.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.110
Number 12.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:51.690
Oh, no, I'm almost
out of time.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.160
So I'll do number 12
in the next video.
