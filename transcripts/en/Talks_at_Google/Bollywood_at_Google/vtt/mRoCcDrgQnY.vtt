00:00:08.337 --> 00:00:09.920
SPEAKER 1: Hello,
Googlers and guests.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.360
My name is [INAUDIBLE] and
welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.690
Our guest today is the
actor Manoj Bajpayee.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.620
My earliest memories of him are
from the TV series "Swabhimaan"

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.250
and watching him set
the screen on fire,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.450
as Bhiku Mhatre in "Satya."

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.190
It's been nearly 20
years since then,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.600
and he has performed
many outstanding roles

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.880
in movies like "Shool," "Aks,"
"Zubeidaa," "Chakravyuh,"

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.130
"Aligarh," and
"Gangs of Wasseypur."

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.130
His craft has been recognized.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.710
He's a two-time winner of
the National Film Award

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.990
and a four-time winner
of the Filmfare Award.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.993
Please join me in welcoming
the very talented Mr. Manoj

00:00:49.993 --> 00:00:50.959
Bajpayee.

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:54.823
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:57.238
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: Thank you.

00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:03.150
SPEAKER 1: Welcome to Google.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.108
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: Thanks.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.560
SPEAKER 1: So I wanted
to start by asking--

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.360
you took a tour
around the campus--

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.600
is this your first
time at Google?

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.960
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: This is the
first time in San Francisco.

00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:21.760
Everybody said that this
is the best city in USA.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.040
I, personally, love Europe,
as I was speaking to my friend

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.420
[INAUDIBLE]---- we shared the
common thing about Europe.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.590
But yes, tonight I'm
going for a look around.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.600
Some friends are taking
me to San Francisco

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.610
and all the landmark places.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.140
So yes, first time at
Google, and first time

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.930
in a place which is
considered the biggest

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.480
company in the world.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.320
So yes, this is quite an
interesting, exciting tour.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.730
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.670
I'd like to start by how
you got into show business.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.160
I've heard about the time
that you were a teenager.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.210
You moved to Delhi to apply to
the National School of Drama.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.980
You applied many times.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.560
You were rejected,
but you persevered.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.560
At such a young age,
how were you so focused

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.790
on one career choice?

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.960
What drew you?

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.580
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: I don't know.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.038
I mean, since my
childhood I wanted

00:02:16.038 --> 00:02:23.740
to become an actor, which was
quite a rarity in a small town

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.540
like mine which was quite
backward in those days,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.370
and it still is.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.550
We are working very hard towards
convincing the government of--

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.230
be hard to really focus all
the developmental issues

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.970
towards that area.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.470
But yes, it was a rarity.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.700
Being an actor was not
something that any parent

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.300
wanted for their child to
get into that profession.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.410
It was not looked up.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.210
It was looked down by everybody.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.170
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.480
For me, it was
very, very essential

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.980
to keep my dream very close to
my chest since my childhood.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.450
So I never actually told
anybody, any close friend

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.530
of mine, closest of the body
that this is the dream I have,

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.050
and this is what I am
planning to do in life.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.340
So it was a hard task.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.580
Dreaming of becoming an
actor was much more easier

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.430
than keeping your dream
close to your heart

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.050
and not letting
anyone know about it.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.580
That was very, very
difficult for me.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.770
So the 17 and a half years
that I spent in my village,

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.190
or in the small town where
I was doing my schooling,

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.880
I kept on looking for some
avenues where I could just

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.530
go ahead and do some acting.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.750
But it was not available.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.630
It used to happen only
in the school functions

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.030
sometimes, one skit
here, some skit there.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.130
Watching Amitabh Bachchan
films and imitating him

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.240
in front of the mirror.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.730
These were the only
things which was available

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.329
to me, where I could just
go ahead and give it a try.

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:23.870
So for me it was
very, very important

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.540
to move my base from that
small town or that village

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.920
to a better place like Delhi.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.220
So I thought of
doing my graduation

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.590
from Delhi, Delhi University.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.713
That was a long, long
journey for 17 years old, 17

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:44.510
and 1/2 year old person who
has never been to any big city

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.810
before.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.369
So yes, that's how it
all started for me.

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:52.660
SPEAKER 1: So you've kept
the dream close to your heart

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.780
as you were leaving from there.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.210
What did you tell your parents
as you were going to Delhi?

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.220
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: The
easiest thing to tell

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.760
your [NON-ENGLISH] parent
is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.140
The easiest way
to convince them.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.720
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.140
My father was a
little disheartened,

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:20.550
because he had a dream of
seeing his elder son becoming

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.080
a doctor.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.116
But he said, OK, so doctor,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:05:26.116 --> 00:05:29.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:31.366 --> 00:05:32.490
That's how I convinced him.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.890
But one thing he said
that I have six children

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.510
to take care of.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.290
So I will not be very frequent
in sending money to you.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.910
So you will have to really
look after yourself,

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.440
take care of yourself, of
your monthly expenditure.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.080
So sometimes he used to send
me 200 rupees, 250 rupees

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.842
sometimes.

00:05:51.842 --> 00:05:53.550
But the rest of the
time I was completely

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.540
dependent upon all
the friends of mine

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.830
who are doing so well now.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.810
Some of them are into
income tax on a big post.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:10.180
One of them is the Indian
ambassador in Mexico.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.950
These friends of mine, they
took it upon themselves

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.600
to look after Manoj Bajpayee.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.780
They believed in my dream.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.790
Somewhere, they felt that
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.550
You just wear it.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.932
I have a shirt.

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:31.890
You'll take it from me.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.250
I was very short.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.330
OK, how much you
need for your rent?

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.010
100 rupees?

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:43.830
So this month I'm putting in
on behalf of Monoj Bajpayee.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:49.780
So that's how I was taken
care of by all my friends.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.800
I always say that without
them, without their support,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.060
I wouldn't have survived
in a city like Delhi.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.040
SPEAKER 1: Interesting.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.050
So now you're in Delhi.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.220
You are participating
in theater.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.930
Tell us about your
early days in theatre.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.332
Is there a role or a performance
that you found particularly

00:07:07.332 --> 00:07:08.790
rewarding during
your theatre days?

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.498
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: There
are many, actually.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.510
I used to work 16 hours,
18 hours in a day.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.300
I used to sleep for
five or six hours.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.890
And there were many challenges.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.560
For a person who was coming
from that kind of a place,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.650
learning good Hindi,
because everybody says

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.210
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.500
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.050
So these are the languages.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.940
And my mother tongue
is [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.770
Yes, my education
medium was Hindi.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.740
But all the [NON-ENGLISH] used
to do very badly in Hindi.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.200
They could hardly
manage second division.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.540
Because [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.942
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:06.161
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.180
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.820
It's tricky working on Hindi.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.370
Learning English was
a big, big challenge.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.750
But somewhere I realized
when I was a 14, 15-year-old,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.760
and I was still in school, I
realized that if I have to do

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.270
well in big city, in a big
city like Delhi or Bombay,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:34.080
and if I have to be in industry,
I should stop listening

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.450
to [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:48.860
So English was more of tool
for me than a language.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.050
So English, [NON-ENGLISH],,
Hindi [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.840
or theatre [NON-ENGLISH],,
acting a craft [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.090
and monthly rent [NON-ENGLISH].

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:06.000
There were too many challenges
that I was facing in Delhi.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.370
But yes, somewhere
theaters could

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.380
help me survive everything.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.140
Whenever I used
to do rehearsals,

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.830
or I used to do plays--

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:24.020
anything related to
theater or acting--

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.950
somewhere I was
completely distracted

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:30.535
from all the difficulties
that I was facing.

00:09:30.535 --> 00:09:32.410
SPEAKER 1: Languages is
an interesting point.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.190
I wanted to ask you a
question about that.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.690
You've acted in a few Tamil
and Telugu movies as well.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.190
Do you speak any
of those languages?

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:38.981
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: No.

00:09:38.981 --> 00:09:44.660
So I've done four
films, and I decided

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.780
that I will never touch them.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:54.260
Because not knowing language
is the biggest handicap

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.540
for any actor.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.910
So whenever I'm
conducting a workshop,

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.550
I always tell all the new
actors that, you guys,

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.120
your Hindi's really bad.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.770
And you are not going to be
directed by Martin Scorsese

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:16.490
and Spielberg in Bombay.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.590
You are going to
work in Hindi films.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.475
So your language has to be good.

00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:23.234
So Tamil Telugu films that--

00:10:23.234 --> 00:10:24.650
very few films
that I have done, I

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:30.070
have realized that somewhere
I'm doing complete injustice

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.400
to my profession.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.260
Where I could not understand
anything that I was saying.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.310
I was taking the prompting
working on basic emotions.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.860
Somewhere that didn't go
down very well with me.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.020
So I stopped working.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.010
And now I don't accept that.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:52.466
Unless someone really comes
and pays me a huge amount.

00:10:52.466 --> 00:10:53.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.990
Because as an actor--

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.020
as a star, you make a
lot of money in India.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.835
But as an actor, you
don't make money.

00:10:58.835 --> 00:11:02.550
[INAUDIBLE] definitely
will agree with me.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.209
[LAUGHING]

00:11:05.209 --> 00:11:07.250
SPEAKER 1: Another
interesting nugget I picked up

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.400
was you've actually done
voiceover work for two

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.705
animation movies as well?

00:11:11.705 --> 00:11:12.830
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: Yes, right.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.455
SPEAKER 1: How is
that as an experience

00:11:14.455 --> 00:11:15.950
when you are not actually--

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.850
you just have to use
your voice to emote?

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:18.740
MANOJ BAJPAYEE:
Yeah, I mean, I've

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.810
done radio plays when
I was doing theater,

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.559
because that's how we
used to earn money--

00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:24.870
200 rupees, 400 rupees,
sometimes used to make.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.310
And I didn't find it any
different from radio plays.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.650
Because even in radio
plays those days,

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:31.940
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.610
Or you would start working on
it, and say it in front of--

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.390
now you act it out in
front of the camera.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.640
And this is what I have done
in those animation films.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.940
In one, I played Rama.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.940
In one, I played Yudhisthir.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.930
So whatever interpretation
that I have of Rama--

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:58.100
because I always see him as
a human being, not as God--

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.820
but God is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.470
But Ramji was married.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:09.260
Ramji went through difficulties
that all humans go through.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:14.780
So I treated him very
realistically for the animation

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.830
film.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.360
SPEAKER 1: So you've worked
with many different directors.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.290
I'm sure each one of
them has their own style.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.360
You've worked across genres.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.540
Is there any
incident you remember

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.202
where you were
concerned about working

00:12:28.202 --> 00:12:29.660
with a particular
director, and you

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.130
found that as you
started working

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.144
you had instant rapport?

00:12:33.144 --> 00:12:35.060
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: I get
along with my directors,

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.970
because I really feel that
theater is actor's medium,

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.460
and cinema is director's medium.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.450
Because he is the
only one who has

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.600
complete clarity
about the entire film.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.710
So you just listen to-- you
work along with the director.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.950
You don't work separately
from the director.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.230
You are not somebody who is--

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:06.120
are the people who are seen
when audience is watching,

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.620
but it's the director
who is calling the shots.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.780
So all the people
that I worked with,

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.100
I never had any issues with any
director in my entire career.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.670
I think also because
that somewhere deep down

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.800
in my heart, I
feel that I am what

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.130
I am because of the belief and
the faith of some directors

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:30.720
who somehow had the vision
of taking me in those roles.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.816
SPEAKER 1: So you mentioned that
theater is an actor's medium.

00:13:33.816 --> 00:13:35.190
One of the things
one reads about

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.490
is you're called upon
as the pioneering method

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.400
actor in Hindi cinema,
and other actors

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.020
look to you for inspiration.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.270
Do you see yourself
as a method actor?

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.740
What is your style?

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.230
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: Method
is something that you--

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.980
you can't have one method.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.000
Yes, when you're doing
theater, you are really--

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.830
you are working on yourself.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.280
You are acquiring new
skill for approaching

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.880
each and every role.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.580
But at the end of
the day, when I'm

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.530
working with-- on
Anurag Kashyap,

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:10.980
I'm applying a different
way of approaching my roles.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.547
When I'm working
with Neeraj Pandey,

00:14:12.547 --> 00:14:13.630
he's completely different.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:18.120
He's 360 degree opposite
to Anurag Kashyap.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.810
So an actor has to
be skilled enough

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:26.640
to really adjust his method
or approach according

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.166
to the director's need.

00:14:29.166 --> 00:14:31.540
Neeraj Pandey doesn't want
you to get into the character.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.081
He just wants you
to learn your lines

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:35.910
and come in front of
the camera and just

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.680
listen to his direction.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.820
That's it.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.970
Anurag Kashyap says, you
go through your script,

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.390
and you throw the script.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.830
And after that, whatever
you are going to do,

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:47.820
I'm going to accept it.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:55.080
Unless it is really, really
not right for the vision

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.490
that I have.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:02.670
So a true actor is somebody
who is never questioning

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:07.310
the director's vision and
always ready to adjust

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:10.070
with the director's need.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.866
So we apply different
kind of method

00:15:14.866 --> 00:15:17.490
for different kind of directors
and different kinds of scripts.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.310
SPEAKER 1: Your recent
movie, "Aligarh"--

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:27.020
you played Professor Siras'
character as very sensitive,

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.110
heartbreaking.

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.940
How did you prepare for that?

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.010
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: I went
the other way round.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.040
And actually, my wife was
very, very supportive.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.890
She has to keep my little
daughter in check all the time

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:46.790
and just making sure that she
doesn't come and disturb me

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.920
when I was taking
Marathi lessons, lessons

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.050
from the chief
assistant director.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:52.790
He was very good.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.420
His knowledge about Marathi
poetry and literature

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.760
was amazing.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.330
So he used to come to my place.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.260
And we should just learn--

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.910
I was just learning Marathi.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.410
And this chief of
assistant director

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.320
was always amazed and surprised
as to why I'm learning Marathi,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.690
because I'm not going to
say any line in Marathi

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.360
in a Hindi film.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.620
But I kept on asking
him to introduce me

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.600
to Marathi poetry,
Marathi poets.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.730
So he used to put it on
the YouTube sometime.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.510
He used to get some link,
open it on his computer.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.540
And I used to just listen
to those Marathi words.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.580
And sometime, I should start
writing in Marathi, also,

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:38.320
whatever he was
asking him to write.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.170
Sometime he used to make
me read a few Marathi

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.710
lines from a Marathi novel.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:51.390
But for me, it was
very, very important

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.330
to think like Siras as a
Marathi literature person.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:17:02.140
Because Siras was-- his
sexuality was not his identity.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.660
Siras being a great
Marathi literature

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.990
professor in "Aligarh"--
that was his identity.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.420
So I wanted to
know his identity,

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.930
to get close to his
identity, to really get

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:16.609
into the skin of the character.

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:23.130
So if you see the film, his
love for Lata Mangeshkar,

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:29.470
or love for Marathi poetry,
or the way he talks,

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:33.790
the way he approaches
his literature--

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:39.830
that makes Siras the character.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.660
Gay was secondary for me.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.020
Him being homosexual
was something very, very

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.050
secondary for me.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.400
And that's how I
approached the character.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.300
SPEAKER 1: Last year, you
also had three short films

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.230
I saw on YouTube--

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.500
"Ouch," "Kriti," and "Taandav."

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.000
What do you think
about that medium?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.470
Do you have more short
films coming out?

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.330
MANOJ BAJPAYEE:
I'll be doing more.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.620
I'm just stopped for some time,
because now suddenly there

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.440
are so many people are
making short films.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.890
I really feel that
actor is always

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:19.760
in need of acting, is always
looking for an opportunity

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.130
to act.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.560
And these short films are
giving you a nice getaway

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.200
from the routine life
of acting in films.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:34.810
Just go act for a day
or two, and suddenly you

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.160
put it on YouTube.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.650
And suddenly you see
so many reactions--

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:43.810
so much equal to the reaction
when you're doing theater.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.480
It's so immediate
response you get.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.770
And that actually
excited me quite a lot,

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.930
the kind of reaction
I got for "Taandav."

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:57.440
And that made me, pushed
me towards making "Kriti."

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.550
I convinced Shirish
or Neeraj Pandey

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.530
to make two more
short films for me.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:08.560
But yes, I mean, you are also
pushing your limitations.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.870
The things that you
could not do in films,

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.040
you are getting to do
in those 15 minutes.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:13.600
So why not?

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.489
Just go ahead and give it a
try and learn some new things.

00:19:18.489 --> 00:19:20.530
SPEAKER 1: I think we have
a clip from "Taandav."

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.988
Could we please play that?

00:19:22.988 --> 00:19:23.980
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.452
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.230
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.554
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:06.554 --> 00:20:07.804
SPEAKER 1: That was excellent.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.850
That dance performance brought
to life the frustrations

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:15.560
of the character.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:22.574
And it felt very
improvised and spontaneous.

00:20:22.574 --> 00:20:23.990
So I just wanted
to know how you--

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.720
MANOJ BAJPAYEE:
Yeah, my director

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.970
wanted to do see as to
how I'm going to dance.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.400
I said, please don't do it.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.490
You just switch on the camera,
say action, I'll do it.

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:39.210
But it was a constable
who is constantly

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.200
getting pressurized by the
day to day life, the pressures

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.370
of the day to day life.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.730
And he doesn't know
how to deal with it.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.120
So this is the only way
he could just let it go.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:00.510
If you have seen the film, he's
about to have brain hemorrhage.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.510
If he'll not dance it out, he
will have a brain hemorrhage,

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.850
because he is getting
pressure from his duty,

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:07.670
getting pressure from his wife--

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.770
all of those things
are going on.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:15.450
And he doesn't know how to
just sort out his own life.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:20.520
And there comes this situation
where he just starts dancing.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.130
And after this, everything
gets sorted out.

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:23.842
[LAUGHING]

00:21:23.842 --> 00:21:25.050
SPEAKER 1: He gets suspended.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:28.080
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: [LAUGHING]

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.540
SPEAKER 1: So life is back.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.580
On the other end
of the spectrum,

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.290
your character in
"Zubeidaa," which

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:37.380
was based on a royal family--

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.610
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: I will
never say it on record.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.220
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.920
It was inspired, I should say.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.140
That is something
rooted in history,

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:51.810
and it had this grandeur and
this sort of stoicism to it.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:56.200
How did you feel doing
a movie like that?

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.850
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: Yeah, it was
difficult. Because Shyam Bapu,

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:01.020
I wanted to work with him.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.960
He's such a legendary
director of our country,

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.670
after the late [NON-ENGLISH].

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.280
And so many films
of his really--

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:17.810
they left such an impact on
me when I was doing theater,

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:21.360
or when I was growing
up in my small town.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.390
Those were the films, but they
were hardly available anywhere.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:28.630
One show somewhere in
[NON-ENGLISH] in Delhi.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:32.330
So you have to change
to two or three buses

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:35.580
to reach on time for the film.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.530
But somehow you manage to do it.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:43.920
And those films have really
inspired not only me,

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.180
but all the actors who were
doing theater those days.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.500
So it was a dream come true.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.020
And when he narrated
the role to me, I said,

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.320
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.980
So he said, first
of all, this role

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.156
was rejected by all the stars.

00:23:05.156 --> 00:23:07.470
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.880
And soon, I don't have any
other choice but to take you.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.350
But to keep you at
ease, I must tell you

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:23.060
that this is the photograph
of the prince on whose life it

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.055
is based on.

00:23:24.055 --> 00:23:25.430
Tell me who is
more good-looking.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.895
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.430
I said, definitely,
that gives me arrogance

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.370
to say that, yes, I'm much
more good-looking than him!

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:41.510
So he said, OK, so
you've got your answer.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:44.660
The one thing that
he wanted me to--

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:50.300
apart from learning
horseriding and learning polo--

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.510
that was a physically
tough thing,

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:53.870
but one could easily do it.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:57.950
For two months, three months
of practice, I have done it.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.080
But the most
difficult thing was I

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.680
was born in a farmer's family,
middle class farmer's family.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.630
I've never been to any palace.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:09.530
I've never known any
princely state people.

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:14.050
So I didn't know their behavior
pattern and their mental state.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:16.400
But some way, Shyam Bapu
has thought it out for me.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.570
He said, for a prince,
he takes it for granted

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:25.460
that anybody who'll come to
him will bow down before him.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:31.460
So you have it in your mind.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:36.290
Since the time you were
born, in that kind of family,

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.809
you know that if
you get into Google,

00:24:38.809 --> 00:24:40.850
the Google chairman will
be there to receive you.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:43.580
This is something
which is granted.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.890
This is not something that
you are going to think about.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.510
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I'll
definitely think about

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:50.910
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:59.360
I mean, that prince will--
when he will come here,

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.760
people will naturally
come to see him.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.420
People naturally
go to welcome him.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:11.256
This is what decides
their behavior pattern.

00:25:11.256 --> 00:25:15.410
So to get into the
zone of a prince's mind

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:16.850
was a difficult, difficult part.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:21.550
Because my body language--
it was never of a prince.

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:24.980
It was never up
of a feudal lord.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.960
Again, because I've
never seen them,

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.500
never sat with them,
never had dinner with them

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.820
or lunch with them.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:37.760
So to really get into the
mental zone of that character

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.420
was very, very difficult.
But somehow, Shyam Bapu has

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.567
helped me quite a lot
through all the shooting.

00:25:45.567 --> 00:25:47.400
SPEAKER 1: I think we
have a mic over there.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.810
I'm going to ask
one more question.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.518
So if there are folks
in the audience who

00:25:50.518 --> 00:25:53.190
would like to ask a question,
please go to the mic.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:57.480
You are working on your second
English film, "Love Sonia,"

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.725
which is releasing--

00:25:58.725 --> 00:26:02.400
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: Actually, "Love
Sonia" is not an English film.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.680
I've done two films--

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:10.902
they are produced and directed
by the people who are LA-based.

00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:13.530
"Love Sonia" is one
and "In the Shadows."

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.670
"In the Shadows" is
a film that I'm very,

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:23.390
very proud of, because
it shot in [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:27.770
And I would say that it's
the best film of my career,

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:28.730
"In the Shadows."

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.597
And according to me, that
is my best performance.

00:26:31.597 --> 00:26:33.680
People keep asking, what
is your best performance?

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.930
What is your best performance?

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:38.360
Somewhere, when the screening
was over of "In the Shadows,"

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:45.890
and I said, yes, finally, I give
myself some marks as an actor.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.590
Because when you are
watching your own film--

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:50.300
while people are
enjoying it, enjoying

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.040
your performance,
but as an actor,

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.930
you are always looking
at it differently.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.230
You are looking at
it very technically.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:00.930
And an actor can't
tell lies to himself.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.760
He's always thinking, I
could do better in that line.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.880
I could do a little
better in that sequence.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.190
So actor is never satisfied.

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:15.110
But "In the Shadows" is a film
where not only I was pretty

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:19.100
much taken aback by the craft
of the director and the story

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.160
writer, but also,
yes, I was quite happy

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.380
with my own performance.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.340
So, yes, I'm in "Love
Sonia" as the guy--

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.070
I didn't want to
do that character,

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:31.100
because it was very
discomforting for me

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.110
to play a brothel keeper.

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:39.840
Somebody who's initiating the
lead, who is a virgin girl--

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:46.120
she's gotten into
big city like Bombay.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:50.590
And straight away, she was
put into this brothel, which

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:51.820
I'm owning.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.510
And this guy is a ruthless guy,
but he talks very sweetly--

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:56.740
very sweetly, he talks.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.420
And he gets this girl
to do the stuff, which

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.800
is so, so scary for them.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.980
But he makes it easy for them.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.270
But he's dangerous, also--
very, very dangerous.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.620
If you go against his
rules, against him,

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.350
then you will see hell.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:16.420
All hell breaking loose.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:21.460
So I didn't want to do the film.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:26.310
David Womark, who is one of
the producers of "Life of Pi"--

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.160
he was kind of--

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.040
he was after me.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.750
He somehow-- I think all
American producers are

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.020
very, very good at convincing
people, the actors.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.380
So he somehow convinced
me to do this film.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.820
But I'm happy that
I'm part of it.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.060
Though I don't like
myself in the film,

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:50.490
because the character
that I played in this film

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:55.010
is something which
gives me creeps.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:59.130
But yes, I'm very happy that
these two films are ready.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:02.070
And they are going to
take festival routes,

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.660
and then they will be
releasing in India.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.092
SPEAKER 1: I think we have
an audience question here.

00:29:07.092 --> 00:29:08.250
AUDIENCE: Hi, Manoj.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:09.430
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: Hi.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.260
AUDIENCE: So arguably, two
of your most defining roles

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.332
have been Bhiku Mhatre
and Sardar Khan, right?

00:29:15.332 --> 00:29:16.790
What are some of
the challenges you

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:18.380
had while preparing
for these roles

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.140
and bringing such
reality to screen?

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:27.980
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: When I
was given Bhiku Mhatre,

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.460
I really didn't know
how to go about it.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.950
Because just before
Bhiku Mhatre,

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:38.090
a couple of years before
"Satya," [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:42.110
is a film that left
such a huge impact

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.810
on each and everybody's mind.

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:46.550
And all the actors
were completely

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:48.830
blown away by the performance
of Mr. [INAUDIBLE],,

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:52.580
who I personally think
is one of India's finest.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.880
And he's never gotten his due.

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:02.690
So when I was doing Bhiki
Mhatre, I was very scared.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:06.370
I always had this fear that I'm
going to have an [NON-ENGLISH]

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:10.217
kind of a syndrome while I'll
be playing the character.

00:30:10.217 --> 00:30:11.800
So I had to go
completely against him.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.790
So to prepare the role, I
went into the back story

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:17.050
of Bhiku Mhatre.

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.150
I prepared a back story
of Bhiku Mhatre, which

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:27.520
helped me to really sketch
out the approach or the method

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.500
to do that route.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:32.200
So that's how Bhiku
Mhatre happened.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.000
And also, Anurag Kashyap--

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.390
the script gives you a
lot of scope to improvise.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.000
And Ram those days
was very open.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.850
He said, just go ahead
and give it a try.

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:46.180
And if it is really
wrong, I'll cut it.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.370
Otherwise, I'm going
to keep everything.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:52.330
So all of these guys
together and the back story

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:55.150
of Bhiku Mhatre about
literally little things--

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:58.630
if I tell you, if you
remember the film--

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:04.120
like when I get into
the house of Bhau, who

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.600
was just played by Govind
Namdeo, I touched his feet.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:13.160
So Ram asked me, why
did you touch his feet?

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:18.000
So I said, in my back story,
after my father's death,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.750
he is somebody who helped
my mother, to bring me up.

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.870
And that's how I
am with him today.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:25.910
I'm working for him.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.320
So for me, he's like
a father figure.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.390
Oh, let me go for
a close-up then.

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.340
So he took a close-up of that.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.400
So that's how Bhiku
Mhatre kept on happening,

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.260
kept on shaping up everyday.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:42.370
It's never one person's effort.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.470
It's very collective.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.170
Sometimes directors
are so welcoming.

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:48.940
And they keep adding
little, little things

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.310
to your preparation,
which is amazing.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:57.820
And Sardar Khan-- when
I was hearing the script

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.720
from Anurag Kashyap,
he said, Bajpayee, I

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.110
don't want to see
Bhiku Mhatre in this.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.060
I said, this guy is not a mafia.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.660
He said, no, no, he's a mafia.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.840
I know, and for me,
he's a womanizer.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:16.270
So I have never treated Sardar
Khan as a dangerous guy.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:22.060
I treated him as somebody who
is always looking for cheap sex

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.090
all the time.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:27.190
So if you see the film,
that's how I prepared myself.

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:31.510
Even the body, the
raw sex appeal.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:34.950
I went for-- well,
I requested, Anurag,

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:40.790
please allow me to
have a bald head.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.627
And for a few days,
he was not ready.

00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:44.710
And suddenly one fine
morning, he got up, he said,

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:47.590
Bajpayee, let's go for it.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:52.060
So we have done everything
possible which could actually

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.240
enhance his raw sex appeal.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:01.120
And also, the way
he walks, the way

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.180
he talks to a woman, the
way he looks at a woman

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.730
is not something I
have ever experienced.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:11.230
So to get into the
zone, in one shot,

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.750
Anurag Kashyap said,
Durga is sitting there.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:14.650
She's making roti.

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:18.202
And you have to look at her
in the most perverse way.

00:33:18.202 --> 00:33:21.580
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:27.940
And that shot has become
quite a landmark for people.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.370
And they keep asking me,
how could you do that?

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:33.849
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:38.720
So yes, for that, you
have to be an actor.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.612
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:33:41.612 --> 00:33:44.504
[LAUGHING]

00:33:44.504 --> 00:33:49.150
I know, because there
are certain reactions.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:57.630
Every good actor, like
[INAUDIBLE] is sitting here--

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:00.639
in many ways, she's my senior.

00:34:00.639 --> 00:34:02.180
And she will agree
with me that there

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.480
are many, many of the actions
that an actor achieves,

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.529
and sometimes even actor doesn't
know that it actually happened.

00:34:09.529 --> 00:34:11.659
It actually-- it just happened.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:13.280
It just happened in that shot.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.510
It just happened.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.120
And everybody clapped.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.719
And every actor has this memory.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:23.895
And for that shot, I realize--

00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:27.104
I remember Anurag Kashyap
looking at the monitor.

00:34:27.104 --> 00:34:30.230
And he said cut, and
he came and hugged me.

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:33.639
And it just happened.

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:36.469
And if you asked me how
could I manage to do it?

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:38.659
The most perverse reaction?

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:40.670
Believe me, I have
never chased a girl.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.750
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:49.610
As a small village boy, I was
very scared of telling a girl,

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:50.586
"I like you."

00:34:50.586 --> 00:34:52.460
I always thought that
she's going to slap me.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.251
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:34:53.251 --> 00:34:57.110
So for many years, I
couldn't date a girl.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:00.470
So you are talking
to a person who

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:05.330
has this kind of a life story
and who has done Sardar Khan!

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:06.920
For me, he's quite
an achievement!

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.121
[LAUGHING]

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:13.520
SPEAKER 1: So it was interesting
to learn how you distinguish

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.860
Bhiku Mhatre being a
gangster and Sardar Khan

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:17.390
being a womanizer.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:20.900
What was your
character from "Aks"?

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.900
What were you thinking
of him in these terms?

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.520
How did you think
of his back story?

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.816
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: Rakeysh Mehra--

00:35:27.816 --> 00:35:29.480
he told me about the script.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.690
And then he said,
I don't want you

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.580
to play character in this film.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.150
I want you to play evil.

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:40.520
So evil is a metaphor.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:46.170
If I tell an actor,
you have to play evil--

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:48.980
now, evil has too
many facets to it.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.560
You can't just say
that evil is dangerous.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.730
Evil is most flamboyant.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:58.837
Evil is most attractive.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:06.660
A bottle of liquor is far
more fascinating looking than

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.770
a bottle of
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],, right?

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:13.710
So why they make it
fascinating looking?

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:18.610
So that you buy it,
and you drink it.

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:26.560
And if you get lured
very easily by any bar--

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:31.300
but when you get into a
bar, it's all dark, dungeon.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.750
You don't know when you're
going to come out of it.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:35.960
You want to come out.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.560
You want to say, this is
the time I should go back.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.270
This is a time I should
go back to sleep.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:42.130
But you don't come out.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.260
You keep on dancing.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.410
You keep on drinking.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.690
So that's evil.

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:52.130
So that was my point for the
characterization of "Aks."

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:57.130
So if you see the film,
he's very flamboyant.

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.940
He's a very good lover.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.130
He's very attractive.

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:03.470
That's why the long hair was.

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.610
He is sharp.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:08.550
But there is something very,
very dangerous about him.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:11.670
And that something
you only get to know

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.590
when he starts laughing.

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:17.520
That is the only sign where you
realize that this guy is not

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.330
trustworthy.

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:25.320
So that's how two, three
months of preparation

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.362
has gone into making Raghavan.

00:37:28.362 --> 00:37:30.570
SPEAKER 1: I think we have
another audience question.

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:31.470
AUDIENCE: Hi, Manoj.

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:32.500
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.230
I'm a huge fan of you.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:38.250
So my question is, these
days, a lot of period films,

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:41.250
biographies are
coming in Bollywood.

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:44.610
And you do a lot of research,
a lot of hard work for it all.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:48.180
So is there any famous figure
or historical personality

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.330
you easily identify with
yourself, and you have a dream,

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.144
or you want to play
that character?

00:37:54.144 --> 00:37:54.810
Do you have any?

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.240
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: I would
like to play Chanakya.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:56.943
AUDIENCE: Chanakya?

00:37:56.943 --> 00:37:59.109
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: Yeah, I
would like to play Chanakya.

00:37:59.109 --> 00:38:04.620
I really feel that he's the
biggest philosopher of all.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.240
And he's not been
read until now.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.060
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:14.760
That will give me a chance to
really do research on Chanakya,

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.710
who is known as Kautilya.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:21.540
So that will also give me a
chance to know all the text,

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.260
know everything about him.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.130
Because whatever little
that I know of him,

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:30.447
I think he's somebody who should
get his due by the filmmakers.

00:38:30.447 --> 00:38:31.280
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:36.624
SPEAKER 1: Another audience?

00:38:36.624 --> 00:38:37.290
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:40.560
This is more of a complaint.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:44.330
There are movies like
"Gangs of Wasseypur,"

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:46.550
"Aligarh," "Budhia
Singh" that did not get

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:47.665
released in the Bay Area.

00:38:47.665 --> 00:38:50.040
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: You are going
to talk something which I'm

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.340
going to answer very brutally.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.131
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:38:52.131 --> 00:38:53.220
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.630
And then you made a
very fine distinction

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.750
that there's a difference
between an actor and a star.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:01.470
The star gets all the
money, the actor doesn't.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:06.850
So what are you as an actor
trying to do to become a star?

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:09.740
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: See, you
have to understand one thing.

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:10.990
AUDIENCE: Can I say something?

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:11.690
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: Yeah, please.

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:13.148
AUDIENCE: I think
Manoj is probably

00:39:13.148 --> 00:39:16.055
one of those rare examples of
an actor who is truly a star.

00:39:16.055 --> 00:39:17.397
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:39:17.397 --> 00:39:18.480
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: Thank you!

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.450
Thank you.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:27.260
A star is when-- you
don't become a star.

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:30.200
I really feel that way.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.090
Stardom just happens to you.

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:41.640
But actor-- you have to really
work hard to become an actor.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.400
You can't work
hard to be a star.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:52.680
Stardom is not something which
can be achieved by hard work.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:53.640
All you can do is--

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.430
but I wanted to be part
of these kind of films.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:40:03.390
I always saw a dream where I'll
be playing these roles which

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:06.730
are in of our day to day life.

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:09.802
And they are the
heroes, whether it is

00:40:09.802 --> 00:40:11.430
Biranchi Das of "Budhia Singh."

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.975
When the news of "Budhia
Sing" was coming out,

00:40:16.975 --> 00:40:18.630
and he is going to
run the marathon,

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:22.260
it was covered widely
by all the channels.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:27.780
And I was quite fascinated
by this coach who was--

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:33.300
swich on one channel, he is
being regarded as the villain

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.140
by one channel.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:37.980
And he is being regarded as
hero on the other channel.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.390
So that interested me.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:43.410
I said, what a
personality this man is!

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:47.540
He's such a
contradiction in himself.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.290
Whenever I saw him
talking about Budhia,

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:54.852
I also saw a very arrogant
man and a very innocent man.

00:40:54.852 --> 00:40:59.100
So this combination of arrogance
and innocence of Biranchi Das

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:01.472
really attracted me.

00:41:01.472 --> 00:41:03.930
And when I was offered this
role, I immediately grabbed it.

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:07.310
I said, I must do this role.

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:09.030
There is a dream.

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:16.130
There is a dream that one
day, entire Indian audience

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:21.150
through all the world
will be standing

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.060
in queue to watch these films.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.770
There is a dream.

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:31.630
And I'm working on these films
with the dream in my mind.

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:32.730
It's not happening.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:35.980
Our audience is failing
us all the time.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.458
It's not the producers
who are failing us.

00:41:39.458 --> 00:41:41.810
It's the audience
who is failing us.

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:44.290
But should we fail ourselves?

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:46.160
No.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.060
We can't afford
to fail ourselves.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:53.020
We can only go on doing
what we believe in.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:58.480
We should go on
doing things that

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.330
will one day fulfill our dream.

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:02.600
Now, that dream doesn't die.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.890
Dream only dies when
[NON-ENGLISH] people die.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:07.300
This dream will always be there.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.140
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:16.180
Like you stand in queue and buy
the first day for sure ticket

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.950
for [NON-ENGLISH] film.

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:22.030
The dream is there that one
day, you'll be standing in queue

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:24.340
and buying the first
day for sure ticket

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.530
for those content-driven films.

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:28.270
That dream is there.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:34.630
And so many actors, so many
filmmakers are working on it.

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:38.000
They have the choice and options
of making other kind of films.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.750
But no, their
belief is into this.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:42.780
And kudos to them.

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.460
They sacrifice so many other--

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.470
there are so many other
comfortable things to do this.

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:56.040
So the day audience
will wake up,

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.320
the day they start
going to the theater

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:03.630
to watch these films, that
will be the day you will start

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:08.670
seeing a different
kind of a change coming

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:09.960
in the Indian industry.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.470
And then Indian industry
will become a global force.

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:16.410
Because until the time we
are not focusing on content,

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:20.118
we can't compete with
the world cinema.

00:43:20.118 --> 00:43:24.405
We will always be
regarded as Bollywood.

00:43:24.405 --> 00:43:24.905
Bollywood.

00:43:24.905 --> 00:43:27.920
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.540
So stars-- they get money.

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.390
And rightly so, because
their films are doing well.

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:38.990
And producers are ready to
invest money into their films,

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:40.670
rightly so.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.721
But should we stop
doing our job?

00:43:42.721 --> 00:43:43.220
No.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.950
We should be doing what we are
good at, or what we believe in.

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.770
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:56.180
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.917
First of all, welcome
to Google, Manoji.

00:43:57.917 --> 00:43:59.000
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: Thank you.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.333
AUDIENCE: And I hope you have
a wonderful evening in San

00:44:01.333 --> 00:44:04.520
Francisco, since it's your
first time in the Bay Area.

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.130
My question was around--

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:11.040
obviously, it was very
inspiring to hear your story.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.730
It seems like you're a
very hardworking actor.

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:15.290
You've learned a lot--

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:18.410
not just languages, but
a lot you've picked up

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:21.300
in the due course of your life.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:24.290
There's one thing which I
have noted in your movies--

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:25.400
very offbeat.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.070
You have played very
different roles.

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:30.650
I really liked the
diverse roles you

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:34.970
played in "Aligarh," in
"Gangs of Wasseypur,"

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:37.790
and in "Special 26."

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:41.180
I wanted to ask if there is
a way, or advice that you

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:47.540
would give people within Google,
how to spark their creativity.

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:51.890
If you can just talk towards
how you've experienced that.

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:54.920
Obviously, there is a story
which the director brings

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.430
to you, but you, as an actor,
also add a lot of creativity

00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:59.300
into it.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:02.150
So any advice for us
on how to really spark

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:05.934
that creativity in
each one of our jobs?

00:45:05.934 --> 00:45:07.850
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: Thank
you very much for asking

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:12.110
this question, but the one
thing I always stay away from--

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:12.770
giving advice.

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:14.300

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:19.730
I was listening to
[INAUDIBLE] one day.

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:22.460
And he said,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.874
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:30.290
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:37.286
I'll try to answer you
through my own preparation,

00:45:37.286 --> 00:45:39.327
how to spark your creativity.

00:45:44.654 --> 00:45:49.260
I personally-- I can
consider myself a rebel.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.130
I get up in the morning.

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:58.780
And if I think of going
in the park alone,

00:45:58.780 --> 00:45:59.960
I don't listen to my wife.

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:03.590
I just go in the park.

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:10.300
Sometime I think of taking
my daughter in the market.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.070
I immediately do it.

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:16.730
Listening to your
heart, not your mind.

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:23.100
Listening to your heart
is the beginning point.

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:29.430
Judgment-- judging people.

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:31.500
I don't judge them.

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.770
I don't [NON-ENGLISH].

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:36.400
I don't judge my characters,
the characters I play.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.040
I don't judge.

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:47.100
And somewhere, these are
all the morality issue.

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:47.975
These are the issues.

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:57.610
There must be some points where
I must not be compromising on.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:02.630
But I don't look at
people's life or the world

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:04.860
with any kind of judgment.

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:10.310
I don't sit on a pedestal
and look at people's life,

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:12.830
or look at people and the world.

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:16.240
I am always listening.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:31.120
to anybody who is unknown, who
is giving abuses on Twitter.

reading, listening, absorbing.

your eyes and ears open--

I'm letting everything
come into me.

The moment I finish
the shot, and if you

ask me to just go back again,
I'll have to again memorize it.

So [CLEARING THROAT].

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:16.060
Because I have taken--

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:24.830
I actually learned a lot from
[NON-ENGLISH] rhythm of his

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:25.670
speech.

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:29.210
I learned a lot, because--

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.117
I keep listening
to [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:36.980
Or there are many other
leaders or many saints, so

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.270
many speakers.

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:46.130
Because they really help you
in formatting a speech pattern.

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:49.730
So with the
"Raajneeti" dialogue,

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:55.040
that speech was actually mainly
I have put in all the things

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.040
that I've learned from
Mr. [NON-ENGLISH] speech.

00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:02.250
So if you remember that--

00:50:08.646 --> 00:50:10.680
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:29.360
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:37.010
This was actually taken from

speech pattern.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.652
And that I have put into this.

00:50:40.652 --> 00:50:42.000
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.130
So I'm very bad.

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:47.310
If you tell me to say any
dialogue that you remember,

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:50.840
I will just say it.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.780
I'm very bad with it.

00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.910
One thing I really admire
about [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:59.930
that he remembers
all his dialogues.

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:05.600
And anytime you ask him to say
any dialogue from any film,

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.560
he just says it.

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:11.171
That skill-- I don't have it.

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:13.740

AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:25.290
He was the great
actor in the '80s.

00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:26.010
We knew him.

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:27.560
We knew [NON-ENGLISH].

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:32.620
And across the aisle, we had
Smita Patil and [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:35.490
These days, we have
[NON-ENGLISH] and Nawazuddin

00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:37.360
Siddiqui-- you, of course.

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.940
And who's across the aisle?

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:43.410
And if there's nobody
really strong over there,

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:45.352
why is the case?

00:51:45.352 --> 00:51:46.560
MANOJ BAJPAYEE: Actually, no.

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:48.440
I disagree with you.

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:50.850
Konkona is very good.

00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:55.380
And one actress sitting
here, so you can't say it.

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:56.900
Pallavi is there.

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.390
Konkona.

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:04.020
Kangana, I think, is a
remarkable growth as an actor.

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:08.850
Kangana's journey actually
is quite inspiring,

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:13.120
not only for the female
actors, but also male actors.

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.970
Because you can really
educate yourself.

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:17.340
You can actually create
a discipline for yourself

00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:20.190
without getting into
any kind of institute

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:21.720
and become a very good actor.

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:24.460
Kangana is a very
good example for it.

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:29.510
So there are so many actresses.

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:32.080
Why we only remember
Smita Patil?

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.110
Because she left us very soon.

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:37.690
And we wanted to
see more of her.

00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:43.790
So that longing of seeing
more of her is still there.

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:46.650
[NON-ENGLISH] is
a great actress.

00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:50.210
[NON-ENGLISH] of that
time, [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:52.200
There are so many
other actresses.

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.820
But yes, it would have been
fantastic if she was around.

00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:56.840
We miss her.

00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:01.010
And that's why we keep thinking
that we don't have somebody

00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:03.980
like her, because
she was Smita Patil.

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:08.220
Definitely, we will never
have anybody like Smita Patil.

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:10.370
But at the same
time, I really feel

00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:14.540
that there are so many
fascinating actresses working

00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:19.170
in our time that we
can learn so much from.

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:22.660
And they are doing
films, and they

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:26.970
are performing on their
own terms and conditions.

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:32.041
