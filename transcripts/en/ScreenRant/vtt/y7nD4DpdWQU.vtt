00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.019
Even when the pieces are in place for a film,
nothing is set in stone until the finished

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.380
product enters theaters.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.299
As a project makes the transition from page
to screen, there can be several revisions

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.670
as the filmmakers try to get everything right.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.810
Sometimes this just entails rewriting a few
pages of the script, or it can be something

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.510
more drastic like replacing an actor before
shooting.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.429
Then there are instances where there has to
be a change of director – occasionally when

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.439
the movie is already in principal photography.

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.119
It happens more often than you might thing.

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.440
Here are 10 movies that changed directors
during production.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.440
Ant-Man

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.280
Fans of Marvel and comedy films in general
were excited when it was announced Edgar Wright

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.429
of Scott Pilgrim and Cornetto trilogy fame
would be calling the shots on the first Ant-Man

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:46.429
film.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.269
Wright had spent years developing the movie
and even shot test footage that impressed

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:50.269
audiences at Comic-Con.

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.340
But just before it was time to start rolling
the cameras, Wright chose to step down, citing

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.859
creative differences with the studio.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.399
Peyton Reed stepped in on late notice, and
delivered a solidly entertaining installment.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.989
Wright still received credit for the screenplay,
so at least part of his voice remained intact.

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.540
The Wizard of Oz

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.710
It’s one of the most beloved films of all-time
now, but back when it was being made, The

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.850
Wizard of Oz was a nightmare behind the scenes.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.610
The project had four directors come in at
various points.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.300
Richard Thorpe started but was replaced when
the studio felt he was rushing the production.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.470
George Cukor ironed things out for a while,
and then passed the torch to Victor Fleming.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.960
King Vidor had to take over for the final
stages of production when Fleming was tasked

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.140
with aiding Gone With the Wind.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.590
Despite what definitely should have been too
many cooks in the kitchen, The Wizard of Oz

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.580
went on to earn widespread acclaim.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.580
Gone With the Wind

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.390
Here’s another Hollywood classic that had
several issues making its way to the big screen.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.000
Originally, George Cukor was to helm it, but
he left after disagreements over the pacing

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and tone.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.060
Victor Fleming took over the reigns, but had
to leave shortly after due to exhaustion.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.700
Sam Wood was the one who finished the job
and ended up delivering one of the greatest

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.100
movies ever made.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.340
It won 8 Oscars – including Fleming for
Best Director – and is the highest-grossing

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.500
film of all-time when adjusted for inflation.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.780
What could have been a doomed film became
a masterpiece that many enjoyed.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.780
The Hobbit

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.660
Peter Jackson made a name for himself by adapting
the Lord of the Rings trilogy to film, but

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.660
he initially was not going to be the one calling
the shots on The Hobbit.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.310
That honor was to fall to Guillermo del Toro,
who was coming off the hit Pan’s Labyrinth.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.750
The fan-favorite director spent two years
doing pre-production work before he stepped

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.470
away due to numerous delays.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.980
Jackson was the one who took over, and while
that sounded good at the time, his decision

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.540
to stretch The Hobbit from a two-part movie
to three drew the ire of fans.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.460
We’ll never know what del Toro’s version
would have looked like, and it could have

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.460
been better.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.460
Moneyball

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.080
This small-scale sports film encountered quite
the drama behind the scenes that drastically

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.780
changed the format of the picture.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.750
Original director Steven Soderbergh wanted
to present Moneyball as a documentary style

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.600
film, even shooting interviews with real life
athletes, which didn’t make executives happy.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.700
Coming up with a new approach, they brought
in Bennett Miller to handle the project as

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.460
a more straightforward narrative film.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.100
Sony had to end up paying two directors and
two screenwriters to get the product they

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.010
wanted, but it paid off, as Moneyball was
one of 2011’s best-reviewed films.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.010
Ratatouille

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.930
Brad Bird gave fans a wonderful superhero
tale in The Incredibles, and it turns out

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.920
the director is something of a superhero himself.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.350
When Pixar was developing Ratatouille, Jan
Pinkava was originally on board to direct,

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.819
but the studio was concerned his version didn’t
have a strong chance to be commercially successful.

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.260
Pinkava was removed from the project and replaced
by Bird, who had just 18 months to completely

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.210
overhaul several aspects of the film.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.760
Luckily, Bird cracked the winning formula,
and the Ratatouille that was released became

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.140
his second massive hit for Pixar and won an
Oscar for Best Animated Feature.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.140
Superman II

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.590
Long before the shared universe phenomenon,
director Richard Donner was planning multiple

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.490
installments of his Superman series.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.781
His plan was the shoot the first two films
of the franchise at the same time, and he

00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:49.340
made his way through 75% of the production
on Superman II before he had to focus on post

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.340
for the first film.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.530
Even though 1978’s Superman was a hit, Donner
was kicked off the sequel due to budgetary

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.790
and tone concerns.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.180
Richard Lester took over, with the intention
of making the movie lighter and campier.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.780
It was a controversial decision, and Gene
Hackman refused to take part in the Lester

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.780
reshoots.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.850
Superman II was successful, but the debate
over which version is better will never end.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.850
Spartacus

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.880
All legends get their start somewhere, and
Stanley Kubrick had his big shot at fame thanks

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.069
to Kirk Douglas.

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.019
While filming Spartacus, Douglas, who was
also executive producer on the film, felt

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.669
that original director Anthony Mann was overwhelmed
by the scope of the project and unfit for

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.810
bringing it to the screen.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.650
He made the decision to replace Mann with
Kubrick, even though Spartacus would be Kubrick’s

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.539
most expansive production at the time.

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.441
Nevertheless, Douglas’ judgment proved correct
and Kubrick helmed a standout entry in the

00:04:33.441 --> 00:04:38.449
swords-and-sandles genre, launching a career
full of ambitious and large ideas.

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:39.449
Layer Cake

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.610
Guy Ritchie’s calling card is the slick
British crime film, and he could have had

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.389
another one under his belt if the original
plan for Layer Cake stayed in place.

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.540
Ritchie was going to helm the film, but he
had to step away as he was still dealing with

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.699
the aftermath of his flop Swept Away and trying
to save his marriage to pop star Madonna.

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.189
Ritchie let his friend Matthew Vaughn take
over, and Vaughn used the film to announce

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:58.710
himself as a filmmaking force.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.650
He’s helmed such hits as X-Men: First Class
and Kingsman in the years since, and star

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.490
Daniel Craig went on to headline four James
Bond films following his performance.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.050
The Legend of Tarzan

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.729
Veteran Harry Potter director David Yates
remained on this reboot throughout production,

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.960
but troubles began once the film entered post.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.750
According to reports last year, Yates had
begun filming Fantastic Beasts and Where to

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.569
Find Them before Tarzan was complete.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.110
Though Warner Bros. was concerned with the
quality of Tarzan, they wouldn’t pull Yates

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.250
off of Fantastic Beasts since the Harry Potter
spinoff is the greater priority to them.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.689
The studio maintains all is well, but it’s
certainly an unusual situation.

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:33.990
Typically directors will make sure one movie
is in the bag before moving on to the next

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.990
one.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.159
Hopefully both of Yates’ 2016 efforts are
memorable.

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:40.949
These are just some of the films that had
to change their director before it held its

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:41.949
premiere.

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:42.949
Are there any we missed?
