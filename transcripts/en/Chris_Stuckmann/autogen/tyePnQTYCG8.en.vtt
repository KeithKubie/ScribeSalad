this there are alternate theories but
just the fact that Richard Kelly has

talked so much about it and that book
 

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.460
talked so much about it and that book
itself leads me to subscribe to that

maybe it's a time loop going over and
 

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.650
maybe it's a time loop going over and
over again and Donnie just has to keep

over again and Donnie just has to keep

there's way too many plot holes for that

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:49.620
there's way too many plot holes for that
 

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.199
there's way too many plot holes for that
to make sense to me one of my biggest

00:08:51.199 --> 00:08:51.209
to make sense to me one of my biggest
 

00:08:51.209 --> 00:08:52.910
to make sense to me one of my biggest
issues with that is that the notion that

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920
issues with that is that the notion that
 

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.620
issues with that is that the notion that
everyone in this tangent universe is

everyone in this tangent universe is
just kind of acting or in a play

basically to get Donnie to do things I
don't view it like that at all I think

don't view it like that at all I think
they think they are in a real world and

do like when Drew Barrymore is in her

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:09.810
do like when Drew Barrymore is in her
 

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.139
do like when Drew Barrymore is in her
class and she's like cellar-door are the

00:09:12.139 --> 00:09:12.149
class and she's like cellar-door are the
 

00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:13.639
class and she's like cellar-door are the
two most beautiful words in the English

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:13.649
two most beautiful words in the English
 

00:09:13.649 --> 00:09:15.290
two most beautiful words in the English
language and then later

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.300
language and then later
 

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.389

Donnie finds his cellar door knows he

00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.399
Donnie finds his cellar door knows he
 

00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:19.370
Donnie finds his cellar door knows he
has to go in there like those things I

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:19.380
has to go in there like those things I
 

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.600
has to go in there like those things I
don't think Drew Barrymore was just

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:20.610
don't think Drew Barrymore was just
 

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.130
don't think Drew Barrymore was just
waiting for him with those words on the

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:22.140
waiting for him with those words on the
 

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.990
waiting for him with those words on the
board I think somebody made her do that

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000
board I think somebody made her do that
 

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.759
board I think somebody made her do that
but she didn't look at it like I'm in a

00:09:25.759 --> 00:09:25.769
but she didn't look at it like I'm in a
 

00:09:25.769 --> 00:09:27.740
but she didn't look at it like I'm in a
play or I'm in a weird world where I'm

forcing Donnie to do things or Gretchen
 

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.920
forcing Donnie to do things or Gretchen
for instance I think she really is

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:30.930
for instance I think she really is
 

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.650
