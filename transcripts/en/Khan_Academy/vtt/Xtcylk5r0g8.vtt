00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.409
- Let's get some practice

00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:03.603
identifying equivalent expressions.

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:06.180
So I have an expression written here in yellow

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.549
and then I have two more written in this light green color.

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:10.652
And I want you to pause this video and see if you can

00:00:10.652 --> 00:00:12.870
figure out which of these expressions,

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.715
and it's possible that neither of them are,

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:18.326
which of these are equivalent to the one in yellow.

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:20.649
So I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:22.561
So the way I like to tackle it is just

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:24.639
to simplify all of them as much as possible.

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:27.324
So this one up here is clearly not that simplified.

00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:29.551
So let's distribute this two.

00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:32.123
So if I distribute the two, what does it become?

00:00:32.123 --> 00:00:36.703
This is equal to two times negative six-C, is negative 12-C.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:40.609
Two times positive three is positive six.

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.100
And then we have plus four-C, plus four-C.

00:00:44.775 --> 00:00:46.689
And then we can simplify it further

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:49.138
cause I have both of these terms that involve C.

00:00:49.138 --> 00:00:52.963
I have negative 12-C plus four-C.

00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:54.402
So what's that going to be?

00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:57.692
Negative 12 of something plus four of something

00:00:57.692 --> 00:00:59.352
is going to be negative eight of that something.

00:00:59.352 --> 00:01:01.880
So this is going to be equal to negative eight-C.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.306
So these two blue terms when I add them,

00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:05.804
I'm going to get negative eight-C.

00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:07.584
And then finally plus six.

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:09.501
Plus six.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.637
Now just doing that that's exactly

00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:14.518
what this first green expression is.

00:01:14.518 --> 00:01:16.888
So this one is definitely, this one is

00:01:16.888 --> 00:01:18.583
definitely going to be equivalent.

00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:20.662
Now what about this one down here?

00:01:20.662 --> 00:01:22.848
Well to figure that out let's simplify it.

00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:24.536
So let's distribute the three.

00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:27.751
Three times negative four-C is negative 12-C.

00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:31.593
Three times positive two is positive six.

00:01:31.593 --> 00:01:35.848
So plus six and then we have the plus four-C over there.

00:01:35.848 --> 00:01:37.521
It's lookin' good.

00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:41.164
And then we can add the terms that involve C.

00:01:41.164 --> 00:01:44.995
Negative 12-C and four-C, you add those together,

00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:47.231
you're gonna get negative eight-C.

00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:49.283
Negative eight-C plus six.

00:01:50.353 --> 00:01:54.454
Plus six, which is exactly what these other ones are.

00:01:54.454 --> 00:01:57.864
So all of these, all of these expressions,

00:01:57.864 --> 00:01:59.584
are actually equivalent.

00:01:59.584 --> 00:02:01.686
This one, that one, and that one.

00:02:01.686 --> 00:02:03.414
Let's do another example.

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.403
And just like the last time pause the video

00:02:06.403 --> 00:02:08.737
and see which of these two expressions,

00:02:08.737 --> 00:02:10.490
it could be both of them or it could be none of them,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.583
or it could be one of them.

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:13.871
Which of them, if any, are equivalent

00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:15.668
to this yellow expression?

00:02:16.316 --> 00:02:17.924
Alright let's do it together.

00:02:17.924 --> 00:02:19.778
And like before let's just simplify it.

00:02:19.778 --> 00:02:22.582
So the first thing my brain wants to do

00:02:22.582 --> 00:02:26.593
is let's take the terms involving N and add those together.

00:02:26.593 --> 00:02:29.962
So negative six of something, in this case N,

00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:31.749
plus four of that something, in that case N.

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.177
So negative six-N plus four-N that's gonna leave you

00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:35.687
with negative two of that something.

00:02:35.687 --> 00:02:36.586
You add the coefficients.

00:02:36.586 --> 00:02:39.922
Negative six plus four is negative two Ns.

00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:43.054
So we have negative two-N, and then plus negative 12,

00:02:43.054 --> 00:02:45.235
that's the same thing as just minus 12.

00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:48.123
So minus, minus 12.

00:02:48.123 --> 00:02:50.913
So I simplified our original expression.

00:02:50.913 --> 00:02:53.600
Let's see these ones, these down here.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.279
So if I distribute the four, if I distribute the four

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.181
I get four times N is four-N.

00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:03.373
And then four times negative three is minus 12.

00:03:03.373 --> 00:03:06.047
And then we are going to subtract six-N.

00:03:06.804 --> 00:03:09.576
So minus six-N.

00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:10.667
So what does this give us?

00:03:10.667 --> 00:03:13.354
We get, let me get another color here.

00:03:13.354 --> 00:03:16.599
So we have four-N, I'm adding all the terms with N,

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.499
minus six-N, that's gonna give us negative two-N.

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:22.624
And then we have the minus 12.

00:03:22.624 --> 00:03:25.115
And then we have the minus 12.

00:03:25.115 --> 00:03:27.359
So this expression when I simplify it got me

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.170
the exact same place as the first expression.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.034
So these two, these two are equivalent.

00:03:32.034 --> 00:03:33.485
This is equivalent to that.

00:03:33.485 --> 00:03:35.196
Now let's check this one out.

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:37.603
So two, let me just distribute,

00:03:37.603 --> 00:03:39.901
let me just distribute the two.

00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:41.944
Two times two-N is four-N.

00:03:41.944 --> 00:03:45.576
And then two times negative six is negative 12.

00:03:45.576 --> 00:03:49.440
So this simplified to four-N minus 12 which is clearly

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.261
different than negative two-N minus 12.

00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:54.359
So this one, this one,

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.006
is not the same as the other two.
