00:00:06.298 --> 00:00:08.563
On August 21, 2017

00:00:08.587 --> 00:00:09.722
the shadow of the Moon will pass

00:00:09.746 --> 00:00:12.382
from the west coast
to the east coast of the U.S.

00:00:12.406 --> 00:00:14.168
Our blue sky will turn black as night

00:00:14.192 --> 00:00:15.235
and fill with stars,

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:16.476
and there will be a hole in the sky

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.022
where the Sun used to be,

00:00:18.046 --> 00:00:20.434
surrounded by the fiery
ring of the Sun's corona,

00:00:20.458 --> 00:00:22.517
a total eclipse of the Sun.

00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:24.256
This will truly be a historic event.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.526
Accounts of solar eclipses

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.497
date way back on the written record.

00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:29.069
The early Mesopotamians wrote

00:00:29.093 --> 00:00:30.618
that the Sun was put to shame

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:33.667
during the solar eclipse
of the 14th century B.C.E.

00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:34.788
and it may have started

00:00:34.812 --> 00:00:37.642
the Sun worship of the Egyptian
pharaoh Akhenaten.

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.105
Ancient Chinese astrologers
paid with their lives

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.177
if they failed to predict
the solar eclipse

00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:44.011
and portend the fate of their emperors

00:00:44.035 --> 00:00:45.587
whose symbol was the Sun.

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:48.231
The earliest date of a specific
event in human history,

00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:50.594
a battle between the armies
of Lydia and Media,

00:00:50.618 --> 00:00:53.807
occurred on May 28, 535 B.C.E.

00:00:53.831 --> 00:00:55.736
when a solar eclipse caused the soldiers

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.853
to lay down their arms
and declare a truce.

00:00:57.877 --> 00:00:59.435
So how does it happen?

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:01.394
During a total solar eclipse,

00:01:01.418 --> 00:01:04.045
the Moon moves
between the Earth and the Sun.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.158
When this happens, the disc of the Moon

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:08.610
appears to perfectly cover
the disc of the Sun

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:11.373
even though the Sun is much
larger than the Moon.

00:01:11.397 --> 00:01:12.996
But how is this possible?

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.064
The Sun is 400 times bigger than the Moon,

00:01:15.088 --> 00:01:16.120
but by sheer coincidence,

00:01:16.144 --> 00:01:18.776
the Moon is 390 times closer to Earth.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.701
Size and distance cancel each other out

00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:22.202
so that the Moon and Sun appear

00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:24.485
to be almost the exactly same size.

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.321
Every time the Moon orbits the Earth,

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:28.753
once every 27.3 days,

00:01:28.777 --> 00:01:31.276
it has to pass
between the Earth and the Sun,

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.423
a stage called the new moon phase.

00:01:33.447 --> 00:01:34.984
And every time it passes,

00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:38.014
the New Moon has a chance
to block out the Sun.

00:01:38.038 --> 00:01:39.056
Most of the time,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.307
the Moon passes a little above

00:01:40.331 --> 00:01:41.765
or a little below the Sun,

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.384
but if they align perfectly,

00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:44.539
the shadow of the Moon

00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:46.392
will make a narrow path across Earth

00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:49.466
and those in the shadows
will see a total solar eclipse.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.362
Just like on night side of the Earth,

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:53.244
the sky during a total eclipse is black

00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:54.579
and filled with stars.

00:01:54.603 --> 00:01:56.367
But while the moon perfectly covers

00:01:56.391 --> 00:01:57.503
the surface of the Sun,

00:01:57.527 --> 00:01:59.813
it doesn't block
out the Sun's outer atmosphere,

00:01:59.837 --> 00:02:02.083
its corona, which appears as a fiery ring

00:02:02.107 --> 00:02:05.143
around the dark disc of the moon.

00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:07.668
Solar eclipses occur several times a year,

00:02:07.692 --> 00:02:09.413
but most often they are partial eclipses

00:02:09.437 --> 00:02:11.915
where the Moon doesn't quite
line up with the Sun.

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.584
And, when the Moon and Sun
are perfectly aligned,

00:02:14.608 --> 00:02:16.391
the Moon is usually too far
from Earth in its orbit

00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:17.849
to completely cover the Sun,

00:02:17.873 --> 00:02:20.140
creating an annular eclipse.

00:02:20.164 --> 00:02:22.355
During an annular or partial eclipse,

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.770
the sky remains bright.

00:02:23.794 --> 00:02:26.271
Even on those rare occasions
of a total eclipse,

00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:28.200
the Moon's shadow is most likely to fall

00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:30.529
on the 70% of Earth
that is covered by water,

00:02:30.553 --> 00:02:33.661
and few people, if any, will see it.

00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:37.038
The eclipse of 2017 will be
remarkable on a larger scale

00:02:37.062 --> 00:02:39.580
because the Moon is slowly
moving away from Earth.

00:02:39.604 --> 00:02:42.147
If a furry ancestor of ours
had bothered to look up

00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:44.717
during a solar eclipse
a hundred million years ago,

00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:47.075
it wouldn't have seen
the fiery corona of the Sun.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.480
It would have just been dark.

00:02:48.504 --> 00:02:51.124
Eventually, the Moon will have
moved too far from Earth

00:02:51.148 --> 00:02:53.218
to completely cover the disc of the Sun.

00:02:53.242 --> 00:02:55.719
It is only during our little wink
of Earth's history

00:02:55.743 --> 00:02:57.791
that the Moon is at just
the right distance

00:02:57.815 --> 00:02:59.302
to cause a total solar eclipse

00:02:59.326 --> 00:03:01.485
yet not block the Sun's corona.

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:04.146
So on August 21, 2017,

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.218
when the Moon exactly
lines up with the Sun

00:03:06.242 --> 00:03:08.242
and the Moon is close enough to the Earth,

00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:09.879
its shadow will cross the U.S.

00:03:09.903 --> 00:03:11.999
and, if you happen to be
in its narrow path,

00:03:12.023 --> 00:03:13.166
you will witness one of the most

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.730
awe-inspiring sights in the universe.

00:03:15.754 --> 00:03:18.208
But, as incredible as this event will be,

00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:20.756
total eclipses
are one of the most dangerous as well.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.277
Only specially tinted filters,

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:24.254
specifically designed to observe the Sun,

00:03:24.278 --> 00:03:25.397
should be used.

00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:27.497
The eclipse might put the Sun to shame,

00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:28.873
but even a shamed Sun

00:03:28.897 --> 00:03:30.687
can seriously damage your eyes.
