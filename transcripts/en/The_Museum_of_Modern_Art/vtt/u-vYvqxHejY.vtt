00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.860
We're here in the Atrium of the Museum of
Modern Art.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.191
My name is Deborah Wye and I'm the Chief Curator
Emerita of Prints and Illustrated Books, here

00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:10.710
at the Museum.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.820
And the display that you're looking at in
the Atrium is part of an exhibition called

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.890
“Louise Bourgeois: An Unfolding Portrait.”

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.440
It begins here in the atrium and extends up
into the third floor galleries.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.109
It's bittersweet for me to have done this
exhibition since Louise died in 2010, it would've

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.040
been wonderful to have her here to see it,
but I knew she couldn't live forever.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.180
But in the first exhibition that we did in
1982, she used to come in on the weekends

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.680
and move things around, and the guards would
try to stop her and she’d say

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.020
"But I'm the artist!"

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.690
I decided to put a recording of her voice
at the entrance of the exhibition, where she's

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.960
singing a song that she wrote, and it's a
kind of funny rap song with French words,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.390
about the power of men and women and the fact that men have more power than women.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.000
I hear her voice and I think she's here.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.570
So, it's a nice touch for me.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.630
Can you hear Louise?

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.950
That makes me really happy.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.630
Oh, and here's a picture of her at the printing
press.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.820
That printing press was in the basement of
her brownstone in Chelsea, which was her home

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.670
studio and she had two printing presses down
there.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.170
And she also had a table for a seamstress
that she employed full-time with two sewing

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.630
machines to work on her fabric works, so her
home on 20th Street really became a workshop,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.570
just like her mother had had that workshop
for tapestries.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.320
We're in the section of the exhibition devoted
to architecture and we call it “Architecture

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.320
Embodied.”

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.430
And the whole exhibition is divided into thematic
sections.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.159
I call them “visual metaphors” that Bourgeois
came back to again and again.

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:11.360
She was motivated by emotional struggles and
she came up with a visual imagery that would

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.940
help her deal with these emotional struggles.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:22.600
So, architecture is very solid and she saw
it as source of strength and something that

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.790
would be stable for her.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.980
It wasn't just the building, this was a person
or a symbol of a person.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.950
So, if you saw a skyscraper like this by itself,
that meant it was a lonely person.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.800
If you saw two beside each other, that was
a couple.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.900
And since they were separated, they were probably
estranged.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.050
This is the way she would talk about this
imagery.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.490
You see a third one, and she says, "That's
a triangle."

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.459
There's a lot of jealousy going on here.

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.130
She calls the texts in this book parables
and they're wonderful stories.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.130
Sometimes they're about loneliness—there’s
one about a girl who went on a date and she

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.490
was stood up.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.020
Another one's about a son who leaves his mother
and slams the door and never comes back.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.090
Another one's about a person who loses his
hearing and then becomes isolated because

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.160
of that.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.130
And another one's very violent about a husband
who cuts up his wife and cooks her into a

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.630
stew and serves her at a dinner party.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.660
Here she was a struggling artist and she thought
by making an illustrated book and making

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.250
an edition of over fifty, she could distribute
this book and get well known.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.930
It was like a way to get known in the art
world, but it turned out that it wasn't a

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.709
success at all, and only a few of them were
ever really sold.

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.770
When she made the book “He Disappeared Into
Complete Silence,” the buildings that she

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.569
depicted hinted at sculptures that she would
make soon.

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.319
And once she started making sculpture, she
stopped making paintings and printings or

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.550
prints all together.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.569
She just really devoted herself to sculpture,
because she said that sculpture was much more

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.590
tangible and that she could feel her emotions
much more vividly in sculpture.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.940
This is a sculpture called “Portrait of
Jean-Louis,” and that's a portrait of her son.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.040
And at this point, Bourgeois was traveling
in pretty elevated intellectual and cultural

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.709
circles in New York.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.680
Her husband, Robert Goldwater, was a very
highly respected art historian.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.120
And some of the people she associated with
were architects, including Le Corbusier, who she befriended.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.740
And Le Corbusier is known for an architectural
feature of “piloti,” which is like stilts.

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:37.409
And you see them everywhere.

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:43.499
A building that's raised and has columns at
the bottom, like pillars and then the glass

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:45.529
box rises above it.

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:49.830
So, here I think she's making reference to
Le Corbusier with these two legs.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.539
Years later, talking about this sculpture,
she said, "I wanted my son to be as beautiful

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:57.849
as the skyscrapers here."

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.039
So, it's very touching.

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.699
We're now in the section of the exhibition
called “Fabric of Memory,” and I mentioned

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.529
that Bourgeois was raised in a family of tapestry
restorers.

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:14.940
But she didn't turn to fabric for her work
until she was in her 80s, and that was in the 1990s.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.479
She never like to throw anything away and
her assistant had said something that I think

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:26.189
rings really true, and that is he said that
she probably thought that if she started to

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:30.530
make sculptures out of all these old clothes,
then they could never be thrown away.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:38.240
And one of the prides of the MoMA collection
is this fabric book called “Ode à l'Oubli,”

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.440
or “Ode to Forgetting.”

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.889
And what she did, is she folded the hand towels
in two and sewed them at the binding, and

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.419
then she filled them with fabric collages.

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.550
And we've here put examples of these fabric
collages here on the walls.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.800
And these collages are made up of bits of
her old garments.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.509
And by putting them in the book, it becomes
like a scrapbook, like a memory book.

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:05.699
Like, she could look at any particular page
and remember, "Oh, I might've worn that dress

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:10.990
to such and such, a party," or "That was the
scarf I got for Christmas from my husband."

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.349
I'm just making up those examples but I think
that's the way she felt about them.

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.750
In this case, we're really lucky because we
had Louise Bourgeois herself, turning the

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.750
pages of a book.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.469
Oh, I think she's getting to the end of the
book, she does something very sweet here.

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:25.710
You'll see what she does.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.629
She points to her name at the end of the book.

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:33.690
In printmaking, a composition is developed
in stages.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.919
An artist will work on a copperplate, ink
it up, run it through the press, look at a

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:42.580
sheet of paper, see how he or she likes it,
then maybe want to make some additions.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.849
They'll work more on the copperplate, ink
it up again, put a piece of paper on,

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:48.020
run it through the press.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.199
And they do this many times and all those
pieces of paper survive.

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:57.310
And so you can see how an artist's imagination
unfolded and that's actually why I came up

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:03.939
with the title of the show "An Unfolding Portrait,"
but I also wanted to show that sculpture drawings

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:07.370
and paintings are also involved with this.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.909
In this group of works, Bourgeois started
with this sculpture.

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:15.340
So, after Bourgeois did the sculpture, she
decided to make a print of the same motif.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.940
So then she ran out to the press and she got
a couple of proofs, and she started to work on them.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:28.480
And here, she added inside the glow, sitting
on the chair, a mother attached by an umbilical

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.419
cord to a baby.

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:34.120
And she continued to develop that to these
different stages of the print.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.169
And then she decides on this one on fabric,
a black version.

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:41.509
And she initials it on embroidery LB.

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:46.250
And then she decides to make another sculpture,
this time with a mother and child connected

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.080
by an umbilical cord within the glass jar.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:55.499
So, it's a very interesting way to see how
an artist thinks, going from one medium to

00:07:55.499 --> 00:07:57.399
the other in developing her imagery.

00:07:57.399 --> 00:08:03.809
So, I hope that this exhibition makes clear
to all the visitors, how important printmaking

00:08:03.809 --> 00:08:09.219
was to Bourgeois and how integral it was to
her practice overall.

00:08:09.219 --> 00:08:12.800
And I was the print curator here at the Museum
of Modern Art.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:19.199
I actually worked at MoMA for thirty-one years
before I retired in 2010.

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:23.800
And then from 2010 till now, I've been working
on this Louise Bourgeois catalog raisonné

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.180
and this exhibition and accompanying book.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:32.000
But the reason for all that attention to Bourgeois'
prints, is that in 1990 she decided to make

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.400
an archive of her prints here at MoMA.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.650
So at that point, she gave all the prints
that she then had in her possession.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:45.130
And she said that, going forward, she would
promise to give us one example of every print

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.740
she made after that.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:53.300
So, that's how we amassed such a large collection
because she lived for two more decades, nearly

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.880
two more decades, yeah, two more decades up
until 2010 and printmaking was one of her

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.820
major activities during that period.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.960
So now, we have about three thousand prints in MoMA's
collection.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.250
And it's an incredibly unique resource for
study and exhibition.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:15.080
And behind here are just the kind of examples
of what we have, both the evolving states

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:20.860
as she developed her imagery, as well as the
final composition that she decided to issue in an edition.
