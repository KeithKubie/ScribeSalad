00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.820
So since fractions are just division,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.490
we can convert a fraction to a decimal
by performing that division.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.940
Let's take an easy one, one half.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.972
This is the same thing
as 1 divided by 2.

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:19.993
This might be a good time to remind
you that 1 is the same thing

00:00:19.993 --> 00:00:25.071
as 1.0 which is also
the same thing as 1.00,

00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:29.470
which is also the same thing as 1.000.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.699
Adding more 0's after the decimal point
here does not change the value of 1.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.680
It just tells us a more
precise value for 1.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.190
So in order to be more precise and to
make division here a little more easy,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.860
I'm going to add a few
extra trailing 0s here.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.170
And by adding these extra
0s after the decimal point,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.310
I still have not changed the value of 1.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.850
I'm just being more precise.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.796
All right, on with the division.

00:00:58.796 --> 00:01:02.819
2 goes into 1 0 times.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.330
Now let's make sure that we put
our decimal point that's here,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.970
we'll also put it up here.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.470
So now how many times
does 2 go into 10 here?

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.429
It should go in 5 times.

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:20.370
2 times 5 is 10.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.130
And when we subtract, we get 0.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.985
And there we go, we have 0 here,
so 0.5 is our answer.

00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:32.511
One-half is the same thing as 0.5.

00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:34.229
Now you give it a shot.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.390
What is three-fifths as a decimal?

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.670
Enter your answer here.
