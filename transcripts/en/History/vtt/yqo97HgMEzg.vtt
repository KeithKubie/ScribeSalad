MIKE WOLFE: All right Rod, how's

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.870
Chicago suburbs treating ya?

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.400
MIKE WOLFE: Oh, man, Australia.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.670
This is a guy that's an
expert with Rolls Royce.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.030
He's going to tell us
the value, flat out.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.000
There is not going
to be any guessing.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.200
MIKE WOLFE: OK

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.000
Oh.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Self-driving.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.630
Never owned a
chauffeur-driven car.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.230
No.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.530
So how rare is it
for it to be over here?

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.470
Yeah.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.270
Would someone pay $20?

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.430
MIKE WOLFE: Well, I very much
appreciate you calling us back.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.300
FRANK FRITZ: Thanks, Rod.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.400
Appreciate you, Rod.
Bye bye.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.330
MAN: Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.270
OK.
Well that was educational.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.670
Yes.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.770
MIKE WOLFE: He's saying that if
you have a car of this caliber

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.500
and want to take it to the
finish line, doing it right,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.900
it would cost that
type of money.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.070
You start talking museum-quality
restoration, concourse,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.570
the elegance, Amelia Island,
all of that kind of stuff,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.970
Pebble Beach--

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:11.670
no.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.970
This ain't their car.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.370
It's going to cost
too much money.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.670
So I'm wondering if there's a
guy out there that would want

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.000
it presentable, but not
want it to the caliber

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.900
that he's speaking about.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.170
Right.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.700
MIKE WOLFE: If somebody doesn't
want to restore the car,

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.700
they just want to clean
the raccoon poop out of it

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.830
and get it running and drive
around go, check out my Rolls

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.970
Royce Rat Rod, this is it.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.030
This is a working
man's Rolls Royce.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.070
It seems like the number
might be, according to him,

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.330
maybe $20,000.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.900
MIKE WOLFE: It's kind of
where I was leaning, $20,000.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.130
So if it's $20,000, then I
can't be the guy for $20,000,

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.370
but I can be the
guy for $15,000.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.670
If we could get
this car running,

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.330
so someone could
hear the engine--

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.530
Just at least it turn over.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.970
I'm not talking
about driving it.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.370
FRANK FRITZ: Right.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.630
We could turn it over right now
and see if the engine's locked.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.700
It'll turn over, I do believe.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.570
Here, let's see.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.630
Let's take a look here.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.600
Yeah, it's turning over.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.270
MIKE WOLFE: Good.
FRANK FRITZ: Yeah, it's free.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.230
Well there you go.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.830
You guys are at $15,000.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.230
I'm at $20,000.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.630
We split the
difference at $17,500.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.170
The family's at the point
where we love the car,

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.070
but at the same time, we
have nowhere to store it

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.530
and we can't leave it here.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.830
Yeah, but see the
thing is for me,

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.570
it doesn't make sense for
me to to buy it at $17,500.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.330
I get it back to
make $2,000 bucks,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.600
then I'm in the same
position you are because it's

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.900
taking up room as well.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.870
How about $16,000?

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.430
Look at that face.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.230
How could I say no to $16,000?

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.900
Are you kidding me?

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.070
Do you want me to pay $16,000?

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.130
Yeah.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.730
When Marlene looks
up at me, and says,

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.800
would you do $16,00,
who could say no to her?

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.170
Can we hug instead of shake?
- Sure.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.670
All right.
FRANK FRITZ: There you go.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.230
- Thank you.
- OK, thanks.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.200
Thank you.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.300
Appreciate you.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.730
Marlene, is either the
sweetest woman alive

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.470
or the best negotiator in Ohio.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.300
Either way, I paid $16,000
and we have ourselves

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.930
a Rat Rod Rolls Royce.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.130
All right, here we go.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.070
I think she saw a lot
of her husband's passion

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.300
in the way we were
appreciating these items.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.800
Thank you very much.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.670
You didn't have to
help us do this.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.570
And that made her proud
of what her and David

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.870
were able to accomplish.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.070
They saved all of
these things together.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.630
All righty.
- Appreciate you, my friend.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.000
FRANK FRITZ: Thanks
for calling us, guys.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.300
Appreciate it.
- Glad y'all could make it.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.170
FRANK FRITZ: Thanks for the
[inaudible],, sweetheart.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.500
Oh, yeah.
Sure.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.200
FRANK FRITZ: I'll think of
you every time I [inaudible]..

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.600
- OK.
- So sweet.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.670
Thank you so much.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.630
WOMAN: I used to think
I would be really

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.870
sad about seeing the things go.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.330
But the thought of having
somebody else enjoy it like we

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.930
enjoyed it makes
it a lot easier.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.500
FRANK FRITZ: Good too see you.
Sweet pickings!

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.330
[horn]

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.030
See y'all later.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.770
Take care!
