follow<00:05:05.069><c> these</c><00:05:05.250><c> coordinates</c><00:05:05.639><c> like</c><00:05:05.819><c> just</c>

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 align:start position:0%
follow these coordinates like just
 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.390 align:start position:0%
follow these coordinates like just
really<00:05:07.110><c> kind</c><00:05:07.349><c> of</c><00:05:07.439><c> out</c><00:05:07.560><c> of</c><00:05:07.590><c> the</c><00:05:07.710><c> blue</c><00:05:07.860><c> does</c><00:05:08.219><c> it</c>

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
really kind of out of the blue does it
 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
really kind of out of the blue does it
but<00:05:08.550><c> again</c><00:05:08.669><c> out</c><00:05:08.939><c> its</c><00:05:09.750><c> Nolan</c><00:05:10.259><c> ok</c><00:05:10.650><c> whatever</c><00:05:10.889><c> so</c>

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 align:start position:0%
but again out its Nolan ok whatever so
 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.390 align:start position:0%
