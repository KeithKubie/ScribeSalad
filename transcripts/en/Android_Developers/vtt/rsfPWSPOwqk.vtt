00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.140
NAZMUL IDRIS: I'm Nazmul Idris.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.570
I'm a developer advocate on
the Android team at Google.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.460
This is "UXD for
Developers," the show

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.240
where you can learn how to
create better user experiences.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.980
Today we're going to talk
about what UX actually means.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.160
With me I have a special
guest, Izabel Idris,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.900
who is a mobile
interaction designer that

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.270
works for [? Good ?] Technology.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.186
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:26.186 --> 00:00:27.080
IZABEL IDRIS: Thanks.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.121
NAZMUL IDRIS: So, Izabel.

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:30.540
I hear the words UX design
get thrown around a lot,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.090
and especially in many
different contexts.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.970
People say, if you do
is, you have a good UX.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.470
If you do that,
you're going to have

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.780
a bad experience and your
users will have a bad time.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.762
So what is UX?

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:44.470
IZABEL IDRIS: Well
User Experience Design

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.380
is really an emergent
property of design

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.100
that includes visual
design, interaction

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.710
design, and engineering.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.952
So you can see the slide
how all of these things

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:54.410
really need to come together,
and the whole must be greater

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.179
than the sum of its parts.

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:57.970
So if any one of these
things aren't great,

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.490
they're going to let down
the overall user experience.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.210
So user experience
really involves

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.430
you focusing on all
the details, as well as

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.241
being able to really
zoom out and make sure

00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:08.740
that what you're delivering has
an overall really great user

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.980
experience.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.370
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.910
So you mentioned the
words "visual design"

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.330
and "interaction design."

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.506
Can you describe the
differences between the two.

00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:20.380
IZABEL IDRIS: So I'm an
interaction designer,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.280
so I'll start with
interaction design.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.890
It really involves designing
a sequence of screens,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.390
are sequence of
steps, that the user

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.223
has to go through in
your application, which

00:01:28.223 --> 00:01:30.530
is what we call "flow,"
in order for your user

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.156
to accomplish certain tasks.

00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:33.530
So those tasks
depend on whatever

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.160
it is that your
application actually does.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.020
So interaction design
takes into account

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.800
how a user interacts with
the data and the UI elements

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.650
on each one of your
screens, as well as

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.190
how they interact with all
of the screens together.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.750
So the data and
the UI really has

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.292
to be strong together in a way
that makes sense for the user.

00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:51.583
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:53.340
IZABEL IDRIS: So if
you look at the slide,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.400
this is an example of a flow
that an interaction designer

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.060
might give to a developer.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.574
So the next slide here
is annotated wire frame.

00:02:02.574 --> 00:02:05.240
So this is something else that I
would also give to a developer.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.830
So the different
annotations show

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.789
what each one of those
UI elements mean.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.580
So right here we're
showing the action bar.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.760
So we have the app icon,
a spinner, some icons,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.150
and an overflow.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.580
So a visual designer,
what they do

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.770
is they really specify the
color palette, the iconography,

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.450
the typography, and all
the visual personality

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.690
of your application.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.720
So they would specify
the exact spacing

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.750
for all the layouts of
every single screen.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.784
So if you look at
the slide here,

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:32.450
this is what we would
call a "red line."

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.380
So you can see it's a
very detailed layout

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.490
of that particular screen.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.870
So visual designers would
provide the engineers

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.950
all the graphics,
assets, and the icons,

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.100
and make sure that each
screen is just perfect.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.802
So there's one other
example of a visual design.

00:02:46.802 --> 00:02:49.260
These are some things that a
visual designer would actually

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.218
deliver to an engineer.

00:02:50.218 --> 00:02:52.120
These are like the
different sizes

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.440
for your icons, all the
different font sizes, and icon

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.815
set for your entire application.

00:02:56.815 --> 00:02:57.840
NAZMUL IDRIS: So
essentially you're

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.220
skinning the application.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.030
You're creating that
wonderful experience--

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.530
I mean the visual aspect
of that experience that

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.579
is going to immediately
be striking to someone.

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:09.370
IZABEL IDRIS: Yeah.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.860
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.020
IZABEL IDRIS: So
interaction design,

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.290
you can kind of think of
it that they would provide

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.290
more of a low-res wire frame,
and then a visual design

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.815
would give you a high-res
mock that's really detailed.

00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:18.130
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.960
So I get it.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.870
So basically UX design has to
take into account interaction

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.892
design, on visual
design, and engineering,

00:03:23.892 --> 00:03:25.600
and put them all
together in the way that

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.830
delivers the light
at the end of day.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.460
Right?

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.120
IZABEL IDRIS: Yep.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.120
NAZMUL IDRIS: So from a
developer's perspective,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.960
the way I'd like to think about
it is that I write code that

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.840
might-- there's a
visual code I write,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.350
the non-visual code I write.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.510
And both of those come together
to deliver the overall user

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.746
experience, but the visual code
specifically delivers the UI.

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:45.620
Is that a good way to
think about it as well.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.816
IZABEL IDRIS: Yeah.

00:03:45.816 --> 00:03:48.024
And I think that Google Now
is a really great example

00:03:48.024 --> 00:03:50.540
of a product that delivers a
really great user experience.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.690
And it really embodies
awesomeness at every level--

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.767
the interaction, the
visual, and the engineering.

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:55.600
NAZMUL IDRIS: Right.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.670
IZABEL IDRIS: So I
think it's something

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.750
that we can talk about
a little bit more.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.330
Do you have any examples of how
an application or experience

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.950
like Google Now
could hypothetically

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.459
have gone terribly wrong?

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:07.500
NAZMUL IDRIS: Definitely.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.090
So we were talking about
visual design for quite a bit.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.150
So Google Now, one of the
most striking things about it

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.250
is that the cards are
really, really easy to read.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.636
The typography is great.

00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:20.510
It's very easy to digest
a lot of information

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.610
without thinking much at all.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.130
So if Google Now delivered the
same quality of information,

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.810
it was accurate and relevant,
but if it looked really bad,

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.170
like if the margins are
off and the padding was off

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.610
and the images are
all ugly, then I

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.860
think it would
make the user think

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.820
that it was a very
unprofessional application.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.611
IZABEL IDRIS: Yeah.

00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:42.390
I think that things like
typography and spacing

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.080
and that polish
that's in Google Now

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.532
is one of the things that
makes it so successful.

00:04:46.532 --> 00:04:48.990
Of course, the relevant data
surfacing just when you needed

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.176
is crucially important.

00:04:50.176 --> 00:04:51.800
But what I really
love about Google Now

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.425
is how I can just glance
at a card in just a second,

00:04:54.425 --> 00:04:56.050
I can get a lot of
information from it.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.790
If there's really low
cognitive load to those cards,

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.410
I can just glance
at it and that's it.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.660
NAZMUL IDRIS:That makes sense.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.660
So visual design
is very important.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.995
IZABEL IDRIS: Yep.

00:05:03.995 --> 00:05:05.600
NAZMUL IDRIS: So kind of
switching gears a little bit.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.570
So let's say the
visuals for Google

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.310
Now-- since we are
talking hypothetically

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.590
about how the UX
could go hardly wrong.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.050
So let's say Google Now had
just amazing data was surfacing,

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.990
the content was
totally-- I'm sorry.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.600
If the cards looked
really great,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.020
as they do today, but let's
say the data was lacking,

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.770
like it didn't know
your current location,

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.510
or it surfaced a card
about some upcoming flight

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.710
that you have to be on
and the details wrong.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.941
So in that situation, that would
be really bad user experience.

00:05:31.941 --> 00:05:32.440
Right.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.950
IZABEL IDRIS: Yes.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.570
NAZMUL IDRIS: Because one thing
that I would feel at that point

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.390
as a user is that I can't
trust the information that I'm

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.400
getting, even though it
looks visually striking.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.710
IZABEL IDRIS:Yeah.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.540
Trust is a really important
part of user experience.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.748
I'm glad you brought that up.

00:05:42.748 --> 00:05:45.600
Because trust is one of
those emergent properties

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.190
that has to do with really
great design and really

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.250
great engineering.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.410
So I think trust is something
that as developers we

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.920
should all really focus on.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.160
Because when someone
trusts your application,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.660
that's what's going to
get your users to give you

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.520
these five-star reviews
in the app store.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.936
And these reviews
are what's going

00:06:00.936 --> 00:06:02.670
to make you
ultimately successful.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.046
NAZMUL IDRIS: That's true.

00:06:03.046 --> 00:06:04.570
And then you get to
share your application

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.000
as well, and then the
social proof in what you're

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.680
doing and so on,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.450
IZABEL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.491
NAZMUL IDRIS: Absolutely.

00:06:08.491 --> 00:06:11.130
Trust is one of those very, very
important emergent properties

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.340
I think that everybody
should aspire to accomplish.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.880
So let's use a different
example than Google Now.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.290
So I think we've highlighted how
bad visual design could wreck

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.220
a user experience, how bad
engineering could wreck it.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.610
So let's talk about how bad
interaction design could also

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.280
wreck it.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.190
So we've all used
Android phones.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.760
And if you think back at
the first minute experience

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.797
you had with a
new Android phone,

00:06:33.797 --> 00:06:35.380
the first thing
Android asks you to do

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.090
is sign into your Gmail account.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.920
Once you've done
that, it basically

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.370
automatically signs you into
all the other Google apps

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.800
that you have, like
Play, Maps, and YouTube.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.600
So imagine an alternate
universe where,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.360
instead of this wonderful
flow, we add a lot of friction.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.130
Where, let's say, you've
initially signed in with Gmail,

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.170
but then for every other Google
application that you go to run,

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.860
you now have to sign into it
over and over and over again.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.420
What would the user
think in that situation?

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.081
I would be almost discouraged
from using my phone in the ways

00:07:05.081 --> 00:07:07.330
that I want to use it because
of the tremendous amount

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.270
of friction that had been
created in the interaction

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.930
that I'm having with these
different applications.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.800
So it's a higher-level
flow, if you will,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.920
of how a user interacts
with your phone that's

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.160
being impacted by
individual decisions that

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.120
are being made at the
application level.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.320
IZABEL IDRIS: Yeah.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.040
That's one of those aspects of
being able to get the details

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.998
right and then actually
zooming out and looking

00:07:28.998 --> 00:07:31.780
at how all those details, and in
this case, how the first minute

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.200
experience of using all
these applications really

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.240
affects the overall
user experience, which

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.470
is the Android user
experience of the phone.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:38.596
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:07:38.596 --> 00:07:39.096
Exactly.

00:07:39.096 --> 00:07:41.770
So it's almost as
if you'd have to be

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.074
a good citizen as an
application developer.

00:07:44.074 --> 00:07:46.490
Your applications have to be
a good citizen on the device,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.390
and not only deliver
a good experience

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.720
inside of that
application, but also

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.040
in the context of the larger
phone or operating system

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.249
that it's actually living in.

00:07:54.249 --> 00:07:55.164
IZABEL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:07:55.164 --> 00:07:57.740
NAZMUL IDRIS: It also impacts
things like battery life

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.451
and so on.

00:07:58.451 --> 00:07:58.950
OK.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.200
So it's clear that many
things need to come together

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.490
to make a user
experience truly great.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.174
And clearly that design is
everyone's responsibility.

00:08:08.174 --> 00:08:09.090
IZABEL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.830
Designers alone cannot create
great user experiences.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.990
So I want to say that one time,
that designers alone cannot

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.030
create a great user experience,
and are not responsible alone

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.820
for creating a user experience.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.440
It takes an entire team.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.630
So great user experience
really involves equal amounts

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.070
of amazing design and
amazing engineering effort,

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.085
and really amazing
is across the board

00:08:29.085 --> 00:08:30.710
by all the members
of the product team.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.760
So just to give a shout out
to all these other people that

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.090
are not engineers or designers.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.740
These include tech
writers, product managers,

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.425
project managers, and
directors, managers.

00:08:39.425 --> 00:08:41.299
So you really need
excellence at every level.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:42.340
NAZMUL IDRIS: Definitely.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.610
And also I think we
should also shout out

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.470
to user researchers,
prototypers and so who are also

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.970
part of the design
team that contribute

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.784
in a big way to making sure
the experience actually works.

00:08:52.784 --> 00:08:53.700
IZABEL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.880
NAZMUL IDRIS: I mean,
works for users.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.671
IZABEL IDRIS: Yeah.

00:08:55.671 --> 00:08:57.780
And designers can work
to create and prototype

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.980
really amazing designs.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.750
But in the end of the
day, these designs

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.510
still have to get
built by engineers.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.960
So an example,
let's say a designer

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.740
creates a really amazing
and elegant and functional

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.280
mobile news reader application.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.160
And they test it with users.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.070
It has really great
user feedback.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.072
And they say, OK.

00:09:16.072 --> 00:09:17.030
This design is perfect.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.410
So they give it
to the engineers.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:19.951
But when the engineers
build it, they

00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:21.429
don't put in
prefetching, caching,

00:09:21.429 --> 00:09:23.220
and they don't do
efficient data transfers,

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.680
and they drain the battery.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.330
NAZMUL IDRIS:
[INAUDIBLE] tells us

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.880
we should always do
efficient data transfers.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.230
IZABEL IDRIS: Always do
efficient data transfers.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.970
So these amazing
designs are never

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.885
going to be fully
realized or appreciated

00:09:31.885 --> 00:09:33.510
due to these bad
engineering practices.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.560
And this is something that
designers have no control over.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.870
They can't control if you
use prefetching, caching,

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.770
and if you do data
transfers inefficiently.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.950
So overall this is going
to result in a bad user

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:43.592
experience.

00:09:43.592 --> 00:09:45.800
You're usually going to feel
impatient and frustrated

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.530
and overall have a bad time.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.571
NAZMUL IDRIS: Definitely.

00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:50.809
IZABEL IDRIS: So UX design
is really important.

00:09:50.809 --> 00:09:52.100
It's everyone's responsibility.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.440
And it's really important
that everyone in the team

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.394
comes together to make
a great experience.

00:09:56.394 --> 00:09:57.310
NAZMUL IDRIS: Awesome.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.143
