00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:02.920
- [Voiceover] So let's say
that we've got the curve R

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.878
defined, so this is our curve R.

00:00:04.878 --> 00:00:06.461
It's X of T times I

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.966
plus Y T times J, it's a curve

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.941
in two dimensions on the XY plane.

00:00:13.941 --> 00:00:17.914
And let's graph it, just
graph it in kind of a

00:00:17.914 --> 00:00:19.662
a generalized form.

00:00:19.662 --> 00:00:21.093
So that's our Y-axis.

00:00:21.093 --> 00:00:22.607
This is our X-axis.

00:00:22.607 --> 00:00:25.258
Our curve R might look
something like this.

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:27.431
It might look something,
let me draw a little

00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:28.691
bit more of a.

00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:30.796
Maybe it looks something like this.

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:32.177
Maybe that's just part of it.

00:00:32.177 --> 00:00:34.880
And as T increases, we're
going in that direction

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.300
right over there.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.733
What I want to do in this video,

00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:41.430
this is really more vector
algebra than vector calculus.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.616
Is think about at any given point here

00:00:43.616 --> 00:00:45.679
whether we can figure out a normal vector.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.016
In particular, a unit normal vector.

00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:49.466
Obviously you can figure
out a normal vector

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.226
you can just divide it by its magnitude

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:53.380
and you will get the unit normal vector.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.430
So I want to figure out at any given point

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.803
a vector that's popping
straight out in that direction.

00:00:58.803 --> 00:01:00.358
And has a magnitude one.

00:01:00.358 --> 00:01:03.080
So that would be our unit normal vector.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.778
And to do that, first we'll think about

00:01:04.778 --> 00:01:06.372
what a tangent vector is.

00:01:06.372 --> 00:01:08.139
And from a tangent
vector we can figure out

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:09.682
the normal vector.

00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:11.735
And it really goes back
to some of what you might

00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:13.727
have done in algebra one, or algebra two

00:01:13.727 --> 00:01:15.422
of if you have a slope of a line

00:01:15.422 --> 00:01:17.433
the negative reciprocal of
that slope is going to be

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:19.058
the slope of that negative line.

00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:20.772
And we'll see a very similar thing

00:01:20.772 --> 00:01:23.313
when we do it right over
here with the vector

00:01:23.313 --> 00:01:25.101
with this vector algebra.

00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:26.738
So the first thing I
want to think about is

00:01:26.738 --> 00:01:27.978
how do we construct

00:01:27.978 --> 00:01:31.452
how do we construct a tangent line.

00:01:31.452 --> 00:01:33.951
Well, you could imagine at sum T

00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:35.362
at sum T

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:38.003
this is what our position
vector is going to look like.

00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:40.026
So call that R one.

00:01:40.026 --> 00:01:41.518
R one right over there.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:44.423
And then if we wait, if we
allow T to go up a little bit,

00:01:44.423 --> 00:01:46.426
if T is time, we'll wait a little while

00:01:46.426 --> 00:01:48.994
a few seconds, or however
we were measuring things.

00:01:48.994 --> 00:01:51.270
And then R two might
look something like this.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.672
This is when T has gotten
a little bit larger.

00:01:54.672 --> 00:01:56.695
We're further down the path.

00:01:56.695 --> 00:01:59.394
And so one way that you can approximate

00:01:59.394 --> 00:02:02.160
the slope of the tangent line

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.662
or the slope between
these two points, for now,

00:02:06.662 --> 00:02:09.201
is essentially the difference
between these two vectors.

00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:11.640
The difference between
these two vectors is

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.030
you could view that

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.778
you could view that as

00:02:14.778 --> 00:02:16.211
delta

00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:17.227
delta R.

00:02:17.227 --> 00:02:19.746
This vector plus that vector
is equal to that vector.

00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:22.347
Or, R two minus R one is going to give you

00:02:22.347 --> 00:02:24.306
this delta R right over here.

00:02:24.306 --> 00:02:26.553
And as R two, as that increment

00:02:26.553 --> 00:02:28.431
between R one and R two gets smaller

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:29.458
and smaller and smaller.

00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:32.027
As we have a smaller
and smaller T increment

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:34.782
as we get a smaller and
smaller T increment.

00:02:34.782 --> 00:02:37.045
So we get a smaller
and smaller T increment

00:02:37.045 --> 00:02:40.083
the slope of that delta R is going to more

00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:41.962
and more approximate the slope

00:02:41.962 --> 00:02:43.579
of the tangent line.

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.082
All the way to the point that if you have

00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:47.215
an infinitely small change in T.

00:02:47.215 --> 00:02:48.240
So you have a DT.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.915
So you go from R then you just

00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:52.487
you change T a very small amount

00:02:52.487 --> 00:02:54.754
that delta R, and we can
kind of conceptualize that,

00:02:54.754 --> 00:02:57.537
as DR, that does approximate

00:02:57.537 --> 00:02:59.996
the A tangent vector.

00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:02.646
So if you have a very small change in T

00:03:02.646 --> 00:03:04.313
then your very small

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.350
del DR I'll call it

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.443
because now we're talking
about a differential.

00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:11.292
Your very small differential.

00:03:11.292 --> 00:03:12.450
Right over here.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.491
That is a tangent

00:03:14.491 --> 00:03:16.798
that is a tangent vector.

00:03:16.798 --> 00:03:18.330
So DR

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.163
DR is

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:21.329
a tangent

00:03:22.777 --> 00:03:25.349
tangent vector at any

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.169
at any given point.

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.729
And once again, all of this
is a little bit of review.

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:31.700
But DR, we can write as

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.117
DR is equal to DX

00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:36.485
times I plus the

00:03:36.485 --> 00:03:38.707
infinite small change in X

00:03:38.707 --> 00:03:40.143
times the I unit vector

00:03:40.143 --> 00:03:42.559
plus the infinite small change in Y

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:44.145
times the J unit vector.

00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:45.811
And you see that, you see that

00:03:45.811 --> 00:03:47.030
if I were to draw

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.684
if I were to draw a curve.

00:03:48.684 --> 00:03:50.432
Let me just draw another one.

00:03:50.432 --> 00:03:52.354
Actually, I don't even
have to draw the axis.

00:03:52.354 --> 00:03:54.750
If our DR looks like that

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.771
if that is our DR

00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:58.986
then, we can break that down

00:03:58.986 --> 00:04:01.891
into its vertical and
horizontal components.

00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:04.646
This right over here is DY.

00:04:04.646 --> 00:04:06.483
And that right over there

00:04:06.483 --> 00:04:08.799
that right over there is

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:09.716
that is DX.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.484
And so we see that DX times I.

00:04:13.484 --> 00:04:15.637
Actually, this is DX times I.

00:04:15.637 --> 00:04:17.272
And this is DY

00:04:17.272 --> 00:04:19.324
this is DY times J.

00:04:19.324 --> 00:04:20.554
DY is the magnitude,

00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:22.322
J gives us the direction.

00:04:22.322 --> 00:04:23.875
DX is the magnitude.

00:04:23.875 --> 00:04:25.410
I tells us that we're moving

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.812
in the horizontal direction.

00:04:26.812 --> 00:04:28.945
Over here, this actually
would be a negative.

00:04:28.945 --> 00:04:30.986
This must be a negative
value right over here

00:04:30.986 --> 00:04:32.530
and this must be a positive value

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.663
based on the way that I drew it.

00:04:34.663 --> 00:04:36.959
So that gives us a tangent vector.

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:39.233
And now we want to from
that tangent vector

00:04:39.233 --> 00:04:41.217
figure out a normal vector.

00:04:41.217 --> 00:04:43.258
A vector that is essentially perpendicular

00:04:43.258 --> 00:04:44.976
to this vector right over here.

00:04:44.976 --> 00:04:46.244
And there's actually going to be two

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.402
vectors like that.

00:04:47.402 --> 00:04:48.917
There's going to be the vector

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:51.742
that kind of is perpendicular
in the right direction

00:04:51.742 --> 00:04:53.036
because we care about direction.

00:04:53.036 --> 00:04:55.547
Or the vector that's perpendicular
in the left direction.

00:04:55.547 --> 00:04:56.786
And we can pick either one.

00:04:56.786 --> 00:04:59.012
But for this video, I'm
gonna focus on the one

00:04:59.012 --> 00:05:00.374
that goes in the right direction.

00:05:00.374 --> 00:05:02.383
We're gonna see that
that's gonna be useful

00:05:02.383 --> 00:05:04.457
in the next video when we
start doing a little bit of

00:05:04.457 --> 00:05:06.337
vector calculus.

00:05:06.337 --> 00:05:08.560
And so let's think about
what that might be.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.836
And what I'll do to make
it a little bit clearer.

00:05:10.836 --> 00:05:12.930
Let me draw a DR again.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.113
I'll draw a DR like this.

00:05:15.113 --> 00:05:16.363
This is our DR.

00:05:17.295 --> 00:05:18.619
This is DR.

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:21.057
And then this, right over here.

00:05:21.057 --> 00:05:25.202
This right over there, we
already said this is DY

00:05:25.202 --> 00:05:26.595
times I.

00:05:26.595 --> 00:05:28.247
And then this, sorry,

00:05:28.247 --> 00:05:29.744
this is DY times J.

00:05:29.744 --> 00:05:31.340
We're going in the vertical direction.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.035
DY times J.

00:05:33.035 --> 00:05:34.783
And then in a different color

00:05:34.783 --> 00:05:37.090
this right now if I
already used that color.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.768
I haven't used, oh,

00:05:38.768 --> 00:05:41.347
I haven't used or had blue yet.

00:05:41.347 --> 00:05:43.778
So this right over here is DX

00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:44.695
DX times I.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.134
So we know from our algebra courses

00:05:48.134 --> 00:05:49.699
you take the negative reciprocal

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.336
so there's gonna be
something about swapping

00:05:51.336 --> 00:05:53.266
these two things around,
and then taking the

00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:54.107
negative one.

00:05:54.107 --> 00:05:56.412
But to figure out, we want the
one that goes to the right.

00:05:56.412 --> 00:05:58.273
So which one should we use?

00:05:58.273 --> 00:06:00.284
So let's think about it a little bit.

00:06:00.284 --> 00:06:01.951
If we, if we take DY

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.600
times I.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.574
So we take this length

00:06:05.574 --> 00:06:07.403
in the I direction,

00:06:07.403 --> 00:06:08.634
we're gonna get

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:10.504
we're gonna get this.

00:06:10.504 --> 00:06:12.170
We're gonna get that, so this is

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.003
DY

00:06:14.098 --> 00:06:15.595
times I.

00:06:15.595 --> 00:06:17.513
And then if we were to

00:06:17.513 --> 00:06:19.545
if we were to take D,
if we were to just take

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:20.856
DX

00:06:20.856 --> 00:06:21.844
times

00:06:21.844 --> 00:06:23.693
J, that would take us down.

00:06:23.693 --> 00:06:25.042
'Cause DX it must be negative here

00:06:25.042 --> 00:06:26.758
since it's pointed to the left.

00:06:26.758 --> 00:06:30.975
So we have to swap the
sign of DX to go upwards.

00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:33.474
So we swap the sign of DX

00:06:33.474 --> 00:06:34.795
to go upwards.

00:06:34.795 --> 00:06:36.806
'Cause I was here it was a negative sign.

00:06:36.806 --> 00:06:39.383
It went leftwards, we
want it to go upwards.

00:06:39.383 --> 00:06:40.542
So this is gonna be negative

00:06:40.542 --> 00:06:42.524
negative DX times J.

00:06:42.524 --> 00:06:44.361
We're now moving in
the vertical direction.

00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:46.648
And that, at least visually,
this isn't kind of a

00:06:46.648 --> 00:06:48.395
rigorous proof that I'm giving you.

00:06:48.395 --> 00:06:51.057
But this is hopefully good
a good visual representation

00:06:51.057 --> 00:06:52.631
that that does

00:06:52.631 --> 00:06:54.491
that that does get you.

00:06:54.491 --> 00:06:56.135
I should have drawn it a little bit.

00:06:56.135 --> 00:06:58.546
That does get you pretty

00:06:58.546 --> 00:07:01.326
that gets you pretty close,
just visually inspecting it

00:07:01.326 --> 00:07:03.297
to what looks like the perpendicular line.

00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:05.085
It's consistent with what
you learned in algebra class,

00:07:05.085 --> 00:07:06.142
as well.

00:07:06.142 --> 00:07:08.141
That we're taking the negative reciprocal,

00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:10.803
we're swapping the X's and the Y's.

00:07:10.803 --> 00:07:12.977
Or the change in X and the change in Y.

00:07:12.977 --> 00:07:15.284
And we're taking the
negative of one of them.

00:07:15.284 --> 00:07:17.438
And so we have our normal line

00:07:17.438 --> 00:07:18.840
just like that.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.372
Our normal vector.

00:07:20.372 --> 00:07:23.237
So a normal vector is going to be

00:07:23.237 --> 00:07:24.070
DYI

00:07:24.962 --> 00:07:25.795
minus DXJ.

00:07:26.892 --> 00:07:28.376
But then if we want a normalize it

00:07:28.376 --> 00:07:30.044
we want to divide by

00:07:30.044 --> 00:07:31.283
by that magnitude.

00:07:31.283 --> 00:07:33.347
So a normal, let me write it this way.

00:07:33.347 --> 00:07:34.911
A normal vector.

00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:36.191
So let me call this

00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:37.999
I'll just call it A.

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:39.979
A normal vector

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:42.022
is going to be DY

00:07:42.022 --> 00:07:42.855
times I.

00:07:43.758 --> 00:07:44.753
Is going to be

00:07:44.753 --> 00:07:45.647
DY

00:07:45.647 --> 00:07:46.959
times I.

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:48.376
Minus DX times J.

00:07:49.313 --> 00:07:51.287
Minus DX times J.

00:07:51.287 --> 00:07:52.526
I'll do that same blue color.

00:07:52.526 --> 00:07:53.359
Minus DX

00:07:54.872 --> 00:07:55.705
times J.

00:07:56.761 --> 00:07:58.813
Now, if we want this to
be a unit normal vector

00:07:58.813 --> 00:08:01.251
we have to divide it
by the magnitude of A.

00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:02.949
But what is the magnitude of A?

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:05.022
The magnitude of A

00:08:05.022 --> 00:08:07.265
is going to be equal to

00:08:07.265 --> 00:08:09.634
it's going to be equal to the square root

00:08:09.634 --> 00:08:12.173
of, and I'll just start
with the DX squared.

00:08:12.173 --> 00:08:14.153
So it's the negative DX squared.

00:08:14.153 --> 00:08:15.749
Which is just going to be DX squared.

00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:18.176
The same thing as positive DX squared.

00:08:18.176 --> 00:08:20.199
It's going to be DX squared

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.097
plus DY squared.

00:08:22.097 --> 00:08:22.930
Plus DY

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:25.002
squared.

00:08:25.002 --> 00:08:26.883
I could have put the
negative right in here

00:08:26.883 --> 00:08:29.686
but then when you square it,
that negative would disappear.

00:08:29.686 --> 00:08:31.028
But this thing right over here

00:08:31.028 --> 00:08:34.377
and we saw this when we first
started exploring arc length.

00:08:34.377 --> 00:08:37.454
This thing right over here
is the exact same thing

00:08:37.454 --> 00:08:38.287
as DS,

00:08:39.538 --> 00:08:41.031
and I know there's no DS

00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:43.126
that we've shown right over here.

00:08:43.126 --> 00:08:45.288
But we've seen it multiple times.

00:08:45.288 --> 00:08:47.523
When you're thinking of about if you

00:08:47.523 --> 00:08:50.936
if you think about the length of DR as DS

00:08:50.936 --> 00:08:54.015
that's exactly what
this thing over here is.

00:08:54.015 --> 00:08:56.422
So this can also be written as

00:08:56.422 --> 00:08:57.255
DS.

00:08:57.255 --> 00:08:59.176
So the infinite hasn't really changed

00:08:59.176 --> 00:09:00.770
in the arc length

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.172
but it's a scaler quantity.

00:09:02.172 --> 00:09:03.513
You're not concerned

00:09:03.513 --> 00:09:05.176
you're just concerned with
the absolute distance.

00:09:05.176 --> 00:09:07.689
You're not concerned so
much with the direction.

00:09:07.689 --> 00:09:09.118
Another way to be do it is

00:09:09.118 --> 00:09:10.583
it's the magnitude

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:13.589
it's the magnitude right over here of DR.

00:09:13.589 --> 00:09:16.020
So now we have everything
we need to construct

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.321
our unit normal vector.

00:09:18.321 --> 00:09:20.600
Our unit normal vector at any point.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.871
And I'll now write N

00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:23.801
and I'll put a hat on top of it.

00:09:23.801 --> 00:09:25.435
Say that this is a unit normal vector.

00:09:25.435 --> 00:09:27.620
We'll have magnitude one is going to be

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.413
equal to A divided by this.

00:09:30.413 --> 00:09:32.485
Or we could even write it this way.

00:09:32.485 --> 00:09:34.386
So we could write it as

00:09:34.386 --> 00:09:35.573
there are multiple ways we can write it.

00:09:35.573 --> 00:09:37.434
We can write it as

00:09:37.434 --> 00:09:38.917
I'll write it in this color.

00:09:38.917 --> 00:09:39.750
As DY

00:09:40.937 --> 00:09:41.802
times I

00:09:41.802 --> 00:09:43.365
minus DX

00:09:43.365 --> 00:09:44.374
times J.

00:09:44.374 --> 00:09:46.954
And then all of that times

00:09:46.954 --> 00:09:49.625
or maybe not times, divided by,

00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:50.458
DS.

00:09:50.458 --> 00:09:52.510
Divided by the magnitude of this.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:54.135
So divided by

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:54.968
divided by

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:56.887
DS.

00:09:56.887 --> 00:09:59.052
And obviously I can
distribute it on each of these

00:09:59.052 --> 00:10:00.637
by on each of these terms.

00:10:00.637 --> 00:10:02.473
But this right here, we've
been able to construct

00:10:02.473 --> 00:10:05.086
a unit normal vector at any point

00:10:05.086 --> 00:10:06.253
on this curve.
