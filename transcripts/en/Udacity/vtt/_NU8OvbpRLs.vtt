00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.230
Now that you're pretty comfortable
with your shiny new Linux machine,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.990
it's time to get your hands dirty,
and really start working with it.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.280
In the next lesson, you'll start
addressing some security concerns.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.680
You'll work with user management,
authentication, file permissions,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.260
firewalls, and software updates.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.960
It's going to be a lot of material,
but it's super important, not only for

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.880
your users, but the Internet as a whole.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.140
You're about to unleash your very
own server to the internet, and

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.140
anyone in the world, at any time
is going to be able to talk to it.
