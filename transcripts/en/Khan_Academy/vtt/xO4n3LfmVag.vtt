00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.064
- [Voiceover] Which shape
matches all three clues?

00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:06.119
So here we have three clues

00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:09.296
and we want to see which shape down below

00:00:09.296 --> 00:00:13.037
matches all three of these statements.

00:00:13.037 --> 00:00:14.987
So let's start with the first clue.

00:00:14.987 --> 00:00:18.352
The first clue says the
shape is a quadrilateral,

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.352
quad meaning four-sided.

00:00:23.994 --> 00:00:25.415
So looking down here at our shapes,

00:00:25.415 --> 00:00:27.853
let's see which ones
match that first clue.

00:00:27.853 --> 00:00:31.353
Shape one has one, two, three, four sides.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.049
So it is a quadrilateral.

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:38.549
Shape two has one, two, three, four sides.

00:00:40.023 --> 00:00:42.767
So also a quadrilateral.

00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:45.434
Shape three has one, two, three,

00:00:46.397 --> 00:00:48.230
four, five, six sides.

00:00:50.388 --> 00:00:52.613
So it is not a quadrilateral.

00:00:52.613 --> 00:00:55.413
It's a six-sided shape or a hexagon.

00:00:55.413 --> 00:00:56.688
So we can rule that one out.

00:00:56.688 --> 00:00:58.015
It doesn't match clue one

00:00:58.015 --> 00:01:01.557
so there's no way it can
match all three clues.

00:01:01.557 --> 00:01:05.724
And finally shape four has one,
two, three, four sides again

00:01:06.907 --> 00:01:09.407
so it is also a quadrilateral.

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:14.006
So after clue one, we still
have three possible answers.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.980
This first shape, the second
shape, and the fourth shape

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.897
all match clue one,
they're all quadrilaterals.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.587
Looking at clue two, it says
our shape has no right angles.

00:01:29.017 --> 00:01:31.657
Right angles are also 90 degree angles.

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:33.071
Right angles are 90 degree angles

00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:36.618
and they look something like this

00:01:36.618 --> 00:01:39.845
and we often see them marked
with a square in the middle

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:41.698
because they are sort
of like square angles.

00:01:41.698 --> 00:01:45.919
We can create a square from
the opening that they form,

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:47.368
that these angles form.

00:01:47.368 --> 00:01:49.451
So this is a right angle.

00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:52.268
Looking now down at our shapes,

00:01:52.268 --> 00:01:56.329
we can see right away on shape
one has two right angles.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.429
There's a square corner
and another square corner.

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.422
So this has right angles,

00:02:01.422 --> 00:02:04.967
but the shape we're looking
for has no right angles

00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:07.467
so we can rule this shape out.

00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:12.463
Shape two does not have any right angles.

00:02:12.463 --> 00:02:15.172
These are not squared off corners.

00:02:15.172 --> 00:02:17.415
And same with shape four, no right angles.

00:02:17.415 --> 00:02:21.128
So both of those still match
both clues one and two.

00:02:21.128 --> 00:02:22.354
So we have two shapes left.

00:02:22.354 --> 00:02:26.521
They're both quadrilaterals
and they have no right angles.

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:30.491
And finally our last clue,
the shape has four sides,

00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:33.291
we knew that 'cause it
was a quadrilateral,

00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:36.272
and those sides are of equal length.

00:02:36.272 --> 00:02:40.758
That means each of the
sides is the same length.

00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:43.350
Looking at this first one
that we have left, shape two,

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.819
it looks like these sides on the ends

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.929
are shorter than the
sides going up and down.

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:53.799
So it looks like they
are not equal length.

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.954
So we can rule this one out.

00:02:56.954 --> 00:02:59.748
But let's be sure this last one works.

00:02:59.748 --> 00:03:03.252
Here the sides all look like
they're the same length,

00:03:03.252 --> 00:03:05.550
but the way we can know
for sure that they are

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.217
is these tick marks.

00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:10.336
Any time you have these marks,

00:03:10.336 --> 00:03:12.586
it's saying that any side that has

00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:16.250
the same amount of marks
is the same length.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.893
All four of these sides
have exactly one tick mark

00:03:19.893 --> 00:03:22.560
so they are all equal in length.

00:03:23.418 --> 00:03:26.037
So shape four matches all three clues.

00:03:26.037 --> 00:03:29.632
It is a quadrilateral,
there are no right angles

00:03:29.632 --> 00:03:32.799
and it has four sides of equal length.

00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:36.374
So shape four is our answer.
