00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We already look into the rate of change of the number of infectious persons.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It was a constant times the number of infectious persons times the number of susceptible persons.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If this is the number of persons per day that move from susceptible to infectious,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the same number has to get lost from the susceptible compartment.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So the rate of change of the number of susceptible persons has to be minus the same quantity,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and then there's the second effect mainly that people recover.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We've already looked at that term.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This is the increase of the number of recovered persons per time.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If this number of persons is added to the recovered compartment each day,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
we have to subtract it from the infectious compartment as well.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We have to subtract it from the infectious compartment because these persons leave

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the infectious compartment and join the recovered compartment.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This completes the equations of the SIR model. Obviously, this is a very rough model.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
In particular, as the numbers that we are dealing with here are not integer numbers,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
in real life they should be say 1,000 or 1,000 at 1 or 1,000 at 2 persons, but with these equations,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
we're dealing with say 1,000.1, 2 , 3, 4, 5 persons.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
These equations can only make sense for large numbers of persons so that the fractional part

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
can be ignored, but if these numbers are large, the numerical constants that we're using here

00:01:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
may for instance be used to model influenza.
