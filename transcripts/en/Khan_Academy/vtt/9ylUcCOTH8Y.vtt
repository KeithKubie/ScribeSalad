00:00:00.474 --> 00:00:02.140
We've already seen
that you can visually

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.420
represent a vector as an arrow,
where the length of the arrow

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.700
is the magnitude of the vector
and the direction of the arrow

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.650
is the direction of the vector.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.650
And if we want to represent
this mathematically,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.180
we could just think
about, well, starting

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.720
from the tail of
the vector, how far

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.120
away is the head of the vector
in the horizontal direction?

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.300
And how far away is it in
the vertical direction?

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.720
So for example, in the
horizontal direction,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.020
you would have to
go this distance.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.730
And then in the
vertical direction,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.265
you would have to
go this distance.

00:00:42.265 --> 00:00:44.260
Let me do that in
a different color.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.140
You would have to go this
distance right over here.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.700
And so let's just say
that this distance is 2

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.040
and that this distance is 3.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.870
We could represent
this vector-- and let's

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.070
call this vector v. We
could represent vector

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:08.250
v as an ordered list or a
2-tuple of-- so we could say we

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.040
move 2 in the
horizontal direction

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.980
and 3 in the vertical direction.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.880
So you could represent
it like that.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.390
You could represent
vector v like this,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.742
where it is 2
comma 3, like that.

00:01:25.742 --> 00:01:27.450
And what I now want
to introduce you to--

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.616
and we could come up with
other ways of representing

00:01:29.616 --> 00:01:32.360
this 2-tuple-- is
another notation.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.180
And this really
comes out of the idea

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.550
of what it means to
add and scale vectors.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.150
And to do that,
we're going to define

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.825
what we call unit vectors.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.230
And if we're in
two dimensions, we

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.950
define a unit vector for
each of the dimensions

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.912
we're operating in.

00:01:50.912 --> 00:01:53.370
If we're in three dimensions,
we would define a unit vector

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.210
for each of the three dimensions
that we're operating in.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.640
And so let's do that.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.040
So let's define a unit vector i.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.826
And the way that we denote
that is the unit vector

00:02:04.826 --> 00:02:06.450
is, instead of putting
an arrow on top,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.320
we put this hat on top of it.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.620
So the unit vector
i, if we wanted

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.060
to write it in this
notation right over here,

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.220
we would say it only goes 1 unit
in the horizontal direction,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.080
and it doesn't go at all
in the vertical direction.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.665
So it would look
something like this.

00:02:26.842 --> 00:02:29.810
That is the unit vector i.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.920
And then we can define
another unit vector.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.740
And let's call
that unit vector--

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.620
or it's typically
called j, which

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.259
would go only in the
vertical direction and not

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:41.425
in the horizontal direction.

00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:43.290
And not in the
horizontal direction,

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.680
and it goes 1 unit in
the vertical direction.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.210
So this went 1 unit
in the horizontal.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.410
And now j is going to go
1 unit in the vertical.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.260
So j-- just like that.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.880
Now any vector, any
two dimensional vector,

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.560
we can now represent as a sum of
scaled up versions of i and j.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.300
And you say, well,
how do we do that?

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.470
Well, you could imagine
vector v right here

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.820
is the sum of a vector
that moves purely

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.930
in the horizontal direction
that has a length 2,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.740
and a vector that moves purely
in the vertical direction that

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.320
has length 3.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.530
So we could say
that vector v-- let

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.230
me do it in that
same blue color--

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.690
is equal to-- so if we want
a vector that has length 2

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.160
and it moves purely in
the horizontal direction,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.150
well, we could just scale
up the unit vector i.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.245
We could just
multiply 2 times i.

00:03:44.245 --> 00:03:49.385
So let's do that-- is equal
to 2 times our unit vector i.

00:03:49.385 --> 00:03:52.580
So 2i is going to
be this whole thing

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.250
right over here or
this whole vector.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.800
Let me do it in
this yellow color.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.510
This vector right over
here, you could view as 2i.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:08.420
And then to that, we're going to
add 3 times j-- so plus 3 times

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.920
j.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.740
Let me write it like this.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.890
Let me get that color.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.200
Once again, 3 times
j is going to be

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.760
this vector right over here.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.700
And if you add this yellow
vector right over here

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.150
to the magenta vector,
you're going to get-- notice,

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.110
we're putting the tail
of the magenta vector

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.760
at the head of
the yellow vector.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.410
And if you start at the
tail of the yellow vector

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.830
and you go all the way to the
head of the magenta vector,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.340
you have now constructed
vector v. So vector v,

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.220
you could represent it as a
column vector like this, 2 3.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.060
You could represent
it as 2 comma 3,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.440
or you could represent it as
2 times i with this little hat

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.080
over it, plus 3 times j,
with this little hat over it.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.980
i is the unit vector in
the horizontal direction,

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.570
in the positive
horizontal direction.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.455
If you want to go
the other way, you

00:05:00.455 --> 00:05:02.190
would multiply it by a negative.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.716
And j is the unit vector
in the vertical direction.

00:05:05.716 --> 00:05:07.340
As we'll see in future
videos, once you

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.320
go to three dimensions,
you'll introduce a k.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.491
But it's very natural to
translate between these two

00:05:13.491 --> 00:05:13.990
things.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.840
Notice, 2, 3-- 2, 3.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.550
And so with that, let's actually
do some vector operations

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.470
using this notation.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.090
So let's say that I
define another vector.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.195
Let's say it is vector b.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.400
I'll just come up with
some numbers here.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.130
Vector b is equal to negative 1
times i-- times the unit vector

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:48.000
i-- plus 4 times the unit vector
in the horizontal direction.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.320
So given these two
vector definitions,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.500
what would the would be the
vector v plus b be equal to?

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.410
And I encourage you to pause
the video and think about it.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.000
Well once again,
we just literally

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.404
have to add
corresponding components.

00:06:04.404 --> 00:06:05.820
We could say, OK,
well let's think

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.760
about what we're doing in
the horizontal direction.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.830
We're going 2 in the
horizontal direction here,

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.540
and now we're going negative 1.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.410
So our horizontal
component is going

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:20.470
to be 2 plus negative
1-- 2 plus negative 1

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.200
in the horizontal direction.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.690
And we're going to multiply
that times the unit vector i.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.710
And this, once
again, just goes back

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.110
to adding the corresponding
components of the vector.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:36.715
And then we're going to have
plus 4, or plus 3 plus 4-- And

00:06:36.715 --> 00:06:47.410
let me write it that way--
times the unit vector

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.430
j in the vertical direction.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.140
And so that's going
to give us-- I'll

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:59.270
do this all in this one color--
2 plus negative 1 is 1i.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.120
And we could literally
write that just as i.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.120
Actually, let's do that.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.810
Let's just write that as i.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.940
But we got that from 2
plus negative 1 is 1.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.260
1 times the vector is just
going to be that vector,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:15.380
plus 3 plus 4 is 7-- 7j.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.130
And you see, this is exactly
how we saw vector addition

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.160
in the past, is that we
could also represent vector

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.430
b like this.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:28.805
We could represent it
like this-- negative 1, 4.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.050
And so if you were
to add v to b,

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.520
you add the corresponding terms.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.270
So if we were to add
corresponding terms, looking

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.440
at them as column
vectors, that is

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.340
going to be equal to 2 plus
negative 1, which is 1.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.070
3 plus 4 is 7.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.982
So this is the exact same
representation as this.

00:07:52.982 --> 00:07:54.440
This is using unit
vector notation,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.190
and this is representing
it as a column vector.
