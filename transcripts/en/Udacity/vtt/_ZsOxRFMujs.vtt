00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.670
Sunshine is a weather app, focusing on
the current and upcoming weather for

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.290
a selected location.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.810
Given that focus, it is no wonder that
our main user interface is the weather

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.450
for the next seven days.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.040
Tapping on a day brings
us to the details page,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.650
which goes more into depth on
the forecast for that day.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.130
On larger devices, such as tablet's,
we used a master detail view, so

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.800
you could see the forecast and
the detail side by side.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.170
In both cases, we also provide
a settings screen where users can change

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.200
the location they want weather for,
and switch between imperial and

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.000
metric units.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.990
Even when the user didn't
specifically open the app,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.830
we use notifications to bring
the latest weather information to them.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.760
All this was made possible by the key
components, such as the content provider

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.959
and sync adapter for stable and battery
efficient data loading and retrieval.
