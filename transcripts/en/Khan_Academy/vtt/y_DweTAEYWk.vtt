00:00:00.574 --> 00:00:03.041
- [Voiceover] Perform
the indicated operations,

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:04.695
then simplify.

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:07.078
So we have three rational
expressions here,

00:00:07.078 --> 00:00:08.286
and we're gonna subtract this one,

00:00:08.286 --> 00:00:10.004
and we're going to add this one.

00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:11.584
So just like if we were adding

00:00:11.584 --> 00:00:13.001
and subtracting a bunch of fractions,

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.823
we really have to find a
common denominator here.

00:00:15.823 --> 00:00:17.227
And to figure out a common denominator,

00:00:17.227 --> 00:00:18.679
we have to figure out
the least common multiple

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.304
of x plus five, of 2x minus 10,

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:23.907
and x-squared minus 25.

00:00:23.907 --> 00:00:25.716
And to find the least common multiple,

00:00:25.716 --> 00:00:27.161
we really want to factor these out

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.125
and make sure that that
least common multiple,

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:30.355
that that common denominator,

00:00:30.355 --> 00:00:33.223
has all of the constituent factors in it.

00:00:33.223 --> 00:00:34.872
So this can't be factored anymore.

00:00:34.872 --> 00:00:37.465
X plus five, that's about
as simple as you can get it.

00:00:37.465 --> 00:00:38.869
2x minus 10.

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:40.674
We can factor out a two, and it becomes

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:44.070
two times x minus 5.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.515
So we factor that out.

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:47.539
And then x-squared minus 25

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.082
you might recognize as
a difference of squares,

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:51.963
so that's the same thing as

00:00:51.963 --> 00:00:56.237
x plus five times x minus five.

00:00:56.237 --> 00:00:58.282
Just factored that out.

00:00:58.282 --> 00:01:01.603
And so if we want to have
a least common multiple,

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.300
so let me rewrite each of these

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.912
with that common denominator here,

00:01:04.912 --> 00:01:06.700
that the least common multiple,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.993
the least common multiple

00:01:09.472 --> 00:01:12.142
is going to have to be something
that has x plus five in it,

00:01:12.142 --> 00:01:13.477
it's gonna have to have a two in it,

00:01:13.477 --> 00:01:15.802
it's gonna have an x minus five in it,

00:01:15.802 --> 00:01:17.083
and we've already said it has to have an

00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:19.288
x plus five and an x minus five in it.

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:20.786
So it's gotta have a two.

00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:22.144
It's gotta have a two.

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:23.723
It's gotta have an x plus five.

00:01:25.743 --> 00:01:27.565
It's gotta have an x minus five in it.

00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:32.574
And it's gotta have an x plus
five times an x minus five.

00:01:32.574 --> 00:01:33.815
Well, we've already got that there,

00:01:33.815 --> 00:01:35.429
so no need to write it again.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.422
So that right there is
our common denominator,

00:01:38.422 --> 00:01:39.653
so let's write it out.

00:01:39.653 --> 00:01:41.424
So let's rewrite each of these expressions

00:01:41.424 --> 00:01:42.596
with that common denominator.

00:01:42.596 --> 00:01:45.197
So two times x plus five

00:01:45.197 --> 00:01:47.440
times x minus five.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.075
And then right over here
I'll write it again.

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:52.339
Two times x plus five

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:54.370
times x minus five.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.113
Once you get used to this,

00:01:55.113 --> 00:01:57.762
you might be able to just write
out the common denominator

00:01:57.762 --> 00:02:00.202
once and then figure out the appropriate

00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:02.042
things to multiply the numerators by,

00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:04.006
but I want to make sure
we go through every step

00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:05.259
for these videos just so we make sure

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.338
we understand what's going on.

00:02:07.338 --> 00:02:10.675
So to go from x plus five
to two times x plus five

00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:11.881
times x minus five.

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:14.656
What do we have to
multiply x plus five by?

00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:16.726
Well, we have to multiply
it in order to get at this.

00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:19.547
We're multiplying it by a two.

00:02:19.547 --> 00:02:21.486
We're multiplying the
x plus five by a two,

00:02:21.486 --> 00:02:23.645
and we're also multiplying it by

00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:25.526
an x minus five.

00:02:25.526 --> 00:02:27.753
So if we're multiplying
the denominator by a two

00:02:27.753 --> 00:02:29.031
and an x minus five,

00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:30.895
we have multiply the numerator by a two

00:02:31.988 --> 00:02:33.466
and an x minus five.

00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:36.973
So if we multiply two times
x minus five times one,

00:02:36.973 --> 00:02:40.014
we'll get two times x minus five,

00:02:40.014 --> 00:02:42.034
and we don't even have to write this one.

00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:44.344
Now we're subtracting over here.

00:02:44.344 --> 00:02:48.211
And to get from two times x
minus five to this over here,

00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:49.964
what to we have to multiply it by?

00:02:49.964 --> 00:02:53.658
Well, we have the two times x
minus five right over there.

00:02:53.658 --> 00:02:55.954
We have to multiply it by an x plus five.

00:02:55.954 --> 00:02:57.788
This is the part that is new.

00:02:57.788 --> 00:03:00.830
We have to multiply it by an x plus five.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.409
We have to multiply this
denominator right here

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.509
by x plus five to get this denominator.

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.191
So if you multiply the
denominator by x plus five,

00:03:07.191 --> 00:03:09.675
you want to multiply the
numerator by x plus five as well.

00:03:09.675 --> 00:03:12.915
So the numerator's going to
be two times x plus five.

00:03:12.915 --> 00:03:15.613
Just to put two, multiplied
it by x plus five.

00:03:15.613 --> 00:03:16.940
Exactly what we did to the denominator.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.274
We multiplied it by x plus five.

00:03:19.274 --> 00:03:23.361
Then we have this last
expression right over here.

00:03:25.491 --> 00:03:27.282
I'm going to do this in a new color.

00:03:27.282 --> 00:03:29.870
We went from x plus
five times x minus five

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.099
to x plus five times x minus five

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.074
times two.

00:03:34.074 --> 00:03:35.944
So to go from this denominator
to this denominator

00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:37.834
we just have to multiply it by a two.

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:39.728
If you multiplied the denominator by two,

00:03:39.728 --> 00:03:41.951
you should multiply the numerator by two.

00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:44.634
So multiply two times 2x.

00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:47.746
You're going to get 4x.

00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:51.784
So all I did here is I
multiplied it by two.

00:03:51.784 --> 00:03:53.037
Let me make it clear.

00:03:53.037 --> 00:03:54.883
To get from this to this,

00:03:56.313 --> 00:03:59.450
I multiplied it by x plus five.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.529
X plus five.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.916
And then to go from there to there,

00:04:04.916 --> 00:04:09.176
I multiplied it by two times x minus five.

00:04:09.176 --> 00:04:11.022
And over here I should use,

00:04:11.022 --> 00:04:12.537
instead of writing multiplied
by two right there,

00:04:12.537 --> 00:04:13.763
I should multiply it by two.

00:04:13.763 --> 00:04:15.643
Don't want to get the
multiplication symbol confused

00:04:15.643 --> 00:04:17.547
with the x variable.

00:04:17.547 --> 00:04:20.182
And of course, there
was a positive out here.

00:04:20.182 --> 00:04:23.725
So we're now ready to do
our adding and subtracting.

00:04:23.725 --> 00:04:26.151
And we could view this
just for simplicity,

00:04:26.151 --> 00:04:27.150
just make it clear.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.170
Subtracting this thing is the same thing

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.516
as adding the negative of it.

00:04:31.516 --> 00:04:33.048
And that makes it a little bit simpler.

00:04:33.048 --> 00:04:35.672
So let's put our common denominator down.

00:04:35.672 --> 00:04:37.750
Let's put our common denominator down.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.422
So all of this business is going to be,

00:04:39.422 --> 00:04:42.720
and our denominator's going
to be two times x plus five

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.984
times x minus five.

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:47.365
And our numerator is now going to be,

00:04:47.365 --> 00:04:49.176
and I'm going to multiply this out,

00:04:49.176 --> 00:04:51.325
so that we can properly add terms.

00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:55.002
So two times x minus five is 2x minus 10.

00:04:55.972 --> 00:05:00.058
And then we have a negative
two times x plus five,

00:05:00.058 --> 00:05:02.942
so that's going to be negative 2x,

00:05:02.942 --> 00:05:06.251
and then negative two
times five is negative 10.

00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:09.017
And then we're going to have a plus 4x.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.572
Plus 4x over here.

00:05:11.572 --> 00:05:15.046
Plus 4x, and then we
can simplify this thing.

00:05:15.046 --> 00:05:16.923
And so you have a 2x.

00:05:16.923 --> 00:05:18.386
You're subtracting a 2x.

00:05:18.386 --> 00:05:19.988
Those guys cancel out.

00:05:22.268 --> 00:05:24.427
And then you're left with just a 4x.

00:05:24.427 --> 00:05:26.586
So you're left with just a 4x,

00:05:26.586 --> 00:05:28.560
and then minus 10 minus 10.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.594
So 4x minus 20

00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:35.510
over two times x plus five

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.794
times x minus five.

00:05:39.555 --> 00:05:42.555
Let's see, we can factor
out a four up here.

00:05:42.555 --> 00:05:44.088
So if we factor out a four,

00:05:44.088 --> 00:05:48.790
this becomes four times x minus five.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.048
If we assume that we're not dealing

00:05:53.048 --> 00:05:54.813
with x is equal to positive five,

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:57.840
'cause that would make
the denominator undefined,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.878
we can divide the numerator
and the denominator

00:06:00.878 --> 00:06:02.642
by x minus five.

00:06:02.642 --> 00:06:04.720
And so if we divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.298
by x minus five, those cancel out.

00:06:07.298 --> 00:06:09.294
And we can divide the numerator
and the denominator by two,

00:06:09.294 --> 00:06:11.237
since they're both divisible by two.

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:12.812
That four divided by two is two.

00:06:12.812 --> 00:06:14.832
Two divided by two is one.

00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:17.766
So the numerator, we're
just left with a two,

00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:21.435
and in the denominator, we're
just left with an x plus five.

00:06:21.435 --> 00:06:23.548
We're just left with an x plus five.

00:06:23.548 --> 00:06:26.951
Now, I want to be very careful here,

00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:29.552
because this expression up here,

00:06:29.552 --> 00:06:33.174
if we really want this
final answer that we got

00:06:33.174 --> 00:06:36.808
to be truly identical to
this expression over here,

00:06:36.808 --> 00:06:38.747
just a simplified version,

00:06:38.747 --> 00:06:41.290
we have to make sure that
it has the same domain.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.344
If say this was part of
the function definition,

00:06:43.344 --> 00:06:44.931
you want to make sure that it's valid

00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:46.604
for the same x's and not any more,

00:06:46.604 --> 00:06:48.544
if you want them to be truly identical.

00:06:48.544 --> 00:06:51.081
And this up here is not valid.

00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:54.599
So the domain if you viewed
this as one entire expression,

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:56.422
or one entire function definition,

00:06:57.742 --> 00:06:59.088
the domain would be

00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:02.679
all real x's,

00:07:04.726 --> 00:07:05.568
except

00:07:07.465 --> 00:07:10.078
x cannot be equal to negative five,

00:07:10.078 --> 00:07:13.848
or x cannot be equal to positive five,

00:07:13.848 --> 00:07:16.332
'cause that would make this
denominator equal zero,

00:07:16.332 --> 00:07:18.004
or x is equal to five.

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:21.069
And so if you want these
two things to be identical,

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:23.044
they have to have the same domain.

00:07:24.324 --> 00:07:25.727
Most algebra classes,

00:07:25.727 --> 00:07:28.062
people will not be particular about this.

00:07:28.062 --> 00:07:30.446
And maybe you don't want
them to be the same function.

00:07:32.161 --> 00:07:33.539
Maybe you want it to be defined

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:35.780
when x is equal to a positive five.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.114
But if you want them to be
truly the same expression,

00:07:38.114 --> 00:07:40.102
you have to have the same domain.

00:07:40.102 --> 00:07:44.148
So your domain you would want to say

00:07:44.148 --> 00:07:46.962
it is all real

00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:50.436
x's except...

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.976
If you were just to do
the domain for this thing,

00:07:51.976 --> 00:07:53.753
if you just solved this
expression right here and say

00:07:53.753 --> 00:07:55.871
okay, x can't be equal to negative five.

00:07:57.591 --> 00:08:00.526
So let me write except x
is equal to negative five.

00:08:03.867 --> 00:08:06.652
And so this right here is
just a domain for this thing,

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:07.990
but if we wanted to have the same domain

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.314
