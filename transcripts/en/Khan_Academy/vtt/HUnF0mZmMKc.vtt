00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.350
Find the missing value to
make the table represent

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.600
a linear equation.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.560
So let's see this
table right over here.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.000
So when x is equal
to 1, y is 3/2.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.035
When x is 2, y is equal to 3.

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:16.160
So let's see what happened.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.020
When x increased by
1, what did y do?

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.400
Well looks like y
increased by 3 and 1/2

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.000
is the same thing as 1 and 1/2.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.220
So to go from 1 and 1/2 to
3, it increased by 1 and 1/2,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.060
or you could say it
increased by 3/2.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.290
You could say that 3 is the
same thing as 6/2, 6/2 minus 3/2

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.360
is another 3/2.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.870
All right.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.220
Now when we go
from 2 to 3, we're

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.400
increasing by 1 again in x.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.960
And what are we doing in y?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.440
So we're going from 3, which is
the same thing as 6/2 to 9/2.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.830
So once again, we are
increasing by 3/2.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.500
So in order for this
to be a linear equation

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.340
or a linear relationship,
every time we

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.810
increase by 1 in
the x direction,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.090
we need to increase by 3/2.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.980
If we increase by 2, we need
to increase by 2 times 3/2.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.064
So what are we doing over
here on this fourth term

00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:15.605
on the table?

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:16.540
Well we're increasing.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.200
We're going from 3 to 8
so we are increasing by 5.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.990
So if we're increasing
x by 5, then we

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:34.890
need to increase y by 5
times 3/2 or 15 over 2.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.820
So that's the amount that
we have to increase y by.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.470
If we started at 9/2 and we're
going to increase by 15/2,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.480
so it's going to
be 9/2 plus 15/2,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.070
this is how much
we increment by.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.140
Remember, we increment
3/2 every time x moves 1.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.800
This time, x moved 5.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.010
So we're incrementing
by 15/2, or you

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.100
could say we're incrementing
by 3/2 five times.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.020
But this is going
to be equal to 9

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.120
plus 15 is 24 over 2
which is equal to 12.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.930
And so in the box, we could
write 12, and we are done.
