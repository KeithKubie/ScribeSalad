00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.800
Hi I’m Craig and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics, and today we’re going to finally

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.250
get into why many people, including me, think
that the Fourteenth Amendment is the most

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.200
important part of the Constitution. At the
same time, we will attempt – successfully,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.750
I hope – to unravel the difference between
civil liberties and civil rights, and also

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.230
try to figure out how the Supreme Court actually
looks at civil rights and civil liberties

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.050
cases. So that’s a lot. Let’s get this
out of the way because we're not gonna have

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.630
time later. Let's get started.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:33.620
[Theme Music]

00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:37.100
So we’ve been talking a lot in the past
few episodes about civil liberties, the protections

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.500
that citizens have against the government
interfering in their lives. Civil rights are

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.940
different in that they are primarily about
the ways that citizens, often through laws,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.590
can treat other groups of citizens differently,
which usually means unfairly. Civil Rights

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.370
protections grow out of the “equal protection”
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which reads:

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.000
“No State shall make or enforce any law
which shall … deny to any person within

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.230
its jurisdiction the equal protection of the
laws.”

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.280
This may seem straightforward, and in some
of the landmark cases that we’ll get to

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.030
like Brown v. Board of Education, it is, but
when you think about it, unequal treatment

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.110
of specific groups is usually done by private
citizens or institutions – like your employer

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.920
or your landlord, and most people, believe
it or not, are NOT employed by the government,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.500
either federal or state and they don’t live
in government housing.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.159
And initially the Supreme Court interpreted
the clause to apply only to the state government,

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.799
not to private discrimination. In the Civil
Rights Cases, the Court ruled that the law,

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.380
“could not have been intended to abolish
distinctions based on color, or to enforce

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.080
social, as distinguished from political equality,”
and they confirmed that as long as the state

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.079
provided equal accommodations for people of
different races, segregation was fine. This

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.459
is the infamous “separate but equal” doctrine
that was formulated in the case Plessey v. Ferguson.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.890
The distinction between social and political
equality is an important one, and it provides

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.299
a principle for looking at discrimination
that the courts still use. Unfortunately,

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.159
it’s pretty complicated and it means we
have to look at something that’s kind of

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.560
confusing, levels of scrutiny and protected
classes. And we’ll start with protected

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.710
classes because they are easier to understand.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.470
So when state law or executive action mentions
a protected class, the Supreme Court will

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.720
almost automatically become suspicious. So what are
protected classes? Broadly speaking they are what we

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.800
might think of as “minorities” and this is an important
way to conceptualize them. The Court defined protected

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.640
classes in one of the most important footnotes
in their jurisprudence. Here’s the relevant passage:

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.980
“Nor need we enquire whether similar considerations
enter into the review of statutes directed

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.680
at particular religious … or national, …, or
racial minorities,… whether prejudice against

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.700
discrete and insular minorities may be a special
condition, which tends seriously to curtail

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.980
the operation of those political processes
ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities,

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.200
and which may call for a correspondingly more
searching judicial inquiry.”

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.640
So here it lays out the categories where the
Court is going to pay special attention: when

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.230
a statute deals with “discrete and insular
minorities,” such as religious, or national

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.960
or racial minorities. It’s automatically suspect
and the courts are going to look at it closely.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.560
Why? Well this is in the footnote too. It’s
because minorities, by definition, are at

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.280
a huge disadvantage in the democratic political
process – their numbers are too small to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.510
pass laws that might favor them, and it is
easy for groups in the majority to pass laws

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.480
that will disadvantage groups that are not
in the majority. And this gets at the heart

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.670
of the distinction between civil liberties,
which deal with government actions, and civil

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.090
rights, which deal with majority groups making
life hard for minority groups.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.730
You may not like this distinction, but it
does have the virtue of being based on a principle.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.040
Basically the courts will step in to protect
groups that are unable to protect themselves

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.620
in the legislative process because it will
be too hard for them to pass laws in their favor.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.800
The way politics works in the U.S.
will complicate this, as we’ll see, but

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.500
as a principle it does make some sense. Thanks,
Thought Bubble.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.670
That footnote above talks about situations
that call for a “more searching judicial

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.390
inquiry.” This is known as the level of
scrutiny that the courts will apply, and it’s

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.050
not strictly limited to equal protection cases,
but this is where I’m going to try to make sense of it.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.739
So the highest level of scrutiny is called
strict scrutiny. I'd call it super scrutiny

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.390
or mega-monster scrutiny, but they didn't
ask me today. And this means that the government

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.720
will have a heavy burden to prove that the
law or action in question is allowable. When

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.989
government action concerns a protected class,
strict scrutiny kicks in. There’s a five-step

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.030
process that the courts go through in examining
what the government has done.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.269
First they look to see if there’s a protected
liberty at stake. Sometimes this is easy,

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.460
as with religious freedom, but other times it’s hard,
as with certain property rights or privacy issues.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.020
Second they look at whether the liberty is
fundamental, which again can be complicated

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.239
or not, depending on what the government is
doing. Freedom from incarceration is a fundamental

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.489
liberty, actually, it’s basically what we
mean by liberty, so a law that specifically

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.269
incarcerated one group based on nationality
would get strict scrutiny. Unfortunately this

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.680
did happen, during World War II when Japanese
Americans were interned, but it’s a bad example of strict

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.159
scrutiny since in that case the court, ruling in the case
of Korematsu v. US let the government’s action stand.

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:20.930
Third, they look at whether the law or executive
action places an undue burden on the person

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.340
or group in question. Let's say a state requires
literacy tests for voting which can be burdensome

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.660
or not, depending on the test and how it is
administered.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.160
Fourth, assuming that the first three qualifications
are met, the courts look to see if the law

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.490
in question furthers a compelling government
interest. In the literacy test example, the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.830
government interest might be seen as creating
an educated pool of voters, although I’m

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.250
not sure this would qualify as compelling.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.810
Fifth, if the court finds that the law meets
all the other criteria, it looks to see if

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.560
the government action in question follows
the least restrictive means of achieving the

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.300
government’s interest. In other words, is
there a less burdensome way that the government

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.600
could accomplish what it says the law accomplishes?
If the answer is yes, then the law is struck down.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.610
So you can see, this five-part test is pretty,
well, strict, and it’s hard for the government

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.160
to pass it. In practice, this means that if
the Court applies strict scrutiny, it means

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.090
that the governmental action or law in question
is probably going to be deemed unconstitutional.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.210
So that’s strict scrutiny -- not mega-monster
scrutiny -- but what about those cases where

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.840
the government isn’t dealing with a protected
class, which is much of the time? Usually

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.440
the Court applies what is called the “rational
basis” standard for review. This is the

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.030
lowest level of court scrutiny, and what it
means is that if the government can show that

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.870
it has a rational basis for its actions, the
courts will say they are ok. As you might

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.710
expect, this gives the government a lot of
leeway with its laws.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.539
In between strict scrutiny and rational basis
review is something called midzi scrutiny

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.220
-- NOPE -- intermediate scrutiny. It’s a
harder standard to meet than rational basis,

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.400
but it doesn’t mean that the government
usually loses, like with strict scrutiny.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.740
Why doesn't the government consult me about
naming things?

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.520
Ok, so now we have a sense of what civil rights
are, and why the courts look at civil rights

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.600
cases in the way that they do. It seems like a good
time for an example to help make sense of all this.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.480
And there’s no better example than the famous decision
in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka Kansas.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.080
Although it was not the first case to take
on the issue of discrimination in education,

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.050
Brown v. Board is the most important, because
it dealt with public schools. The issue was

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.610
that Topeka had separate schools for black
students and white students. Linda Brown was

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.770
black and her parents wanted her to attend
the white school because it was closer to

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.259
where they lived and because it was better.
The schools were supposed to be equal in quality

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.400
under the “separate but equal” doctrine,
but they weren’t.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.560
So after all I’ve told you about how the
court decides cases where protected classes

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.910
are involved – in this case black people
who certainly qualify as a discrete and insular

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.139
minority – the interesting thing about Brown
v. Board of Education is that the Court pretty

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:27.979
much ignored all of it. Their reasoning wasn’t
legal or historical, it was sociological,

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.270
based on the idea that separate facilities
are inherently unequal because they make the

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.669
minority group feel inferior to the majority
group.

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:36.680
Although the case didn’t immediately bring
about the end of segregated schools – many

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.050
states engaged in what they called “massive
resistance” to prevent school integration,

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.900
Brown v. Board of Education is still a landmark
Civil Rights case. It showed that the federal

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.819
government could intervene in something as
local as public education when racial discrimination

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:51.479
was involved, and, more important, it showed
that states couldn’t use race as a criterion

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:54.940
for setting up public schools. It was the
legal basis of what we know as the American

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.720
civil rights movement, and provided the foundation
for the federal civil rights legislation of the 1960s.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.100
So I got a little into the history there,
sorry about that. I know this is Crash Course

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.310
Government and not Crash Course History. But
with civil rights it's kind of hard not to.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.150
That’s because, unlike with civil liberties
which are pretty much defined by the bill

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.910
of rights, the question of civil rights comes
out of the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.530
clause, which itself came about because of
the Civil War and from the very beginning

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.139
was a contested concept, and one whose meaning
has changed over time.

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:23.690
Because civil rights and equal protection
almost by definition involve political activity

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.389
and protection of minority rights, what constitutes
civil rights changes over time. That’s why,

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:32.509
in 2015 people talk about same sex marriage
as a defining civil rights issue when 30 years

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:35.389
earlier it was hardly mentioned. What’s
really important is that we understand that

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:39.440
civil rights, and their denial, have as much,
if not more, to do with us and how we treat each other,

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.960
as they have to do with how the government acts.
