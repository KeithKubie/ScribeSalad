SO WE MENTIONED THIS BREAST
FEEDING THING.

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:29.122 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE IS A THING-- A CONTROVERSY
ABOUT BREAST FEEDING.

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:32.558 align:start position:0% line:91%

&gt;&gt; THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF
PEOPLE, HODA-- THOSE WHO FEEL

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:49.675 line:91%
THE NEED TO SHARE THEIR MOST
PRECIOUS MOMENTS AND THOSE WHO

GOD BLESS US ALL.

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:56.716 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I SAY BREAST FEEDING IS
BEAUTIFUL AND NATURAL, BUT

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:01.354 size:84% position:42% line:85%
SHARING IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA?

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:03.222 align:start position:0% line:85%
T.M.I.

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:05.391 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT WAS JUST
BIZARRE.

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:06.792 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; KNOW.

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:13.065 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU'RE SCARED TO SAY IT SO YOUR
EMOJIS ARE SAYING IT?

00:02:13.098 --> 00:02:15.835 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YEAH, WHAT WAS UP
WITH THAT?

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:17.803 align:start position:0% line:91%
BREAST FEEDING ISN'T AWKWARD
ENOUGH.

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:20.606 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW WE'LL HAVE CARTOON

LARRY.

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:39.792 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.535 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; TWO IN PARTICULAR.

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:53.673 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ONE OF THE ISSUES IS
PEOPLE AREN'T JUST DOING IT IN

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:54.440 align:start position:0% line:85%
PUBLIC, WHICH IS FINE.

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.075 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
THAT.

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:59.111 line:91%
BUT THEN THEY'RE SHARING IT ON
INSTAGRAM, WHICH SEEMS A LITTLE

00:02:59.144 --> 00:03:00.413 align:start position:0% line:85%
OVER THE TOP.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:04.350 align:start position:0% line:91%

&gt;&gt; I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
CAPTIONING.

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:23.002 align:start position:0% line:91%

FACEBOOK SAYING THE KIDS IN THE

&gt;&gt; Larry: YES!

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:36.475 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEN DID WE BECOME RACIST ABOUT
SPELLING BEES?

00:04:36.508 --> 00:04:38.010 align:start position:0% line:85%

 I DON'T GET IT.

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:55.528 line:91%
THE OTHER THING IS-- LET ME ASK

&gt;&gt; 100%!

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.267 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S INSANE.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.869 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IS IT RACIST TO SAY
A GROUP CAN DO SOMETHING GOOD?

00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:08.741 align:start position:0% line:91%
