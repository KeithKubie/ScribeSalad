MALE SPEAKER: Today we
have for Talks at Google

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.844
the man behind the label, Scott
Jordan, the founder and CEO

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:09.940
of SCOTTeVEST clothing.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.910
So you may have seen his apparel
in the Google Store or online

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.760
or even on my person where I
now have 23 pockets on my person

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.770
right now, which is super
handy, super useful.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.890
Scott's here today to talk to
us about his new book, which

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.320
is called "Pocket Man."

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.840
It's the story of really
SCOTTeVEST from his early days

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.720
to becoming a lawyer to
working at SCOTTeVEST

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.130
full time to "Shark
Tank" to the present day.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.930
So he's going to give us
some thoughts on his journey,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.290
and then we'll have some time
for questions at the end.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.710
You can also find Scott's
book on scottevest.com

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.750
and the Amazon
Kindle store as well.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.730
So please join me in
welcoming him to Google.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.536
Thank you.

00:00:48.536 --> 00:00:51.194
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:51.194 --> 00:00:53.110
SCOTT JORDAN: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.530
I really do appreciate it.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.100
I'm a huge fan of
Google, and it's

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.480
a real honor to be here today.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.807
I have to tell you.

00:01:00.807 --> 00:01:02.390
I'm going to be just
perfectly honest.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.930
This is my first
speech for the book,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.230
so if I'm a little rough around
the edges, please work with me.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.250
My team came up with
all these cards,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.110
and I'm just going
to talk freely.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.030
I do so much better just
talking off the cuff.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.900
So if there's something
I say during this speech

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.304
that you have a question on,
just please interrupt me.

00:01:25.304 --> 00:01:25.970
Raise your hand.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.720
Ask me about that, because
you might forget at the end.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.310
And it's about my journey
in starting SCOTTeVEST

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.300
and what it means.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.341
How many of you guys are
familiar with SCOTTeVEST

00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:37.960
before you got the email?

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.460
Yay.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.960
Awesome.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.920
I see some customers here.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.630
So, the book is about the art of
passionate personal promotion.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.850
Because when I sat down and I
reflected on writing this book,

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.990
I thought, well, what
do I have to say?

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.730
And it's hard because I've
been at this now for 14 years.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.620
When I founded
SCOTTeVEST in 2000,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.120
little did I know I was
starting the first apparel

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.740
brand on the internet.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.320
Before then, no apparel brands
had started on the internet.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.396
And I'm not through living
life and accomplishing things,

00:02:08.396 --> 00:02:10.979
so I was like, well, what am I
going to write this book about?

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.990
What makes me truly unique?

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.970
And I talked to people
that I was working with,

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.297
my friends, my
family, and they said

00:02:18.297 --> 00:02:20.630
one thing that always comes
through when they talk to me

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.570
is my passion.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.580
I'm really passionate
about what I do,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.570
so the book is about my
passion and my journey.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.300
And first and foremost,
if you read this book,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.930
you will be entertained.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.160
I promise you that.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.890
It is an entertaining journey.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.780
Because I did not want
to write a book that

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.630
was going to be like,
this is how I did it,

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.810
steps one, two, three.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.007
If you just follow-- I'm
just telling a story.

00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:42.090
It's the story of my life.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.270
I was a miserable lawyer, and
I hated it, and I thought,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.040
wow, I'm looking for
pockets in things,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.910
and I'm in a business
casual environment.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.605
And I came up with this concept
of something 14 years later

00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:56.210
it still seems that sample.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.210
Put more better
pockets in clothing.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.340
Everyone loves pockets.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.260
So that's the basis
of my company.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.960
And how I've gone about
selling an idea so simple

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.630
is with my passion.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.370
So I'm actually, now,
I'm traveling around

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.661
in this crazy car,
the Polaris Slingshot,

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:15.535
which I've decorated.

00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:16.784
Are you guys familiar with it?

00:03:16.784 --> 00:03:17.470
You've seen it?

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.710
It's actually parked
right in front.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.680
It's actually a motorcycle,
and it has no top.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.130
And I left Sun Valley,
Idaho, about a week

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.880
and a half ago in
minus 11 degree weather

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.220
and drove down to
Las Vegas at CES

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.890
and had an opportunity
to hang out.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.070
Everyone wanted a ride.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.161
I'm taking Guy Kawasaki
and Robert Scovill

00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:38.910
and a variety of other
people, and there's

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.630
tons of media devoted to that.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.380
So I found a way to get people
to stand in front of the car

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.860
and do this what we call the
power pocket man pose and take

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.610
pictures, and they
posted to the internet.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.810
So it's a great experience.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.490
I made my way to LA, and
now I'm in San Francisco.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.615
I'm actually going to leave
it with Robert Scovill,

00:03:57.615 --> 00:04:00.810
and we're having a pimp my
Polaris contest where we're

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.870
going to try to get
suggestions of what

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.044
cool stuff to put in the car.

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:06.960
We're going to do some
live streams and stuff,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.180
and then I'm going to take
it back to Sun Valley.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.760
So, I did mention it
was minus 11 degrees

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.850
when I left Sun Valley in
that car and it has no top.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.240
And I was really fortunate.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.070
I don't know if you know the
famous photographer Thomas

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.830
Hawk, but I had an opportunity
to hang out with him yesterday

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.760
and we shot the car.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.510
And it was a great
experience, and there's

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.790
a bunch of those
pictures online.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.180
So, I firmly
believe that showing

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.479
is much better than
talking, although I

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.520
do talk quite a bit for
those of you who know me.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.450
So first and foremost,
for those of you

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.550
who don't know
SCOTTeVEST, I am wearing

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.930
one of our SCOTTeVEST
products, actually not just

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.030
one but three.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.900
It all started out as a vest and
therefore the name SCOTTeVEST,

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.940
and it's grown into
a company with more

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.340
than 40 different products
ranging from pants to shirts

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.280
to jackets, winter jackets
and still the vest,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.870
women's clothing and the like.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.520
We've been in Inc's Fastest
Growing Company list

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.100
now three years in a row,
and we do this all out

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.320
of beautiful Sun Valley.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.820
Idaho.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.430
So I'm going to show you what's
in my pockets and the reason

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.130
why I came up with this concept
of designing a SCOTTeVEST.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.960
Well, first and
foremost, I came up

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.110
with this idea of patenting the
concept of wires in clothing,

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.700
because one thing
happened to me.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.330
It's probably happened
to a lot of you.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.140
It was pre-iPod days.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.140
I had a Discman.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.220
I'm listening to music.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.750
I got wires dangling
all over me.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.640
I'm in an airport and
I walk by a doorknob,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.549
and it practically
pulls off my ear.

00:05:39.549 --> 00:05:40.840
Literally, I grabbed the thing.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.810
I expected to see
my earlobe on it.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.550
So I said, there's
got to be a better way

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.470
to design clothing that
incorporates a method

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.350
to wire your devices.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.650
So I came up with this idea of
incorporating headphone wires,

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.520
but not just headphone
wires but also for batteries

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.880
as well because you want to
keep your devices charged

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.674
at all time.

00:05:58.674 --> 00:06:00.590
And wiring it and routing
it through clothing,

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.437
I filed for a patent
and I got the patent,

00:06:02.437 --> 00:06:03.270
reissued the patent.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.672
I actually went on "Shark
Tank" to present that company.

00:06:05.672 --> 00:06:08.005
There's a whole back story
to "Shark Tank" if any of you

00:06:08.005 --> 00:06:08.963
have seen that episode.

00:06:08.963 --> 00:06:11.590
It was highly controversial.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.270
And I actually spent
the first several years

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.080
of the company just thinking,
OK, all I want to do

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.030
is clip coupons.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.550
I came up with an invention.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.870
I just wanted license
to other companies.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.760
I don't want to make anything.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.910
I just want to collect checks.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.310
Well, what I found is in the
apparel business especially,

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.440
no one wants to
license a patent.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.990
They don't believe in patents.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.500
So I figured, especially the
patent wasn't even issued.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.650
So I had a patent pending, and
I started SCOTTeVEST merely

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.946
as a proof of
concept back in 2000.

00:06:42.946 --> 00:06:44.070
And a funny thing happened.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.440
SCOTTeVEST became
wildly successful

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.160
due to what I was doing,
passionate personal promoting,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.330
because I did not want to
practice law ever again.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.470
So I took every opportunity
to get out and talk to people.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.190
You can find me on
blogs back in 2000 just

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.430
interacting with people
trying to get them.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.300
So without further ado, we have
a pocket here for my cell phone

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.630
that you can actually
see and control right

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.600
through the fabric,
get your calls

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.550
without taking your phone
out, and it's really cool.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.200
So that's my iPhone 6.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.500
And the wires, it can be
wired up right through here

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.960
through this
patented this system.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.050
I have an iPad mini.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.370
And that will fit the
full-size iPad too.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.690
I have a passport here
and safe and secure.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.462
We actually have a
guarantee offering.

00:07:34.462 --> 00:07:35.920
If you're ever pick
pocketed, we'll

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.410
reimburse you up to $1,000.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.350
Because we know no one's going
to reach into that pocket.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.750
No claims on it, but
I get to promote it.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.350
So, this pocket actually
on the newer garments

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.630
we've lined with RFID
blocking material.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.930
I think that one.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.290
No, it's not?

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.880
Yeah.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.190
So, to me it's always
about batteries,

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.900
so I've got an extra
battery, an extra cord.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.000
I've got a Bluetooth headset.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.360
And this I just grabbed.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.120
I got some suntan lotion.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.770
I got gloves.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.500
I got a GoPro that hopefully
didn't break when it fell.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.660
I got a key holder.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.930
Guys are always
forgetting their keys,

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.450
and that was part
of the frustration

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.950
and how I started SCOTTeVEST.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.260
I was always asking my
wife where I'd put stuff.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.430
And she said, why don't
you just create something?

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.685
That was the moment that
SCOTTeVEST was formed.

00:08:24.685 --> 00:08:27.250
I have to feel all the pockets
to make sure I got them all.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.040
I have another battery because
without batteries I'm screwed.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.710
I've got a charger.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.390
So, I could go on.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.789
Let me just empty out.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.240
I have a 2 terabyte disk.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.419
I've got something to
clean my eyeglasses.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.742
And I got--

00:08:43.742 --> 00:08:44.950
AUDIENCE: Is it heavy though?

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:45.658
SCOTT JORDAN: No.

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:47.000
That's a great question.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.680
And I've got a radar detector.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.080
Because what we've done is--
and I'm going to take it off

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.580
because it's a
little warm in here--

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.890
we've designed this
so that the weight

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.670
resides on your shoulders.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.410
So we've engineered.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.810
We've taken a completely
different approach to clothing.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.210
I mean, I really feel like
I've reinvented pockets.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.460
And you think
about it, clothing,

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.470
when they designed
pockets, they weren't

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.060
thinking about what goes in it.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.410
And that little pocket that
Levi's have, who uses that?

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:20.360
So in my pants
pockets, I've got this

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.170
for the microphone
all the way down here.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.230
I keep my wallet down
here and around back.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.400
I've got layers of
pockets, and yet they

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.290
look like-- the concept
is design clothing that

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.215
first and foremost
looks good, but design

00:09:33.215 --> 00:09:35.090
pockets so that you can
carry all your stuff.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.040
This pocket is actually one
of my favorites in this shirt

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.000
and one of the hardest
ones to-- because it's

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.280
a design for my iPhone 6.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.550
We engineer clothing
with fulcrums and design.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.670
We really engineer clothing
so it doesn't rub up

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.670
against you uncomfortably.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.010
You can't make it disappear.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.250
It's a big unit, but it
enables you to carry it.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.300
And then how many
guys are sitting down

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.100
and you're always
sitting on your wallet?

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.640
Well, we just moved
it down a little lower

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.660
so that it's down here.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:09.680
So that's the basis for
SCOTTeVEST and the clothing.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.970
Now, my story is
really about my passion

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.040
and just going around and being
in opportunities like this.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.750
I never turn down an opportunity
to talk about my product,

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.750
never ever.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.150
And using the
internet, it's enabled

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.607
me to view the
world differently,

00:10:26.607 --> 00:10:28.190
and I've done this
from the beginning.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.010
I send video messages because
passion doesn't come through

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:32.860
in an email.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.160
It never can.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.300
In fact, passion in an email
can often be read as anger.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.680
And passion, there's a very fine
line between passion and anger

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.540
anyway as it can be
possibly perceived,

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.490
because I get really
excited about something.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.270
Scott, why are you so angry?

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:47.853
I'm not angry.

00:10:47.853 --> 00:10:50.170
I'm just really
excited about it.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.750
So what I've done
for a very long time

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:58.800
is I use tools, mailVU
and various other things.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.730
I send email messages of videos.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.130
So, I convey my
message through videos,

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.100
even if it's a short message.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.220
And by doing so, it enables
people to really get

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.890
a sense as to who I am
and what my message is.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.882
And on my website itself,
if you look at it,

00:11:16.882 --> 00:11:17.840
there's a lot of video.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.730
There's a lot of me.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.320
Any of you are old enough
to watch "The Brady Bunch."

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.540
I'm looking around and
several of you are,

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.490
so you remember Sam the butcher?

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:28.030
You go in.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.719
You buy some steak from Sam.

00:11:29.719 --> 00:11:30.260
You know him.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.593
He's not going to be your
best friend, but you know him.

00:11:32.593 --> 00:11:34.650
You feel comfortable
giving him your money.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.030
Well, my premise
is that if people

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.850
feel comfortable
that they know Scott.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:39.960
They can send me an email.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.340
They can engage with me on
Facebook or any of the other.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.480
That's my primary channel.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.210
I would encourage you
guys all if not friend me

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.289
because I'm very
prolific, follow me

00:11:49.289 --> 00:11:50.580
and choose and pick and choose.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.746
And be forewarned, you start
pressing like too much,

00:11:52.746 --> 00:11:54.500
you're going to get deep in.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.470
I'm going to
overwhelm your feed.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.190
But it's interesting stuff.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.920
So basically the
premise is create

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.000
these personal relationships
and let my passion come through

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.730
in an authentic way, completely
unscripted as the cards will

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.200
indicate.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.410
But passion is one thing,
but without the drive

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.100
to follow through--
I have a philosophy.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:24.300
I run my business on two
letters, FU-- Follow Up.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.700
Every single email
I get I follow up

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.160
on until it comes to a natural
conclusion or it's dead.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.740
So I have a drive.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.190
I never have an
idea-- and I have

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:40.110
tons-- that I'm not willing
to write down and do.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.530
And that's why we are able
to create a business doing

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.300
about $12 million with 15
people in Sun Valley, Idaho,

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.810
because we are just
using technology

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.500
to find a way to constantly
implement everything

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.470
that we come up with.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.120
And we've been able to do it.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.882
But you don't want to be just
around a passionate person

00:12:59.882 --> 00:13:01.840
who's just talking about
all these great things

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.881
and never doing anything.

00:13:02.881 --> 00:13:05.500
That's boring.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.670
There's an expression
in "Ferris Bueller,"

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:11.820
one of my favorite quotes.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.480
In "Ferris Bueller" he
goes-- the movie of course--

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.404
"Life moves pretty fast.

00:13:18.404 --> 00:13:19.820
If you don't stop
and look around,

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.220
you're going to miss it."

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.240
And my take on that expression
is, life moves pretty fast.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.920
If you stop and look
around, you might miss it.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.450
So I'm just moving
really fast in everything

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:35.070
that I do, and it's
with a lot of drive.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:40.040
So, this is obvious.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.650
All these messages
are in the book.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:48.330
Like I said, it's not like,
Chapter 1, these top four steps

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:53.160
in order to achieve success.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.330
I read this and I look.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.100
Yeah, no shit.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.440
You do shit.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.040
You just constantly do stuff.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.070
If you look at what I've
done in the past week,

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.360
it's been a whirlwind.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.350
I bought this car,
just by way of example.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:08.740
I got it three weeks ago.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.110
I got it scanned.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.360
I recognized it.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.996
Hey, here's this vehicle,
has no compartments in it

00:14:14.996 --> 00:14:16.410
at all, no trunk at all.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.070
I'm going to go to CES.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.390
I'm going to put my logo on it.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.260
I just generated the Pocket Man
logo just in time for the book,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.630
which, by the way, we wrote
in six weeks beginning to end.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.540
It was literally
published eight weeks

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.030
after we had our
first meeting on it.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.870
And that's not to say it's not
a good book, because it is.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.640
And if it isn't, write about it.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.920
Go look at Amazon reviews.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.710
Those are all authentic reviews.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.920
So, I got the car, and I
said, I'm going to Vegas.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.680
And my PR firm
sucked, and I just

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.260
decided I'm just going
to drive around and offer

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.670
really notable people
rides in the car.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.090
And I sit in the car,
and it occurred to me,

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.970
how am I going to
create content that

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.210
is going to get out
there and get more people

00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:59.650
to know about my brand?

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.660
Because we don't have
multimillion-dollar budgets

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.940
for advertising.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:09.070
Most of our advertising,
we spend a minuscule amount

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:09.880
on advertising.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.790
It's PR is what we've done.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.210
So I get them to
ride in the car.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.000
I say, I'm going to
ask you one question

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.958
at the end of the ride.

00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.110
They're like, fine.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:19.290
Take me for a ride.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:20.373
So I take them for a ride.

00:15:20.373 --> 00:15:21.925
What's your passion?

00:15:21.925 --> 00:15:22.960
That's the question.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.180
And I'm learning so
much about people

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:29.780
and what makes people successful
and how people can perhaps

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.850
find their passion.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.470
And it's really been a
fascinating experience.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.460
My premise is, for me,
when I was practicing law

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.770
at a very major law firm,
DLA Piper, the largest law,

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:40.990
I was miserable.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.470
At the end of every day,
I had to somehow find

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:47.840
eight hours that were worth
writing down at $300 an hour

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.310
that were worthy
of being billable,

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.640
and it was just excruciating.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.870
My premise is,
you can find a job

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.870
or do what you're passionate
about and tie it to your work.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.985
You can be exceptionally
successful and happy as well.

00:16:01.985 --> 00:16:03.360
And I think I've
done that, and I

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.776
think there's a
template for that.

00:16:04.776 --> 00:16:06.850
And I think more and
more people can do that.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:08.970
And I see it all the time.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.875
My maid, for
example, how can you

00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:12.250
be passionate
about being a maid?

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:12.880
She comes in.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.130
I'm going to clean this house.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.590
She really is passionate
about cleaning my house.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.615
And she is therefore a
lot happier in doing so.

00:16:19.615 --> 00:16:21.740
I get a beer at the local
brewery and the guy who's

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.660
pouring me the beer, I'm
asking him what his passion is.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.370
He's like, beer.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.380
And he's telling me
how beer is made,

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.720
and I learned more about
beer in that experience

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.790
than anything else.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.910
So, it was weird,
though, because I'm

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.410
on this mission,
this quest, talking

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.090
to people about their passion.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:42.840
And someone asked me,
what's your passion?

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.540
I was like-- I wasn't
prepared to answer.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.110
It caught me by surprise.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.510
So it's interesting,
because I reflected.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:53.020
As a child, my passion
has always been fast cars.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.580
So here I am, driving a
fast car around the country.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.950
And ideally I have
this plan for myself

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.420
to continue to promote my
clothing line and perhaps

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.810
a new line based
upon this Pocket Man

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.730
emblem and the spirit of
it and everything else,

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.099
very similar to what Paul
Newman did, drive race cars.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:13.693
But I'll get a team
of Polaris cars

00:17:13.693 --> 00:17:15.109
and drive them
around the country.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:17.000
The problem is
it's a motorcycle,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.260
so it can't drive on car
tracks, and motorcycles

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.435
don't want to have it
on its track either.

00:17:21.435 --> 00:17:23.849
I'm going to pause for
a second and take a sip.

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:27.560
And if anyone-- am I going too
fast, too slow, too boring, too

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.715
passionate?

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.840
AUDIENCE: The question is
around, explain your path

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.320
on how you incorporated
passion into your career.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.710
SCOTT JORDAN: My career--
I was a nice Jewish kid,

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:43.130
and I was given two options,
be a doctor or a lawyer

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.460
or go into dad's business.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.860
Dad happened to own a cemetery,
so I went into the cemetery

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.790
business, and I was knocking
doors door to door selling

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.500
cemetery lots in Cincinnati.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.710
It's a hard way to make
a living at 21 years old,

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.310
not something I wanted to
do, but something I did.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.590
And I was involved in
that for a couple years

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.550
and actually really
successful at it.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.341
Not passionate about it.

00:18:06.341 --> 00:18:08.090
Although you could be
passionate about it.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.490
You're helping people plan.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.530
But not something
you graduate college

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.970
and you're excited
about doing in my case.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.879
So, sold the business
out from beneath me.

00:18:17.879 --> 00:18:19.420
I didn't know what
to do with myself.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.640
And I knew I had
to make a living,

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.530
and I knew I could make
a living as a lawyer,

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:24.860
so I became a lawyer.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.160
And I knew very soon
in practicing law

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.880
that it wasn't
going to be for me.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.217
So I was starting to
look for exit strategies.

00:18:32.217 --> 00:18:34.050
In the problem is-- and
I think this happens

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:38.710
to so many people-- I was making
really good money at that age,

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.670
and even now looking back.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.270
And you're just stuck.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:48.540
To take that risk is
really, really, really hard

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.804
to walk away from that all.

00:18:49.804 --> 00:18:51.220
Fortunately I
didn't have children

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.060
and I had a really
supportive wife.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.670
And we kept looking
for things to do.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.890
I tried to go into
biz dev roles,

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.809
but once you're a
lawyer, the whole world

00:19:00.809 --> 00:19:01.850
looks at you as a lawyer.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.630
You have like a scarlet
L on your forehead.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.540
They really do.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.450
I applied for jobs, and they're
like, but you're a lawyer.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.090
And I've actually been
involved in some lawsuits

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:15.830
including with Scott USA when
I moved to Ketchum, Idaho.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.830
They tried to force me to
change the name of my company

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.950
because they thought I moved
to confuse people into thinking

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.220
they were buying ski
poles from SCOTTeVEST.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.090
Are you familiar with Scott USA?

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.070
They make bikes and ski poles.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.565
So, I just did a lot
of soul searching,

00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:32.790
and I had a really
supportive wife.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.010
And I decided, if
I'm not going to be

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.545
able to get an opportunity
working for someone else,

00:19:37.545 --> 00:19:39.540
I had to try it for myself.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.850
So I was really
fixated on coming up

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.960
with the perfect idea,
an idea that no one

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.600
else has thought of.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.530
And I came up with this
concept for wiring clothing

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.390
and patented it and thought
that that was the idea.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.660
But it really wasn't
about the idea,

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.900
and it wasn't about the
patent despite all the stuff

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.650
on "Shark Tank," the arguments
about patents and stuff.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.780
It was about building a
brand and being passionate

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.900
about it and execution.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.330
You hear this so much.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:11.400
It's who can execute better,
who can follow up better.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.730
I mean, how many opportunities
are in your inbox

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:19.790
that you don't bring to
conclusion or try to maximize?

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:23.140
And that's a short answer.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.300
There's a lot of
it in the book as

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.860
to how I made that transition.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.820
There were some
dark, dark moments.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.460
At the time, when
I couldn't decide

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.110
what to do because taking
that jump is the hardest jump,

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.799
and Hammacher placed an order.

00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:44.090
And I thought it was going
to be-- Hammacher Schlemmer.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.010
I'm a gadget guy.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.230
And at the time, Hammacher
was the coolest thing around.

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:52.370
This was before the really real
evolution and all the consumer

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:52.940
electronics.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.065
I don't even know-- cellphones
were just developing

00:20:55.065 --> 00:20:56.820
and iPods weren't even around.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:01.370
And I was actually
in my shrink's office

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:02.830
trying to figure out.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.760
I'm at the lowest
level like, what am I

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.270
going to do when I grow up?

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.514
I'm 30-something years old.

00:21:07.514 --> 00:21:08.430
I can't figure it out.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.340
I got to support my wife.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.120
And Hammacher, the
buyer from Hammacher

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.310
called while I was in
the shrink's office.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.210
And I said, well, that's a sign.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:21.220
Well, as it turned
out in that case,

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.120
the buyer said yes, he
wanted in and all the stores

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.420
and everything else.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.500
And lo and behold, he wasn't
replying to my emails.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.580
I'm like, uh oh.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.910
I just now quit my job.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.020
I stopped looking at
all these other paths.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:39.250
And I then e-commerce enabled my
site kind of as an afterthought

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:42.560
and finally showed up at
Hammacher's office one day

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.910
and said, hey, what's up?

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.110
I got an order in China
and everything else,

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.225
and you going to come through?

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:50.600
He said, I hate
to tell you this.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.740
Today is my last day.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.350
Meet the apparel buyer.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:56.589
And the apparel buyer
wasn't a gadget buyer,

00:21:56.589 --> 00:21:58.380
and she's just like,
oh, it's just pockets.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.050
I don't get it.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:00.860
I don't carry these things.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:04.220
So that fell through,
and then as a result

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.550
that door closed but
the other door opened.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:10.550
And that was to this day
over 85% of our business

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.850
is direct to consumer.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:15.210
It enables me to have a direct
relationship with the customer,

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.460
and it enables my
passion to come through.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.370
I go around the country
and do these fan events.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.930
I don't care if two, four
or 50 people show up.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.821
I get an opportunity
to interact with them.

00:22:25.821 --> 00:22:27.070
I'm not selling them anything.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.300
I'm telling them
basically my story

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.910
without the slides, which I'm
pretty much doing right now.

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:33.690
So does that--

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.118
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
it was very good.

00:22:35.118 --> 00:22:36.118
SCOTT JORDAN: All right.

00:22:36.118 --> 00:22:40.620
So, invite people
along for the ride.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.410
So that's what I've done.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:45.980
I open up my entire life.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.985
You will not meet another
CEO in the entire world that

00:22:48.985 --> 00:22:52.890
is more transparent and
engages with more people.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:58.460
I've been crowdsourcing ideas
and concepts for awhile.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.610
Again, look on Scott Jordan.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:01.510
You'll see.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.060
I'm asking people ideas.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.390
I'm engaging with
people, and I'm

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.616
doing it in a truly
passionate and authentic way.

00:23:09.616 --> 00:23:10.240
And guess what?

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.190
It comes through.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.900
I'm wired so I cannot lie.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.850
There's just something about me.

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:21.060
And I fundamentally
believe that 90% of people

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.800
can tell a little
white lie and not

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.350
think anything wrong with it.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.970
Our company is founded on the
basis of honesty, integrity,

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.350
and transparency.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:33.250
So when you meet me,
you get true passion.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:34.650
You get true authenticity.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.150
So I bring people
along for the ride.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.482
And truly, I take
them in my car,

00:23:39.482 --> 00:23:40.940
and I ask them
about their passion.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:46.300
I'm truly taking them for
not just a metaphorical ride.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.690
I'm taking them for a ride.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.990
But I think Cliff's been
following me for a while,

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:51.700
and he can attest to it.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:55.360
And so, yeah, it's
funner that way.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.160
It's fun to do things
with more people.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.111
And then they root for you.

00:23:59.111 --> 00:23:59.860
They root for you.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.290
They say, who's this
guy who quit his law job

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:05.490
and just reinvented pockets?

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:09.130
And even more absurd,
January 1 I declared

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:10.290
myself the pocket man.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:15.120
And I'm creating this
insane, absurd superhero

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:19.260
based upon every
man's gadget guy.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.970
And at CES I go to parties,
and everyone collectively

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.090
does this.

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:24.600
Pocket man!

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.600
And they get in front of
the car, and they yell.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.099
It's something that
makes you smile,

00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:30.360
so I'm inviting people
along on the ride.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.670
And I find that passion
is infectious too,

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.920
because when people
are around me and when

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.429
I'm around other really
passionate people, you feel it.

00:24:38.429 --> 00:24:38.970
You sense it.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:39.610
You want it.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.550
You want to do something.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.210
And so what I've
had the opportunity

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.490
to do is ask what their
passion is and maybe give them

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.310
a kick in the butt and maybe
just, hey, you should do it.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.710
I'm not going to preach
to them, but if I

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.560
can influence one
of 1,000 people

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.450
I talk to and 10 years from
now they're still doing it,

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:58.040
that's pretty cool.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.630
I really enjoy that.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:08.550
So, be willing to go far, but
make sure you go far enough.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.820
It's just finishing things.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.990
It's just once I
start something,

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:17.270
I just want to make
sure that I take it

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.010
to the furthest level possible.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.160
And now there will
come times where

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.400
it just doesn't make sense
and it's time to stop.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.632
Even just getting
in the Google store,

00:25:28.632 --> 00:25:30.090
I wanted to be in
the Google store.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:31.540
I knew it made sense.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.640
It took a lot of back and
forth emails and begging.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.320
And now it's here, and they're
doing really, really well,

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.920
and they want more, and
they're inviting me to speak.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.660
And that's fricking--
I'm at Google speaking

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.380
for my very first speech ever.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.070
So this is fun.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.700
Embrace controversy.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:56.030
As a small company with
no outside investors,

00:25:56.030 --> 00:26:00.160
just my wife and I own 100% of
the stock, virtually no debt,

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.060
profitable since our
second year in business,

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.740
and with the
personality that I have

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.790
and with my legal background,
there are many times

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.780
that I'm faced with a
controversial issue.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:16.400
For example, when I first
started the company,

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.160
the E in SCOTTeVEST looked
like an italicized E.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.485
Remember E in E-Business
Solutions for IBM?

00:26:23.485 --> 00:26:26.810
I get a letter from IBM.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:28.970
Please stop using an
E that resembles--

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:31.450
they owned the italicized
E. So I had a choice.

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:38.190
I could fight it to what
end, or I could roll over,

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:40.850
or the third choice.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:42.590
Fighting it never makes sense.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:43.730
I would never incur.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:45.850
But I said, OK.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:47.370
I did a big press release.

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:48.660
David versus Goliath.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.480
IBM's forcing me
to change this E.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.630
I agreed to a
settlement agreement.

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:55.770
I will change the E
in all future runs,

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.460
but I'm not going to destroy
all my current garments.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:05.010
But everything I have now, so,
I couldn't keep them in stock.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:05.930
I sent an email out.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:10.130
People from IBM,
I want the IBM E.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.120
If you look at controversies--
and most people avoid them--

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.910
you're avoiding one
half of the situations

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:17.760
and one half of
the opportunities.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.270
So you look at something
controversial and say,

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.900
how can I work that in my favor?

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.170
Now, again, I don't have
a board of directors.

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:25.820
I don't have a boss.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:29.230
I have a personality that can
get away with these things.

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:31.370
But for me, it's work.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:33.650
Same thing with Scott
USA when they sued me.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.430
It's the world's
most expensive E.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:39.785
I had to change the E to all
uppercase because SCOTTeVEST,

00:27:39.785 --> 00:27:43.770
it was a lowercase E.
And they said, well, it

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:48.280
looks too much like Scott USA,
and so they made me change it.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.820
And I write about
this in the book,

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.830
and the whole
argument with lawyers.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.880
And I'm sitting there
with the lawyers

00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:00.670
and in settlement, mandatory
negotiations in federal court.

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:05.500
And they said, OK,
what we're going

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.030
to allow you to do is continue
using the name SCOTTeVEST,

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.670
but you have to make
the E uppercase.

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:15.110
And I could have
continued fighting it,

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.640
and I just decided that
I would accept that.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.390
But then they said,
well, and you also

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.870
have to pay us the
$100,000 in legal expenses

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.030
that we've incurred
to date fighting this.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.220
And I was like, you
have got to be kidding.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:31.130
And I said some really
colorful things to my lawyer.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.830
And before I said them, I
said, you are my mouthpiece.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.320
You were hired to
repeat everything I say.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:41.177
You go in there, and you tell
them exactly these three words.

00:28:41.177 --> 00:28:42.010
They're in the book.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:43.885
I'm not proud of them,
but I wrote them down.

00:28:43.885 --> 00:28:46.310
I'm not going to say them aloud.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.810
And I'm not paying
their legal fees.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.130
They had a choice of how to--
but I embraced the controversy,

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.350
and I got out there in my town,
little small town of Ketchum,

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.770
Idaho, with 5,000 people.

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:01.850
Everyone knew me, and I had
immediate underdog status.

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:04.700
Like, why is Scott
USA suing you?

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.080
I have no idea.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.875
I made more friends, got
more notoriety from that,

00:29:08.875 --> 00:29:11.460
and there's a lot
of other experiences

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.170
that if you do properly,
as I get larger,

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:18.320
as I get more well known,
it gets harder to do.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.180
Because I have more to lose,
but I still have that edge.

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.980
And when Mark Cuban and
I got into the fight

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.220
on "Shark Tank" over
patents, I made it public.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.080
I used my megaphone too.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.890
Everyone is so wired to
run from controversy,

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.020
and I think there's
a lot of benefit

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.970
to embracing controversy.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:44.655
This is actually
really interesting.

00:29:44.655 --> 00:29:49.940
I have been able to meet the
most interesting key people

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:53.470
in this role, just so
many interesting people.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:58.530
And my favorite one is actually
a very famous San Francisco

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.790
person, Amy Tan.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.070
She placed an order
on our website,

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.310
and my wife, who is the
president of the company,

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:07.090
processes all the orders.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.895
She goes through the order
and she says, wow, Amy Tan.

00:30:09.895 --> 00:30:11.340
And she forwards
it to me, saying,

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.699
Scotty, I think
this is the Amy Tan.

00:30:13.699 --> 00:30:15.240
She emails it to
me, and I forward it

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.080
to Amy, who I didn't know.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.477
I'm embarrassed to say
I didn't read-- not so

00:30:20.477 --> 00:30:22.060
embarrassed-- I
didn't read her books.

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.160
It's kind of not my genre.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.300
And I forwarded it
to the email address.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.500
I said, are you the Amy Tan?

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.555
And not with that inflection
but just, are you the Amy Tan?

00:30:31.555 --> 00:30:33.520
And she writes back yes.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.740
And as a result, I have had
just a tremendous relationship

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.980
with her because I treat her
like she's a normal person.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.100
And I stay at her home.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.850
I'm having dinner with
her tomorrow night.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:45.780
And this goes on and on.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.330
Thomas Hawk, who's done
most of the photography

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:53.140
you see here and with the books,
and a bunch of really, really

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.650
famous people that I encounter.

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:58.210
Steve Wozniak, he bought
something on my website.

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:02.480
Same way, Laura forwards it to
me, and I write back, thanks.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.150
I'm a huge fan.

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:05.420
And speed is really
important to me too.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.630
Rather than sitting there
and wondering what to say

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:10.580
and trying to pick the perfect
words, you just be authentic.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.570
I think you can get away with
a lot more if you're quicker.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.179
People can be a
lot more forgiving.

00:31:16.179 --> 00:31:17.970
They like the fact that
you're really fast,

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.440
and that matches my personality.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.920
So I write to him, thank
you very much for the order.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.420
He was and is my idol.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.800
And he writes back, oh, this
is an excellent accessory

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:28.600
for an iPod.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.479
This was before
iPhones were out.

00:31:30.479 --> 00:31:32.270
Can I use that on my
website, I write back?

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.310
Sure.

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:36.055
Within a day, on my
homepage, Steve Wozniak,

00:31:36.055 --> 00:31:39.020
co-founder of Apple,
says, SCOTTeVEST

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:44.950
is an excellent accessory
for an iPad-- iPod.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:46.460
Let me get the I's straight.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.830
And as a result, we developed
this great friendship.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:53.050
We shot a series of WOZ-isodes
together on green screen,

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:56.970
did all these fun things and
did all these photo shoots,

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:58.910
and I've gotten to see
him a lot of times.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:04.000
So, when you're building a
brand like I was building

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.600
a brand, what I recognize
is the importance

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.170
of getting key influencers
and not treating them

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:12.740
like they're the
most special person.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.256
They know that what
they've done is good,

00:32:15.256 --> 00:32:17.640
but they want to be
treated like normal folks

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.960
and to have normal
relationships.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.640
And to be very careful
as I publicized things,

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.020
because there was a point in
my life that I actually live

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.510
streamed me working constantly.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:32.150
You have to be very careful
as to what you would reveal.

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:35.190
So, this is really hard for me.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:38.140
I just thought everyone
was wired like me.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.220
I had no mentor.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.079
As a lawyer I had no training.

00:32:43.079 --> 00:32:44.620
They just throw you
in there and say,

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.800
start dotting I's
and crossing T's.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.360
And you report to a collection
of four or five partners,

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.700
and you gravitate
towards one or another.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:59.420
And so after I started
Scott-- my biggest problem

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:03.450
in running the businesses
is people, managing people,

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:06.650
because it's hard.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:09.880
Honestly when I was taking
an HR class at college--

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.030
I went to the Ohio
State University.

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:19.330
Go Buckeyes, champions--
I was like, why HR?

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.350
You pay people money.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:22.586
They do their job.

00:33:22.586 --> 00:33:24.970
There's a contract there.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:27.040
As I've learned from
the way you guys

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.622
operate, you guys are amazing,
your HR practices, what you do.

00:33:30.622 --> 00:33:31.580
I want to implement it.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.550
It's compounded in my case.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:38.960
I'm so passionate my passion
is often misunderstood.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.109
I'm so visionary that
I'm constantly changing.

00:33:42.109 --> 00:33:44.400
I'm thinking three years out,
and I don't have the time

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:49.210
to explain why I'm thinking
to every person at all times.

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:52.760
I live in a community
that has 5,000 people, all

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.240
there primarily
to ski or retire.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.850
I don't have the applicant pool.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:00.550
So I would hire
people and expect

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:03.850
that they would be looking at
Google Analytics every day.

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:05.580
How did the sale do?

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:09.409
And not everyone,
especially employees

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:14.330
that don't have that same stake
in that, are that passionate.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:15.040
And that's OK.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.489
I'm learning to accept that.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.540
But what I'm also
learning to do is

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.300
try to put people in
jobs that have elements

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.610
that they can be
passionate about.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:27.960
With as small a company
as ours with 15 employees

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.310
that basically has
to do just as much

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:32.659
as a company at Tommy
Bahama, from design

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:35.900
to supporting retail
stores and doing

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.320
retail stores and catalog.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.409
We have a lot going
on, so that if you

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:43.729
are passionate about something,
I want you doing that.

00:34:43.729 --> 00:34:45.270
Because you're going
to do it better.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:46.730
You're going to have
more fun, and guess what?

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:48.860
You're going to be
more fun to work with.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.340
Because at this
point, I don't have

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.820
to work another day in my life.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.940
And I always wondered,
why do people

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.210
continue to keep working more?

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:59.700
Isn't it all about getting to
that number and then retiring?

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.394
And if you guys participated
in early stock options,

00:35:02.394 --> 00:35:04.060
you are here because
you enjoy doing it.

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:09.190
So what I've learned is I want
to be around passionate people.

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:11.660
I want to be around
people who are excited.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.640
But I think I set
a bar for passion.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.650
I'm like an ever-ready
bunny on passion.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:20.570
And that's OK.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.830
So I'm always ready
to reinvent myself

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:29.110
when there's an opportunity.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:29.980
I did it this year.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:34.820
Who else would say, OK, on
January 1 I'm Pocket Man?

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.077
With all that goes
along with it, you know?

00:35:37.077 --> 00:35:37.785
I got my own car.

00:35:37.785 --> 00:35:39.240
I got my own logo.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.440
I got my own theme
song, for god's sake.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.380
Every superhero needs his
theme song, so says Kanye.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.940
So I've done that several
times along the way.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.830
And I think people get
bored, especially a brand.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.240
But you have to have
consistent messaging as well.

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.760
We reinvented our company
and our logo several times.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:04.380
It used to be SEV until we came
up with this pocket icon, which

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.310
speaks directly to our brand.

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:09.590
It's a tough brand to explain
to someone, especially

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.650
with a name, SCOTTeVEST.

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:12.940
The E, is that silent?

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.265
SCOTTe?

00:36:14.265 --> 00:36:15.340
Scott Vest?

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.000
It's hard to pronounce.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.312
So I think it's important,
whether in your job

00:36:20.312 --> 00:36:21.770
or in your life or
your role, don't

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.710
be afraid to reinvent yourself.

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:25.670
I moved a lot when I was a kid.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:28.840
And through all these moves,
I was born in Philadelphia,

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:33.710
moved to Cincinnati, went to
school all over Ohio, Columbus

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:35.740
and Case Western Law and
then moved to Chicago.

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.780
And now I live in Sun Valley.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:41.600
And each time I move,
I get to start over.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.950
But having started over,
the one consistency

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.990
is I'm still that
same passionate person

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:48.000
that I was in that old city.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.210
I still can't lose that.

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:51.490
And I hope I never will.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:54.850
And it was only when I
first really wrote the book

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:56.780
and really thought about
it and really said,

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.030
embrace that passion.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.830
It's who I am.

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:00.950
Don't hide from it.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:03.480
And encourage other
people to find it as well.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.980
So, that's the last slide.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:11.420
I want to take
lots of questions.

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.870
And there is a link.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:16.060
You can download a
free copy of the book

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.120
at apparently tinyurl/pocketman.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.695
I think that's a typo.

00:37:22.695 --> 00:37:25.700
It couldn't really
be that, could it?

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:26.850
I have cards for that.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.560
I will answer anything that
you have a question about

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.200
AUDIENCE: I feel
like from an outsider

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.789
perspective about
three, four years ago,

00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:39.830
it looked like your business
hit a tipping point.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:42.110
You had like, three
or four employees

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:44.060
and a handful of products.

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.090
And then suddenly you
seemed to explode,

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:48.350
and you were constantly
posting that you

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.040
were hiring for all
these positions.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.976
And you had a women's
line, and now you're

00:37:51.976 --> 00:37:53.370
up to 40 or something.

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:55.420
And I was wondering
if you perceive

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.640
that there was a tipping
point somewhere for you

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.750
somewhat recently.

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:05.217
And if so, what happened
around there that caused that?

00:38:05.217 --> 00:38:06.800
SCOTT JORDAN: That's
a great question.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:13.820
The answer is, about four
years ago or thereabouts,

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.360
historically we've been
doing this now since 2000.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:21.670
So we were growing 20%, 40%, 50%
sometimes, but no more than 40%

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:23.320
a year for a number of years.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.030
And then we started
doubling in growth.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:29.600
And I freaked out, because
you hear all these stories

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.150
of the entrepreneur who
needs to step aside, let

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:34.530
a professional manager come
in and manage their business.

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:37.720
And when you have an
inventory-based business

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.870
with long lead times for
manufacturing cycles,

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:42.330
it's really complicated.

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:46.700
And so I actually, when we
started doubling in size,

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.090
I hired a lot of people.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:53.060
And I hired a president, in
fact, a really big number.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:58.640
And there were mistakes,
really bad hiring decisions.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.830
And there was a lot of
activity that you saw online.

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:04.509
And I learned a tremendous
amount about management.

00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:05.550
Had no corporate culture.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:10.020
I went from three people to
21 people without saying,

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.920
what is it that's
important to SCOTTeVEST?

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.210
Not even from a court.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:15.600
What does SCOTTeVEST mean?

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.020
What is our brand proposition?

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.520
And all those questions
that-- the problem

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:25.410
was when you grow too fast and
you're a slave to the growth,

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:27.144
you grow or die.

00:39:27.144 --> 00:39:28.560
But be careful not
to die growing,

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.100
because that's what happens.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.680
So fortunately we
had the wherewithal

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.220
to stop and slow down.

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:37.250
We let a lot of people go
or the attrition happened,

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:40.102
and we focused on-- it
sounds so obvious-- focused

00:39:40.102 --> 00:39:42.310
on the fundamentals, and we
created a corporate goal.

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:43.090
But it's true.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:46.140
And we focused on, the
primary goal for last year

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.220
was happy employees.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.140
Well, actually it was
build brand, number one,

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.930
to make our brand
stand for something

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:56.370
and understand that
it stood for pockets

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:58.940
and the functionality of
pockets and the engineering.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:02.090
And then make happy employees.

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:06.860
So as a result, we had
a bit of stagnation

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:10.170
after we doubled in
size in that one year.

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:15.690
And we've been now, without the
pressures of outside investors,

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:17.260
we've been slowly growing again.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.300
And part of the
problem is that I

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.790
thought that all
the dot-coms that

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:27.220
came and went, all the VC
stuff, all the stuff you hear,

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.630
it's just like, the only
thing that's meaningful

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.110
is to grow to 100 million
and then go public.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:33.680
And there are companies.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.095
Bonobos is perfect example.

00:40:35.095 --> 00:40:37.590
Are you familiar with Bonobos?

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.390
They have sold more stock
than they have clothing.

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:43.270
And they have a valuation
that probably is $500 million,

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:45.480
but they have not made
a single dime yet.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.970
I have been focused
on profits and lately

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.510
happiness more so than profits,
because if you have happiness

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:54.620
the profits will come.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:57.940
So I've never, though,
really experienced

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:03.280
the true Malcolm Gladwell sense
of the word tipping point.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.360
And I always feel
like it should happen.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.470
I don't get it.

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:08.170
I've got all these celebrities.

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:08.760
I come here.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.530
I get exposed.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:10.822
I'm in Google.

00:41:10.822 --> 00:41:14.320
I'm in SkyMall, and I'm
in a major motion pictures

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.890
are showing, and Michael Mann
calling me up and saying,

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:18.040
you have great products.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.990
And I'm in CES.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:23.800
I tool around with TechCrunch.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.620
And it just doesn't
happen that way.

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:30.300
There's not that explosion,
or it hasn't happened so far.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.400
But you know what?

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.370
That's OK, because I'm
living a pretty good life.

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:38.550
I built the house of my
dreams on top of my business.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:40.760
I live in Sun Valley,
which is gorgeous,

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.170
and I get to do pretty
much whatever I want

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:46.550
and call it work.

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:48.970
Did that kind of
answer your question?

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:49.804
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:49.804 --> 00:41:52.053
SCOTT JORDAN: Thank you for
your business, by the way.

00:41:52.053 --> 00:41:53.860
You've been a good
customer for many years.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:54.359
How long?

00:41:54.359 --> 00:41:55.430
How long?

00:41:55.430 --> 00:42:02.505
AUDIENCE: I bought my first
jacket from you in 2005, 2006.

00:42:02.505 --> 00:42:03.255
SCOTT JORDAN: Wow.

00:42:03.255 --> 00:42:04.255
How'd you hear about us?

00:42:07.132 --> 00:42:09.340
AUDIENCE: I was going on an
overseas trip to Germany,

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:12.310
and I was looking for a
sort of all-weather jacket

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:15.160
that was going to be
able to carry my stuff.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:19.844
And I was in a store
and saw one of yours.

00:42:19.844 --> 00:42:20.760
I don't even remember.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.170
It was a travel store.

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:23.750
It was a sort of
a brown felt one.

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:25.020
You haven't sold it for years.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:26.300
SCOTT JORDAN: Yeah, the Rodeo.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.439
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and fell
in love with it, and--

00:42:29.439 --> 00:42:30.980
SCOTT JORDAN: Was
it Edwards Luggage?

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:31.730
AUDIENCE: Pardon me?

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.260
SCOTT JORDAN:
Edwards Luggage here.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.218
AUDIENCE: Possibly, yeah,
I think that's right.

00:42:35.218 --> 00:42:37.174
SCOTT JORDAN: Yeah, one
of our few resellers.

00:42:37.174 --> 00:42:38.840
AUDIENCE: And it
really worked out well.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.994
That jacket was stolen
a little while ago.

00:42:40.994 --> 00:42:42.410
SCOTT JORDAN: The
tough thing is--

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:44.710
AUDIENCE: It's been
replaced, of course.

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:46.876
SCOTT JORDAN: We've always
struggled with how do you

00:42:46.876 --> 00:42:49.970
market a product that--
what do people search for?

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:51.640
Clothing with lots
of-- what do you

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.810
search for when
you want something

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:55.280
that you didn't know existed?

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.890
Clothing with lots
of clever pockets.

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:59.900
Not a lot of people
searching for that.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.970
Travel Vest, we own Travel Vest.

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.090
You search Travel Vest.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:06.910
Oh, and yeah, I
missed the important--

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:09.600
when we started doubling,
it was interesting.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.010
We used to be highly
focused on gadgets.

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:15.020
It was a dark and
very masculine site,

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.990
and it was very gadget
oriented, a very male site.

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:20.110
And we sent out a
request to our customers

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:22.660
for pictures of themselves
wearing our products.

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:23.850
And we were overwhelmed.

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:27.796
Thousands of pictures came back,
and everyone was wearing it

00:43:27.796 --> 00:43:29.740
at a location like
Great Wall of China.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.240
I got more pictures of people
wearing the stuff at the Great

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.990
Wall of China than
any other place.

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:37.180
And I was like, wait, maybe
we don't make gadget clothing.

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:40.290
Because gadget people, if you're
in front of your computer,

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:41.780
you don't travel.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.020
If you're not traveling,
you don't need pockets.

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:47.450
I mean, you need one
pocket but not a lot.

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:50.040
So we changed our
branding-- I forget.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:53.639
It was like five years
ago-- to travel clothing,

00:43:53.639 --> 00:43:56.180
and we came up with the tag line
"for the trip of your life."

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.846
Whether it's a trip
to the grocery store

00:43:57.846 --> 00:44:00.740
or a trip to China, you need
a pocket to put your stuff in.

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.660
And as a result of
changing our branding

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:05.900
and in being inclusive,
incorporating our customer

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.760
base in a lot of the
photography in the catalogs,

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.050
our business doubled.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:14.330
And then we went on that
slide of a ton of bad hires.

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:18.030
And now our branding is
more pocket focused, not

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:20.010
so much travel.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:23.570
But it's more about the pockets.

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:26.770
AUDIENCE: Why not have a
license, like Gore-Tex?

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:28.490
SCOTT JORDAN: Well,
that's the premise.

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:32.990
That was the goal, licensed by
technology enabled clothing.

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:34.960
When I started, I
didn't want to sell

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.227
a single piece of clothing.

00:44:36.227 --> 00:44:38.310
And this is the company I
pitched to "Shark Tank."

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:41.400
I couldn't mention the word
SCOTTeVEST because if I did,

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.000
I had to give the producers
5% of my business.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.180
And yet they kept
asking for SCOTTeVEST.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:50.574
But that, like Intel Inside.

00:44:50.574 --> 00:44:51.990
AUDIENCE: Or Dolby
Digital, right?

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:54.010
SCOTT JORDAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:54.940
That was the premise.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.740
But it's just clothing
companies don't

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.800
want to pay for the privilege
of putting a piece of Velcro

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.870
and controlling.

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:04.200
We have licensed
to VF Corporation,

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.850
which owns North Face, and
Ralph Lauren, and Under Armour.

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:11.650
Most of the major clothing
brands are licensees of ours

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:15.619
through litigation.

00:45:15.619 --> 00:45:17.160
AUDIENCE: So what
are some challenges

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.260
you faced and lessons
you learned from starting

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.440
a business that was
not your expertise,

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.770
so going completely
from law into something

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:27.380
you had very limited
background in?

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:33.250
SCOTT JORDAN: God, I mean,
that's a loaded question.

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:35.480
A lot, everything.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:40.430
What I've found is that
any expert I hired,

00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:44.610
within a very short period
of time and doing a couple

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:47.235
Google searches--
thank you very much.

00:45:47.235 --> 00:45:49.930
I appreciate it-- I
could learn almost as

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:52.800
much about their
expertise myself.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:58.570
And oftentimes I found it was
easier to just do it myself

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:02.680
than rely on outside consultants
to do my work for me.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:06.300
So I think the
challenge I still face

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.410
is when do I know I
have a good consultant

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:12.880
that I can rely on them
to do what I'm hiring them

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.820
to do and not have
to do it myself?

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.470
I still struggle with that.

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:21.320
I mean, I've hired several
PR firms along the way.

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.590
I hired these experts to get
me PR, and they cannot do it.

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:30.134
I fired one, probably fired my
fifth PR firm, maybe even more.

00:46:30.134 --> 00:46:31.800
And I talk about this
a lot in the book,

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.010
and immediately
hired another one.

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:37.511
If you're watching,
please do a good job.

00:46:37.511 --> 00:46:38.010
Thank you.

00:46:40.429 --> 00:46:42.970
AUDIENCE: So, when you quit law,
did you have a fallback plan

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:46.140
or a time limit as to, I'm going
to try this, if not go back

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:46.640
to law?

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.430
SCOTT JORDAN: No.

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:49.050
No, I really didn't.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:50.590
I didn't think it through.

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:54.560
I thought that the worst case
scenario was I go bankrupt.

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.410
And in this country,
we're very fortunate.

00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:59.090
It's the best country in
the world to do business.

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:00.340
You go bankrupt, who cares?

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:01.390
You start over.

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:03.180
I could always go back to law.

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:06.030
That was my fallback plan,
and it was a miserable one.

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:09.270
And every year, my law
license comes up for renewal.

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:13.030
And I'm like, oh, do I
want to pay the $250?

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.950
No, I'm ready.

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.060
I really think I don't
need a fallback plan.

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:20.550
And every year I still
send the damn check in.

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:22.801
My life's a lawyer too,
and she wouldn't do it.

00:47:22.801 --> 00:47:23.300
Yeah.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:23.860
AUDIENCE: Hey Scott.

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:24.590
Just a quick question.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:26.180
You mentioned Google
Analytics before.

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:26.450
SCOTT JORDAN: Yeah.

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:27.800
AUDIENCE: Can you
tell us a little bit

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.050
about how you use that or
if that's been instrumental

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:31.502
in any of your success?

00:47:31.502 --> 00:47:33.210
SCOTT JORDAN: It's a
love-hate situation.

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:34.200
There's so much--

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:34.910
AUDIENCE: What do you
love and what do you hate?

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:36.800
SCOTT JORDAN: I love
the amount of data

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.240
and I hate the amount of data.

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:45.120
I was a very early adopter.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.930
We've been on Google Analytics
since the beginning of time.

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:50.910
And I love the fact
that within a second

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:53.720
I can see how things
are performing.

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:57.680
And as a result, it puts
a lot of pressure on me

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.570
because I know that
if I do something--

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:03.700
like I'm on this trip, and
my car has QR codes on it.

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.930
And who uses QR codes,
especially with a car

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:09.780
driving 70 miles an hour?

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:12.090
But I look at the Google
Analytics every day,

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:16.590
and it makes you a
slave to information.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:20.930
I really wish that there were
better human beings involved

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:23.430
in my organization who can
condense the information

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:24.680
to give me actionable items.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:27.240
I used to look at it
religiously daily, twice a day.

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:27.885
It was up.

00:48:27.885 --> 00:48:30.720
I haven't looked at it in years.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.380
I rely on my wife to tell me
if we're doing well or not.

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:35.713
And at the end of every day,
I say, how did we do today?

00:48:35.713 --> 00:48:37.350
It was a good day,
bad day, no numbers.

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:40.590
We have never done a strategic
plan, never done any.

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:45.782
I don't review, just
keep trying to focus

00:48:45.782 --> 00:48:47.240
on what I think is
the right thing,

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.260
and it's proved
pretty good for me.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.510
AUDIENCE: Your background
is being a lawyer,

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:56.320
and you're not happy about it.

00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:00.260
But it enabled you to
come up with the fund

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:04.070
to start this business now.

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:07.160
I came from Japan three years
ago because of the disaster,

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.590
and I pretty much had
to start from scratch

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:12.680
my life in the United States.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.160
And I had a big dream.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:18.590
And I am actually starting a
business, but the challenge

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:20.700
with raising the money.

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:24.910
And I got people who
invest, but the people

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:26.970
has a lot of fear
of losing the money.

00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:30.470
And so I'm dealing with that.

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:36.220
And so I guess the question
is, if you weren't coming

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.700
from the background
of having money,

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:40.590
what would you have
done, and would you

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:46.160
choose people whose hard-earned
money and have a lot of fear

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.280
around it?

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.427
Is that a good investors?

00:49:49.427 --> 00:49:50.760
What would you say in that case?

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.176
SCOTT JORDAN: So,
when I started--

00:49:52.176 --> 00:49:54.260
this is a great
question-- I always

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.890
thought you started a business
with other people's money.

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:59.070
I just thought
that's what you did.

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:03.220
And I actually started
with a home equity loan.

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:06.040
It was $60,000 was
the seed money.

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:10.300
And at the time-- this was
before the real estate crash--

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:12.450
it was fairly easy to get
a home equity loan just

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:16.640
based on credit score, and that
wasn't a great deal of money

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.700
to start a business.

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:19.930
That is all the
capital I used to start

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:22.090
my business, effectively.

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:26.360
But to me, that was a lot
of money, to invest $60,000.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:29.200
But I was prepared to
lose it, and if I lost it,

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:33.930
I guess I would have lost my
house, which would have sucked.

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:36.220
But I looked at all sorts
of different alternatives.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.860
I looked to SBA loans.

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.420
I looked at having investors.

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.380
And in fact one guy who
sits on my advisory board

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:46.030
along with Steve Wozniak, who
is on my board of advisors,

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:49.840
which I'm proud to say.

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:54.200
One guy came in, and I said,
this is right after 9/11.

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.610
My business was doing horribly.

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:56.550
Everyone's was.

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:57.890
It's a luxury item.

00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:01.970
You don't need a
SCOTTeVEST to travel,

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:04.570
which I'll tell a
related story to.

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:07.050
And he looked at my
books, and he said,

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:08.990
I don't think you
need investors.

00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:11.910
I think you can do it, because
before 9/11 I was already

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:13.910
starting to be
cash flow positive.

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:17.430
And then after 9/11 with
the holidays coming up--

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:18.990
he convinced me.

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:22.200
And he stood to gain because
if he could have raised money

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.340
for me, he would
have gotten a piece,

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.299
and it would have been
profitable for him.

00:51:26.299 --> 00:51:27.340
And he said, don't do it.

00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:29.160
And it was the smartest
thing I ever did.

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.340
Because the time
and energy you will

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:35.450
spend keeping your investors up
to date and keeping them happy

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:37.430
and wondering when
their exit strategy is

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:39.840
and wondering why you
made this decision,

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.450
I'd much rather dedicate
that to the business.

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:46.840
So in my case, it
wasn't the money

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.740
that I made while practicing
law, because most of that

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.970
was spent on living
big in Chicago.

00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:56.680
You don't save that
much money at that age,

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:57.840
as much as you should.

00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:02.320
But having the luxury of a
wife working full time that

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:06.380
was completely supportive of
the idea, which was awesome.

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:07.880
I couldn't have
done it without her.

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.950
And to this day, all of my
success is because of her.

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:14.740
She is the hardest working
woman-- person-- in the world.

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.680
She gets to the office
every day at 12:30,

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.930
and she leaves the
next day at 4:00.

00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:24.990
She puts in 16-hour days, and
she's there processing orders.

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:26.090
She's like a machine.

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:28.200
She just loves the
work, and she makes sure

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.410
that we don't make
mistakes and we

00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:32.590
don't make bad hiring decisions.

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:36.114
It's hard, because you have to
have a home to borrow against.

00:52:36.114 --> 00:52:37.530
But, you know,
what I would advise

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:39.220
you is find a
business that doesn't

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:41.340
require a lot of capital.

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:44.930
Service businesses,
websites, do something

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:48.320
that doesn't require
the capital investment.

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:52.092
Most businesses in America
are service businesses.

00:52:52.092 --> 00:52:54.860
AUDIENCE: But what
about the passion?

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:56.820
I have this background
of writing a first book

00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:00.740
on raw food diet for Japan, and
I became the raw food person

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:01.510
in Japan.

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:04.620
And since this
last three years, I

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:08.490
have just followed my other
passion, which is language.

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:12.640
But I really want to start this
juice bar, and I got the place,

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.590
and dealing with
this PG&amp;E building,

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:16.880
which is huge company.

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:20.360
And they're just dragging
us along for six months now.

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:24.070
And I'm at the point I
don't know what to do now.

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:27.050
What can I do to make
this move faster?

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:27.784
What should I--

00:53:27.784 --> 00:53:29.200
SCOTT JORDAN: Well,
if some things

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.430
are outside your control,
you can't blame yourself

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:33.132
for doing that path.

00:53:33.132 --> 00:53:34.590
I'd find if there
are other places.

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:37.010
If you're really
passionate about that idea,

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:38.970
find a way to pursue it.

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:40.570
And if you need
investors to do it,

00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:42.990
then find some
friends and family,

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:45.740
because they really
understand you.

00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:48.780
But go into it
really passionate.

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:51.180
If you are going to
fail, there is no-- there

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:53.070
was no plan B for me.

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:54.050
There was none.

00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:59.110
And I really, I painted myself
intentionally into a corner,

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:01.550
because I knew I had to succeed.

00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:04.555
Because failure was not
a good option for me.

00:54:04.555 --> 00:54:05.680
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Scott.

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.471
SCOTT JORDAN: Sure.

00:54:06.471 --> 00:54:08.610
AUDIENCE: I just glanced
through the Amazon review

00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:09.410
you mentioned.

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:12.992
I noticed there are entries
like a kind of wish list

00:54:12.992 --> 00:54:14.450
of which you
mentioned in the book,

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:16.730
like a detail like
how you started

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:21.590
with finding manufacturing,
handling shipping, growing

00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:23.090
customer business.

00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:27.360
I want to take this opportunity
to satisfy those curious souls.

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.430
And it's kind of related to
that gentleman's question,

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:32.570
like how you're growing.

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:35.700
But instead of making it that
loaded question, maybe just

00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:38.160
like when you get
that idea, you get

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:42.910
that home equity fund, how do
you start getting manufacturing

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:45.243
and actually start the business?

00:54:45.243 --> 00:54:47.820
SCOTT JORDAN: I am
the only apparel

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:51.970
maker and maybe the only
manufacturer in the country

00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:55.820
and maybe the world who has
been manufacturing in Asia

00:54:55.820 --> 00:55:00.840
and has never been to
my factories, ever.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.590
I don't know if I
should be proud of that,

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:06.380
but I'm still working with the
same factories I started with.

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:09.610
I have great
inspection companies.

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:10.660
I use Skype.

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:11.380
I use video.

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:12.880
I have great correspondence.

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.700
So I'm going to start there.

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:17.840
If you ask someone,
in my case once I

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.260
start telling people I wanted
to make something in China,

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:22.950
everyone knew someone
who knew someone

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:24.825
who knew someone who
made something in China,

00:55:24.825 --> 00:55:27.860
and they could get you
there one way or another.

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:31.360
The problem was that everyone
along the way wants a cut.

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.590
Everyone's hand is out.

00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:36.110
I mean, it's like old
school merchant business.

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:37.160
It really is.

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:41.360
So fortunately, one of
my factories, the one I'm

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.120
still working, one of my
major ones, 14 years straight.

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:48.890
And my factories have all
come out to Ketchum, Idaho.

00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:51.200
It's like a two-day
trip to come out

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.680
to visit us instead of
me going out to them.

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.110
I'd like to change
that, because I

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:58.510
think I do need-- they're
an extension of my company.

00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:02.550
So the answer is
just passionately

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:05.430
decide what the end game
is and work backwards.

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:08.470
You need a factory in China.

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:11.360
You need a place
for your juice bar.

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.160
What are the steps
it's going to take?

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:15.530
Where's the critical path?

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:17.070
I do everything that way.

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:20.950
And anything that is a
third party I do first,

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:24.970
because I know anything
that's out of mind control,

00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:27.550
I want to start earlier.

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:30.110
It's critical path.

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:32.390
AUDIENCE: One of your
tenets was, a day of action

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:34.405
is better than a
week of thinking.

00:56:34.405 --> 00:56:38.360
A lot of people I know, even in
Google, they have great ideas,

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:39.994
and they try to work
on them part time.

00:56:39.994 --> 00:56:41.910
Obviously it sounds like
you went cold turkey,

00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:43.740
the cold turkey route, where
you just said, hey, look.

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:44.605
I'm going to go full time.

00:56:44.605 --> 00:56:46.160
I'm going to quit
my job, do X, Y, Z.

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:49.990
How do you think about
what you gain psychically

00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:53.110
by making that full plunge
versus the advantages of having

00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:56.610
a job and working
in your free time?

00:56:56.610 --> 00:56:58.300
SCOTT JORDAN: I
think it's dramatic.

00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:01.320
I mean, to say, I'm
jumping in full time.

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:06.140
I'm painting myself in a
corner-- the flip side of that

00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:09.530
is people who go into a
business with an exit strategy.

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:11.090
I don't have an exit strategy.

00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:15.200
I want to go in thinking what
today, tomorrow, next year

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:15.720
looks like.

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:18.970
But I don't want to worry about
when I'm going to sell out.

00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:21.950
So I think it's really
important that if you are going

00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:24.280
to make-- now, it doesn't
mean that you just come up

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:26.510
with an idea, and
you love the idea,

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:29.590
and before you do your research
you quit your great-paying job

00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:31.840
at Google or wherever
you are, and you just

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.280
go off and running.

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.470
But you need to
know when to jump.

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:38.930
You need to know when
to take that first step.

00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:39.910
And then you know what?

00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:43.090
After you take that first
step, take another one.

00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:44.450
Don't pause.

00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:46.090
Keep going.

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:50.010
And that's what I did, because
I got affirmation along the way.

00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:52.510
But not everyone--
when I told people--

00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:55.280
I was making really
good money as a lawyer.

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:57.360
I told people, I'm
going to stop and form

00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.930
this company called
SCOTTeVEST about pockets,

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:01.315
they thought I was crazy.

00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:05.320
People fell in two camps.

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.930
They thought I was
brilliant or crazy.

00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:09.220
There was no one in between.

00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:12.740
No one was like, ah, well,
that might be a good idea.

00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:15.010
And that's kind of been
the story of my life.

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:18.990
I kind of tend to be a little
controversial, I guess.

00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:21.070
So I want to thank you guys.

00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:22.885
This has been fun
for my first speech.
