Existing markets--well, the customers--well, they're know. We know who they are. They exist.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The customer needs--well, we could ask them--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
"What do they really care about for gains and pains." They could tell us.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Competitors, by definition, they are many.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The risk--well the risk is lack of branding, lack of sales, lack of distribution,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and well unfortunately, sometimes your product really does not live up to the claims.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Example, well the Google. It's an existing market.

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Go ahead and try to enter your search business to that. It's a dominant player in search.
