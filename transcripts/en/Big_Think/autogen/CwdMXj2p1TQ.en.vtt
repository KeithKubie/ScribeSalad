pushing that envelope in the poem I
 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.550
pushing that envelope in the poem I
can't expect my reader to be

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560
can't expect my reader to be
 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.259

years ago there was an I did do
something like that for a magazine where

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430
something like that for a magazine where
 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.160
something like that for a magazine where
it where a journalist actually followed

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170
it where a journalist actually followed
 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.550
it where a journalist actually followed
me around and we tried it but but it's

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560
me around and we tried it but but it's
 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.990
me around and we tried it but but it's
slightly different every time my

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000
slightly different every time my
 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.869
slightly different every time my
inspiration comes from everywhere just

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879
inspiration comes from everywhere just
 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.520
inspiration comes from everywhere just
walking down street just and I never

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530
walking down street just and I never
 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.660
walking down street just and I never
know where it's gonna come from so I

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670
know where it's gonna come from so I
 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.089
know where it's gonna come from so I
keep a notebook with me at all times and

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099
keep a notebook with me at all times and
 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.460
keep a notebook with me at all times and
the only criteria for anything making it

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470
the only criteria for anything making it
 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.800
the only criteria for anything making it
into that notebook is if it stops me in

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810
into that notebook is if it stops me in
 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.649
into that notebook is if it stops me in
my tracks for even an instant if it

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659
my tracks for even an instant if it
 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.670
my tracks for even an instant if it
catches my eye or my ear you know and

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680
catches my eye or my ear you know and
 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.729
catches my eye or my ear you know and
and I just write it down that means that

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739
and I just write it down that means that
 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.650
and I just write it down that means that
there are recipes in there you know

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660
there are recipes in there you know
 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.810

a line and after that point though what
 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.689
a line and after that point though what
happens is kind of odd I tend to I work

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699
happens is kind of odd I tend to I work

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:13.330
I just think of there are someone out
 

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.080
I just think of there are someone out
there who might want to read this if

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:16.090
there who might want to read this if
 

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:18.660
there who might want to read this if
they read this well that I want to get

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:18.670
they read this well that I want to get
 

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:20.120
they read this well that I want to get
them to feel the same thing

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:20.130
them to feel the same thing
 

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.760
them to feel the same thing
that I'm feeling and that's my audience

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:22.770
that I'm feeling and that's my audience
 

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.700
that I'm feeling and that's my audience
but that in the end I'm thinking only of

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:25.710
but that in the end I'm thinking only of
 

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:31.260
but that in the end I'm thinking only of
them and I'm not there

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:31.270
 

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:34.800
it would be wonderful if we were

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:34.810
it would be wonderful if we were
 

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.840
it would be wonderful if we were
striving for toward a post-racial

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:36.850
striving for toward a post-racial
 

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.570
striving for toward a post-racial
literature and certainly the election of

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:39.580
literature and certainly the election of
 

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:43.200
literature and certainly the election of
Obama is a big step on the way I think

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:43.210
Obama is a big step on the way I think
 

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.000
Obama is a big step on the way I think
that we shouldn't get complacent and

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.010
that we shouldn't get complacent and
 

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.070
that we shouldn't get complacent and
they go gosh now we're post-racial we

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080
they go gosh now we're post-racial we
 

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.760
they go gosh now we're post-racial we
are not we haven't had the conversations

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:50.770
are not we haven't had the conversations
 

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:54.000
are not we haven't had the conversations
we need to have about race and and

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.010
we need to have about race and and
 

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:57.990
we need to have about race and and
privilege and all of that stuff we're

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000
privilege and all of that stuff we're
 

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.980
privilege and all of that stuff we're
starting so or on our way but one of the

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:01.990
starting so or on our way but one of the
 

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:03.960
starting so or on our way but one of the
things that I've always dreamed of is to

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:03.970
things that I've always dreamed of is to
 

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.630
things that I've always dreamed of is to
have a post-racial literature you waste

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640
have a post-racial literature you waste
 

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:12.420
have a post-racial literature you waste
so much energy and good talent either

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:12.430
so much energy and good talent either
 

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:15.210
so much energy and good talent either

trying to insist upon your presence
 

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:20.550
trying to insist upon your presence
which is certainly what happened in the

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:20.560
which is certainly what happened in the
 

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.440
which is certainly what happened in the
Black Arts Movement in the 60s for

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:22.450
Black Arts Movement in the 60s for
 

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.070

instance and you also waste a lot of
 

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:32.190
instance and you also waste a lot of
energy then gee I lost my thought you

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.200
energy then gee I lost my thought you
 

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:37.000
energy then gee I lost my thought you
think

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:37.010
 

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.510
well you waste a lot of energy insisting

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:40.520
well you waste a lot of energy insisting
 

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.400

upon your presence but then you also can
 

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.640
upon your presence but then you also can
waste a lot of energy explaining things

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:44.650
waste a lot of energy explaining things
 

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.780
waste a lot of energy explaining things
explaining things which are specific to

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:46.790

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:00.500
up if we don't understand them but we
 

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:05.590
up if we don't understand them but we
kind of expect to be clued in on various

of the things that I've always found

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:12.370
 

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:16.150
frustrating are the little reference

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:16.160
frustrating are the little reference
 

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.710
frustrating are the little reference
points that I might have to explain in a

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720
points that I might have to explain in a
 

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.320
points that I might have to explain in a
poem that I wouldn't have to explain if

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:23.330
poem that I wouldn't have to explain if
 

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.419
poem that I wouldn't have to explain if
it were and it if if it were a

00:20:25.419 --> 00:20:25.429
it were and it if if it were a
 

00:20:25.429 --> 00:20:29.590
it were and it if if it were a
mainstream detail for instance I know

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600
mainstream detail for instance I know
 

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.659
mainstream detail for instance I know
exactly how a white woman would do her

00:20:34.659 --> 00:20:34.669
exactly how a white woman would do her
 

00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:37.780
exactly how a white woman would do her
hair every morning I know the washing

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:37.790
hair every morning I know the washing
 

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.310
hair every morning I know the washing
and the blow-drying and all of that kind

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:39.320
and the blow-drying and all of that kind
 

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.400
and the blow-drying and all of that kind
of stuff but so that if I see that in a

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:42.410
of stuff but so that if I see that in a
 

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.580
of stuff but so that if I see that in a
poem if that were to occur in the poem

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:44.590
poem if that were to occur in the poem
 

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:47.799
poem if that were to occur in the poem
then I would have no problem with it

00:20:47.799 --> 00:20:47.809
then I would have no problem with it
 

00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:52.240
then I would have no problem with it
whereas for me to even to get up and and

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:52.250
whereas for me to even to get up and and
 

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.150
whereas for me to even to get up and and
and to explain getting up and rushing

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:55.160
and to explain getting up and rushing
 

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.580
and to explain getting up and rushing
and how to do my hair it would require

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:57.590
and how to do my hair it would require
 

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.530
and how to do my hair it would require
all sorts of glosses you know I'd have

00:20:59.530 --> 00:20:59.540
all sorts of glosses you know I'd have
 

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.390
all sorts of glosses you know I'd have
to say well yes there's the this the

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:01.400
to say well yes there's the this the
 

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.360
to say well yes there's the this the
hair pomade and there's the this and and

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:04.370
hair pomade and there's the this and and
 

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:09.039
hair pomade and there's the this and and
and so my hope is that in a in a

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:09.049
and so my hope is that in a in a
 

00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:11.470
and so my hope is that in a in a
post-racial culture all these kinds of

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480
post-racial culture all these kinds of
 

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.650
post-racial culture all these kinds of
details we will just assume that we can

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:14.660
details we will just assume that we can
 

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.120
details we will just assume that we can
figure them out or we will assume that

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:16.130
figure them out or we will assume that
 

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.000
figure them out or we will assume that
that it's something as we read them that

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:19.010
that it's something as we read them that
 

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.460
that it's something as we read them that
will we'll have to to look up instead of

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:21.470
will we'll have to to look up instead of
 

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:25.600
will we'll have to to look up instead of
demanding that our writers give us some

demanding that our writers give us some
 

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:26.919
demanding that our writers give us some
gloss right in the middle of a poem I

00:21:26.919 --> 00:21:26.929
gloss right in the middle of a poem I
 

00:21:26.929 --> 00:21:32.269
gloss right in the middle of a poem I
think we're on our way

00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:32.279
 

00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:34.860

when I be when I was named poet laureate

what does that mean to promote poetry I

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260
what does that mean to promote poetry I
 

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.810
what does that mean to promote poetry I
said well what's the budget because

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:33.820
said well what's the budget because
 

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.789
said well what's the budget because
you're gonna promote me but and I got a

00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:35.799
you're gonna promote me but and I got a
 

00:22:35.799 --> 00:22:38.610
you're gonna promote me but and I got a
kind of a blank stare so I thought okay

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:38.620
kind of a blank stare so I thought okay
 

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.680
kind of a blank stare so I thought okay
this means that you make it up as you go

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:40.690
this means that you make it up as you go
 

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:43.169
this means that you make it up as you go
along what else does you know I'm an

00:22:43.169 --> 00:22:43.179
along what else does you know I'm an

artist I could create and I decided to

00:22:46.139 --> 00:22:46.149
artist I could create and I decided to
 

00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:49.769
artist I could create and I decided to
just do things and figured they would

00:22:49.769 --> 00:22:49.779
just do things and figured they would
 

00:22:49.779 --> 00:22:51.289
just do things and figured they would
stop me if they didn't have enough money

00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:51.299
stop me if they didn't have enough money
 

00:22:51.299 --> 00:22:55.019
stop me if they didn't have enough money
