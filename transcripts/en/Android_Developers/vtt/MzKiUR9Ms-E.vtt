00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.679
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Welcome to this week's Android
Developer Office Hours from Europe. And we

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:17.760
are today in Campus London our start up building
in East London. They're sleeping around about.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:29.890
So, obviously we haven't had the chance to
decorate yet. But we are in the stream, yes.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:43.920
And hopefully the video quality and the sound
quality is a little bit better. And we'll

00:00:43.920 --> 00:01:03.960
try to make it look a little bit prettier
over the coming weeks. Joining as always,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.770
Matthew Gaunt.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Hello.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.979
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: And Nick Butcher.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT]

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:21.520
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: You know, I think today's word
of this week would be [INDISTINCT] oh, lovely.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.250
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: In our well, lo-end vacation day.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: He's on vacation.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.480
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Americans are [INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: And well, I guess we'll get started.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.830
Welcome to the people who've joined us in
the Hangout. I'll be looking down here quite

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:57.390
a lot, down here quite a lot because that's
where the [INDISTINCT]. Hey Andrew and hey

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:07.280
Al. Why don't you say hello, just want to
make sure that we can hear you.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.770
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Hey guys.
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.869
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Hey Al.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Hey.

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:22.340
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Thanks for that, I can hear you.
Just bringing up the [INDISTINCT] for my little

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:35.440
device down here. Oh, that's where the open
[INDISTINCT] I think the other devices. So,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:50.480
the big news of the day of course being, the
jolly good statues back on the lawn? That

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.159
was a big move wasn't it?
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:06.159
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Crazy long antennae. I need to
go and see it, and to see if they really are

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.890
that longer than the [INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:16.170
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: The look of that--the antennaeů
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It's got bigger reception now.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.170
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: It's cool
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.080
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: It can pickup its home signal
from wherever that is.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.489
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I remember seeing that they day
before [INDISTINCT]

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:36.659
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Is that what I think it is?
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: The event's going on. So Rich

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.449
and I we're looking up to visit Israel last
week where we met up with the locals. We developed

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:45.310
[INDISTINCT] there, it's very, very active
[INDISTINCT]. And so we may have to--kind

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.249
of he talked Android and the design and, you
know, [INDISTINCT]

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:51.650
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Uh-hmm.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And then here in London this week,

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.400
Friday [INDISTINCT] in fact, there's going
to be another developer then here at Google

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:07.059
Campus. The--and here in London as well. I
hope we--I hope that you know about it because

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:12.959
tickets are sold out already. We're looking
forward to meeting up today [INDISTINCT] Android

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.169
fest this weekend.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: So yeah that's theů

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.160
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: DotFest.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: [INDISTINCT] Slowly--something round

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.159
isn't it?
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-hmm.

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:28.639
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: So we even got tickets for this
and we think it [INDISTINCT] and then maybe

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.139
[INDISTINCT]. They're organizers kind of [INDISTINCT]
Thank you. Yes, oh yes.

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.840
&gt;&gt;THOMPSON: Thus by 50 [INDISTINCT] transporting
across the world over the next few months.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.810
We'll look out for those. Probably talk to
[INDISTINCT] and supported by Google Teams

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:56.190
on the ground [INDISTINCT]. What I was going
to say, the big news of course.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.539
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yes.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: It wasn't [INDISTINCT] statue

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:08.009
going back. The big news [INDISTINCT] us,
Android [INDISTINCT] is billion. [INDISTINCT]

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.860
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER. [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: [INDISTINCT] the world.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.060
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Half or three in the nation.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.169
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: And I've done editing for it.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.260
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: We're announcing today, you know,
[INDISTINCT]

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:27.080
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Is that what the antenna was for?
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: [INDISTINCT] and what? So hope

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:34.800
a billion activations of Android devices which
probably doesn't come much for shock because

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.930
Eric Schmidt announces it's one I'm going
to believe. [INDISTINCT] Still who wants to

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.289
join us in the Hangout? Andrew, we've got
Michael [INDISTINCT] and myself, Richard Thompson.

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:56.319
Does anyone from the Hangout have a question
before we'd get in to the moderator today?

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:04.340
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Just go a quick thing today. The
guys, who are running the Dotfest in London

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.750
have released some standing remaining tickets.
So there are a few still remaining. So people

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.479
heading to London, Dotfest.com they may get
tickets if they feel like standing all day.

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.320
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Very good. In London Dotfest.com
[INDISTINCT]

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.130
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah. I meanů
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah. I'll put a link in the comments

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.330
as well.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Perfect. Great.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.170
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Dotfest.info my mistake.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: .info?

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.840
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Maybe that's going to make the

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:35.030
mic a bit hard to hear.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: All right. We were worried about

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:42.479
this. We didn't wire ourselves up with the
pen mics, which the studio people apparently

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:47.949
provided us. So, if it's too quietů
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: We have options.

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:54.909
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: We do have options. So it might
get really loud now instead of being quite

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:55.909
quiet.
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: No, that's good with me.

00:06:55.909 --> 00:07:00.680
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So you can moderate also from
our side.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.100
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I just need a hand.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Hey Michael is that better? Is

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.690
this thing even on?
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yup we can here you.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.509
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: All right. I'll just put that
on the desk. By then every time I lean on

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:17.579
the desk you'll get a big knocking noise.
So you think problems neverů

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:20.759
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: No.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: We're just noisy. It must be

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:26.410
coming through right now as we [INDISTINCT]
microphones, we do get told to wear. And we're

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:31.629
like, no we don't need those. Maybe we do.
Sorry that this isn't entirely Android focus.

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:36.410
We should've found some Android microphones.
[INDISTINCT] Here we go. Okay, I'm on. It's

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.409
for you guys. Moderates, nothing come up in
here.

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:44.030
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Here we go. Is that any good Michael?
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yup. Michael says so much better,

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.129
thank you. Well thank you for mentioning it
because we have realized on the YouTube video

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:54.190
afterwards and have to take it down.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And other news, new Google developers'

00:07:54.190 --> 00:08:00.900
live video launched yesterday. So Roman Nurik
and myself start an Android design in action

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:09.310
shows. So, where we're focusing on how to--how
to implement Android design. And we did it

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:16.400
in a form of a--an app make over where we
take three of the applications which the--an

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.129
app [INDISTINCT] lookout on every Friday.
And we applied the Android design philosophy

00:08:19.129 --> 00:08:25.419
to them to kind of like reskin and to looking
for the Android looking feel. And so hopefully

00:08:25.419 --> 00:08:32.099
that was informative a lot of people out there
to learn what would, you know, how to apply,

00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:37.360
add Holo kind of design language to your applications.
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Okay. I actually saw it live when

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:44.570
you guys were doing it, it was brilliant.
I mean, you guys had the before and after

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:52.160
shots. So, you went through the mistakes in
the apps. And then what was good about the

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.090
redesign version. I found it really useful.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah. I found that format of the

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:01.490
two side by side, you know, really, really
helpful too kind of. It speaks volumes, you

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.410
know, rather than reading documentationů
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yes.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:15.750
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ůof the App. That's what--that's
what I should do. So I hope that's ease with

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.780
you guys. And actually Roman did that the
markups last week. So he'd already [INDISTINCT]

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.330
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: He always does, Roman's superman.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.030
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So, done?
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: As we said, so any live question

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:33.340
or should we jump into the moderator?
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Andrew liked the Android design

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.530
video as well.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, excellent.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:43.960
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: People shaking their heads no.
So, let's jump into the moderator, of which

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.840
I have a copy on my Nexus 7 in here. That's
what the little black window in the Hangout's

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.190
for. I need to show you things, one sec. So
here.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.610
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Go ahead Rick the app.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Okay. RE, this is from Phil H,

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:06.580
in the UK. Google Play in app purchases, I
want to be able to get the price for an in

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:11.630
app purchase product by the product ID when
the app starts. From the billing info page

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:16.120
it doesn't seem possible. Anyone know this
is possible? So Phil unfortunately we don't

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.300
have an API for retrieving the prices from
the Play Store into application. Better the

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:29.290
same time we recommend that you show the prices
in your applications because it reduces your

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:34.390
cancellation rights. So the thing that you
can do is obviously query your own server

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:40.340
for those prices and the Play Store accepts
the CSV input file to import pricing information.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:48.940
So you can hold it all on your server and
export it as a CSV and import it into the

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.510
Play Store and your server being single price
all theů

00:10:53.510 --> 00:11:00.440
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: We could have embed that same
CSV app as an asset. And assets part of--but

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:07.910
it doesn't mean you're going to have to update
your information from the change of prices.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.050
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: But, yes. So we recommend the

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:14.529
server based approach. You can download that
same CSV file.

00:11:14.529 --> 00:11:21.280
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: But the Play Team are indeed
aware of the fact that than API is very much

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:29.330
desired. And although they're currently working
very hard on a developing console, they do

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:37.830
have a list of feedback from Google Play.
And the prices in that's definitely in it.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:43.230
So sorry that's not available quite yet. Not
at all. Next up. I read that apps that define

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:46.580
users feature Android hardware camera in the
manifest won't be in the Nexus 7, it only

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:57.670
has a front facing camera. That's true. However
my photo app should work on the Nexus 7 using

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:04.850
camera in turn, what to do? So you can specify
requires--users features camera, and then

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:10.370
required equals false. And the it will pay--will
work on the Nexus 7 up here in the Play Store

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:15.680
and everything will go ahead and work. So
I would recommend if you want your app to

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:21.660
show on a Nexus 7, so that it uses the feature
camera but it's required.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.520
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Okay. So then Andrew's gone on saying,
my question relates the entry and the manifest

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:32.620
that Nexus 7 users can download the app devices
without Camera ET, Google TV won't have the

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:38.470
app show up when they search. And so yes,
in terms of basically enabling Google TV you

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:43.990
have to actually disable touch screen, but
that's normally a clear far way of basically

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.120
saying don't allow it on Google TV because
obviously, they're only touch screens. So

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:52.080
that would be covered really, I think it's
something what we've done to insure that you

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:58.690
really have to actually say, "I'm going to
spoke it with TV. So that should be an issue.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.170
And, yeah, no touch screen TVs yet. Yet, one
thatů

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.880
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I was in a department store on
weekend there's a big, you know TV and they

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.780
guy was trying to touch all the iconsů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.190
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ůscroll all the different apps.
And maybe, you think how long until you do

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:13.520
that?
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: [INDISTINCT]

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:19.290
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: If you have kids.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I'm not sure if you want that.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:23.510
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: I have hand prints all over my
TV, anyway that's how I'm used to that kind

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:24.640
of stuff.
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: ViewSonic launched yesterday a

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:30.730
TV which has Android on it which is a resistive
touch screen that's about 27 inches.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:35.210
&gt;&gt;THOMPSON: How many inches?
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I think it's around 27, I meanů

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:41.610
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: 27 inch resistive screen, wow.
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah. Let me take out the link

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.630
and I'll post it out so you guys can drool
over it.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.550
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah. There are a couple of manufacturers
that are payingů

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.330
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Soů
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Wouldn't it be cool [INDISTINCT]

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.430
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: I see what Andrew's saying about
the--he just post it in the chat as well.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:57.580
What about other devices that don't have cameras.
I had this conversation with another partner

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:05.270
recently. I couldn't actually think of one.
Between us we never came up with another device

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:11.750
that doesn't have a camera, that's all.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I think if it happens then at the

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.590
very, very last resort you could just block
it and do the bestů

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.490
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: You could blacklist it. Make
it open to everything except Google TVs.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.270
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Nexus Q?
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: That's unlikely.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.420
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Obviouslyů
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I think if you canů

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.210
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It just speaks to the whole Android
approach really isn't it? You shouldn't really

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:28.150
think in concrete devices. You should probably
think in capabilities and users speak to us

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:32.741
using speeches that will define the capabilities
you require and things you don't require and

00:14:32.741 --> 00:14:36.640
then these packets match to enable them [INDISTINCT]
send all.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.340
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Andrew says, Nexus Q as well.
Yeah. I mean, Nexus Q.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:47.600
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: The Nexus Q again would not have
a touch screen. So that's one way base to

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.930
know. And [INDISTINCT] else if they put USB
camera on that was supported and then what

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.150
happens?
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Right. It's a funny one.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.410
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Because the app have no functionality.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:08.630
I'm looking over here because I'm just [INDISTINCT]
because the app have no functionality that

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:17.450
could be used--could not import photos and
use them in your application like Instagram

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:29.380
is still very useful without the cameras.
And I hope I answer that. Andrew is typing.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:45.700
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Just for you to know, we're not
looking at the cameras because we got a screen,

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:53.650
it's just slightly, uh, off of the camera
so whenever anyone else talks we kind of have

00:15:53.650 --> 00:16:05.380
to look a little bit away.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: To give you the side of what we're

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.380
like.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yes.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:11.110
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Well, just figuring out all [INDISTINCT]
in the studio because the chat window is for

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:19.440
me it's in front of us right now as we can't
actually read it and as we [INDISTINCT]. Andrew

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:24.330
is still typing. Okay. I'll get back to it
as soon as he's finished.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:29.310
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Next muffin.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Muffin? Where does that come

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:33.620
from?
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: It's a comedian in YouTube.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.260
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Lame joke.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: [INDISTINCT]

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:41.010
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: I don't get it. Why would Nexus

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:45.780
7 not support the camera if it has a front
one? The app is pretty useless and the device

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.030
is the best camera?
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Essentially it's a legacy thing

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:53.910
that Android got hardware and no camera. I
think it's the biggest feature the camera

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:57.790
we're facing [INDISTINCT] so there's another
feature under the Android camera front facing

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:02.750
so you can specify it individually but if
you just use the camera urgent than that implies

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:12.610
real basic camera which the Nexus 7 just now.
It's in the docs [INDISTINCT] when you look

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:20.290
at the [INDISTINCT] users feature and stuff
but it's--perhaps not the [INDISTINCT]

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:25.410
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: And it's documented. Yeah, it
just treats it as rear camera, unfortunately.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:29.360
Okay. Anythingů
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah, there is one I add. I think

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.160
[INDISTINCT] in his talk this year [INDISTINCT]
so--what's his talk all about?

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.360
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah. Making good apps great.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.280
I think.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Or I'll let you [INDISTINCT]

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.300
&gt;&gt; I [INDISTINCT] but it's fine, it's fine
thank you [INDISTINCT] for now.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.400
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah, sorry, Andrew that is--you
understand the situation. That's exactly the

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.600
situation right now there isn't any magic
way around it I think you got the general

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:54.370
gist in it. So, is there any documentation
I could search for it on creating my own app

00:17:54.370 --> 00:18:01.059
store. I'd like to have and app store of approved
only apps for use in education, health care.

00:18:01.059 --> 00:18:03.460
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT] with Al?
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah, I'm sure the documentation

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:07.620
would be a hundreds of pages. There's nothing
definitive, there are various third party

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:12.910
companies who will quite happily provide branded
apps stores or if you--if one of these--a

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:17.150
example it's basically just a system that
can download a list of available apps. You

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:23.840
can check for updates and can download those
updates. I'm happy to talk about it offline

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.789
but there's a lot of wok for something that
maybe a small project.

00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:31.760
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: For those who don't know Al, that
was the [INDISTINCT] app store is [INDISTINCT]

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.760
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT:[INDISTINCT]

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.570
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Alternatively a much, much, much,
much, much, much, much easier approach would

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:44.450
be to launch that into the Play Store or however
you want to distribute it which is linked

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:49.450
back to apps in the Play Store.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Uh-hmm.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:53.780
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So here's my [INDISTINCT] apps
but then.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.940
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yes. It is actually [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So thenů

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.340
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: ůadjacent [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:09.180
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: [INDISTINCT] considering the feat.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: And you got a free all the update

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.670
ultimate basic functionality on the bandwidth
costs and all that already shoulder out by

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:14.160
us andů
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And it has the benefit of you

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:20.010
able to then put that app in the Play Store.
You can't list another store in the Play Store.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.510
It's one of theů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yes.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:27.080
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ůthe rules there isů
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: But that's how videos [INDISTINCT]

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.570
zone works, isn't it?
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Exactly.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:35.760
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah, [INDISTINCT] zone is a
good example of what exactly what we're talking

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:44.390
about. This links straight back to us. Any
comment on that, that was actually from [INDISTINCT]

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:49.890
again, you should turn your microphone on
Andre, come on.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:54.310
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: And we got another one from Andre
[INDISTINCT]

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:58.840
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Hold on. He's just laughing at
us now.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.860
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: All right. He's jumping [INDISTINCT]
comments [INDISTINCT]

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:07.890
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Oh, yeah.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And is asking if anyone knows

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:26.030
how you get your--how you can replace the
glass in the Nexus 7 because a friend has

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:31.540
dropped it on a concrete floor in two hours
applying it.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.540
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Oh.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Ouch.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:41.710
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I think that's [INDISTINCT] play.google.com
in buying that one but, I don't know if anyone

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:48.760
can replace it. So if anyone knows, anyone
that can help try out then please jive in

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.009
the comments, but I'm not aware of, yeah.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT]

00:20:53.009 --> 00:21:00.210
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah, I don't know where you
can get to patch these things. I don't know

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:05.040
if calling the customers report they would
allow fixing that or paid at your expense,

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:10.210
I don't know.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I think the cost, it might actually

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:16.030
wipe out best just to buy another one, not
just really on, he's [INDISTINCT] Galaxy Nexus

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:20.900
[INDISTINCT] smash screen as well [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah, wondering [INDISTINCT] while

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:27.360
it was raining trying to find a place you
haven't--you don't know? Yeah, that happens.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.210
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: You did? Okay, did you get the
next moderator?

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:38.200
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: This for Josh. Yes, we're all
on the Nexus 7 here. One, two, three, Nexus

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.940
7. Well.
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: [INDISTINCT] planning on.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:47.800
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: We have personalized in different
ways, I don't know why Matt defiled his with

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.820
a cloud, the thing on the back but there you
go.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:58.580
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: It was swag that was it.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Swag. Okay. Yeah, a little bit.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:03.720
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: The question from Andrew Kelly again.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah. I know you don't come until

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:09.200
[INDISTINCT] release in products. We didn't
say that at the start of the show but [INDISTINCT]

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.980
more things that you don't really know except
the last one. But is there any chance that

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.630
the Android plug in for a clip would eventually
include templates and things like Action [INDISTINCT].

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:26.670
This would be a useful feat that would help
adoption of action bar. And else like [INDISTINCT]

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:35.620
so the best place to check is the Google Group,
the adt-dev Google work if you suggested there

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:42.230
and who knows what would happen. Yeah, unfortunately
we can't comment on that whether it's like,

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:50.659
whether it's not likely or anything. That's
it.

00:22:50.659 --> 00:23:00.240
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And yes, please bear in mind is
[INDISTINCT] Google again, I'm proud to say

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:10.570
that we're working on a Google action bar
compatibility library. So, as when that launches

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:18.250
perhaps we'll see that in sometime [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: It'll be annoying if you [INDISTINCT].

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:26.280
Yeah. The next question is from a new person
Andrew Kelly. The one man moderator machine,

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:31.490
Andrew Kelly, is there a nice way to--but
they're good questions.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:37.530
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah, I know.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Is there a nice way to clear

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:42.590
the metadata [INDISTINCT] price? Oh we've
already answered this one earlier in the talk

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:48.000
today. There isn't a nice way. No, we don't
have a [INDISTINCT]

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.369
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: The Monkey has no official API
is the official answer.

00:23:51.369 --> 00:23:55.850
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Uh-hmm. Isn't it the only answer?
A nice way.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.780
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I like it.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:07.620
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: And it says and the rest of his
question is currently scraping. Screen's scraping

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:13.700
in the Google Play website. I'm not doing
some boring spider like profession [INDISTINCT]

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:18.070
&gt;&gt;BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT] there is a bunch of
people who reverse engineered [INDISTINCT]

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.580
that market uses in thisů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:26.220
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Very easy to use.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Used to host them, yeah.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:32.390
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: API but--it's not the official.
It's subject to change, it may break anytime

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.470
so, you know, at your own risk.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: And define--it's still Andrew

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:41.890
telling the next question. I've defined a
thing for my app and the styled things like

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:48.620
buttons, et cetera, but the buttons used in
my dialogue don't seem to pick up the styling,

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:53.130
is there specific base style that I need to
expand the dialogues?

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.950
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I can't remember offhand, probably.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Probably.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:25:01.820
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, I think dialogues come into
their own like [INDISTINCT] spaces of the

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:09.020
thing. See, I always do the thing I do is
I just kind of fire up and [INDISTINCT] small

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.505
[INDISTINCT], you know like shift with the
[INDISTINCT] the platforms that [INDISTINCT]

00:25:12.505 --> 00:25:17.560
and so [INDISTINCT] that's how I always try
to [INDISTINCT] I cannot remember off the

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.390
top of my head.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Kelly, Andrew [INDISTINCT] because

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:28.750
he's misses is watching the X Factor. [INDISTINCT]
one person in X Factor what an Android [INDISTINCT]

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:33.740
office hours. We can talk about X Factor.
Would that be more intriguing [INDISTINCT]

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.980
population. I need to watch it butů
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Actually no, more intriguing than

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.540
Android then.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: You're right. See half billion

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:48.650
devices activated. So back at the top of the--which
we ask is there any questions from inside

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:53.450
to Hangout yet? Because we are munching through
the moderator.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:57.220
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: There's a couple coming on the
[INDISTINCT]

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:05.700
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Let's go for that one.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So Josh, he was asking for using

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:17.520
Nexus 7's [INDISTINCT] in he wants to buy
a Nexus 7. He's a [INDISTINCT] developer [INDISTINCT]

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:23.250
schools, studying all day. And he wants to
use it for testing and finding out. Yeah,

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:28.429
there's no question but I recommend it. It's
a good device, it's a Nexus device, without

00:26:28.429 --> 00:26:32.500
[INDISTINCT] in between you and Google so
its kind of going to get awesome updates and

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:37.080
so on and so as the developer, you can do
a lot of works and this was on pretty reasonable

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:42.960
price so I highly recommended it. I love mine.
Any more questions?

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:48.210
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: There's another on the bottom of
the [INDISTINCT] actually [INDISTINCT] service

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.450
to get updates from a server. Updates are
not scheduled, it's random. Thank you.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:55.870
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Sounds to me like a perfect case
of push messaging using GCM, Google Cloud

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:58.570
Messaging.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: That's what I do.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:03.370
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So that just requires to have
some kind of server infrastructure of your

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:08.620
own. So you have to use your server infrastructure
to ping our push servers which will then send

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:15.909
a [INDISTINCT] to the device. So, that is
one requirements you could set up that [INDISTINCT]

00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:21.520
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: For example to do that if that's

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:28.110
not possible then yes you could use the [INDISTINCT]
manager to schedule to wake up and start a

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:39.650
service to grab and check for a place essentially
but my gut feeling is to try to get a push

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:45.910
for this kind of non scheduled thing because
you'll be much more [INDISTINCT] and also

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:52.130
updates would come through faster, you know,
just try [INDISTINCT] push down the device

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.590
of the [INDISTINCT] and have some period of
delay.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:28:01.670
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah, please, don't make a polling
service at least that would be pretty hard

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:10.560
in this, I guessů
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And if you do you use the inexact

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:21.410
for [INDISTINCT] that's the Android [INDISTINCT]
to try lining all up so you're not waking

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:30.560
up the device the whole time.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: That'll be bad if you don't do

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:39.710
that then you can start occurring battery
[INDISTINCT] and battery hog. And people will

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:46.030
uninstall your app and boo. We're in public.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:53.180
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: That's just boo. What is from--for
us the recommended way to control super light

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:58.600
database connection in a multi threaded environment?
Is having warnings system database help us

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.920
share between threads is a good idea and does
using a content provider help? Yes, using

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.670
a content provider is the recommended way
to control a super light database generally

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:13.320
inside Android. Yeah, you know, it's just
going to provide the functionality and synchronization

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:19.530
that you need. Without you having to code
it at all yourself. I would personally go

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:25.340
for content writer in the situation. I know
other devs have gone for single terms and,

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.600
you knowů
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Uh-hmm.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.040
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: ůtrying to synchronize it themselves
and things that--passing [INDISTINCT] around.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.340
But I mean ContentProvider is the thing that
Android provides to do it. So unless you're

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.360
pretty confident about coding it up yourself,
you might as well check the ContentProvider.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:38.760
There's a lot of good sample code for ContentProviders
out there.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:44.100
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah. The less kind of multi [INDISTINCT]
synchronization code you write yourself the

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.090
better. Just for the [INDISTINCT] in it makes
us.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:52.220
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Indeed. I'm just scrolling down
to the [INDISTINCT] again.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:30:00.090
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So, it where in the [INDISTINCT]
is there a way to get a list of counts with

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:04.770
out going through the AccountManager to actually
by the ContactsContracts.setting will always

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.670
returns zero with anything by [INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Oh, I'm [INDISTINCT]ContactsContracts.setting

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:14.040
I'm not quiet sure what it is because I've
always just used the AccountManager to get

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.179
list of the accounts and device.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Me too.

00:30:17.179 --> 00:30:21.730
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And then why would youů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: I mean, definitelyů

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:27.759
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ůwant to void that? Are you trying
to not have to ask for the permission, I guess?

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:32.220
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: But then you're still doing the
thing with permission. Why would you try and

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:37.130
get around the permission and then just go.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It makes me feel likeů

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:42.470
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Sounds sneaky.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah. We feel like the AccountManager

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:49.750
is the right way to do this.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah. In ContactsContracts. Yeah.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:57.290
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Hey, it's possible about settings
returning zero because you don't have the

00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:02.150
AccountManager's permission as well. Other
things outside ofů

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:07.260
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-hmm. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: It might be using the AccountManager

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:12.180
to get those things. You should just check
in the API docs if it says it requires those

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:17.350
permissions. It would be strange if we did
have a way of getting around the AccountManager

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:21.940
permission and we'd probably try and close
it if there was a way.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.760
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah. I would say. It's never
been.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.529
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Security issue.

00:31:26.529 --> 00:31:32.110
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah. Okay. In which case we
are--can we refresh this? Sometimes they're

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:37.070
coming during the--during the a couple of
minutes away.

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.679
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: There's a question in Google+
stream again.

00:31:39.679 --> 00:31:41.639
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yup.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT] up byů

00:31:41.639 --> 00:31:42.940
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Aviva.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Aviva.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.899
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Best way toů

00:31:44.899 --> 00:31:47.840
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Hi, Aviva.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ůdraw charts on Android. And

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.120
anyone got the--you recommended the charting
libraries?

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.200
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: I don't know.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Is a [INDISTINCT] which I know

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.000
before.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: I drew my own once.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.580
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Did you?
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Some pixels and lines and stuff.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.669
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I did mineů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: It's on a canvas.

00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:02.820
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: ůas well.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.220
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It could be a canvas.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.690
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: That wasů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:15.200
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I ended up with just trying to make
a wrong chart which was just highly generic

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:22.430
and just try to stick to a bit and adapt the
patterns, so I wasn't constantly going in

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:29.450
adding in pixels left, front and center. And
it's not too bad to do on your own. It may

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:37.690
be nice if there was just [INDISTINCT] directly
but I can't say I found any. I don't think

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:41.260
some people might be changing this one.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah. I didn't try anything.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:45.840
Which one did I use? Any past on [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT]

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.610
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: [INDISTINCT] she did a graph
but then I can't remember.

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:53.750
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And it's kind ofů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: [INDISTINCT] I was truly at home.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.700
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I know.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: You eventually Android you are

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.059
keep on reviewing.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Fix out, it's brings out some

00:32:59.059 --> 00:33:03.029
interior interesting ones a Chartdroid Android
plots and H [INDISTINCT] engine.

00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:06.250
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Uh-hmm.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So I can't recommend them by myself.

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:10.440
Is there anyone live can comment on their
experience using this [INDISTINCT] engines,

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:15.160
then that's fine. There was an interesting
on I remember seeing [INDISTINCT] open source

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:20.270
[INDISTINCT]. And we have a [INDISTINCT] package
thing. They open sourced that up. And that

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:26.340
had some pretty roughs in it. I--well, it
might be worth checking up. I don't know what

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.460
it is, but a little attractive.
&gt;&gt; No.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.400
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: You know, Track is always better.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I think so.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.810
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Uh-hmm.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: At least try it for attractive.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:34.810
Obviously that way.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: What?

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:37.580
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So, someone else has joined us
in the Hangout. Scott, hey Scott Howell. Do

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.039
you have any questions for us today in the
Hangout?

00:33:40.039 --> 00:33:41.960
&gt;&gt; HOWELL: No. Just listening in, thank you
though.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:49.280
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Thanks for joining. Looks like
you got quite a tech desk set up over there.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:53.530
&gt;&gt; HOWELL: That's not what my wife calls it.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah. I've got it. So next fun.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:57.500
It's not a proper game.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So, where are you joining us from,

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.340
Scott?
&gt;&gt; HOWELL: I'm sorry, say again?

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:02.400
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Where are you joining us from?
&gt;&gt; HOWELL: South Florida.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.760
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, lovely.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: How nice. What time is it? Jeez.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.210
8:00, 6:00--no it's not.
&gt;&gt; HOWELL: It's 9:30 AM.

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.510
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: It's not so bad.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Not far from here.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:16.950
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Excellent. Well, welcome here.
If you do have any questions, feel free to

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:20.479
jump in because we're out.
&gt;&gt; HOWELL: It's nice to be [INDISTINCT] stuck

00:34:20.479 --> 00:34:25.279
up for your link.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: To every chance in library [INDISTINCT]

00:34:25.279 --> 00:34:29.639
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah. And there's tons
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And let's put in.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:36.129
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah. Android charts, graphs, diagrams,
perhaps putting a draw thing. This is the

00:34:36.129 --> 00:34:43.619
one I'm stuck up in replacing, so we can go
and--yeah, you'll be set like go off from

00:34:43.619 --> 00:34:47.300
packages. Yeah, tons.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: I guess Aviva was actually looking

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:53.290
for a recommendation from us, then he's found
out and got all--there's hundreds of these

00:34:53.290 --> 00:35:00.690
things, which one should I use?
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Or at least like--it's not the main

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:03.979
top answers listed down to three. Which is
Chartdroid, Android [INDISTINCT] HR and then

00:35:03.979 --> 00:35:05.769
[INDISTINCT] and soů
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Some of the others have a commercial

00:35:05.769 --> 00:35:15.249
license as well. So it's a--Google it out.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: How dare they try to make money.

00:35:15.249 --> 00:35:24.290
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: The most expenses of all those
is over $300, so.

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:29.040
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Wow.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I was like one of my own choice

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:33.289
comes to be with the Canvas.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah. Can't get wrong.

00:35:33.289 --> 00:35:39.599
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: I have a contacts and I think
that's when I click that [INDISTINCT], oh,

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:45.270
is that one of my own.
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: There's nothing like a chunk of

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:47.859
Canvas because [INDISTINCT] later.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Nothing like a chunk of Canvas.

00:35:47.859 --> 00:35:50.069
Well, since youů
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT]. So why [INDISTINCT]

00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:54.190
ask why Android doesn't have a multiple users
and so anyone who plays Android--well, realize

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:58.650
that there's some [INDISTINCT] of that coming
already open source than Jelly Bean. So watch

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:01.319
this space to see another gets exposed.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah. I've seen people from Android

00:36:01.319 --> 00:36:06.690
use a [INDISTINCT] typing commands into terminals
that Android devices and magic things happening,

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:10.380
so. So we must, what?
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And the next up. Mortz, it's very

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:16.930
funny [INDISTINCT] again asked, is it possible
to buy cards into Google now would know as

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:19.219
an app verifier.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Oh.

00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:25.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So, no. Unfortunately, there is
no develop rate going and [INDISTINCT] as

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:29.480
is. Who knows, maybe in the future hands but
right now, nope.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.920
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Nope.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: That's right.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.920
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: An interesting one.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, that would be fun. Interesting

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.509
to have what kind of we've mentioned you'd
like to surface in there.

00:36:39.509 --> 00:36:44.039
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah. If weů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: If only we could just override--have

00:36:44.039 --> 00:36:50.479
a different weather card to a different source,
maybe there [INDISTINCT] will go pretty well.

00:36:50.479 --> 00:36:53.910
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And some of theů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Okay.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:37:00.880
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ůactions you can form from the
cards to just pile off intense plus you can,

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.569
you know, divide alternative, you knowů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: You have a stock ticker on that

00:37:03.569 --> 00:37:04.569
maybe?
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, I do.

00:37:04.569 --> 00:37:06.440
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: You just went [INDISTINCT] action
to that. I take care of the [INDISTINCT] here.

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.400
Oh, that reminds me, I still have to reply
which notification andů

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.380
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Chronometer.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: ůChronometer. I also might start

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:15.410
with try to get some feed on the app would
be on Friday.

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:18.819
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yes, it would be.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: My mission right now. Because

00:37:18.819 --> 00:37:23.760
I don't want to do some live [INDISTINCT]
again. Fairly, it's quite easy. On my own

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.119
force, just have to set the Chronometer which
notification [INDISTINCT] which you can kill

00:37:26.119 --> 00:37:28.731
it again.
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Do you want let the guys know what

00:37:28.731 --> 00:37:34.019
app review it's going to be Rich?
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: No. Well, thank you for submitting

00:37:34.019 --> 00:37:36.669
it, Al.
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Oh, it's my pleasure.

00:37:36.669 --> 00:37:41.959
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, Al will pay for it.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Al will pay for it, yeah.

00:37:41.959 --> 00:37:44.609
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I didn't know that.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Soů

00:37:44.609 --> 00:37:49.190
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Good choice to that teaching out.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: ůthe American side about team

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:54.490
reviewing timer and countdown apps on Friday
and Al knows that I've made one about 50,000

00:37:54.490 --> 00:38:00.681
years ago. My first star Android. So we put
it up for review. So my team's going to rip

00:38:00.681 --> 00:38:06.309
me apart or a new one or some place on Friday
which is nice.

00:38:06.309 --> 00:38:14.920
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Well, making of that [INDISTINCT]
how awesome it is.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:24.279
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: They might. And if they do, it
will all be down to Marie's [INDISTINCT] much

00:38:24.279 --> 00:38:28.789
better designs than mine.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Even though I apparently I didn't

00:38:28.789 --> 00:38:33.970
implement them properly. We still tried to
distance ourselves somewhat from the app.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:38.369
I kind of like my designs.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So I think [INDISTINCT].

00:38:38.369 --> 00:38:46.039
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah. You don't need a few page,
the machine countdown and so much.

00:38:46.039 --> 00:38:50.369
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: I'll do that as well. Open a

00:38:50.369 --> 00:38:56.849
few page and you'll then open the--you play
didn't exist back then. Swiping didn't exist

00:38:56.849 --> 00:39:04.140
gestures. They were voice [INDISTINCT]. Okay.
Why we're kind of filling in time here because

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:11.730
we've got half an hour to go.
&gt;&gt; KELLY: [INDISTINCT]

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:16.099
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Only one participant, let's jump
on him quick.

00:39:16.099 --> 00:39:23.480
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No. The other one.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: It says his name is Zabi. He's

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:30.260
got picture, doesn't have a video. Doesn't
have a video, maybe he has a microphone. Hey

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.680
Zabi, do you have a question for us?
&gt;&gt; Okay. I'm sorry. [INDISTINCT]

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:40.119
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Have you exhausted him?
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Remind you if it wasn't for Android

00:39:40.119 --> 00:39:49.660
Kelly, this Hangout would have been four minutes.
But fortunately [INDISTINCT] got all the questions

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:54.559
ever. I think you want [INDISTINCT]. And it's
also the--it's the other question. He asked

00:39:54.559 --> 00:40:00.609
for some question for you. Seven people interested
in aů

00:40:00.609 --> 00:40:16.460
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I knew we pick on the live participants
say a couple of years you said that you changed

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:24.190
into the Android design action session yesterday?
Any feedback? Anything you like to--you want

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:32.939
to see more of, you've spent too long or very
useful? Anything, that when we used for that?

00:40:32.939 --> 00:40:39.930
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: One other that could be cool would
be, if you could get the developers to join

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:47.489
in as well and say whether there's something
thinking behind the designs or how sort of

00:40:47.489 --> 00:40:59.549
that, like to implement them because it's
quite closing the design changes but hearing

00:40:59.549 --> 00:41:05.619
about how they try to implement as well that'd
be useful.

00:41:05.619 --> 00:41:13.740
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I think there's something they knew,
the guys in the US do there. I think they

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:18.540
had a couple of [INDISTINCT] so they actually
have the guys suite develop their on the Hangout

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:27.180
live and it--yeah, you're right, it does add
another level of kind of understanding and

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:30.530
I know you said they got tips and tricks and
quite ready to learn.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:35.589
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I understand Nick, you're limited
to about a half an hour, so I--what you can

00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:44.829
do is really limit it and it's kind of a weighing
out between minutes, we've getting more app

00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:48.780
redesigns or whether it's worth fixing on
a few, then.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:55.140
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Well, since [INDISTINCT] yeah,
you know you can make it longer if you think

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:59.200
a longer format would be--would work and we
could make it an hour or less. It's quite

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:07.869
lot of work to the app redesign as it try
to turn around three days a week that it takes--it

00:42:07.869 --> 00:42:12.589
takes probably lots of time. And over [INDISTINCT]
is what [INDISTINCT] straight up. So the good

00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:16.430
thing about the best buying into the a bit
more of a general show as well as to having

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:32.239
more--talking about more in the news, so we
spent a little bit talking abut the Holo Colors

00:42:32.239 --> 00:42:37.390
Generator which actually generate the themes,
the buttons and the next more files.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:40.059
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: True.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: To personalize a few things who

00:42:40.059 --> 00:42:50.880
did more of that kind of news and maybe--I
don't know. Talking about what's going on

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:59.180
in the community, not just being the app,
app redesign. So [INDISTINCT] best way out

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:06.899
a little bit with out, you know, spending
full time job redesigning apps.

00:43:06.899 --> 00:43:13.380
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: That'll be quite cool. Hasn't [INDISTINCT]
produce a video this week in Android or something

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:18.119
like that? That wasů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: He did five minutes work on what's

00:43:18.119 --> 00:43:21.679
coming up this week which we're halfway through
now.

00:43:21.679 --> 00:43:25.229
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: That was a--that was also pretty

00:43:25.229 --> 00:43:31.769
useful because there's some other things that
were going on that I wasn't aware of, so.

00:43:31.769 --> 00:43:39.299
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: We've got some upcoming other
ways on discovering our videos scene as well

00:43:39.299 --> 00:43:49.079
and keeping up to date with everything that's
going on this pretty much not constant TV

00:43:49.079 --> 00:43:56.430
channel. If you go to developers.google.com
like and cross all our products. The calendar

00:43:56.430 --> 00:44:06.759
is almost full. Soon there'll be more than
one show onů

00:44:06.759 --> 00:44:14.369
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Wednesday [INDISTINCT] day.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Wednesday straight through the

00:44:14.369 --> 00:44:27.709
whole day you can watch something from the
Google Team live on YouTube live.

00:44:27.709 --> 00:44:43.239
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And don't worry as soon you guys
tune into multiple office hours sections,

00:44:43.239 --> 00:44:53.720
do tune in to the US one as well.
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I've pick up the Asia Pacific one

00:44:53.720 --> 00:45:01.069
before an [INDISTINCT] it's only 7:00 in the
morning. I watched it during breakfast because

00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:07.630
that's how sad I am, really.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: No, no, I've watched that as

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:15.390
well. They've done a slightly a different
format. They do less questions and they're

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:24.499
doing a bit more news about the week and then
they do a technical part as well. So, here's

00:45:24.499 --> 00:45:30.480
worth watching that and what do you think
of that Al?

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:38.280
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I quite like it. I like the technical
presentation of the start. It will be interesting

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:44.200
to see how many different topics they can
gather and whether they go into depth so whether

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:51.269
they keep stuff quite light. But I think it--what
seems to work quite well and it means that

00:45:51.269 --> 00:45:59.880
they didn't end up with half an hour to fill
up the Android or anything like that so.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.880
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: All right. So, yeah.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.160
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: We've got some more questions.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Questions, questions, questions

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:12.420
going on the [INDISTINCT] here they are.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yes, so David Scott. When in not

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:19.800
[INDISTINCT] is there way to pass some kind
of string like to develop a payload that will

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:23.579
show up on Google checkout/payout [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: No, so all right.

00:46:23.579 --> 00:46:31.140
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: That's quite similar to the other
questions we're using it, trying to find out

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:40.270
the price system. Maybe, maybe not, yeah.
No. Moving on. It's from Chris over here.

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:46.499
And why is HTML5/CSS3 so outrageously bad
on Android--Android devices in general even

00:46:46.499 --> 00:46:56.250
in countries [INDISTINCT] one called devices
the HTML5 experience is really slow. The page

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:59.829
requires [INDISTINCT] especially with [INDISTINCT]
shouldn't it not get more attention? I think

00:46:59.829 --> 00:47:05.770
I'm interested to know with your phone to
like the embeddable web view or whether your

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:09.890
referring to actual Google Chrome because
those are very different. So yeah, Chrome

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:15.789
Team they kind of [INDISTINCT] on the HTML5
spec and noticeable thing speed et cetera.

00:47:15.789 --> 00:47:20.099
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And they [INDISTINCT] yet.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: If you're working [INDISTINCT]

00:47:20.099 --> 00:47:24.420
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: What's going on?
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Oh, it's Andrew's mic, sorry.

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:28.209
I'm going to meet you Andrew. I unless you
want to, you know, you want to say something

00:47:28.209 --> 00:47:30.759
before you get muted? No?
&gt;&gt; KELLY: No, that's all right.

00:47:30.759 --> 00:47:32.829
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Denied.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Sorry, you've been muted. Much

00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:40.400
as the X Factor I think we can just listen
to five seconds of anything with out having

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:44.319
copyright issues.
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Hoping back to the HTML5 thing

00:47:44.319 --> 00:47:52.200
is probably also worth thinking about the
processing power of mobile devices. A lot

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.009
of websites I've seenů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yes.

00:47:54.009 --> 00:47:57.700
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: ůand they started getting into
really complex stuff already designed for

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:02.509
desktops. So trying to run them on a mobile
processor is just painful. It's [INDISTINCT]

00:48:02.509 --> 00:48:11.450
to trying to run Flash on a mobile processor.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah. I'll ask you in a point

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:15.430
even core level devices you compare that quad
core desktop that performances deference's

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:17.880
still matter.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah. And it's layers, layers,

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:22.170
upon layers, upon layers of abstraction [INDISTINCT]
when you have these resources trained devices

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:30.150
that closer you get like down the stack the
more performance you're going to get as you

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:37.579
add more lays like a web layer on top and
that's something [INDISTINCT]

00:48:37.579 --> 00:48:41.769
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yes, benefits the web jail something.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I think we've seen the trend of

00:48:41.769 --> 00:48:47.859
big developers moving away from a lot like
Facebook into myself as well with, what's

00:48:47.859 --> 00:48:54.099
the best comments today and that's all [INDISTINCT]
and make it as a wonder listů

00:48:54.099 --> 00:48:58.929
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: They got away from HTML.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: They were titanium andů

00:48:58.929 --> 00:49:02.439
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ůthey've gone native now andů

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:07.269
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah. That was [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: For much better performance still

00:49:07.269 --> 00:49:11.660
looks like [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Do they say we've launched already

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:12.660
or is it sneaky? Did they say they launched
already?

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.759
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yes.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Does it have a Google task I'm

00:49:14.759 --> 00:49:17.269
thinking.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I haven't checked that.

00:49:17.269 --> 00:49:22.619
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: I shall check it. Okay. [INDISTINCT]
whether that app does look iOSed or not.

00:49:22.619 --> 00:49:25.670
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: It was quite interesting that yesterday
at the Tech crunch conference from [INDISTINCT]

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:28.289
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: ůactually said the--they're moving

00:49:28.289 --> 00:49:33.519
towards HTML5 was probably one of the worst
mistakes his made on mobile so.

00:49:33.519 --> 00:49:37.629
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: So we've wasted two years of
everyone's time or something.

00:49:37.629 --> 00:49:40.609
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Like the HTML5. Pretty interesting

00:49:40.609 --> 00:49:46.589
thing [INDISTINCT] which is natural comes
out. Does it like and how fast and super snappy

00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:52.899
it is like they've already put a lot of effort
in making amazing there with a lot of anticipation.

00:49:52.899 --> 00:49:54.339
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: But the Android doesn't really
requiresů

00:49:54.339 --> 00:49:55.960
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Oh, I putů
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It's grand [INDISTINCT]

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.549
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: We build with Android apps.

00:49:58.549 --> 00:50:02.339
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: And they're still hiring more people
as well so they're building and building that

00:50:02.339 --> 00:50:04.119
team.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Talking about how many people.

00:50:04.119 --> 00:50:07.690
So, advertising is not here, yeah, our time--our
team--a time. Our team is currently looking

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:11.420
for one new member to sit here in the London
office. So if you're into Android and you

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:19.209
can see developer advocacy of Android. Get
in touch on me on Google+. I'm really looking

00:50:19.209 --> 00:50:27.500
for someone with some European language skills
but, there you go. Get in touch with me on

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:35.029
Google+ and we can have a talk about it. Okay.
Our team we can fill the spot soon before

00:50:35.029 --> 00:50:38.919
we [INDISTINCT] headcount comes and go like
anything in Google.

00:50:38.919 --> 00:50:43.029
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And what went pretty well, I thought
[INDISTINCT]

00:50:43.029 --> 00:50:47.130
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: There's another one from David Scott.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Okay.

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:54.440
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: So, this was still the Google Play
getting a payload in the report. What would

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.739
you--what would you suggest the best solution
for an app with the--with possibly 40,000

00:50:57.739 --> 00:50:59.269
separate in app payments with hundreds added
monthly.

00:50:59.269 --> 00:51:03.740
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: What would you suggest the best
solution for an app with 40,000 separate [INDISTINCT]

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:06.450
payments?
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT] we work on a magazine

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:07.500
appů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: What?

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:11.140
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ů[INDISTINCT] application which
we can download more for magazines and issues

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:12.140
there off [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Okay. Well, definitely the [INDISTINCT]

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:14.539
who knows if anyone tested the CSV import
and export with 40,000 items in it but that's

00:51:14.539 --> 00:51:16.970
going to way to go, that'sů
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No, I think your trying to look

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:22.969
out sales of individual and stuff.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Well, I have to design the app

00:51:22.969 --> 00:51:26.839
orů
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No, no, we're working on it.

00:51:26.839 --> 00:51:31.200
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Basically you take the CSV filesů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Oh.

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:35.839
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: ůwith it, it will be more useful
to than to use our [INDISTINCT] I imagine.

00:51:35.839 --> 00:51:39.250
I have no idea
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT] we'll pass it to

00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:43.749
the team who built it.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah. I don't know what--in the

00:51:43.749 --> 00:51:49.029
sales report what comes out if you end up
anyway. Since the [INDISTINCT] one separate,

00:51:49.029 --> 00:51:54.269
they must be separate. Surelyů
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: There's a way you can split it and

00:51:54.269 --> 00:51:59.869
just pronounce andů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: On the sales report hopefully

00:51:59.869 --> 00:52:04.809
you'll see what items are purchased. I don't
have an app within app billing in it. It's

00:52:04.809 --> 00:52:08.220
like people [INDISTINCT]. Is there anyone
on the Hangout have an in app billing app

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:10.869
currently live in the Play Store? No, no.
Interesting.

00:52:10.869 --> 00:52:12.890
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Okay.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: That's the place.

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:17.599
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: You'll understand there because
I'm just typing again this being quite a few

00:52:17.599 --> 00:52:25.349
things going to the chat. Scott said GameSalad
and Andrew says he's working on one. I don't

00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:27.219
know why GameSalad came up. Did miss something?
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No, [INDISTINCT]

00:52:27.219 --> 00:52:28.219
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: GameSalad.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yes.

00:52:28.219 --> 00:52:33.029
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: App building up. It's got starting
a new code.

00:52:33.029 --> 00:52:34.710
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: That's not like the old [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: What? A Titanium or what?

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:37.089
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Now, the Android developers [INDISTINCT]
thing the drag-and-drop.

00:52:37.089 --> 00:52:39.940
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah. I thought it went up to
MIT?

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:41.529
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Android app [INDISTINCT].

00:52:41.529 --> 00:52:42.619
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: That [INDISTINCT] GameSalad seems
to be a cross platform application for generating

00:52:42.619 --> 00:52:44.450
apps.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Oh he then says now I got your

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:47.519
attention. How about--how about integrating
voice over IP vehicles. Voice Over IP vehicles

00:52:47.519 --> 00:52:49.009
with Hangouts as my Android so if you want
to.

00:52:49.009 --> 00:52:50.170
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Go in.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Invite people with [INDISTINCT]

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:52.921
Google+ Hangouts maybe.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Is there an intent starting to

00:52:52.921 --> 00:52:53.921
Hangout?
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: That would be very cool.

00:52:53.921 --> 00:52:54.921
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: How about it. Voice Over IP video
calls with Hangouts via Android integrating

00:52:54.921 --> 00:52:55.921
into.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It took him out like I just kicking

00:52:55.921 --> 00:52:58.050
off the--let's say Hangout so it's just [INDISTINCT]
off to Google+ to start it or are you talking

00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:02.359
about having it run in our infrastructure
and then give you a stream [INDISTINCT] video

00:53:02.359 --> 00:53:05.789
shows in your app by playing a game and typing
audio and video or whatever just come out.

00:53:05.789 --> 00:53:08.640
&gt;&gt; HOWELL: It just--it just seemed that it's
a similar technology and you know we've had--we've

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:14.219
had the discussions on it on how to take--say
we've got a video a VoIP called platform how

00:53:14.219 --> 00:53:16.470
to enjoy the versatility of Hangouts within
that, you know, or vice versa. Making a call

00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:17.960
if you will by way of the Google Hangout to
somebody.

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.960
&gt;&gt; Okay. I think [INDISTINCT] with something.
&gt;&gt; I think it's probably [INDISTINCT]

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.069
&gt;&gt; Sort of that. We just dropped out and then
mainů

00:53:21.069 --> 00:53:23.150
&gt;&gt; I think what'sů
&gt;&gt; We'll up here as soon as be coming back

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:24.489
in a second.
&gt;&gt; I think [INDISTINCT] after. Are you talking

00:53:24.489 --> 00:53:26.509
about conferences people and directly into
a Hangout so basically you'll be able to select

00:53:26.509 --> 00:53:30.749
the group of people what you want to join
to Hangout and they get invited in.

00:53:30.749 --> 00:53:32.549
&gt;&gt; HOWELL: Essentially, you know, sure, yeah,
because one--at one level absolutely.

00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:33.609
&gt;&gt; So we missed quite about a bit unfortunately
due to the drop out sorry.

00:53:33.609 --> 00:53:35.180
&gt;&gt; So, I'm still some what confuse. You're
trying to get VoIP trying to [INDISTINCT]

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:36.640
connect to Hangout would you just that you
mean use Hangouts within [INDISTINCT]

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:40.660
&gt;&gt; HOWELL: And then now suggested now even
creating a conference from within a Hangout

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:45.521
to back out to a video call VoIP. The technology
seems similar if you just be interesting to

00:53:45.521 --> 00:53:46.521
enjoy the use of both directions.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:53:46.521 --> 00:53:47.521
&gt;&gt; HOWELL: We'll hang out from [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ůand the Hangouts that are doing

00:53:47.521 --> 00:53:48.521
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:53:48.521 --> 00:53:49.521
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And they set any, you know, we'll
talk about the Hangouts API and what you can't

00:53:49.521 --> 00:53:51.339
do in that, I don't know about, you know,
connections to other, you know, video, audio

00:53:51.339 --> 00:53:57.109
streams and [INDISTINCT] there advice and
that's about it.

00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:59.540
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah, I think very interesting to
know whether you could access through Hangout

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:00.540
API [INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Well, I don't think we can [INDISTINCT]

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:01.540
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: But it's Google+ [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Okay. Listen one more quick run

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:03.230
through the letter [INDISTINCT] and the comments
just in case anything is coming. And I think

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:07.579
we have seven questions, next one is the comments,
right, nothing new coming in? I think about

00:54:07.579 --> 00:54:09.819
several questions next one from the comments,
right, nothing new come in?

00:54:09.819 --> 00:54:10.839
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, [INDISTINCT] come in and
said back to the links to charting libraries.

00:54:10.839 --> 00:54:11.839
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And he's wondering if there's

00:54:11.839 --> 00:54:12.839
a standard implementation. So I don't think
there is one. One thing that I can think off

00:54:12.839 --> 00:54:13.839
is the factory stuff. Not like [INDISTINCT]
to sharing moment this is WiFi and stuff [INDISTINCT]

00:54:13.839 --> 00:54:14.839
it's the same but it might be worth and technically
a source code for that.

00:54:14.839 --> 00:54:15.839
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah, that quite pretty got impressed,

00:54:15.839 --> 00:54:16.839
yes.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT] in the third part

00:54:16.839 --> 00:54:17.839
there is [INDISTINCT] I would think that's
the reason.

00:54:17.839 --> 00:54:18.839
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Plus they don't do what you do.
Tweak them, change them, fix them up, add

00:54:18.839 --> 00:54:19.839
stuff, and then re[INDISTINCT] back to the
community, always another plus.

00:54:19.839 --> 00:54:20.839
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So Phil [INDISTINCT] asking if
the--and the building blocks section of the

00:54:20.839 --> 00:54:21.839
design side which goes through all the different
controls, you can go to any application and

00:54:21.839 --> 00:54:22.839
when it's going to get and examples and create
at some point. So I guess in front of, I mean

00:54:22.839 --> 00:54:23.839
like visual examples [INDISTINCT] I think
it has already has a most of about code examples.

00:54:23.839 --> 00:54:24.839
If it s a latter, I'm going to ahead and say
maybe not, okay this design side is very much

00:54:24.839 --> 00:54:25.839
prestigious that. I would say if you feel
that the [INDISTINCT] documentation side,

00:54:25.839 --> 00:54:26.839
so I will just [INDISTINCT] the code like
you will be and [INDISTINCT] or but the documentation

00:54:26.839 --> 00:54:27.839
on. In the reference section or even the Android
training pages. If you feel that they're not,

00:54:27.839 --> 00:54:28.839
you know, upstart of interesting maybe could
do a better job of joining them up. You know,

00:54:28.839 --> 00:54:29.839
linking through from the side of the building
block page to and we start to implement it.

00:54:29.839 --> 00:54:30.839
Then that could worth looking at.
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: And the documentation, the design

00:54:30.839 --> 00:54:31.839
documentation. So partly Android open source
project. So people can actually submit there

00:54:31.839 --> 00:54:32.839
changes if they want to, so located in the
frameworks based docs package. So if anyone

00:54:32.839 --> 00:54:33.839
wants to make fixes, they can fix it so much
[INDISTINCT] and become a famous author of

00:54:33.839 --> 00:54:34.839
the design documents.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-hmm. As you [INDISTINCT]. Yes,

00:54:34.839 --> 00:54:35.839
I thought [INDISTINCT] you mean are the good
examples. Yes, I think the desire is to keep

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:36.839
the design section down to design. So it's
not stir up designers with the code. And but

00:54:36.839 --> 00:54:37.839
yes certainly linking [INDISTINCT] tips for
implantation is interesting will be up and

00:54:37.839 --> 00:54:38.839
turning.
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I think it's nice to see that Android

00:54:38.839 --> 00:54:39.839
has got to the point where the designers is
so important compared to back in the day when

00:54:39.839 --> 00:54:40.839
we didn't have such kind of strict standards
so. I think keeping the two separate it's

00:54:40.839 --> 00:54:41.839
kind of made a lot of sense. But yeah, maybe
it's the case that needs to be here. A couple

00:54:41.839 --> 00:54:42.839
of strings down together.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Lastly, I already like the redesign

00:54:42.839 --> 00:54:43.839
again for [INDISTINCT] separated it out. But
maybe we do need to just think for your ads

00:54:43.839 --> 00:54:44.839
and watch the process.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:54:44.839 --> 00:54:45.839
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: The dispute ones has got some

00:54:45.839 --> 00:54:46.839
great information on publishing and getting
your [INDISTINCT] together. I think quite

00:54:46.839 --> 00:54:47.839
a lot of people [INDISTINCT] originally I
just put everyone in the design page but now

00:54:47.839 --> 00:54:48.839
you distribute links as well.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:54:48.839 --> 00:54:49.839
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: As it become more familiar, you
know, a different [INDISTINCT] inside that.

00:54:49.839 --> 00:54:50.839
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: That's what the device in our
generation [INDISTINCT]

00:54:50.839 --> 00:54:51.839
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yes.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Device Art Generator. Steven

00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:52.839
[INDISTINCT] just joins us in the chat and
in the Hangout. I just wonder if he's got

00:54:52.839 --> 00:54:53.839
any questions before we sign off today.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And [INDISTINCT] that they're

00:54:53.839 --> 00:54:54.839
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: And what do I [INDISTINCT] I

00:54:54.839 --> 00:54:55.839
saw that as well, never mind maybe [INDISTINCT]
where I locked it..

00:54:55.839 --> 00:54:56.839
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: If [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I didn't, yeah. I think--didn't

00:54:56.839 --> 00:54:57.839
Sparky say that he'd get to the point where
he'd lock it a bit before. So then people

00:54:57.839 --> 00:54:58.839
couldn't [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; He did.

00:54:58.839 --> 00:54:59.839
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I think, you meanů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: He said get your questions in

00:54:59.839 --> 00:55:00.839
early next week because I'm going to lock
it before the event.

00:55:00.839 --> 00:55:01.839
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Is there were all coming in during
that last week?

00:55:01.839 --> 00:55:02.839
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: That's fine.

00:55:02.839 --> 00:55:03.839
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: I don't know unlock it again.
The Sparky has the power. Next week I prefer

00:55:03.839 --> 00:55:04.839
the questions coming in during the [INDISTINCT].
So next week we won't lock it.

00:55:04.839 --> 00:55:05.839
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I have a feelingů
&gt;&gt; It's [INDISTINCT]

00:55:05.839 --> 00:55:06.839
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: ůThat it on an--on an [INDISTINCT]
trigger because he's already got there one

00:55:06.839 --> 00:55:07.839
for next the office--oh, the moderator for
next week open it. It says come back at 6:00

00:55:07.839 --> 00:55:08.839
to submit your questions.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:55:08.839 --> 00:55:09.839
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Also we actually got sort of the
time right just, yeah, the time where we [INDISTINCT]

00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:10.839
any questions.
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: And is it worthů

00:55:10.839 --> 00:55:11.839
&gt;&gt;THOMPSON: [INDISTINCT] are you.
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I'm just wondering whatů

00:55:11.839 --> 00:55:12.839
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: What was his question?
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Sorry.

00:55:12.839 --> 00:55:13.839
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Does anyone know whether the
Android at proximity alert on the location

00:55:13.839 --> 00:55:14.839
manager is battery intensive? Is the at proximity
alert on location manager battery intensive?

00:55:14.839 --> 00:55:15.839
No, no, no.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And this is the area of [INDISTINCT]

00:55:15.839 --> 00:55:16.839
that's his stuff [INDISTINCT] location?
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah, itů

00:55:16.839 --> 00:55:17.839
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: A space to [INDISTINCT] a very long
time about this. They said that even the GPS

00:55:17.839 --> 00:55:18.839
icon is there. He said that it's actually
designed to be quite efficient in terms of

00:55:18.839 --> 00:55:19.839
not actually GPS chip into it, actually needs
to. He told me to look in the source code

00:55:19.839 --> 00:55:20.839
to see if I can then stop it from doing that.
And then essentially brought my own version

00:55:20.839 --> 00:55:21.839
of it. When I was looking into it awhile ago,
about the same time, I think some people have

00:55:21.839 --> 00:55:22.839
commented that it may not be the case. So
I'd say, I'd stick with [INDISTINCT]

00:55:22.839 --> 00:55:23.839
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: The [INDISTINCT] is here. Yes,
this will definitely eat your battery.

00:55:23.839 --> 00:55:24.839
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Okay. So ignore what I said.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: You never want to be setting

00:55:24.839 --> 00:55:25.839
on a couple of Approximity [INDISTINCT] in
any case. To your case you describe isn't

00:55:25.839 --> 00:55:26.839
really catered for proximity or not. The best
you want to add about 20, sometimes 80 alerts

00:55:26.839 --> 00:55:27.839
with no time expiration with the radius around
500 meters, okay. A better alternative would

00:55:27.839 --> 00:55:28.839
be to use an alarm and service to check your
current location against your center location

00:55:28.839 --> 00:55:29.839
this will let you manage the location services
you want to use GPS or some ID as well as

00:55:29.839 --> 00:55:30.839
the frequency of checks. Doing it this way
will let you manage your battery much more

00:55:30.839 --> 00:55:31.839
effectively. So, yeah [INDISTINCT] the man
on batteries andů

00:55:31.839 --> 00:55:32.839
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: His battery.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: His battery pals.

00:55:32.839 --> 00:55:33.839
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: That way [INDISTINCT] if you
are then you can get it back. Hey, Steven,

00:55:33.839 --> 00:55:34.839
you got our question next?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have a question regarding with

00:55:34.839 --> 00:55:35.839
locks.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Okay.

00:55:35.839 --> 00:55:36.839
&gt;&gt; Can you understand me?
&gt;&gt; I have and service which runs in the back

00:55:36.839 --> 00:55:37.839
from which connects to location data and through
some [INDISTINCT] hello? Necessary to which

00:55:37.839 --> 00:55:38.839
is wake lock when screen is off.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Sorry [INDISTINCT] we lost you

00:55:38.839 --> 00:55:39.839
through the half of that question.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:55:39.839 --> 00:55:40.839
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: You're dropping in anů
&gt;&gt; So I have an--I have a series which is

00:55:40.839 --> 00:55:41.839
registering in wake lock and as collect location
data. Always when this [INDISTINCT] and do

00:55:41.839 --> 00:55:42.839
you need--do we need an wake lock for this
when screen is off to get enough computation

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:43.839
power to do some filtering of GPS position
and so on or is it just sufficient to do it

00:55:43.839 --> 00:55:44.839
without the wake lock?
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, you only get--was it ten

00:55:44.839 --> 00:55:45.839
seconds [INDISTINCT] yeah.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah, you will get pause very

00:55:45.839 --> 00:55:46.839
quickly afterwards. So it's [INDISTINCT] I
don't how long your computations are going

00:55:46.839 --> 00:55:47.839
t take. But it is more than a second or two
then you have to definitely wait for wake

00:55:47.839 --> 00:55:48.839
lock.
&gt;&gt; Okay. It's good choice to read--okay.

00:55:48.839 --> 00:55:49.839
&gt;&gt;THOMPSON: Yeah, just take the wake lock
and then turn it back off again, drop it as

00:55:49.839 --> 00:55:50.839
soon as you can.
&gt;&gt;GAUNT: We have another question on theů

00:55:50.839 --> 00:55:51.839
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yes, he's turned up. Hey [INDISTINCT]
finally you tell it right at the end of it.

00:55:51.839 --> 00:55:52.839
He's got his [INDISTINCT] as well. So we couldn't
be in Israel within this week. I'm sure your

00:55:52.839 --> 00:55:53.839
weather is better than ours. Apparently we
got another question coming through.

00:55:53.839 --> 00:55:54.839
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah, from Benjamin Wise.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Oh, hi Ben.

00:55:54.839 --> 00:55:55.839
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Benů
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: [INDISTINCT]

00:55:55.839 --> 00:55:56.839
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I show it to Ben and maybe prepare
they took care of the [INDISTINCT] last week

00:55:56.839 --> 00:55:57.839
and [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: [INDISTINCT] then.

00:55:57.839 --> 00:55:58.839
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: [INDISTINCT] to do here, so. Thanks
guys [INDISTINCT] and yeah, Ben says all the

00:55:58.839 --> 00:55:59.839
intention on supporting [INDISTINCT] as in
[INDISTINCT] for Android application and I

00:55:59.839 --> 00:56:00.839
don't know what [INDISTINCT] is.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: And we can't talk about [INDISTINCT]

00:56:00.839 --> 00:56:01.839
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No. Al you might be a bit more
than [INDISTINCT] some talk on the on new

00:56:01.839 --> 00:56:02.839
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah, that's right and basically

00:56:02.839 --> 00:56:03.839
they've decided to take a step back and start
from scratch from the Android building system

00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:04.839
to see what's happening. Great list one of
the systems that was in there as a potential

00:56:04.839 --> 00:56:05.839
for support. It seems to be less favored because
it's not a mainstream system by mainstream.

00:56:05.839 --> 00:56:06.839
I just mean it's got a critical mass of uses.
I'm sure there are a lot of people who really

00:56:06.839 --> 00:56:07.839
like it. I can't see it from what's being
said at the moment being supported in the

00:56:07.839 --> 00:56:08.839
first part of the new build system but there's
nothing to say that it wouldn't have support

00:56:08.839 --> 00:56:09.839
for a build later because it there are quite
a few people who are interested in seeing

00:56:09.839 --> 00:56:10.839
it. If Benjamin's really interested, ADT-Dev
is the group on Google groups. Jump in and

00:56:10.839 --> 00:56:11.839
that's see if it can be that it's what you
need and see if the guys are willing to put

00:56:11.839 --> 00:56:12.839
in the effort to produce what you want.
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Okay. That was [INDISTINCT]

00:56:12.839 --> 00:56:13.839
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Cool. Thanks.
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: All right. Well now [INDISTINCT]

00:56:13.839 --> 00:56:14.839
it's time to go [INDISTINCT] he can take over.
Thanks all for joining us again today for

00:56:14.839 --> 00:56:15.839
our first Hangout from the new studio in Campus
London. Hopefully we'll get to introduce some

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:16.839
of the locals start ups around here on sometimes
soon as well [INDISTINCT]

00:56:16.839 --> 00:56:17.839
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah [INDISTINCT] get back to
London [INDISTINCT]

00:56:17.839 --> 00:56:18.839
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: Yeah, that will be in this building
too. Other than that, thanks very much.

00:56:18.839 --> 00:56:19.839
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, until next week keep [INDISTINCT]
questions into the moderator for next week

00:56:19.839 --> 00:56:20.839
and [INDISTINCT] the Androids [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Thanks guys.

00:56:20.839 --> 00:56:21.839
&gt;&gt; THOMPSON: [INDISTINCT] cheers everyone.
Unstoppable.

00:56:21.839 --> 00:56:21.842
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: And elegant.
