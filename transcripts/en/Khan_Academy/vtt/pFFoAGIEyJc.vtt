00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.170
We're asked to
solve the equation,

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.810
3 plus the principal square root
of 5x plus 6 is equal to 12.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.250
And so the general strategy
to solve this type of equation

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.925
is to isolate the radical sign
on one side of the equation

00:00:13.925 --> 00:00:15.800
and then you can square
it to essentially get

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.739
the radical sign to go away.

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.280
But you have to be
very careful there

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.822
because when you
square radical signs

00:00:20.822 --> 00:00:22.780
you actually lose the
information that you were

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.230
taking the principal
square root.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.810
Not the negative square root
or not the plus or minus square

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.420
root.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.440
You are only taking the
positive square root.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.940
And so when we get
our final answer,

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.940
we do have to
check and make sure

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.939
that it gels with taking
the principal square root.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:36.480
So let's try.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.330
Let's see what
I'm talking about.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.190
So the first thing
I want to do is

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.314
I want to isolate this on
one side of the equation.

00:00:41.314 --> 00:00:43.800
And the best way to isolate
that is to get rid of this 3.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.300
And the best way
to get rid of the 3

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.122
is to subtract 3 from
the left-hand side.

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:49.080
And of course, if I do
it on the left-hand side

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.070
I also have to do it
on the right-hand side.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.860
Otherwise, I would
lose the ability

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.880
to say that they're equal.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.350
And so the left-hand
side right over here

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.000
simplifies to the principal
square root of 5x plus 6.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.280
And this is equal to 12 minus 3.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.110
This is equal to 9.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.640
And now, we can square both
sides of this equation.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.050
So we could square the principal
square root of 5x plus 6

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.430
and we can square 9.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.200
When you do this-- when you
square this, you get 5x plus 6.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.070
If you square the square
root of 5x plus 6,

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.060
you're going to get 5x plus 6.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.490
And this is where we actually
lost some information

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.240
because we would
have also gotten this

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.906
if we squared the negative
square root of 5x plus 6.

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:38.530
And so that's why we have to be
careful with the answers we get

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.220
and actually make sure it works
when the original equation

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.640
was the principal square root.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.090
So we get 5x plus 6
on the left-hand side.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.950
And on the right-hand
side we get 81.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.160
And now, this is just a
straight up linear equation.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.700
We want to isolate the x terms.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.855
Let's subtract 6
from both sides.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.990
On the left-hand side, we have
5x and on the right-hand side,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.990
we have 75.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.175
And then we can divide
both sides by 5.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.190
We get x is equal to--
let's see, it's 15, right?

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.945
5 times 10 is 50.

00:02:15.945 --> 00:02:18.880
5 times 5 is 25 gives you 75.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.700
So we get x is
equal to 15, but we

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.577
need to make sure
that this actually

00:02:23.577 --> 00:02:24.910
works for our original equation.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.970
Maybe this would
have worked if this

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.370
was the negative square root.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.400
So we need to make
sure it actually

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.510
works for the
positive square root,

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.760
for the principal square root.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.930
So let's apply it to
our original equation.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.160
So we get 3 plus the principal
square root of 5 times 15.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.912
So 75 plus 6.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.090
So I just took 5
times 15 over here.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.320
I put our solution in.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.060
It should be equal to 12.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.800
Or we get 3 plus square
root of 75 plus 6

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.480
is 81 needs to be equal to 12.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.300
And this is the principal
root of 81 so it's positive 9.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.550
So it's 3 plus 9 needs
to be equal to 12,

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.120
which is absolutely true.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.030
So we can feel pretty
good about this answer.
