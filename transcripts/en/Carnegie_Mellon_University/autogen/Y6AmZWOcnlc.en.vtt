00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
use both of and and I have always loved
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.200
use both of and and I have always loved
science even though I've not been a very

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
science even though I've not been a very
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.420
science even though I've not been a very
natural science it's always been sort of

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430
natural science it's always been sort of
 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.970
natural science it's always been sort of
the subject that I have the most trouble

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980
the subject that I have the most trouble
 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.970
the subject that I have the most trouble
in and but I've always loved it because

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
in and but I've always loved it because
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.250
in and but I've always loved it because
it's the especially biology because it's

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
it's the especially biology because it's
 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.080
it's the especially biology because it's
the study of life right it's the study

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090
the study of life right it's the study
 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.580
the study of life right it's the study
of how humans I mean humans and the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590
of how humans I mean humans and the
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.219
of how humans I mean humans and the
processes that govern us work drama also

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229
processes that govern us work drama also
 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.020

for me is also been the study of life

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
for me is also been the study of life
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.460

and has also been the study of people

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
and has also been the study of people
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.770
and has also been the study of people
and that's sort of how I've been looking

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
and that's sort of how I've been looking
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.210
and that's sort of how I've been looking
at my education here is that they both

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
at my education here is that they both
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.850
at my education here is that they both
make up the human being you know or life

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860
make up the human being you know or life
 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.380
make up the human being you know or life
because in drama you're studying people

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
because in drama you're studying people
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.730
because in drama you're studying people
and you're studying their interactions

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
and you're studying their interactions
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.310
and you're studying their interactions
and you're studying their emotions and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
and you're studying their emotions and
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.609
and you're studying their emotions and
you're studying sort of one aspect of

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619
you're studying sort of one aspect of
 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.560
you're studying sort of one aspect of
how people work and and how life works

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
how people work and and how life works
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.850
how people work and and how life works
but then in biology are also looking at

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
but then in biology are also looking at
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.800
but then in biology are also looking at
how life works they're just completely

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
how life works they're just completely
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.600
how life works they're just completely
different angles well I'm working on my

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
different angles well I'm working on my
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.359
different angles well I'm working on my
thesis project right now and that is

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369
thesis project right now and that is
 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.090
thesis project right now and that is
this whole mix of things but it's

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
this whole mix of things but it's
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.390
this whole mix of things but it's
supposed to be a way it's a it's a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
supposed to be a way it's a it's a
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.679
supposed to be a way it's a it's a
performance it's cooking show

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689
performance it's cooking show
 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.530
performance it's cooking show
performance and the the objective of the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
performance and the the objective of the
 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.910
performance and the the objective of the
cooking show performance is to use

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
cooking show performance is to use
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.210
cooking show performance is to use
performance and art and theater in order

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220
performance and art and theater in order
 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.280
performance and art and theater in order
to educate people about scientific

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
to educate people about scientific
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.719
to educate people about scientific
processes and culture and agriculture so

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
processes and culture and agriculture so
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.520
processes and culture and agriculture so
that's sort of been a really nice fusion

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
that's sort of been a really nice fusion
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.010
that's sort of been a really nice fusion
because I think the drama and the sides

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020

Education using theater elements to
 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.229
Education using theater elements to
educate about science I think food as a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
educate about science I think food as a
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.490
educate about science I think food as a
way to educate is a really wonderful

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
way to educate is a really wonderful
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.630

all these great you know international
journals and I guess I think people

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710
journals and I guess I think people
 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.170
journals and I guess I think people
liked the idea so much is because it's a

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180
liked the idea so much is because it's a
 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.340
liked the idea so much is because it's a
really unique way to approach awareness

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530
and education now that sounds very
 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.650
and education now that sounds very
ambiguous and it sounds sort of idyllic

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660
ambiguous and it sounds sort of idyllic
 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.949
ambiguous and it sounds sort of idyllic
but I think I think same use given me

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959
but I think I think same use given me
 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.290
but I think I think same use given me
the confidence to know that that is very

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300
the confidence to know that that is very
 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.040
the confidence to know that that is very
possible that I can take a lot of facets
