00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is a much easier way to do trig by using either a calculator or a computer.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And in fact, we can go the other way.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What if I told you I have an angle and the tangent of that angle is 0.932?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Maybe a way to write that would be tangent of some angle I don't know that is equal to 0.932.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, you've had some practice in this, you could go to your table, look up tangent 0.932

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and see if the angle we're talking about is 43 degrees.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
What we're doing here is sort of the opposite of computing a tangent, and instead of looking

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
at an angle and calculating the tangent, we're looking at the tangent in calculating the angle.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So what we're doing is the inverse tangent. It's the exact opposite of taking a tangent.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The way we specify this inverse tangent is we say arctan or sometimes tan to the -1.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'll be using arctan for now--so if you went into Google right now and you typed arc tangent

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
or arctan of 0.932--and remember this is exactly the same step as looking up into the trig table.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
There is an angle, this tangent is 0.932--arctan will find that out.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
If we enter this into Google arctan of 0.932 what we'll get is the following answer:

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
0.75 something radians and this is strange.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This is a unit you may have never seen before or maybe you have

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
but this is just another way of measuring angles.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The radian is another unit just like the stadium is now the unit of distance.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Now this is a fine measure, radians is a wonderful unit but it's not the unit we want.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Actually Google will allow you to specify the unit you want.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'd like you to go to Google and type in arctan 0.932 in degrees.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
This will  tell Google--Hey, I want the answer in degrees not radians

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and enter in the result you get here.

00:02:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Just go to two decimal places should be fine.
