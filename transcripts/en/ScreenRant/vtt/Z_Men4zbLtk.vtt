00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.100
Everyone loves a good crime story, with the
men on both sides of the law starring in thousands

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.730
of action films, dramas, and comedies.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.710
The genre may be dominated by notorious men,
but from the noir films of the 1940’s to

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.420
seedy modern thrillers, there are plenty of
wicked women worth admiring, too.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.939
Here are Screen Rant’s 5 Badass Female Movie
Criminals.

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.220
O-Ren Ishii

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.670
She’s half-Chinese-American, half-Japanese,
ready to take the head off of anyone who mentions

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.799
her divided heritage.

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:45.769
She’s O-Ren Ishii just one member of the
Deadly Viper Assassination Squad introduced

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.190
in Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill Volume
1.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.140
After witnessing the murder of her family,
O-Ren mastered the art of the sword – and

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.490
the art of revenge - disposing of the men
who killed her parents, and eventually taking

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.120
over the Tokyo Yakuza with the help of the
enigmatic Bill.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.680
Considering her background and her resume,
it’s no wonder why O-Ren is so fiercely

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:19.160
defensive of her status as the boss, and one
of the few “DIVAS” who met her end with

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.070
honor.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.070
Phyllis Dietrichson

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:32.200
Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity is one of
the most influential noir films of all time,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.579
with star Barbara Stanwyck at the center of
the grisly tale of deceit and murder.

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.060
Stanwyck plays Dietrichson, a married woman
who approaches insurance salesman Walter Neff

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.460
to take out an insurance policy on her husband
– without his knowledge.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.570
It’s obvious that she has murder on her
mind, but Neff simply can’t resist her wiles

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.010
and winds up aiding her in the plan.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.200
Her cunning and manipulation would have worked,
too, if not for the suspicions of Neff’s

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:02.159
boss – the one man Phyllis didn’t get
to charm.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.000
Stoney, Cleo, T.T. &amp; Frankie

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.069
Imagine this: You’re working at your day
job when all of a sudden, a handful of armed

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.030
men burst in and hold up the place.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.160
Then, to add insult to injury, your boss unceremoniously
fires you for knowing one of the assailants.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.160
What do you do?

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.750
Who do you turn to?

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.180
In Set it Off, Vivica A. Fox decides to get
even, and recruits her friends - Queen Latifah,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.760
Jada Pinkett, and Kimberly Elise - to tag
along for a crime spree, robbing bank after

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.880
bank as John C. McGinley tries to keep up
with their larceny.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.700
It’s a great thrill ride, but the film is
remarkable for the concern it shows its disenfranchised

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.250
characters, reminding viewers of the cast’s
humanity, and that every crime – and every

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.650
criminal - has a story to tell.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.360
Mother Russia

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.080
Jeff Wadlow’s Kick-Ass 2 isn’t remembered
as fondly as Matthew Vaughn’s original,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.420
but the sequel does have one thing going for
it: Olga Kurkulina, the Uzbekistanian athlete

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.459
and actress behind Mother Russia, the towering
henchwoman to budding, untested crime lord

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.120
Chris D’Amico.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.410
Kick-Ass 2 indulges in bad taste for its own
sake, but when Kurkulina takes the spotlight,

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.290
the film becomes shockingly watchable.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.319
Throughout the film, Mother Russia demonstrates
a flair for the dramatic, eventually meeting

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.610
her end at the hands of Hit-Girl.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.989
But up to that point she puts on an unforgettable
show, whether she’s breaking the law or

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:36.290
eating her prison cell mate.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.180
Thelma Dickinson &amp; Louise Sawyer

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.250
This classic story of downtrodden femininity
turned out to be anything but the lighthearted

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.620
romp it was advertised as.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.690
When a night of drinking leads to attempted
rape, which leads to murder, the starring

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.780
women set off on an adventure only ended when
Thelma and Louise drive their Thunderbird

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.270
off of a cliff.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.709
The darker tones of the movie were a large
part of the movie’s success, managing to

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.170
tell an uncompromising tale of the good and
bad faced by modern women.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:12.730
There are many ways to be badass, but literally
taking your life into your own hands, as our

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.310
heroines do in Thelma &amp; Louise’s climax,
might be the most badass of all.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.560
Those are our picks for our most memorably
crime-loving women.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.569
Are there any we missed?
