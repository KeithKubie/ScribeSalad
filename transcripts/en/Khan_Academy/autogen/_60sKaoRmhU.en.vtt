00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.760
 If we only work with two dimensions and want to find one 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.460
 area under the curve, we already have a good tool for it 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.050
 and I will remind you now 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.430
 So let's say this is the x-axis and this is the y-axis 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.450
 and here's any feature 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.130
 my function f (x) 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.210
 And let's say we want to find an area between "x" equals "a" 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.810
 so this is "x" equals "a" and "x" equals "b" 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.140
 We've seen this many videos back. 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.010
 You can take it by taking really tiny widths of "x" 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.610
 or really tiny changes in "x" 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.350
 We can call them delta "x" but because they are so small 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.650
 we will call them "dx" 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.300
 Very, infinitely small "x" changes 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.780
 And then we multiply them by f (x) 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.300
 at that point. 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.710
 So we multiply them by the height at that point 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.730
 which is f (x) 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.210
 So we have f (x) times each of these infinitely small bases, 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.930
 which tells us the surface of this infinite 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.500
 narrow rectangle 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.220
 And since each of them is infinitely small 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.370
 we will have infinitely these rectangles 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.050
 to fill the entire area 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.480
 You will have infinitely many of them, 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.880
 that? 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.250
 So the tool we used was a definite integral 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.970
 A definite integral is the sum of all 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.000
 infinitely small areas or these 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.910
 infinitely small rectangles 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.790
 And the symbol we use is that they go from "a" to "b" 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.690
 And we've already done many videos like these 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.230
 solve the integrals 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.010
 I just want to remind you 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.210
 What this tells us 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.000
 This tells us: let's take a tiny change in "x" 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.620
 multiply it by the height at this point 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.740
 and you will have infinitely many of these because these "x" 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.110
 they are infinitely small 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.330
 so you will have infinitely many of them. 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.880
 So make an infinite sum of all, from "x" equals "a" 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.630
 after "x" equals "b" 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.150
 And that is our standard definite integral 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.230
 And in this video, we'll expand it a bit 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.320
 so that we can solve more complex and 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.240
 wider range of examples 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.380
 Let's move to three dimensions now 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.970
 I first paint the xy surface 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.820
 Maybe I'll leave this to be clearer. 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.450
 I'm going to bend it a little now, 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.460
 so that we have a better view. 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.490
 Let's say this is the "y" axis, 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.750
 that goes backwards. 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.410
 You can imagine that by pushing this 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.600
 and I'll put it down. 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.480
 So this is the "y" axis and this "x" axis. 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.630
 Let's say we have some path on the "xy" desktop 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.460
 And to define it, 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.560
 I will have to find out the parameters of both variables, "x" and "y". 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.120
 .......... I'll just change the color, 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.350
 because I use orange too much. 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.050
 Let's say that "x" equals some funky with some parameter "t" 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.450
 and let's say "y" equals some other function with the same "t" parameter 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.320
 and say, 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.090
 that "t" will be greater than or equal to "a" 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.840
 and also less than or equal to "b". 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.880
 And this defines the path on the "xy" surface. 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.890
 If you find this confusing, you can look again 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.430
 to videos about parametric equations. 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.060
 So when "t" equals "a" 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.320
 .............. 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.630
 thus, "x" equals "g (a)" 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.166
 and "y" is equal to "h (a)". 

00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:45.580
 So we'll have this point, maybe here, 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.760
 I do not know, I draw a random point here. 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.970
 When "t" equals "a", we draw a point on the coordinates 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.590
 "g (a)" 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.270
 as the "x" coordinate. 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.030
 ------------ 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.320
 And the coordinates "y" will be "h (a)". 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.930
 Just substitute "t" equals "a" to each of these equations 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.430
 and get values ​​for "x" and "y". 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.450
 So this coordinate is "h (a)" 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.940
 And you will gradually increase "t" 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.190
 until you reach "b" 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.190
 and get a set of points that looks like this. 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.410
 This is the curve on the "xy" surface. 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.430
 And now you're probably saying "what's in common." 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.430
 with here? " 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.250
 "What are we doing?" 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.000
 So I'll write "c" here 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.750
 which is our curve. 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.090
 Now, let's say I have another function that connects everyone 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.010
 point on desktop "xy" with some value. 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.480
 Let's say I have the function "f (x, y)" 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.800
 that connects each point on the "xy" desktop 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.170
 with some value. 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.890
 So now I'm drawing "f (x, y)" 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.360
 Here I will make a vertical axis. 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.460
 Maybe in a different color. 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.090
 We will call it the axis "f (x, y)" 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.010
 or the "z" axis if you want. 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.080
 Just some vertical axis here. 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.050
 So if I know "x" and "y" and put them in 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.860
 my function "f (x, y)", I get some point. 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.160
 So I can paint the area 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.375
 which represents "f (x, y)". 

00:05:12.375 --> 00:05:14.920
 All this will be much clearer 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.440
 when I do some concrete examples. 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.950
 Let's say "f (x, y)" looks like this. 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.890
 I'll try to paint it as best I can. 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.440
 And in a different color. 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.090
 ............. 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.730
 Some surface ... 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.795
 I paint her part- 

00:05:26.795 --> 00:05:29.230
 Let's say that area 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.220
 it looks like this. 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.680
 This is "f (x, y)" 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.310
 And all this is is that you give me "x" and give me "y" 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.800
 substitute it into "f (x, y)", and some value comes out 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.060
 which we draw on the vertical axis. 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.780
 ............... 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.760
 Example "f (x, y)"? 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.110
 This may be, for example, not in this case, 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.650
 "x" plus "y". 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.300
 ................. 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.200
 These are just examples. 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.750
 It may be "x" times "y". 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.350
 when "x" is 1 and "y" is 2, "f (x, y)" is equal to 1 times 2. 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.110
 But let's say for each point on the desktop "xy" 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.570
 we draw the corresponding point according to "f (x, y)" and this area is created.
