00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.400
In the last video, we figured out the absolute minimum

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.340
speed in order to stay on the circular path right over here especially near the top

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.980
was 27.6 km/h

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.420
What I want to do in this video is

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.090
I just clipped out the parts where he's actually on the loop de loop

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.440
and I want to figure out his average [speed]

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.740
So I'm going to use the video editor right here

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.060
to time how long it takes to complete the loop de loop

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.220
And then we can use that and we know about the circumference of this loop de loop

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.460
and we're going to assume that it is perfectly circular for our purpose

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.130
although it looks like it's a little bit egg-shaped in reality or elliptical

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.170
For our calculation, we're going to assume that it's perfectly circular

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.710
I'll leave it to you to think about how it would change

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.210
if you had an elliptical shape like this

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.370
So anyway, let's watch the video again

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.080
Remember this is from fifth gear which shows on Channel 5 in United Kingdom

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.850
So there you go

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.770
Let's watch it again. It's fun to watch. There you go

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.630
And right over here, we have a little timer for my video editor

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.160
And this right over here is in seconds and I was corrected on a earlier video

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.540
This right over here is not in hundredth of seconds. This is in frames

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.630
And there's 30 frames per second

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.240
So it starts at 0 seconds 0 frames

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.250
and then when we play it, it goes to 2 seconds and 14 frames

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.410
There's 30 frames per second

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.350
So it's 2 and 14/30 of a second. It's how long it takes the car to do the loop

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.510
So 1 second, and then 2 seconds, 2 and 14/30. So almost 2.5 second

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.850
So let's write that down

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:50.440
So the time required to do the loop de loop is roughly 2 and 14/30 seconds

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.530
And what is the distance that it travels?

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.320
If we assume that this thing is circular although it looks like it's a little bit egg-shaped

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.250
if we assume that it is circular

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.950
then the distance traveled is the circumference of the circular loop de loop

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.970
The circumference is 2 pi times the radius which is equal to 2 pi

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.030
and in the previous video, we figured out the radius was 6 m

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.710
So it's 2 pi times 6 m which is equal to 12 pi meters

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.510
If you wanted to figure out its average speed--

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.130
the velocity is constantly changing because the direction is changing

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.140
but the magnitude of the velocity--

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:37.250
if we wanted to figure out the average magnitude of the velocity or the average speed

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.150
the total distance traveled is 12 pi meters

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.010
divided by the time required to travel the 12 pi meters

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.720
so that is 2 and 14/30 seconds

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.190
Now let's get our calculator out to actual calculate that value

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:06.930
So we're going to have the distance 12 pi m divided by

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:15.480
2 + 14/30 just to get the exact value

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.010
And then this gives us in meters per second

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.710
15.3 m/s

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:31.070
So the average speed is approximately 15.3 m/s

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.900
which is almost twice as fast as the minimum speed we figured out

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.100
because you want that margin of safety

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.870
and you want to be able to have some traction with the road

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.260
Although you don't want to go too fast, because then the G force is going to be too big

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.070
then this--maybe we'll talk about that in the future video

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.590
I'll just relate this into kilometers per hour. Let's figure out what that is

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.730
I want to use the calculator here

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.890
So that's in the meters per second

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.270
Let's figure out how many meters per hour by multiplying it by 3600 seconds per hour

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.170
So that's how many meters per hour, and divide it by 1000 which you can see right over there

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.030
that is 55 km/h

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.270
If you want to do it in miles, it's rough approximation, divide it by 1.6

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.470
It's about 35 mph give or take or 55 km/h

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.560
So this is approximately 55 km/h

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.640
So the driver here luckily they did the physics ahead of time

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.900
and he had the margin of safety

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.340
He was well in excess of the minimum velocity just to maintain the circular motion

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.650
So he probably has some nice traction with the track up here
