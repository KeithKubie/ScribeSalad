autism is both a devastating problem and

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.139
autism is both a devastating problem and
 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.039
autism is both a devastating problem and
it's still a puzzle largely what causes

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049
it's still a puzzle largely what causes
 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.370
it's still a puzzle largely what causes

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380
what he's been causing the dramatic
 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.190
what he's been causing the dramatic

years or so so it's almost like an

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020
years or so so it's almost like an
 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.170
years or so so it's almost like an
exponential increase part of that is

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180
exponential increase part of that is
 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.600
exponential increase part of that is
really due to better diagnosis and the

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610
really due to better diagnosis and the
 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.510
really due to better diagnosis and the
diagnostic criteria but a lot of people

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520
diagnostic criteria but a lot of people
 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.420
diagnostic criteria but a lot of people
think that something in our environment

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430
think that something in our environment
 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.750
think that something in our environment
has played a role in in causing this

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760
has played a role in in causing this
 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.340
has played a role in in causing this
increase and it's worldwide it's not

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350
increase and it's worldwide it's not
 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.020
increase and it's worldwide it's not
just in North America it's in Asia it's

the genes the genetic risk factors for
 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.450
the genes the genetic risk factors for
autism have obviously always been there

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460
autism have obviously always been there
 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.110
autism have obviously always been there
and but something else must have

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120
and but something else must have
 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.310
and but something else must have

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320
triggered and so you know some people
 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.780

think it's it's something in a diet it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790
think it's it's something in a diet it
 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.580
think it's it's something in a diet it
and and that is possible it could also

and and that is possible it could also
 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.510
and and that is possible it could also
be something in what we do to our gut

the obsession with keeping things more
 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.179
the obsession with keeping things more
and more sterile from from the day we

lifetime so people have thought about to

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069
lifetime so people have thought about to
 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.940
lifetime so people have thought about to

constipation abdominal pain discomfort

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840
constipation abdominal pain discomfort
 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.800
constipation abdominal pain discomfort
part of that is most likely due to the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810
part of that is most likely due to the
 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.679
part of that is most likely due to the
diet the unique diet that autistic

children self-select force many things

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:05.419
children self-select force many things
 

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:07.389
children self-select force many things
are excluded from a diet that we

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399

normally would like fiber fermented

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130
normally would like fiber fermented
 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.690
normally would like fiber fermented
foods and so it's it's quite possible

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700
foods and so it's it's quite possible
 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.280
foods and so it's it's quite possible
that that plays a role

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290
that that plays a role
 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.890
that that plays a role
and there are people that have thought

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900
and there are people that have thought
 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.229
and there are people that have thought
about this why do kids select such a

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239
about this why do kids select such a
 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.380

diet seems to have to do a lot with the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390
diet seems to have to do a lot with the
 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.860
diet seems to have to do a lot with the
texture of foods so their unique

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870
texture of foods so their unique
 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.589
texture of foods so their unique
disturbance in the sensitivity for the

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599
disturbance in the sensitivity for the
 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.899
disturbance in the sensitivity for the
texture not so much for the content so

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909
texture not so much for the content so
 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.380
texture not so much for the content so
things that are soft and are much

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390
things that are soft and are much
 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.410
things that are soft and are much
preferred over crunchy and and and chewy

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420
preferred over crunchy and and and chewy
 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.470
preferred over crunchy and and and chewy
things and then you know people have

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480
things and then you know people have
 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.149
things and then you know people have
started to look at the microbial

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159
started to look at the microbial
 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.479
started to look at the microbial
composition so they looked at the gut

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489
composition so they looked at the gut
 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.940
composition so they looked at the gut
microbes in fecal samples from from

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950
microbes in fecal samples from from
 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.490
microbes in fecal samples from from
patients with autism and have found

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500
patients with autism and have found
 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.449
patients with autism and have found
abnormalities the problem is most of

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459
abnormalities the problem is most of
 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.020
abnormalities the problem is most of
those studies are small they're often

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030
those studies are small they're often
 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.110
those studies are small they're often
not well controlled they we now

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120
not well controlled they we now
 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.619
not well controlled they we now
understand that autism is a spectrum

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629
understand that autism is a spectrum
 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.559
understand that autism is a spectrum
autism spectrum disorder and it probably

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569
autism spectrum disorder and it probably
 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.800
autism spectrum disorder and it probably
contains several different subsets of

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810
contains several different subsets of
 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.479
contains several different subsets of
patients so if you just take a small

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489
patients so if you just take a small
 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.520
patients so if you just take a small
number of patients measure their they

got microbes it's you're likely to pick

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220
got microbes it's you're likely to pick
 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.089
got microbes it's you're likely to pick
up variable patterns because you it's

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099
up variable patterns because you it's
 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.729

has been a study published a couple
 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.119
has been a study published a couple
years ago by a group at Caltech in in in

years ago by a group at Caltech in in in
 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.990
years ago by a group at Caltech in in in
California which showed that in an

autism always you know a big jump from
 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.180
autism always you know a big jump from
something from from animal behaviors to

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190
something from from animal behaviors to
 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.800
something from from animal behaviors to
something as complex as all the

something as complex as all the
 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.740
something as complex as all the
disturbances in autism but that has

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750
disturbances in autism but that has
 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.710
disturbances in autism but that has
received a lot of attention because in

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720
received a lot of attention because in
 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.360
received a lot of attention because in
these animals that have this behavior

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370
these animals that have this behavior
 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.480
these animals that have this behavior
they have an altered gut microbial

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490
they have an altered gut microbial
 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.339
they have an altered gut microbial
composition produced different

human patients and they have a leaky gut

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:36.469
human patients and they have a leaky gut
 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:39.159
human patients and they have a leaky gut
so they have immune activation in the

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169
so they have immune activation in the
 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.879
so they have immune activation in the

that's sort of most intriguing by
 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.659
that's sort of most intriguing by
treating them with a probiotic which is

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.989
treating them with a probiotic which is
called B fragilis the investigators were

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:52.999
called B fragilis the investigators were
 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:54.249
called B fragilis the investigators were
able to reverse many of those

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259
able to reverse many of those
 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:55.869

behavioural changes and the gut

00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:55.879
behavioural changes and the gut
 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.989

abnormalities in these in these mice so

00:04:58.989 --> 00:04:58.999
abnormalities in these in these mice so
 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:03.819
abnormalities in these in these mice so
this has triggered a tremendous interest

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:03.829
this has triggered a tremendous interest
 

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:07.509
this has triggered a tremendous interest
now there's efforts underway to produce

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:07.519
now there's efforts underway to produce
 

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:10.719
now there's efforts underway to produce
this probiotic and make it acceptable

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729
this probiotic and make it acceptable
 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.089
this probiotic and make it acceptable
for human use so it's not a probiotic

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099
for human use so it's not a probiotic
 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.039
for human use so it's not a probiotic

reverse some of the changes either in
 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.699
reverse some of the changes either in
terms of the gut dysfunction or

therapy after delivery and this is

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699
therapy after delivery and this is
 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:54.369
therapy after delivery and this is
clearly a developmental disorder that

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:54.379
clearly a developmental disorder that
 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:56.769
clearly a developmental disorder that
starts initially almost with

00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:56.779
starts initially almost with
 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:59.559
starts initially almost with
imperceptible changes in the newborn and

00:05:59.559 --> 00:05:59.569
imperceptible changes in the newborn and
 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.229
imperceptible changes in the newborn and
then gradually becomes clinically

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:01.239
then gradually becomes clinically
 

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:04.239
then gradually becomes clinically
obvious the earlier you could start this

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:04.249
obvious the earlier you could start this
 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:08.499
obvious the earlier you could start this
treatment the more likely it would be it

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:08.509
treatment the more likely it would be it
 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:11.559
treatment the more likely it would be it
would be beneficial so autism in many

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:11.569
would be beneficial so autism in many
 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:14.969

microbiome disorder so this model is
 

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:23.409
microbiome disorder so this model is
almost certainly gonna lead to a better
