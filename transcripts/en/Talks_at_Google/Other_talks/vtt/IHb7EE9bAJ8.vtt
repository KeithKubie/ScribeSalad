TODD WOMACK: Come on!

00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:06.290
Yes!

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.618
Come on!

00:00:08.618 --> 00:00:09.574
Look at that.

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:15.190
PAUL SCHEER: Thank you.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.098
All right.

00:00:16.098 --> 00:00:17.006
This is exciting.

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:18.820
TODD WOMACK: An afternoon
with Paul Scheer.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.430
Look at-- this is--

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.055
PAUL SCHEER: Look, I would love
to spend an afternoon with each

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:22.810
of you right here.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.740
We're going to hang out.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.000
We're going to really
get down to it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.540
TODD WOMACK: That's the plan.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.430
We're scheduled to go till--

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.710
PAUL SCHEER: We are
real real today.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.955
TODD WOMACK: Yeah, we have
the room until 11:00 PM.

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:30.600
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, great.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.710
Big epic thing.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.750
Who was here before me?

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.500
TODD WOMACK: Everyone
was here before you.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.950
PAUL SCHEER: Ah, damn it.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.600
Always happens.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.914
But this is a week full
of interesting people.

00:00:43.914 --> 00:00:45.330
So I feel like I
have to top that.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.520
I have to kind of
admit something.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.100
In the course of
this interview, I'm

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.990
going to have to admit
something terrible.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.480
TODD WOMACK: Yeah.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.080
That sounds great.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.955
PAUL SCHEER: Maybe I'll
say I killed somebody

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.160
and we'll get a lot of hits.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.427
But I'll do it right
at the very end,

00:00:58.427 --> 00:01:00.635
so people have to watch the
whole video the whole way

00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:01.060
through.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.855
TODD WOMACK: Watch all the ads.

00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:03.563
PAUL SCHEER: You've
got to get those ads.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:06.180
Bank of America, got it, I'm in.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.614
Pantene Pro V. Yeah, I saw it.

00:01:07.614 --> 00:01:09.280
TODD WOMACK: I don't
think they're going

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.456
to be running Pantene Pro V.

00:01:10.456 --> 00:01:12.940
PAUL SCHEER: No,
they love Pantene.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.420
Look, there's hair other places.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.261
TODD WOMACK: There is.

00:01:21.261 --> 00:01:21.760
Cool man.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.420
PAUL SCHEER: Why do I have
to treat that with this soap.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.545
TODD WOMACK: I know, right.

00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:27.120
PAUL SCHEER: Come on.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.560
TODD WOMACK: So Paul.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.484
PAUL SCHEER: Yes.

00:01:29.484 --> 00:01:31.150
TODD WOMACK: Everyone
is dying to know--

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.240
what is your middle name.

00:01:35.474 --> 00:01:38.400
PAUL SCHEER: My middle
name is Christian,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.650
because my mom had
a tough childbirth,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.870
and I guess that she felt like
she saw God in that childbirth.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.780
So she said, I named you
Christian after, like,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.940
Christianity?

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.280
Terrible.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.805
But yeah, so that's how
my name became Christian.

00:01:57.805 --> 00:01:59.180
TODD WOMACK: I
did not know that.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.513
That was just a stupid, silly
question to throw you off.

00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:02.430
And you're like, God.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.180
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.000
No, but my mom is not a super
religious person as much

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.630
as she may want
people to believe.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.180
But she's not
like-- it's weird--

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.925
TODD WOMACK: Outside
of childbirth.

00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:14.030
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, and
then naming me Christian

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.220
after Christianity.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.630
TODD WOMACK: Great.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.780
So let's tell these guys-- I
actually had you as a teacher

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.547
at the UCB in 2003, and I've
done your comedy show Crash

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:28.880
Test, the live one a few times--

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.880
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.490
TODD WOMACK: --and you've
just been around forever.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.170
So maybe you could just-- you've
just been doing so much stuff.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.920
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.115
When Mel Brooks and I started--

00:02:40.115 --> 00:02:41.990
TODD WOMACK: Yeah, I'm
looking at your IMDB--

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.260
PAUL SCHEER: Show of Shows
was an interesting experience.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.670
No, you're right.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.515
I was lucky
because-- I feel bad,

00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:50.640
because I don't want to
neglect you guys over here.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.640
I'm going to make awkward
big motions like this.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.806
TODD WOMACK: Those seats
are way cheaper than these,

00:02:54.806 --> 00:02:55.692
so that's fine.

00:02:55.692 --> 00:02:56.900
PAUL SCHEER: No, I was lucky.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.390
I started off at UCB
back in-- I guess--

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.080
early 2000, if not even 1999.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.350
I was going to college
at NYU, and somebody

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.460
was like, oh my god, you have
to see this group the Upright

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.180
Citizens Brigade.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.130
And at that point I
was actually touring

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.930
around the country doing this
show called "Chicago City

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.940
Limits," which was kind
of cheesy short form,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.080
where like, every
time this bell rings,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.300
we're going to change the
last line of dialogue.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.800
You know.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.690
And we'd put on funny hats
and say we're gynecologists.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.010
It was a really
top notch program.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.160
And I was like, this is improv.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.990
This is life.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.170
I can't-- nothing
gets better than this.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.770
And someone was like, you have
to go see the Upright Citizens

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.270
Brigade.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.010
And I went to this-- I
walked up five flights

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.980
to go to the top of
this hardware store

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.060
where the UCB were performing
at the solo arts group.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.700
And they do a show every Sunday
night, and my mind was blown.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.900
They took one suggestion, they
improvised for 45 minutes,

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.955
and I believe in
that early time I

00:03:57.955 --> 00:04:00.700
was seeing people like
Adam McKay and Tina Fey

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.210
and Miriam Tolan
and John Glaser.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.130
All these amazingly
funny people.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.610
It was just like, well
I gotta figure out

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.030
how to study with these guys.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.460
And they weren't even teaching
classes at that point.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.890
You could just
hire them privately

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.530
to coach an improv
or comedy group.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.070
So they started
teaching classes.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.839
I took a class
there, and then got

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:25.040
into that system, which has
now become this giant behemoth.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.350
If I was me now trying
to get into UCB,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.230
I don't know if I would
have ever gotten in.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.240
It's just too hard.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.970
They have two theaters in
New York, two theaters in LA,

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.730
and a bigger admission
process than most colleges.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.856
They're just this
giant comedy entity.

00:04:44.856 --> 00:04:47.230
When I first started there,
I was doing shows five nights

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.900
a week.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.400
Not good shows, but shows.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.900
Yeah, we just had
to fill the space.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.650
We had a theater that was
open seven nights a week,

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.600
and I was doing five
of those nights.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.700
Shows like Robot TV, which
was a show for robots

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.580
by robots, where we worship
someone called Landau

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.520
and there was a guy
on the side of stage

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.850
just playing electric
guitar shooting a slide

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.790
show where most of our
audience walked out of.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.010
That was a constant thing.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.650
We did a show called "The Real
Road Rules"-- or "Real World,"

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.510
which was a parody
of the "Real World."

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.885
We just were doing
so many shows.

00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:26.250
That was my comedy
college, essentially.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.880
Just working there
and doing that.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.630
And then I started
teaching there and then

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.150
that's how I met you.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.670
TODD WOMACK: And that group
of-- and everything went from

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.780
there--

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.530
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.959
TODD WOMACK: But that group--
was it Respecto Montalban?

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:37.500
You're like--

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.065
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:05:38.065 --> 00:05:39.330
TODD WOMACK: You guys
are still kind of--

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.480
PAUL SCHEER: We
kind of do, yeah.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.210
TODD WOMACK: You ever
perform together?

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.300
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.258
TODD WOMACK: So this is
a group-- this is you--

00:05:43.258 --> 00:05:45.997
PAUL SCHEER: Me, Rob
Riggle, Rob Huebel,

00:05:45.997 --> 00:05:48.080
Chad Carter who's a
writer/producer for "The Daily

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.152
Show," Owen Burke who's the head
of "Funny or Die" At that time

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:54.360
when we were in New York,
it was Jackie Clarke, who's

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.380
a writer for "Happy Endings"
and a bunch of other stuff

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.980
right now.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.097
And Dannah Phirman,
and Daniel Schneider

00:06:03.097 --> 00:06:04.430
who created "The Hotwives" show.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.230
And so it was a really--
and Jack McBrayer

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.166
was in that group.

00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:09.540
One of the cool
things-- and this

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.820
is a thing I learned
early on-- was

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.350
the UCB would see people
and go, all right, you

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.714
and you and you, you guys
are all in a Harold team.

00:06:17.714 --> 00:06:19.880
And they would pick people
and they'd feel like, oh,

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.510
that energy worked really well.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.080
TODD WOMACK: And that's sort
of your long form improv team.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.830
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.288
This would be like,
you would go up

00:06:26.288 --> 00:06:29.800
and you'd improvise for 30
minutes, and varying degrees

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.710
of being good.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.120
And I got on my team
with Rob Riggle,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.300
and we were like oh, I
really like Rob Huebel.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.466
And he was like, yeah, and
I really like Owen Burke.

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:41.690
And we kind of broke
out of the UCB mold

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.240
and formed our own team.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.290
And at that point no
one had done that yet.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.866
And so we caused a lot of drama.

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:49.240
Like it was, again,
like you know

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.781
all the stuff-- like when you're
first starting out-- like we

00:06:51.781 --> 00:06:53.070
broke up our own Harold teams.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.847
And they're like, how
could you do that.

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:56.680
You know, we made enemies
with these people.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.310
But it was really good, because
when we formed this team,

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.650
we've continued performing
together until this day.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.790
We have a show every
Wednesday night at UCB in LA

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.800
that we still do with the
majority of that team.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.650
TODD WOMACK: Is
that the Facebook?

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.560
PAUL SCHEER: It's
called Facebook.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.390
TODD WOMACK: It used
to be the Myspace.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.480
PAUL SCHEER: Used to be Myspace.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.680
TODD WOMACK: Yeah, you guys
have been doing it a while.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.782
PAUL SCHEER: Soon it
will be Periscope.

00:07:16.782 --> 00:07:18.990
But yeah, no, we are trying
to change with the times.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.520
TODD WOMACK: You guys just
bring up somebody and bring up

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:20.920
their--

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.060
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, our
weekly show-- basically we

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.180
take a person in the
audience, we interview them

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.360
based on their Facebook
page, and then they

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.340
tell us the most insane
things about their lives.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.900
They forget they're on stage.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.300
Like, we had a therapist
tell us that he was treating

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.120
one of his patients at
a psychiatric hospital,

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.040
and started writing
her furlough just

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.210
to have weekend dates with her.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.680
Which is crazy.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.710
And unethical.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.600
I'm not supporting it, but it
gave us really good fodder.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.080
We had a woman who
recently got out

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.830
of a relationship-- a marriage--
and she had so much sex

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.780
that she put herself
in the hospital

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.600
for having too much sex.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.620
We had a woman who
delivered a baby on the 405.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.160
Like, people have
all these stories,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.680
and you never think of it
when you look at their page.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.140
Like, what was happening here?

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.220
Oh, that's when I
just gave birth.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:17.720
Oh really?

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.970
Like, when did you give birth?

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.250
Oh, it was a couple weeks ago.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.310
Oh, was it a hard birth?

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.860
Well it's kind of crazy because
I did it on the highway.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.070
Like, wait, what?

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.060
So it's always this five
step kind of question,

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.730
and then you find
these amazing nuggets.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.299
And then we improvise scenes
based on their life story.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.640
TODD WOMACK: And you guys
have such a great-- that crew

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.010
is just power packed.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.789
Such a great-- tons
of funny people.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.370
PAUL SCHEER: It's
a super fun group.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.500
And now we all kind of basically
work and hire each other.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.131
How many people here have
been too UCB New York?

00:08:49.131 --> 00:08:49.630
A lot?

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.170
A handful?

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:50.836
All right, good.

00:08:50.836 --> 00:08:53.430
Well it's a good
place for comedy.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.390
And they don't-- and
they're kind of agnostic.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.556
You can do an improv show,
you can do a sketch show,

00:08:57.556 --> 00:09:00.090
you can do whatever you
wanted to do in that realm.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.270
It's not like Second City
which does a sketch show,

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.360
or "Groundlings," which
has a main stage show.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.500
TODD WOMACK: A sketch
show where you have hats

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.150
and you play gynecologists--

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.530
PAUL SCHEER: Exactly,
yeah, exactly.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.905
TODD WOMACK: Scenes where
people are naming their child's

00:09:10.905 --> 00:09:13.075
middle name after God.

00:09:13.075 --> 00:09:13.950
PAUL SCHEER: So yeah.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.741
So we've kind of been
taking that aesthetic

00:09:15.741 --> 00:09:18.860
and trying to bring
it out a little bit.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.069
So we all have created shows
and work with each other

00:09:21.069 --> 00:09:21.610
all the time.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.800
TODD WOMACK: So on of the
coolest things that you've

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.142
got coming up is "Crash Test."

00:09:26.142 --> 00:09:26.850
PAUL SCHEER: Yes.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:27.970
TODD WOMACK: It's the
show-- you guys have been

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.200
doing that on and off forever.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:29.950
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:33.040
We've been-- Rob
Huebel, Aziz Ansari

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.360
and I did the show on
MTV called "Human Giant."

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.090
It was a sketch show that
was on MTV at a time when we

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.180
had no business being on MTV.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.710
MTV was like, hey,
we want you guys

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.160
to do a sketch show for us.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.810
And we were like, why are
an older man, a bald dude,

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:50.810
and a little Indian guy.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.420
Like what-- you
have "The Hills,"

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.710
and the prettiest
people basically

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.400
doing zit cream commercials.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.900
Why would you want us?

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.910
And they really just
were like, no, we

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.810
want to have this energy of MTV.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:07.080
So against all odds,
they put us on the air.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.862
We looked like nothing else.

00:10:08.862 --> 00:10:10.820
And like, we were always
invited to the parties

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.070
where we were like the
ugliest people there.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.350
But we were not
the accepcted type.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.550
I remember there's
a picture of me

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.180
and Aziz and Rob with like
Joe Francis and everybody

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.250
from "The Hills."

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.180
It's like what
doesn't belong here.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.384
The three of us.

00:10:25.384 --> 00:10:27.550
And I remember that because
Joe Francis put his arms

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.980
around us-- Joe
Francis of course

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.050
created the great "Girls
Gone Wild" franchise.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.590
I think he may be in prison.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.550
He says, everyone say scumbags!

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.140
And we're like, oh,
we're not scumbags.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.100
TODD WOMACK: We have
a television show.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:43.850
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.900
So but we got to do this show.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.114
And one of the
things that you do

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:49.530
when you're working
on shows a lot

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.780
is you don't get a chance
to get to perform out.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.280
And I think for all
of us, we always

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.446
wanted to make sure we
were getting on stage

00:10:56.446 --> 00:10:57.070
and performing.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.170
So we created this show
that was essentially

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.679
11 o'clock on Monday nights.

00:11:00.679 --> 00:11:02.220
We would always be
able to make that,

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.950
because our shoot day
would never go that long.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.710
So we started doing
the show Crash Test,

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.950
and Rob and I have
continued doing it.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.730
And the show can be
anything that you want.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.420
It's basically a chance for
Rob and I to mess around.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.242
We've had, like,
Yom Kippur on stage.

00:11:20.242 --> 00:11:21.450
We didn't know what that was.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.200
We had someone from the
audience teach us it.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.408
We went to the supermarket,
bought supplies, and then

00:11:25.408 --> 00:11:26.010
did it.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.840
We've sent people
out on blind dates.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.280
We've done dating games.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.820
We did a whole
show via-- what was

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.340
that thing at one point where
it was just-- Chatroulette.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.690
And we open up Chatroulette.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.925
And we went through, and
Tig Notaro was performing,

00:11:40.925 --> 00:11:43.050
and someone was like, my
god, Tig, and freaked out.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.550
So we have like--
it's a place where

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.400
you can do whatever you wanted.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.422
And we were always like, I want
to do this show as a special.

00:11:50.422 --> 00:11:51.630
I want to do it as something.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.150
But it's not really
a stand up show.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.720
It's not really a sketch show.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.050
It's kind of just
this other thing.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.170
This thing that's kind
of very unique to UCB.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.660
And so we didn't
know how to do it.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.285
And then at one time
we were like, what

00:12:04.285 --> 00:12:07.320
would be great if we actually
did the show on a moving bus.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.180
And then Ben Stiller
found out about it,

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.612
and he's like, yeah, let's
go get you guys that bus.

00:12:11.612 --> 00:12:13.695
TODD WOMACK: I was wondering
how you got that bus.

00:12:13.695 --> 00:12:14.080
PAUL SCHEER: We
were like, really?

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.496
Then we're like,
all right, great!

00:12:15.496 --> 00:12:17.200
And Ben Stiller-- we
said to Paramount,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.950
we want to do the
special on a moving bus.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:19.885
Ben's behind it.

00:12:19.885 --> 00:12:20.870
And they're like, well,
what's the script?

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.240
And we're like,
there is no script.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.450
And they were like,
well, we need a script.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:24.670
And Ben's like, no they don't.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.003
And they're like, no they don't.

00:12:26.003 --> 00:12:31.480
And then we got this bus from
42nd Street in Times Square.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.890
It's a glass bus, which
we'll see in a second.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.900
We shipped it out to LA,
and then we just basically

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.430
improvised a special.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.480
We shot for six hours and we
bump into all of our friends

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.790
like Aziz Ansari, Aubrey
Plaza, Rob Corddry.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:51.430
Earl Sweatshirt improvises
a musical-- musical--

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.360
he basically does
a live music video.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.270
And everything-- we
never met anybody

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.810
before we pulled up
to them at their stop.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:58.740
And we were-- yeah.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.420
Everything was over
text and email.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.830
It was the most fun, because
that bus-- whatever we said,

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.680
we could yell at
people in the street.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.730
Like there was a
guy tipping a valet,

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.240
and we had the whole bus
start chanting, tip him more,

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.900
tip him more, tip
him-- and no one

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.080
knows what this is, because
you've never seen a giant glass

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.970
bus rolling down the street.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:25.250
Like, at one point we
all had ski masks on.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.427
And were like, and we're trying
to be as creepy as we could.

00:13:28.427 --> 00:13:29.760
TODD WOMACK: Like all 60 people?

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.570
PAUL SCHEER: Just yeah, like
60 people all in ski masks.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.340
So it was a great
kind of experiment.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.340
And we did one thing--
one of my favorite pieces

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.170
in the whole thing was we
gave a guys-- a random guy,

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.560
we never met this
guy-- an ear bud.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.039
And we said, go out
onto Hollywood Boulevard

00:13:46.039 --> 00:13:47.830
where the Walk of Fame
is, and just start--

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.330
say whatever we tell you.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.680
And he said whatever
we told him.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.524
And I think he just had no fear.

00:13:54.524 --> 00:13:56.940
Because we were like, go up
to that woman, sniff her hair,

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.856
tell her she's pretty.

00:13:57.856 --> 00:13:58.930
And he did it.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.380
And he never had any hesitation.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.580
It was like we
programmed this robot.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.591
And so he got to like
just-- one of the most--

00:14:08.591 --> 00:14:10.090
it was a great
moment that we didn't

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.330
think we were going to
even do in the actual show.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.470
TODD WOMACK: How did you
keep the crowds energy up

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.726
for six hours? were they--

00:14:15.726 --> 00:14:17.350
PAUL SCHEER: It was
fun because I think

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.934
it was that we were having fun.

00:14:19.934 --> 00:14:21.600
We didn't know what
was going to happen.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.310
And a lot of times when you go
to a live taping of whatever--

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:26.980
"Big Bang Theory,"
whatever-- you

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.070
see the same scene three times.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.760
We never did anything twice.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.760
The bus was moving.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.540
You were on a tour.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.220
And instead of watching
like a small TV

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.440
with like "Furious
Seven" on it, you

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.110
were just watching us
interact with celebrities.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.000
And they didn't know
who was coming up next.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.770
They don't know if they're
going to get on the bus.

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.320
No one knew what
was going to happen.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.260
So I feel like it just had
the energy of all right,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.700
yeah, sure, we're in.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.770
What will be next.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.900
TODD WOMACK: Did you know
that the "Reno 911" guys--

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.690
Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant--

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.190
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah,
Ben Garant, Yeah.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.830
TODD WOMACK: --did you know that
they were going to be the cops?

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:01.800
Or were you just like--

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.310
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, we knew
everybody's ultimate game.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.810
Like, we knew Rob was
going to do a yard sale.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.350
But we didn't know where
that was going to go per se.

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.120
We knew that Aubrey was going
to be burying a dead body.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.026
We basically wrote
it enough-- like,

00:15:15.026 --> 00:15:17.150
sketch probbed it in a way,
where we would be like,

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:21.280
hey, you're burying a dead body,
we bump into you, you blame us.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.127
All right, and then Rob,
you're selling stuff,

00:15:24.127 --> 00:15:26.710
you have a Boston accent, you're
not speaking your own accent.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.330
So we were able to
kind of go in there

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.621
and know that we had something.

00:15:29.621 --> 00:15:32.270
But every piece is
really cut down tight.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.360
TODD WOMACK: So that's
going to come out on Vimeo.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.026
PAUL SCHEER: It is
actually already out.

00:15:36.026 --> 00:15:37.740
It's been out for a while now.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:38.990
So-- but don't worry about it.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.508
That's fine.

00:15:39.508 --> 00:15:40.942
It uh--

00:15:40.942 --> 00:15:42.390
TODD WOMACK: Sorry.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.636
I work at YouTube, man,
I don't look at Vimeo.

00:15:44.636 --> 00:15:45.760
I'd get fired if I do that.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.510
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.400
And for anybody internationally,
it's available internationally

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.090
on Vimeo.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.587
And then now on iTunes.

00:15:51.587 --> 00:15:53.420
It just came out and
iTunes a few weeks ago.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:53.850
Yeah.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.610
TODD WOMACK: Any plans
to do more of that?

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:58.650
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah we wanted
to do another "Crash Test."

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.170
And we actually
have a way, I think,

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:04.540
to trump it now and make it even
more drastic-- yeah, airplane.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.070
Duck boat.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:07.820
Yeah I know, yeah.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.119
So that's been a
really-- it was fun

00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:12.910
to be able to kind of
experiment with that.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.780
I feel like the
one thing I like is

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.980
that you're able to mix in a
little bit more sloppy-- that's

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.391
not the best word,
but less polished.

00:16:21.391 --> 00:16:23.390
And that's something I
feel like-- we're so used

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.450
to seeing everything
all like-- when you see

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.580
a stand up special,
it's all perfectly

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.640
rehearsed and everything.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.840
But I think one of the charms
of going to a comedy club

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.350
or going to see people is that
anything can kind of happen,

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:35.625
and that's what we
wanted to do on the bus.

00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:36.620
TODD WOMACK: Great.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.511
Check that out-- one month ago.

00:16:40.511 --> 00:16:41.010
What else?

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.850
So you have some other
digital stuff coming out.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.270
Let me just prep the--
so we have you probably

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.737
till 2:50 up here.

00:16:47.737 --> 00:16:49.570
PAUL SCHEER: Should we
just answer questions

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:50.170
from the audience?

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:51.070
Could that happen?

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.400
Or maybe we won't even have--

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.280
TODD WOMACK: Let's do
a couple more minutes,

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.860
and then we'll
ask for questions.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.370
So if you guys have a
question, think about it,

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.080
and we'll have you come up to
either of these microphones.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.140
PAUL SCHEER: You could
ask about your own life.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.040
I'm going to give you advice.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.369
We can get over issues
with your parents.

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:07.020
So we can really treat
this as like a good group

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.432
therapy session.

00:17:08.432 --> 00:17:10.059
We'll problem solve together.

00:17:10.059 --> 00:17:11.230
TODD WOMACK: This is an
intervention bye the way.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.063
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, this
is-- for one of you.

00:17:13.063 --> 00:17:15.855
We don't know which one yet.

00:17:15.855 --> 00:17:17.175
No, yeah.

00:17:17.175 --> 00:17:18.550
I've been doing
a bunch of stuff.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.770
I just recently
finished a new series

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:27.030
for Maker tentatively
titled "Filthy Sexy Teens."

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:30.165
But apparently that did
not pass legal standards.

00:17:30.165 --> 00:17:32.040
TODD WOMACK: I thought
you were going to say,

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:32.970
that title is taken.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:33.910
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, no.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.022
It is, I'm sure.

00:17:35.022 --> 00:17:36.730
I think we were like,
it's a great title.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:40.980
They were like, yeah, but if
you Google filthy sexy teens,

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.820
It's going to not
necessarily get to our show.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.640
And the show is
really for 14-year-old

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.480
to like 20-year-old girls.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.340
So you're really
going like, yeah mom,

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.450
I want to watch a show
called "Filthy Sexy Teens."

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.560
Google that and
like all of a sudden

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.060
a world is opened up that you
can never close the door to.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.020
But yeah, no-- and I
recently just finished

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.410
doing the second
season of "Hotwives,"

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.250
which is a show I
produced for Hulu,

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.370
which is a parody of "The
Real Housewives" worlds.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.079
But I've basically
been doing all these--

00:18:13.079 --> 00:18:15.411
in addition to doing things
like "The League" and "Fresh

00:18:15.411 --> 00:18:17.057
off the Boat" and
stuff like that.

00:18:17.057 --> 00:18:18.640
All these things in
the digital space.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.723
And one of the things about
"Crash Test" we really

00:18:20.723 --> 00:18:23.370
want to do is to make it
ourselves and self release it.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.680
Because there's sort
of-- we wanted to kind of

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.950
be platform agnostic.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.860
Sometimes it's very
hard to get something.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.030
Like, oh, if everyone
watches "House of Cards,"

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.620
then all of a sudden I got
to spend $7.99 for Netflix.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.230
Not that that's a waste, but
if you don't want to do that,

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.860
then you've got to-- you've got
to-- just to watch one thing.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.090
We want to make it on a platform
where anyone could get it--

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.430
all you need to do
is pay us the money.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.780
Which seemed like the best plan.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.070
TODD WOMACK: So you
got that thing--

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.250
I saw something-- some
cartoon called "White Ninja"?

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.708
PAUL SCHEER: Oh
Yeah. "White Ninja"

00:18:53.708 --> 00:18:56.250
is a new thing that I'm doing.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.030
Finally Vine is coming
out with a TV series.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:05.360
They're are six second TV series
called "White Ninja," which

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.250
is-- I think when the
internet first started,

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.640
"White Ninja" was a thing.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.290
It was kind of this crudely
drawn, black and white

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.770
comic book about
this white ninja who

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.890
is just really a real jerk.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.500
And so Vine is like, yes,
that's our first show.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.960
And so we did a six second show.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.612
And it's a daily show.

00:19:27.612 --> 00:19:29.320
But one of the recording
process for that

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.020
was insane, because you
have to cram everything

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.139
into six seconds.

00:19:33.139 --> 00:19:35.680
No matter what the dialogue, no
matter who you're interacting

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.750
with, you'd be like,
that was great,

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.630
but that was eight seconds.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:38.671
Sorry, gotta do it again.

00:19:38.671 --> 00:19:41.380
So it was almost a race
to get every word out

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.150
in time before it relooped.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.770
So hopefully that
will turn out good.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.250
TODD WOMACK: I saw that it
was going to be on Vine,

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.714
I just assumed it was going
to not be six seconds long.

00:19:48.714 --> 00:19:49.380
PAUL SCHEER: No.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.260
100% six seconds.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.150
Yeah.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.650
It is--

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.050
TODD WOMACK: How did you fit
in all those six second audio

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.080
like into your schedule?

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:57.850
Who has that kind of time?

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:58.480
PAUL SCHEER: I know.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.920
It was really-- we did
them all individually,

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.836
which was really dumb.

00:20:00.836 --> 00:20:02.625
We should have just
block shot them all.

00:20:02.625 --> 00:20:03.910
TODD WOMACK: In one 25 minute.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:04.660
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.741
We would go there for
about three minutes.

00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:08.240
Leave.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:08.980
Come back.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.277
TODD WOMACK: 100 episodes done.

00:20:10.277 --> 00:20:11.360
PAUL SCHEER: It really is.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.380
I imagine like-- we did
about 40 or 50 episodes.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.880
I think it probably is a sum
total of like 40 minutes.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.470
Maybe.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:20.230
At most.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.780
It can't.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.220
It can't even be 40 minutes.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.216
Math whizzes, what is it?

00:20:24.216 --> 00:20:25.370
TODD WOMACK: It's 20.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.430
PAUL SCHEER: Well the
question-- the line is

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.180
just daunting at the Q&amp;A posts.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.260
TODD WOMACK: Yeah.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:31.760
Oh hey.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.045
There's Alan, stoking
the fire over there.

00:20:34.045 --> 00:20:34.790
ALAN: Yeah.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:35.873
I'm going to start it off.

00:20:35.873 --> 00:20:38.550
So we're now in the final
season of "The League."

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.112
Sad face.

00:20:40.112 --> 00:20:41.820
I was wondering if
you could talk about--

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.480
PAUL SCHEER: Say sad face emoji.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.517
Because we can just
see your sad face.

00:20:45.517 --> 00:20:47.350
But if you say sad face
emoji, then we know.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.308
ALAN: Hashtag sad face.

00:20:48.308 --> 00:20:50.104
TODD WOMACK: You
live emoji-d it.

00:20:50.104 --> 00:20:51.520
ALAN: I was wondering
if you could

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.010
talk about how that has sort
of shaped your career, being

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:54.490
on "The League."

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.600
And then if you had a favorite
story you like to tell,

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.530
we'd love to hear it.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:58.440
PAUL SCHEER: Oh yeah.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.440
Well "The League" is a
really interesting story,

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.560
because it was a show
that I almost didn't do.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.170
I think every thing
that I've ever gotten,

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.620
I've been adamantly like,
I'm never doing that.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.975
It's no, not interested.

00:21:09.975 --> 00:21:11.350
And it was about--
because it was

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.652
a show about fantasy football.

00:21:12.652 --> 00:21:14.860
I was like, I can't improvise
about fantasy football.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.080
Who does fantasy football?

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:16.350
No one.

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:17.170
TODD WOMACK: That
was 2009, right?

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:17.919
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:20.180
TODD WOMACK: Since then
it's become a huge business.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.110
PAUL SCHEER: It was
definitely prevalent,

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:24.540
and there were people who
knew about it, and it was big.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.490
But I was doing fantasy
football before there

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:27.791
were apps on your phone.

00:21:27.791 --> 00:21:29.040
It was a little bit different.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.280
And it's grown.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.380
Now DraftKings--
and the government's

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.540
investigating DraftKings--
we've come so far.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:41.130
But the audition for the
show was really interesting,

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:45.590
because it was the perfect
opportunity for a show for me,

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:49.100
because basically
it's improvised.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.440
You get to do whatever you want.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.355
You're going to
create your character

00:21:51.355 --> 00:21:53.070
and you're going to
improvise with these people.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.486
It was being created by Jeff
Schaffer and Jackie Schaffer.

00:21:55.486 --> 00:21:58.690
Jeff wrote on "Seinfeld" and
writes and directs "Curb"

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.220
and was on all the Sacha
Baron Cohen movies.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.360
So it was an
amazing opportunity.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.780
And that show has
been-- I've been

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.279
very lucky to be involved
with very cool shows.

00:22:10.279 --> 00:22:11.820
Like the first show
that I ever did--

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.060
and even if it feels
lame now, I did

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.060
this a show called
"Best Week Ever," which

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.360
was just like-- thank you.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.107
Thank you.

00:22:19.107 --> 00:22:20.540
Aw.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.440
Yeah, we used to talk
about Ben and Jen.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.856
The old Jen.

00:22:24.856 --> 00:22:26.535
J-Lo.

00:22:26.535 --> 00:22:28.660
But no, it was like-- I've
been on these shows that

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.530
have a really crazy fan base.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.220
And "Best Week Ever" was one,
and "Human Giant" was another.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:38.370
But "The League" opened up this
world where it was like, wow.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:41.820
People have loved this show and
it's been really fun to make.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.480
And we get to work with a real
diverse group, Mark Duplass

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.040
and Katie who come from
the independent film world.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.870
Nick Kroll who-- we actually
were friends, so no big

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.790
deal on him.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:55.270
Jon Lajoie is a guy
who was a Canadian soap

00:22:55.270 --> 00:23:00.620
star who then became a YouTube
star making these funny rap

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.180
songs.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:05.460
And Steve Rannazzisi
who is a stand up comic.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.205
And all these different
people from all

00:23:07.205 --> 00:23:09.330
these different backgrounds
who came in and we just

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:10.930
really jelled as a group.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:12.210
So that's been great.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.540
Even to this day we're just
still having fun on set.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:23.320
And I guess as far is
favorite stories-- it's always

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.380
interesting because--
the show can dictate

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.080
whatever you want it to be.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.480
For example, I
referenced in one episode

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:37.820
that I have a blog dedicated
to Don Henley music and magic.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:41.490
And one of the best things
about that was an episode later,

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.850
we were able to make
that blog in the show.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:46.490
So it's kind of like the show
in itself is a magic trip.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.840
You're like, whatever you say
can come true in an episode.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.840
TODD WOMACK: Some intern
has to spend all night.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.590
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah it's
like, here it goes,

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.670
we'll write a scene
where we see your blog.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.190
Yeah.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.050
It's funny.

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:00.502
In seven years, the whole
show kind of blurs together.

00:24:00.502 --> 00:24:02.960
So whenever people ask me, oh,
what's your favorite moment,

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.360
I'm like, well, what we shot
last week was really fun.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.910
Because it's only the
last thing I remember.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.900
But the one moment
that I feel like kind

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:13.350
of jelled the whole
show is in the pilot,

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:18.070
we were doing the scene
around this joint.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.780
My first joint
that I ever smoked.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.450
But it turned out it was pubes.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:21.950
Hilarious.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.620
And I'm trying to
cheers everybody.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.110
I'm saying, so a toast
to my good friends.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.890
And everyone started drinking
before the toast started.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.620
And I was like, oh, OK, hold on,
I'm just-- I'm making a toast.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.820
To my-- drink, drink.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:39.570
Oh, hey.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:42.320
And this whole bit got
started about them drinking

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.060
before I finished my toast.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.555
And it was all improvised.

00:24:45.555 --> 00:24:46.680
And I was like, oh my gosh.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.510
This is the ability
of this show.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.020
I'm never going to have
that opportunity again.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:56.110
And it's been like that since
day one all the way to now--

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.481
is just on the spot, going,
oh, how about if we do this.

00:24:58.481 --> 00:24:59.480
How about it we do this.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.460
And everything comes together.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:06.250
And I think for me, one of
the most daunting moments

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.080
of the show was in
the second season.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.550
We had Terrell
Suggs on the show.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:13.960
He's a very
intimidatingly big man.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.580
And the one I've learned--
and I've learned this thing--

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.080
every time I meet
a football player,

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.069
I assume they're older than me.

00:25:22.069 --> 00:25:23.860
I think I'm still always
a kid, and they're

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.630
like 20 younger than me.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:26.930
They're like, hi, I'm 15.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:27.670
I'm like, oh, OK.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:34.260
But they're-- we all come out
of the machine like at 100%.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.450
They come out of the
machine at like 150%.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:39.190
Like J. J. Watt is a giant man.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:42.840
Like you stand next to him--
he's like an astro mech

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.690
from "Pacific Rim."

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:45.710
I could step inside him.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.280
Controlling you.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.240
They're big.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.490
And you never know how they're
going to take anything.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.573
TODD WOMACK: Seven years
on a show about football,

00:25:54.573 --> 00:25:57.012
and you've learned that
football players are big.

00:25:57.012 --> 00:25:58.720
PAUL SCHEER: It never
ceases to amaze me.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.570
Because you see them,
but in real life

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:03.840
when they're standing next to
you, you feel just smaller.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.430
I can't express
it more than that.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.070
I would say two
moments stick out.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.770
Well-- OK, I can
tell this story.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.210
I'll tell them both.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:18.484
One I just have to
not name any names.

00:26:18.484 --> 00:26:20.770
So Terrell Suggs on the show.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:25.881
And my character Andre is
having an all white party.

00:26:25.881 --> 00:26:26.380
Right.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.730
And it was just you
had to wear white.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:35.030
And then I had to go up to
Terrell Suggs and say, sorry.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.370
He was not wearing white.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:41.279
And I had to kind of kick him--
it was a really crazy scene.

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:43.070
They're like, we don't
want to tell Terrell

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:44.570
what you're going to say.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.630
Just go up to him
and say, all white.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:52.840
And we want to get his honest
reaction the first take.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.040
I never have been more
nervous in my life.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.980
Because he never even
met me, the show was new,

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.140
and I think he was like,
why am I on this show.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.460
And I think, like,
am I being pranked.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.250
But to his credit,
he was so funny.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:13.130
I said it to him, and he clicked
in, and then was improvising.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:16.110
And I still say, Terrell Suggs
is the best football improviser

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.870
that we've had on the show.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:18.980
He was amazing.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.640
Second story that
was kind of crazy

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.335
was we had a monkey on the show.

00:27:23.335 --> 00:27:28.530
A capuchin monkey that
was clearly not trained.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.560
The one thing that you learn
when you work in TV and movies

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.090
is there are all
these animal trainers,

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.620
but they don't train anything.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.900
They don't know these are
animals and they're wild.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.720
Someone's like, oh,
I'm the snake trainer.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.110
Like, you don't train a snake.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.534
How do you train a snake?

00:27:44.534 --> 00:27:45.200
They're a snake.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.150
TODD WOMACK: No.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:46.650
No.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.700
PAUL SCHEER: They are like--
they literally have a stick

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.918
and they're like poking it.

00:27:52.741 --> 00:27:55.706
TODD WOMACK: I've trained the
snake to react when I poke it.

00:27:55.706 --> 00:27:57.410
TODD WOMACK: You're
hitting a snake.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:01.410
So the larger the animal,
the more risks you're taking.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.190
So we had this monkey.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:05.450
And the whole idea
was he's a ghost

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:09.850
monkey, does it really exist, or
maybe it wasn't, I don't know.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.570
He did exist in
real life for me.

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:17.170
And I'm driving my car and
he gets loose in the car.

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:18.980
And so the only way
to do that is to have

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.820
a monkey loose in a moving car.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:29.030
And the monkey went crazy and
started attacking the visor.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:33.120
Like eating the
visor of the car.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.620
I'm on the road like on a
platform car, freaking out,

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.140
and the trainer is
hiding in the back seat.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.040
So if anything goes
wrong, he can't get there.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.929
And the trainer, he's like--
I'm going, he's freaking out,

00:28:45.929 --> 00:28:47.470
he's freaking out,
what should we do.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.470
He's like, give him
the Sour Patch Kids,

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:51.800
give him the Sour Patch Kids.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.809
Which didn't seem like
a great idea to me.

00:28:53.809 --> 00:28:55.100
TODD WOMACK: Here's some sugar.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.016
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, like--
this is not in book.

00:28:57.016 --> 00:28:58.780
It's sugar in the
shape of a human.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:02.050
Giving him the wrong idea.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:03.100
So yeah.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.520
I did not like working
with that monkey.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.450
TODD WOMACK: Question.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:08.991
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Everything I've ever

00:29:08.991 --> 00:29:11.150
read about--
anything about comedy

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.770
says that comedy is
the hardest thing

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.730
to do of out of even
drama or anything else.

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:15.410
Why is that?

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.247
What is it that makes comedy--
and people that do other stuff

00:29:18.247 --> 00:29:20.080
try and do comedy and
say it was the hardest

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:20.730
thing I've ever done.

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:22.230
PAUL SCHEER: Well
maybe because it's

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.940
like-- if I came and
tried to do your job,

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.830
it would be the hardest
thing I ever did.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:29.326
I feel like I think
it's hard because if you

00:29:29.326 --> 00:29:30.700
try to make a
transition-- I feel

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.660
like I wouldn't go up here and
be like, yeah, improv is tough.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.850
Like really had a
tough improv show.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:41.460
But that's what I've been doing
for-- I couldn't make a show.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:44.350
But I'm sure if you said to a
cobbler, is making shoes hard,

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.270
he'd be like, no, I
do this all the time.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:53.680
As you saw in the great Adam
Sandler movie "The Cobbler."

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.730
You know, I don't know.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:58.750
I think the one thing that I
do know that maybe people don't

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:01.280
want to do is look foolish.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.800
I certainly look foolish
all the time, especially

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:04.530
on "The League."

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:07.840
My characters dress
as much as a clown

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:12.850
as you can possibly get
without being a clown.

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.570
But I think it's
maybe looking foolish.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.440
And you have to
give supreme trust

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.190
in a lot of different people.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:22.880
I think for something
to work comedically--

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.200
and it's not on stage--
if it's on film,

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.730
the editors have to be with you.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:28.590
The director has to be with.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.650
Your scene partners
have to be with you.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:32.010
So it's a lot of trust.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:35.990
Whereas if you have someone
amazing Benedict Cumberbatch

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.980
or something-- if he gives a
fucking awesome-- can we curse?

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.365
I'm sorry.

00:30:41.365 --> 00:30:43.190
That clip had a
million curses in it.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:44.565
And I'm like
holding back curses.

00:30:44.565 --> 00:30:45.655
TODD WOMACK: It's OK.

00:30:45.655 --> 00:30:47.390
PAUL SCHEER: You can give
an amazing performance

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:48.720
and walk away, and
it would be like,

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.110
oh that performance was amazing.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.690
I think comedy requires a little
bit more of a group effort

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:56.010
and a trust in the group.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.000
And I think that
that's a daunting thing

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.890
to give that over.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.780
And Jim Carrey I guess
does it by himself.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.720
But I don't--

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.700
But I think maybe
that there's a fear,

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.860
and you have to be open to it.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.800
But yeah. and I guess
ultimately, too,

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.900
if you fail at
comedy, it's apparent.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.795
If you fail at drama,
it's like-- eh.

00:31:17.795 --> 00:31:18.670
No one will be like--

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:19.170
TODD WOMACK: It's a choice.

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:20.280
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah,
no one will be like--

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.780
and you have to really fail at
drama badly for someone to be

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:23.970
like, they're a bad actor.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:25.860
Like "The Room,"
that's some bad acting.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.220
But there's a lot of middle
of the road bad drama.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:32.130
Like I mean, turn on any
"NCIS," you're going to be like,

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.450
yeah, that's fine.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:39.857
But like comedy, it's like
it's good or it's not.

00:31:39.857 --> 00:31:40.690
it's like that's it.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.400
There's like, I
laughed, or I didn't.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.430
Like drama, you're not
like, he didn't move me.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:47.419
So maybe that's it.

00:31:47.419 --> 00:31:48.710
There's a very black and white.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:51.417
TODD WOMACK: What is your
job, if we could ask?

00:31:51.417 --> 00:31:53.500
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I work
on one of the ad products.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:54.550
It's called Double Click.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:56.004
TODD WOMACK: What is your title?

00:31:56.004 --> 00:31:57.795
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm
an escalation manager.

00:31:57.795 --> 00:31:59.210
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah, see,
I couldn't do that.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:00.370
TODD WOMACK: I think
you could do that.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:01.600
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I could teach
you to do it very quickly.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.970
PAUL SCHEER: I can't even
organize my Google Docs.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:03.760
Come on.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.230
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Neither can we.

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:08.040
TODD WOMACK: We got
another one over here.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.700
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So
I'll start with why

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.320
I'm asking the
question, which is

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.510
before this season
of "The League,"

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.590
I feel like my overwhelming
emotion for Andre was pity.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:19.360
And after this seaons
of "The League"--

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.234
and I don't want to ruin
it for people, why--

00:32:21.234 --> 00:32:26.130
but now it's more like
despise-- like I hate him.

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:32.523
And I guess Jack Gleeson, who
played King Joffrey in "Game

00:32:32.523 --> 00:32:36.580
of Thrones"-- he told you
about how his character has had

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.120
consequences in his real life.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.220
Does that happen to you?

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.910
PAUL SCHEER: Oh interesting.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:44.507
Well, we are like the "Game of
Thrones" of fantasy football.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.640
You know, one of
the things I tried

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.950
to do early on in the show-- if
I've done anything calculated

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:59.200
in my career, it was to distance
myself a little bit from Andre,

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.960
because the last thing I wanted
to do was be viewed as Andre.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.034
I think that like,
Matt LeBlanc-- I mean,

00:33:07.034 --> 00:33:09.450
he's apparently amazing on
"Episodes"-- but you think, oh,

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:11.080
that's Joey from "Friends."

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.435
I didn't want to be just that.

00:33:12.435 --> 00:33:14.310
So one of the things I
tried to do right away

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:16.980
was do this Adult
Swim show like "NTSF,"

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:20.200
and be like doing a Jack
Bauer "24" type of character.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.560
So very different.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.470
And I tried to embrace
things like that.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:29.620
I feel like Twitter
and stuff like

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.200
that-- people will come up and
be like, yo, Dre, what up-- I

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.670
think people call you
by your name a lot.

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:35.760
That's the consequences.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.187
I think King-- is it
Joffrey or Jeffrey?

00:33:40.187 --> 00:33:42.520
They probably won't call him
King Joffrey out and about,

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.640
but I feel like whenever
I'm in any airport

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.170
or public situation, it's
like, Andre, what's up.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:48.800
TODD WOMACK: You
also have those fans

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.030
who are like football fans.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.547
PAUL SCHEER: Yes.

00:33:51.547 --> 00:33:53.130
And so I think the
biggest consequence

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:56.390
of being on this show is people
ask me about fantasy football

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:58.150
all the time.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:01.780
And I am not a wealth of
fantasy football knowledge.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:06.360
I know about my teams and
I don't care about yours.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.757
And nor would I expect
you to care about mine.

00:34:08.757 --> 00:34:11.090
But I feel like people are
always like, let me ask you--

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:12.506
who should I start
in [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:12.506 --> 00:34:16.239
And it's a crazy question,
because it's so specific

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:18.431
based on who's in
your league, where

00:34:18.431 --> 00:34:19.639
are you, who are you playing.

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:22.500
It's like-- so yeah, so I
think the biggest consequence

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.790
is that.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:27.280
And also I could
probably never wear

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:30.389
a hat that's not a baseball cap.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:33.730
Like there was a moment like
I was away on a vacation,

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:35.860
and there was-- I
would say a respectful

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:39.585
looking-- it wasn't a fedora,
but it was kind of a beach hat.

00:34:39.585 --> 00:34:40.960
I don't know how
you describe it.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.449
And I was like, no, there's
no way I could ever wear that.

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.695
Because then I'm like,
oh he is like that guy.

00:34:46.695 --> 00:34:48.690
He wears that.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:49.909
I do not want to be that.

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:53.909
So I am extra cautious about
how I dress, and I can never

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:54.460
wear a hat.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.980
So whenever I am
out and about, it's

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.040
a baseball cap 100% of the time.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.530
And as a bald man,
I need hat options.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:01.670
And I have no hat options.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.044
TODD WOMACK: I
got a lot of hats.

00:35:03.044 --> 00:35:03.720
Some cool hats.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:04.120
PAUL SCHEER: Yeah.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.720
I only can wear a
ball cap though.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.940
I feel like any other hat will
put me in that Andre category.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.680
TODD WOMACK: Hey, I
was watching football

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.810
with Nick Kroll in a
bar a couple of years

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.850
ago with a couple
other comedian friends.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:16.911
And-- it was one
of those ones where

00:35:16.911 --> 00:35:18.910
you have a bunch of
football games on in a bar--

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.555
and he just got attacked
by everyone about football.

00:35:21.555 --> 00:35:23.430
And I was like, oh my
god, what a weird fate.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:27.430
TODD WOMACK: It's a crazy--
yeah, it's kind of crazy.

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:28.050
Yeah.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:31.199
But I mean, the fans of "The
League" have been amazing.

00:35:31.199 --> 00:35:32.990
TODD WOMACK: Yeah
they're big time into it.

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:34.114
PAUL SCHEER: Big time fans.

00:35:34.114 --> 00:35:36.010
TODD WOMACK: Let's do
another one over here.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:36.880
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.491
First off, thanks for coming.

00:35:38.491 --> 00:35:40.532
Second of all, I'm a big
fan of your podcast "How

00:35:40.532 --> 00:35:43.476
Did This Get Made" with Jason
Mantzoukas and June Diane

00:35:43.476 --> 00:35:44.070
Raphael.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:45.690
So my question
concerns the podcast,

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:47.110
which is, did you
ever figure out

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:48.790
what happened to the
man who threw away

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:49.909
the dog in "Mr. Nanny"?

00:35:49.909 --> 00:35:52.450
PAUL SCHEER: Well, it's really
interesting you bring that up,

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.980
because-- I thank you for that.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.450
So I do this bad movie podcast
called "How Did This Get Made."

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:01.284
We basically watch a movie
and then just talk about it.

00:36:01.284 --> 00:36:02.470
So it's like a conversation.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:03.730
And it's been really fun.

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:05.105
And one of the
movies that we did

00:36:05.105 --> 00:36:07.090
was a movie called "Mr.
Nanny" with Hulk Hogan.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:09.950
You could figure it out.

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:13.920
The plot-- it's all there,
right there in the title.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.460
But there's an opening
sequence in the film

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.860
where Hulk Hogan is driving
his motorcycle down--

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.990
it's a beauty shot of Florida.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:25.800
And in the background-- and
it's not called attention to,

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.670
and only when you slow
it down do you see it--

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:34.300
there's a guy with a dog in
his hand, and he's like this.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:38.130
Tosses a dog into a river.

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:39.058
Or a body of water.

00:36:39.058 --> 00:36:41.682
I don't wanna be-- I don't know
what the body of water-- and he

00:36:41.682 --> 00:36:43.570
tosses is out.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:45.087
And we pointed that out.

00:36:45.087 --> 00:36:46.670
And it had been
pointed out before us,

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:48.086
we were not the
ones to find this.

00:36:48.086 --> 00:36:50.610
But someone pointed it out,
and we showed it again.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:53.750
And it became a big
topic of conversation.

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:56.180
Recently someone
emailed me and said,

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:59.270
I figured out why that
guy was throwing the dog.

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:04.630
And apparently that is a lake
in which dogs can swim in it.

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:07.730
So if they were
shooting it, that

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:09.720
may have just been
an a-hole owner

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.320
who was like, get in there.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.280
So he was doing the
right thing-- ish.

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:21.040
Dogs do belong in that lake.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.580
But I don't know if I agree
with the way he was putting him

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.290
in that lake.

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:27.010
Yeah.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:28.410
But we've actually done
something really cool

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:29.240
with the show.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.057
We partnered up with
this guy Blake Harris.

00:37:31.057 --> 00:37:33.140
Blake Harris wrote this
book called "Console Wars"

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.690
about Sega and Nintendo.

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:37.970
And he's actually been
doing-- because the biggest

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:39.970
complaint of our show is,
how did this get made?

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:41.136
We're not going to tell you.

00:37:41.136 --> 00:37:41.810
We don't know.

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:43.726
We're just going to talk
about what we thought

00:37:43.726 --> 00:37:45.120
was ridiculous about it.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.322
He is actually doing the
how did this get made

00:37:47.322 --> 00:37:49.280
of "How Did This Get
Made" He's been going back

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.280
and interviewing people.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.900
We just did "Masters of the
Universe" with Tatyana Maslany

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:53.930
from "Orphan Black."

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:55.700
And he went back and he
talked to people from Mattel,

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.270
and he talked to
people on the movie,

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.340
and he gets the full
behind the scenes story.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:03.030
So hopefully, if we ever come
across a "Mr. Nanny" situation,

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:05.410
we're going to able to break
that story much quicker

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:06.010
in the future.

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:07.216
Yeah.

00:38:07.216 --> 00:38:09.892
TODD WOMACK: I think we've got
time for one more question.

00:38:09.892 --> 00:38:10.725
Let's go over there.

00:38:10.725 --> 00:38:11.555
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey Paul.

00:38:11.555 --> 00:38:13.070
I'm actually also a Huge fan
of "How Did This Get Made."

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:14.520
PAUL SCHEER: Oh,
thank you so much.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.394
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Just
given how many projects

00:38:16.394 --> 00:38:18.883
you're in, and how time
consuming they must all be--

00:38:18.883 --> 00:38:22.350
especially "NTSF," "Crash
Test," and "The League"--

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:25.090
do you plan on continuing to
do podcasts as long as you can

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:28.710
based on how a lot easier
they must be to manage?

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:30.846
PAUL SCHEER: You know, to
me a podcast-- and Jason

00:38:30.846 --> 00:38:32.470
and I were talking
about the other day.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:35.380
Jason Matsoukas and I,
we started off at UCB.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.960
And it's been a
really fun thing.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.460
But the best part of UCB-- and
I talked about this earlier--

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.180
is it's great to have a
place to get up and perform.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.220
You have to just be in
front of an audience,

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.750
because that's where
we all started.

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:49.110
And I still perform twice
a week at UCB most weeks.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:50.890
And podcasts have
that same feeling.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:52.167
You can just kind of show up.

00:38:52.167 --> 00:38:54.250
Me, for the podcast, I
have to do a lot more work,

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.530
because I'm kind of
the-- I just have

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.280
to do a lot more work
than Jason and June.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.870
They just watch the movie and
show up. [INAUDIBLE] sometimes.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:06.090
But I do have good interns that
help me put together stuff.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:07.780
But it is fun, and it's easy.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.990
And the benefit of doing all
the things that I am doing

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.920
is that they're all
in short intervals.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.930
So The League is 12
weeks out of the year.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:19.050
And so that doesn't
take up that much time.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:22.310
And when we shot "Hotwives,"
which was eight half hours,

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:25.170
or seven half hours--
it was only 10 days.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:27.760
So we're shooting in these
compact periods of time.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.330
So yeah.

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:29.810
As much as we can
do it, we can do it.

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:31.770
We've been erring more on
the side of live shows,

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:32.810
because they're easier to book.

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:34.900
And we're like, well, we got
to show up and make a podcast

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:35.410
there.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:37.159
So that's why we do a
lot more live shows.

00:39:37.159 --> 00:39:39.970
Because I think if it's
booked, we'll definitely do it.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.340
I feel like we've got to
take this guy's question.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.090
TODD WOMACK: Yeah.

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:43.042
That was a quick one.

00:39:43.042 --> 00:39:44.970
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's
kind of a quick one.

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:47.090
So I know "The
League" is improvised,

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:49.655
but I'm sure you guys have
to write some plot points

00:39:49.655 --> 00:39:50.680
and stuff beforehand.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.305
So I was wondering
how much is written,

00:39:52.305 --> 00:39:53.719
and what extent it's improvised.

00:39:53.719 --> 00:39:55.260
PAUL SCHEER: Well
yeah, I've actually

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:59.310
written a bunch of episodes over
the course of the seven years.

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:01.630
And so it's one of the
harder scripts to write,

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:04.800
because you have to write
a 12 page outline that

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:10.520
is a full story with full plot
lines and joke ideas in them,

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.700
but it has to be loose
enough that it doesn't feel

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.220
like you're writing a scene.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:19.420
So it's this weird
middle ground of-- it's

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.744
almost like a very
detailed outline.

00:40:21.744 --> 00:40:23.910
But some of the stuff in
the show that people really

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:28.080
like, like the terminology--
like fear boner, or Eskimo

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.900
brother, or stuff
like that-- that had

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.060
come from our show creators.

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.524
Jeff Schaffer worked
on "Seinfeld."

00:40:34.524 --> 00:40:35.940
He was one of the
guys who created

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.820
the term regifted,
which I didn't know

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.130
was a "Seinfeld" term.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:43.030
That is such in our lexicon,
but that came out of there.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:45.850
And then I saw Eskimo
brothers on "The Bachelor"--

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:46.740
which, Bachelor.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.270
I love "The Bachelor."

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:49.890
So good.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:51.747
Oh my god, we've made
it, we've made it.

00:40:51.747 --> 00:40:53.330
They're not saying,
like, on that show

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:54.580
"The League," Eskimo brothers.

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:56.413
They're like, no, no,
we're Eskimo brothers.

00:40:56.413 --> 00:40:58.210
It's like, whoa, how
did that come in.

00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:01.144
So yeah, there are
these touchstones

00:41:01.144 --> 00:41:02.310
throughout the whole script.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:04.549
And if you're not
an improvisors--

00:41:04.549 --> 00:41:06.090
and we have a lot
of actors that come

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:07.540
on the show who are
not improvisors--

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:08.160
there's enough there.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.600
Especially with our
football players.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.760
We're like, hey, this is
what we're going to do,

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.093
we're really walking through it.

00:41:12.093 --> 00:41:15.260
But what's so great about our
show is, when we start with

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.487
that the first take
we do as scripted.

00:41:17.487 --> 00:41:18.570
But then we find a moment.

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:23.270
And in the second episode of
the season, we're doing a draft.

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:26.389
And in the draft I'm
kind of auctioning off

00:41:26.389 --> 00:41:27.430
something going on there.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:31.300
And Jason thinks that I'm
playing a game of password.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.640
And he's like, things
a Cobb salad would say.

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.000
And I'd like, no.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:35.470
What are you talking about?

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:36.810
And he's like, things
a Cobb salad would say.

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:37.860
I'm like, no, no.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.990
And then we started playing
this big game of things

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:43.950
a Cobb salad say password.

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:46.740
And that became like
a chunk of the scene.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.017
And that would never
happen anywhere else,

00:41:49.017 --> 00:41:50.350
and that's not written anywhere.

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:52.920
So that's kind of the
benefit of the show,

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.560
is that we have enough
to make the show work.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.890
But never have we left
that on the table.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:00.852
Every scene primarily
starts at a place

00:42:00.852 --> 00:42:02.310
and then grows into
a bigger place,

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:04.220
but we have to know at
the end of the scene

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.760
that Andre can't
go like, and then

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.680
I'm going to go to
the moon tomorrow.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.170
We do have you know he's
got to go here, to go here,

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:11.320
to go here.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.931
We've got to hit
the plot points.

00:42:12.931 --> 00:42:13.805
TODD WOMACK: Awesome.

00:42:13.805 --> 00:42:15.300
Well, thanks for
joining us Paul.

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.070
PAUL SCHEER: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.695
TODD WOMACK: Thank
you guys for coming.

00:42:17.695 --> 00:42:18.820
Paul Scheer everybody.
