00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.719
So the great thing about reports is, they don't necessarily have to be

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:07.080
turned into charts. You can keep them as reports too. but before we can

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.140
turn it into a chart, we have to change the report type. because right

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.260
now, if you see next to the preview we're set to the tabular format.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.520
&gt;&gt; huh.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.750
&gt;&gt; And the tabular format is the simplest type

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.320
of report, which is what we're looking at right now.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.510
&gt;&gt; huh.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.580
&gt;&gt; Just simple like a spreadsheet. But

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.240
you can't actually turn that into a dashboard.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.610
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.610
&gt;&gt; So, if we click the other report types.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.410
&gt;&gt; Summary

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.480
&gt;&gt; Summary, which is

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.800
really similar to tabular, but it just adds a little grouping

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.910
for you to be able to more granularly categorize the data.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.340
&gt;&gt; Can I click it and see what you mean?

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 'Kay, so what do you mean by grouping? Like, what could I group on?

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.340
&gt;&gt; So, maybe one thing that we'd want to group by,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.980
instead of doing it the way we have now, is if

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.870
you take that Ticket Type field, just grab it from the

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.790
header, and then drag it into where it says Drag Field Here.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.841
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Oh, cool.

00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:50.780
&gt;&gt; And so now what it's going to do, yeah. It separates all of the different

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.110
ticket types to, these are all of the ones for our VIP. And then it'll give you

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.620
a little subtotal for how much has been spent

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.090
on VIP and then same thing for General Admission.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.500
&gt;&gt; That's really cool.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.990
&gt;&gt; And there will be a grand total at the bottom.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.610
&gt;&gt; Okay there is no grand total.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.860
&gt;&gt; Well, there will be, but this is just a preview.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.140
&gt;&gt; okay, so that's pretty cool. that's summary, what were the other ones?

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.690
&gt;&gt; So the other ones are matrix, which is

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.980
really similar to summary, but you can also create groupings

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.740
on the left-hand side. So, that's why it's a matrix,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.280
you can do it along the top and the side.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.480
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.510
&gt;&gt; And, then joined is kind of just a

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.190
culmination of a bunch of reports that you can

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.660
then just be able to show different types of

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.260
data in different ways, but have one huge report.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.590
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay. So, how do we, how do we go

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.339
from this summary report to that, our nice little gauge dashboard?

00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:41.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, what you want to do is we want

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.210
to click Save One More Time because when

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.960
you run the report, it doesn't actually save it.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.250
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.290
&gt;&gt; After it saves, click on Report.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.720
&gt;&gt; Okay, so here's our report. And we've got our VIP ticket type, total

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.230
spent for each person. You know, I would have liked a sum total down here.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I totally forgot the last step. So, let's go

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.380
back into the, our Report Editor by just clicking Customize here.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.470
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.130
&gt;&gt; And it will take us right back to the view we were

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.240
in before. So what we care about is the total spent column, right?

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.755
&gt;&gt; Um-hmm.

00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:16.120
&gt;&gt; So let's actually drag that to the end, just so it

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.500
kind of keeps that separate and we can see the total on the right.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.840
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.660
&gt;&gt; And then click that little arrow, and then what we're

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.830
going to do is we're going to want to summarize this field.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.210
&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.220
&gt;&gt; And then click Sum so it'll create a total for each of those.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.420
&gt;&gt; And now we can see it's going to sum up all

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.388
of the VIPS. All of the General Admissions,

00:02:33.388 --> 00:02:34.696
and we'll have a grand total at the bottom.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.439
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm going to save and run Report again.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.264
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:37.264 --> 00:02:40.398
&gt;&gt; All right. We've got $14,600 bucks from VIP

00:02:40.398 --> 00:02:45.079
tickets and then $28,000 or so on the General Admission.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.045
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:02:46.045 --> 00:02:49.710
&gt;&gt; Okay. That's cool. So now if I go

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.010
to the bottom, okay, keeps track of the total amount.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.880
And I'm guessing this is, I mean, I know

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.600
that this is the number that somehow has to feed

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.910
into our little, our gauge thing.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.660
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
