jQuery let's you go beyond simply modifying existing DOM elements.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.790
You can create and delete DOM elements with ease as well.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.420
I want you to start with the .remove method,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.510
which does exactly what you think it does.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.850
Check out the .remove documentation.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.040
For this quiz, you'll be removing the unordered list from Article 1.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.140
Just to be clear, i want this unordered list with these names removed.
