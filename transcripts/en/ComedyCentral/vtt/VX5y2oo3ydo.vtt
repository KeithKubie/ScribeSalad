WE GET STARTED, THERE WAS SOME
BIG NEWS LAST WEEK THAT SLIPPED

THROUGH MY NEWS CRACK, AND IT
CONCERNS SOMEONE I'VE ADMIRED

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:51.485
FOR YEARS, AND YET SURPRISINGLY
IS NOT ME.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.821
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID
LETTERMAN, WHO LAST THURSDAY

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:57.457
NIGHT ANNOUNCED HIS RETIREMENT.

00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:01.395
AND I AM GOING TO MISS THIS GOOD
MAN.

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:06.900
DAVE HAS BEEN ON THE AIR MY
ENTIRE ADULT LIFE, "LATE NIGHT"

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:08.402
DEBUTED MY FIRST YEAR IN
COLLEGE.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:12.606
I LEARNED MORE FROM WATCHING
DAVE THAN I DID FROM GOING TO MY

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:13.173
CLASSES.

00:01:13.207 --> 00:01:14.408
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:18.412
ESPECIALLY-- ESPECIALLY THE ONES
I DID NOT GO TO BECAUSE I HAD

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.814
STAYED UP UNTIL 1:30 WATCHING
DAVE.

00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:22.883
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
THIS MAN HAS INFLUENCED EVERY

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:26.553
HOST WHO CAME AFTER HIM, AND
EVEN A FEW WHO CAME BEFORE HIM.

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:27.487
HE'S THAT GOOD.

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:31.091
( LAUGHTER )
AND I GOTTA TELL YOU, I DO NOT

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:33.193

THAT CHAIR.
