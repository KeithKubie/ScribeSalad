00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.500
[ Applause ]

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lukas Pribyl: Good morning, thank
you very much for coming to see me,

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.910
I have to admit this is a
very strange occasion for me

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.680
because I'm used to
talking after the films

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.880
and now what's really puzzling
myself with how to talk

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.440
about my films without
revealing too much

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.050
and still making you
to come and see them.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.880
And today at four in the morning
I, very jet-lagged woke up,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.740
opened the internet, found out the
results of the election and sort

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.150 position:56%
of had this moment of enlightenment.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.630
And decided to completely change
my talk because I realized

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.480
that everything I do and
everything I've studied,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.290
the thing that I'm
interested in most is stories.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:00.520
And talking about films which is
a story in itself or four films

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.970
in this case which creates
and even larger picture,

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.590
and actually tell a bigger story.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.050
It's so hard that I decided that
I'm going to speak a little bit

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.350
about the story behind the
films, not the films themselves.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.410
And if you find the story
behind the films interesting,

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.970
hopefully you will go and
see the films themselves

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.530
and find the films
interesting as well.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:29.090
So, people often ask me
how I got to make films,

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.550
since as you've heard I'm
not a film maker by training

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.110
and my primary focus was
always politics and history.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.230 position:56%
And now I have to say it was the
stories really that brought me to it

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.980
because and why the Holocaust,

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.960
it goes back to my
childhood love of guns.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.640
Because I could never own a
gun, not even a plastic one

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.650
and I always wanted it because
all the kids on the playground

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.280 position:56%
of course ran around with these
plastic toys and my mom would never,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.220
ever allow me to have one.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.100
One day I managed to
borrow one from a friend,

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.930
whose name I still remember, David.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.020
And came home and I grew up
in communist Czechoslovakia

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.450
where you had all these
Russian movies

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.480
with people fighting the
Germans and the Germans running

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.630
around with machine
guns and shouting,

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.010
[foreign language], hands up.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.740
I know a little bit of German
because my mom sometimes spoke

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.020
to my grandfather in German when
they didn't want me to understand,

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.650
but I didn't know what that means,
I just saw it from the movies.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.740
So, I snuck up on my grandfather
and shouted [Foreign language]

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.600
and I'll never forget his face
because he turned completely white.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.060
And sort of froze and I dropped
the gun, I ran away crying

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.710
and since then I haven't touched
a gun, plastic one or real.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.000
And I realized there is something
in the past of my grandfather

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.560
that it's strange, it's
not completely normal.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.710 position:56%
And it was -- I realized it more and
more because I grew up surrounded

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.970
by these elderly ladies
without families

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.460
and they always swooned on me.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.020
Because whenever they saw a kid --
they came and I still remember sort

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.280
of from my perspective of a kid
was they are coming down on me

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.720
and pinching my cheeks and I
was totally terrified of them.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.110
So I even used to say whenever
I saw one of them approaching,

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.590
I would say [Foreign
language] which meant my name,

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.070
the city I was born in,
because that was one

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:57.000
of the questions they always
asked, like they wouldn't know.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.120
And my age, which was
eight, I don't know why

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.710
because I probably didn't
know any other number then.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.740
And but later on I realized that
these ladies do not have kids

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.550
of their own because they
all lost them during the war

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.850
and during the Holocaust.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.610
And as I was growing up I kind
of thought about the Holocaust

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.180
as something that everyone
goes through.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.540
Like you go to the army, you know
you go to the camp, it's normal

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.300
and then as I was in high school
I realized it's not actually

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.150
completely normal to go
to a concentration camp

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.340
and I started finding out more
about my family and the 60 people

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.380
who did not make it in my family.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.410
And my mom and mom and my aunt
they didn't really know much

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.280
because my grandmother
died just as I was born

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.000
and my grandfather never
really spoke about it.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.660
But I was getting more and
more interested in this history

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.680
and especially about the
history of my grandfather

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.600
because I really loved him and
he influenced me tremendously.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.180
And now I found out that
he was actually deported

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.340
in the very first deportation
of the second world war,

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.160
which was already in October 1939.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.020
I was you could call it Eichmann's
first deportation scheme,

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.470
when the Nazi's were really
learning how to deport people.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.050
The whole scheme didn't work
out, it was quite unsuccessful,

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:24.900
they deported a lot of people
from Moravia from Ostrava

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.340
where my family is
from, upper Silesia

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.570
but the camp itself couldn't
actually -- they were building it,

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.700
the deportees themselves
were building it.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.660
It couldn't accommodate
all the prisoners and a lot

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.740
of them were chased out
or escaped from the camp

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.690
to the Soviet occupied part
of Poland when the Germans

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:50.160
and Russians were --
Nazis' and Soviets.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.680
Divided up the territory
of Poland and ended up,

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.890
most of them were picked up by
the [foreign language] of the KGB.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:06.080
And I'll come back to the KGB
later but I searched their archives

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.890
and ended up in the Klooga that's
how some of these people survived.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.960
And my grandfather was one of 20
who actually went through Nisko

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:19.620
and subsequently was returned to
Ostrava which was very strange

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.270
in the history of concentration
camps

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.330
or camps, Nazi camps in general.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.950
And then he was subsequently
deported again.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:33.480
My grandfather died when I
was 10, but I was rummaging

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.950
through his stuff and I
actually found photographs

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.840
from Nisko, from the camp.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:43.380
And at that time I realized that
there is actually visual material

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:49.150
of almost everything, it just
needs a lot of luck or a lot

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.660
of persistence to find it.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:57.220 position:56%
And I started to be interested, not
only in the history of the Holocaust

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:04.470
but also in sort of the
visual part of the Holocaust,

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.290
about the visual record of it.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.640
Because watching a lot of
documentaries I realize

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.070
that they do not really
depict the life

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.800
of the people who went through it.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.480
In the most crucial periods, you
have a lot of footage that comes

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:28.610
from the period just
before the Holocaust

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.450
or just after the Holocaust.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.970
So you have footage from German
news fields with Nazi's marching

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:39.720
with torches and so on, but that's
not the perspective of the Jews

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:45.300
because you would have to be crazy
or suicidal to go to a Nazi march.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.390 position:56%
You closed your window and you tried
to pretend that you're not home.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:53.180
So this was not the
experience of the Jews,

00:10:53.180 --> 00:11:00.770
and then you have what you can
call the post-Holocaust footage.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:06.440
The liberation footage, but this
is again something that is more

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.040
from the perspective
of the liberators

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.240
and this is the aftermath,
this is the end.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.780
But what happened in between

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.350
and that's was really what
I was most interested in.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.220
And when I was researching this
coverage actually turned out to be

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:28.620
in my BA thesis, I realized that
there were so many other places

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.350
that nothing is known about them.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:36.000
There's nothing that's been written
about, there are no documentaries

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.390
about Krakow, Izbica,
Luta, all these places

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:45.560 position:56%
where Czech Jews were deported, so
I was mostly focusing on Czech Jewry

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.380
and Central European Jewry.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:54.250
And I couldn't really find anything
about that except for the names

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:59.180
of these camps or rather places
and why wasn't there anything

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:06.560
because most of these places ceased
existing already 1943, 44 at most,

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.540
they were liquidated
and they were liquidated

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.950
with all the people in them.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:15.540
So the survival rate was
really not even percentages,

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.830
it was less than that.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:26.440
We have come to associate Auschwitz
with all the evil because it was

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:32.930
such a huge death factory but these
much smaller places were often

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.790
equally deadly or even more so.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:42.570
And I realized that from about
40% of Czech Jews did not perish

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:49.510
in these big extermination centers
but rather in places in Latvia,

00:12:49.510 --> 00:13:00.410 position:56%
Estonia, Belarus, Eastern Poland and
so I decided that when I was looking

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:10.340 position:56%
for this material on Nisko I started
collecting all the other material I

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.970
could find on these other camps.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:20.270
Then eventually I actually
met some of the first people

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.040
who survived these places
and I realized that none

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.590 position:56%
of them had been interviewed before.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:32.590
And often their experience
was so different

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.550
from the survivor's stories that
we know the [inaudible] number

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.140
who have them on the arm
and the stripped uniforms.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.770
That they often even
were not part of the sort

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:48.230
of the survivor's circles, or
sort of fell through the cracks,

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:53.110
that were not interviewed by
these big interviewing schemes

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.620
like Spielberg's Foundation
and so on.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:02.160
So, I started approaching
them and I was thinking

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.150
that what would be the best
medium to capture the history

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.800
and what they were saying, what
they were telling me and realized

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.340
that the book was not
doing it justice.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.010
Because the people were
themselves so interested,

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:20.640 position:56%
as I told you at the very beginning,
I'm most interested in stories

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.630
and people have stories and people
tell stories in a certain way.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.430
And it's really important to see
how they are telling the stories

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.330
and the humor and the gestures
and the facial expressions

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.790
and that's the only way to
capture that is on film.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:40.120 position:56%
I can write a book but book is quite
difficult because you have to work

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.840
with the imagination of the reader.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:49.100
And the reader has to be an
active participant really.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:56.830
But film is the most approachable
media because you can screen it

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.080
to a hall full of high school kids.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:04.790
And if it has a story they might
at the very beginning you know,

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.290
not pay any attention but
they slowly get into it

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.550
and they watch it,
they won't read a book.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.720
So, I decided to make films,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:21.960 position:56%
not being a film maker it might have
been a bit of a audacious enterprise

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.440
but I know a lot of
people in the film world.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:32.580
And I think if you work hard, I
knew exactly what I wanted to do

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.980
and if you work with good people,

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:39.670
and I managed to assemble a really
good team, you can do films even

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:44.520
if you're not a film maker.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.100
And now when I was thinking how

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:54.560
to do the films I realized again
watching a lot of documentaries

00:15:54.560 --> 00:16:02.840
that most of them are told again,
from the perspective of the Nazi,

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.480
from the perspective
of the liberators

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.870
or from the perspective
of the narrator.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:11.090
But this is like a bird's eye
view, we are talking on behalf

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.290
of the witnesses and
I wanted the people

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.820
to tell their stories themselves.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:20.120
So, one of the first decisions
that I took making these films was

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.450
that there won't be any narration.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:27.140 position:56%
That I won't have a commentary, that
everything will be told basically

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.290
from bottom up and that
I'll take the interviews

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:36.550
and these very narrow perspectives
of the individual people

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:43.820
that I recorded and create
the picture from that.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:52.290 position:56%
Because even films that I really
admire like [inaudible] for example,

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:56.730 position:56%
there you don't have a narration but
you have commentary by historians

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.700
which is just a more sophisticated
version of a commentary.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:10.020
So, I wanted to have the Jewish
perspective and even though we went

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:14.410
and interviewed also the so-called
bystanders and quite a few Nazis

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:23.050
or Nazi affiliated troops from
the country's they occupied,

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:30.180
I did not want to include
that in the film.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:36.920
I wanted to be consistent
with that one perspective.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:42.190
And so in the end it worked
out that they were four films,

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:48.180
each of the films is focused on
one destination where transports

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:53.370
of Czech Jews left too and on
one particular group of people

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.480
and we can call it
a mode of survival.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.410
Of course it's not a
recipe for survival

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.710
because there is no such thing.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:03.790
You only know what works in a
particular set of conditions

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:07.480
after you survive if
you're lucky enough.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:13.780
But basically, they were
done in a chronological order

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:21.350
as the transports left and the
very transports left for Riga

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:31.770 position:56%
and for Latvia in early 1942 and the
film about Latvia is really a story

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:38.180
of families, how they tried to cope
in completely atrocious conditions

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.560
of the Riga Ghetto and keep
a semblance of normalcy.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.910
So children went to school but on
the way to school they actually had

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:50.240
to pass by the gallows where
there was always someone hanging

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.280
and things like that.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:56.240
The film about Belarus is
really a story of men only

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.140
because from the deportees

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:06.100 position:56%
to Belarus there was a single female
survivor, all the other people --

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.480
all the other survivors were men.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:13.870
And it's really a film about
resistance, both armed and unarmed,

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:21.420 position:56%
but mostly armed of people escaping
from the camps, from the death camps

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.650
and joining the partisans
and fighting.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:31.810
The third film in the series about
Estonia is the story of women only

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:36.910
because unlike in Belarus there
were absolutely no male survivors

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.730
from the deportees to Estonia.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:44.150
And there were only women and they
survived in a very strange way

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:48.300
because they sort of created
large living organisms.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.420
They bonded so much that they gave

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.250
up their individual
thinking you can say

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:57.150 position:56%
and now they did everything together

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:01.720
which greatly helped
them to survive.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.670
They really surrounded themselves
by this bubble and they refused

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:08.900
to believe what was
going on around them.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.720
They convinced themselves
that they'll survive,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.050
that they will come back and
that they'll meet their families.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.720
It was an illusion, their families
of course they were already dead,

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.800
but this is what kept them going.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:30.500 position:56%
And the last film about the 14,000
Czech deportees to the Lublin region

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.870
of that which 50 people survived
and they all survived thanks

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:38.720
to running away and basically
it's a film about identity.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.970
Because to escape you
have to assume a new name,

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.920
you have to assume a new story,

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.230
you have to believe your
story enough to be convincing.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:54.220
But at the same time when I
talked to the people who lived

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:58.710
under this assumed identity, they
told me you can't lose yourself

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.920
in this identity too much
because the moment you become

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.850
that person you stop being
careful and that's when you die.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:12.180
So this constant acting that you
act, that it stops being acting

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.940
but you still have to keep in
mind that you are someone else,

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.260
that you're pretending
to be someone.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:25.760
And so these four films
actually stand on their own,

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.860
can be screened independently,
have their own structure

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.200
but if you see all four

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.160
of them together there is an
overarching logic to them.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.250
So, I would never use a story
that I tell in one film,

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:40.740
won't be in another film.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:46.420
So, there are certain horizontal
themes, the love or shoes

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.360
for example, so in the film

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:55.080 position:56%
about Latvia you learn how shoes
can help you get food for your kids.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:05.970 position:56%
In Belarus how shoes make you an
unlikely and unwittingly a war hero,

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:14.120
in Estonia how you survived
selection thanks to shoes.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.990
And in Poland what
happens if you lose them.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:21.300
So, there are these stories
that connect the films

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.390
but they work on their own.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:34.650
So, in the films also I decided
that as I told you about the Nisko

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:38.120
and the story of the
pictures that I found.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:42.660
I decided that I'll illustrate
everything in the films by time

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:48.040
and place, precise pictures, that I
won't use any make believe footage,

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:53.680
no postwar footage unless
it's really of liberation.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:23:00.300
But I won't -- what really annoys
me in many documentaries is

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.960
that for example someone
is talking about Dachau.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.410
And you see footage
from Bergen-Belsen

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:09.450
and it's actually something that
really undermines the message

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:13.120
because first become
immune to these images

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.500
because they just recycle
it, recycles too much.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:22.670
And second also the deniers of
the Holocaust use this as a proof,

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.890
look you just have some footage and
keep recycling it and always claim

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.730
that this is some other place.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:37.340
So, I decided that I'll
really look for it everywhere,

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:42.310
which ended up being
over 30 countries.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:46.250
And we filmed in over 20
countries on five continents

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:53.070
and the material really comes
from all kinds of sources,

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.860
but I'll come back to that.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:59.250 position:56%
The most important thing at the very
beginning was to find the people

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:03.600
and as I mentioned 80 or 90%

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:09.600
of them had not been interviewed
before and kind of got lost.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:15.000
Because I had relatively very
precise deportation records,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.380
I had rather accurate
survival records

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.890
because people mostly came back.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:25.820 position:56%
When they came back from the war
they registered with the communities

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.700
and they wanted to
look for their families

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.480
and so on so they registered.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:37.050
Even though I did find some
people who were not on these lists

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:41.460
because having survived and
actually having witnessed the death

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.460
of their families they had
no reason to go home and left

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.530
for another country immediately.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:52.000
So, for example in Australia
we found a mother and daughter

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.660
who survived the Riga Ghetto,
the mother was the oldest person

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.370
that we interviewed, she was 103
years old when we talked to her.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.940
Because I looked for everyone
at that time until the age

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:11.590
of 100 and she was over that.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:19.110
So I started with these
lists of survivors,

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.770
then I went through marriage
records because a lot

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:25.130
of the women married
shortly after the war.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:32.620 position:56%
And also, not always I could find it
but name change records because one

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:37.770
of the funny things in Czech is
that you will have a lot of people

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.920
with German sounding names.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.370
They're mostly not
Jewish because a lot

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:47.480
of the Jewish families changed
their German sounding surnames

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.180
after the war to Czech
sounding ones.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:55.980
And then of course immigration
records which were really helpful

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.000
because not always they
told me where they went

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.840
but the more you know
the more you can judge

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.360
where these people could
have immigrated to.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:10.160 position:56%
Depending on the year, so in 1945
people who left were people who went

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:15.920
as far as possible, New Zealand,
Australia, those were people

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.230
who knew that there
was no one who survived

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:20.570
and they just went directly.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.740
And they wanted to be as far
away from Europe as possible,

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:30.340
1948 was another big wave
of immigration and most

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.810
of these people went to North
America and South America.

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:40.710
And surprisingly they did not go
to Israel and I was wondering why

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:44.900
and it was because the
survival rate from the places

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.200
that I was researching was

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.170
so low there were actually
individual survivors.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:56.110
Israel at least in its inception
was a very collective country

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:58.750
and people left there
collectively too.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.250
But these people did not have
any friends from the camps,

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:04.780
they had no relatives, they
were only by themselves.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.100
So unless they belonged to
some let's say Zionist movement

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.210 position:56%
or youth movement before the war and
they actually managed to reconnect

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:18.910
with someone they knew from
before the war, they did not leave

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.190
in this immigration wave.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:28.160 position:56%
And then there was a third wave in
1968 when the Soviets and the Soviet

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.700
in fact invaded Czechoslovakia

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:36.740
and surprisingly these
people went mostly to Germany

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:41.730 position:56%
but by then it was not so surprising
because they knew the language.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.540
They were middle aged so
they often had families

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.400
and if they had a son they knew
that the son would not have to go

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.900
to the army being Jewish
which in the 60's was quite an

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.040
important factor.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:05.340
Also they already had new
friends and new relationships

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:10.450
that they established after the
war in postwar Czechoslovakia

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:14.990 position:56%
and it's much easier to keep in
touch with someone in Czechoslovakia

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.470
across the iron curtain from
Germany than from Australia.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:25.330
So there were other factors they
got citizenship almost instantly,

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.430
they got some financial
help and so on.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:28.950
And Germany by then was a,

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:32.820
I'm talking about the
western part of it.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:37.450
So by then it actually did a
great deal of identification

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:42.150
so this helped me to
look for the people.

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:46.600
But still they were
often not registered,

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.400
the people I was specifically
looking

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:52.190
for were often not registered with
the Jewish communities and so on.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:57.120
So searching for them this
way turned rather futile,

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.270
what helped me most and my
mom still hates me for it

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:06.380
because we still have
hundreds of phone books

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.850
and now Jews are city people

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:13.140
so when they left they
usually settled in cities.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:18.200
And if you could at least tell
in which direction they went,

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.320
let's say some other American
city I collected phone books

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.340
from the big cities and if
the name was not too common,

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:32.470
I just started calling everyone
of that particular name.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:37.530
And you can always tell whether
you called the right person

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:44.260
by the reaction, because you
dial and you say excuse me,

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.940
I'm not sure I'm calling the right
person but were you in Salaspils?

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:50.080
And if they say what,
you got the wrong person,

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:58.360 position:56%
if they ask who are you, what do you
want you know you hit the jackpot.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:04.190
Now you couldn't do it, actually
now you have Mr. Goggle to help you

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:06.960
but it's much more difficult now

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.890
because no one has
land lines anymore.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.670
Everyone has a cell phone and the
cell phones are not registered

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.970
so actually I was working
in this perfect timing

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:19.150
because you already had
some phone books online,

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:23.740
you already could Google, not
pre-Google whatever that was.

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:30.510
Look up some stuff online but
you could still reach people

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:35.880
through the phones, so this search
would not be successful now.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.770
And once you find the person you
have to convince him or her to talk

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:45.580
to you which often took
me up to two years.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:51.830
As I mentioned, these people
were often very wounded

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:54.470
and sometimes they even
felt that they are shunned

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:58.960
by the other survivors
because our preconception is

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.330
that if something is
horrible we hear about it.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.300
So we know that Auschwitz
was absolutely atrocious,

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:12.920
so it must have been horrible but
have you heard about Luta, no,

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:17.440
means it couldn't have been that
bad there because if it were

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.780
so bad you would have
heard about it.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:26.420
But the fact is no
one survived Luta.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:31.840
So if you say I survived Salaspils,
the other survivors often say

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.920
so what, you know I was
in a much worse place,

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.590
you can't understand it.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:45.470
So these people didn't want to
talk and sometimes I had to go

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:49.690
for example, one of the most
crucial witnesses was living

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:51.870
in New York, a fantastic lady.

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:55.510
I went to see her in New York
three times and always as we set

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:58.700
up the camera, she just
said okay, I can't do it.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:07.890 position:56%
So you had to be quite persistent in
and why indeed did they talk to me?

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:12.290
It was because, I think it
was because first I got lucky

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:18.210
with the timing, because most of
these people were advanced in age

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:19.640
and they started to realize

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.840
that if they don't tell
it now, they never will.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.470
Second, the atmosphere
changed because thanks

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:29.270
to these big interviewing
schemes even though they chose not

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:33.080
to participate in them, other
people around them were talking

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.670
and that makes a huge difference.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:40.230 position:56%
And also their whole lives they
were looking ahead, they were trying

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:44.950
to raise families, work,
what so ever all these things

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:48.840
but now they had actually
time to reflect.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:53.480
So that was a helping factor
and then also I realized

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.520 position:56%
that when they were approached by --

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.690
and they told me themselves
when they were approached

00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:01.150
by interviewers, even in
the cases when they were,

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.670
the questions were wrong.

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:08.820
Because the places that they
survived were so specific,

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:13.780
that the general questions
for -- without diminishing it,

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:15.410
the general survivor

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.640
of the Holocaust would not
fit and they get upset.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:24.250
When I talked to them they
realized that I know sometimes more

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:26.520
than they do because
I knew the context,

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.520
I knew the background,
I knew the documents.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.780
And very often it happened that
they actually started talking to me

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.050
like I was there even though
I was 70 years younger

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:37.350
than they, sometimes.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:42.640
They started talking to me
like I was there with them

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.670
and they said do you remember when
they separated us and we went there

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:49.520
and there and of course
I couldn't remember it

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.050
but it I knew what happened.

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.740
And I knew the names
they were mentioning

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.740
which also greatly helped me

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:59.540
to cross check the
information they were giving me.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:06.560
There were some incredible
stories really,

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.950
I think the people really wanted
to tell but they were waiting

00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:19.430
for someone who would match
their idea of who to tell it.

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:21.810
It's very difficult to tell it
to someone from your family,

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:26.980
you'd almost never do that but if
you have someone who knows enough

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.750
that you can relate it to,

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:32.840
but at the same time doesn't
really show much emotion.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.040
I will come back to it, I had

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.890
to develop my own interviewing
technique then you can get

00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:41.190
this information.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:43.950
And sometimes you had
really incredible stories,

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:50.610
for example you flew half way
around the world to Denver,

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:53.660
I remember this interview very well

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:58.810
because when I was flying back I
landed and the Twin Towers went

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:01.400
down on the day I landed.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:06.610
But we had this interview set
up with this old gentleman

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:10.560
who was a survivor of a labor camp,
Treblinka, which was right next

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.480
to the death camp, very
few people know about it.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:16.980
And [inaudible] and me decided
not to tell it in the film

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.250
but it was an important interview.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:23.960
When we arrived to Denver we found
out that the man was in a comma.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:28.760 position:56%
So, I talked to the family and his
daughter said look, I'm okay with it

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.160
if you want go and talk to him,
I mean he's dying and I talked

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.390
to the physicians and they said
there's nothing to lose, sure.

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:41.680
We went and when I started
talking, whispering into his ear,

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:47.350
the man suddenly sat up with
you know, a pipe in his arms

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:51.600
and had the black Kriah on, he
wasn't religious before the war

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.080
but he turned religious
after [inaudible].

00:35:54.080 --> 00:36:01.070
And he talked to us on camera for
two hours then he said good-bye

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:06.100
to his family and died
12 hours later.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:10.060
And it was literally seeing
someone rise from the dead to tell

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:18.520
that story and it was quite
incredible experience.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:28.470
So, yes I was partly lucky but
you have to ask the right question

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.920
and I mentioned that I developed
my own interview technique

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.710
because I read a lot of books
about psychology and police manuals

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:41.110
about how to interrogate
people and things like that.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:51.440
But nothing would fit perfectly and
then I realized that I both trust

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.680
and mistrust human memory.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:59.620
It can be an excellent source but
you have to be very careful with it

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:06.230
and my most favorite answer
from anyone is, I don't know.

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:08.480
Because the moment people
tell you I don't know,

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.610
they're reliable witnesses.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:16.550
What happened -- I was also
lucky because I was interviewing

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:20.960
from places that were so unknown

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.830
that there were no
documentaries, no books.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:28.000
So there was no integration of
postwar knowledge into their memory

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.540
and for example I interviewed a
lot of people from Auschwitz also.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:41.920
And basically almost everyone
tells you, and there was Mengele

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.250
and he was sending people
to the left and to the right

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:49.090
and I came there and I was
sent there and my family.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:54.480
The memory itself is correct but
Mr. Mengele wasn't standing there

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.090
and saying hello, you know, good
morning, welcome to Auschwitz

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:01.490
and we go to the -- I'm
Mengele and go to the right.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:06.900
How did they know the name, it's
after, they remember the face

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.060
of the officer but there
were dozens of officers

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:12.760
who were carrying out
these selections.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:17.480
Mengele is just a symbol, so this
is a name that's floating around

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.830
and you attach it to the --

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:24.470
but it already makes the
interview somewhat slanted.

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.880
Because you know that they
talked to other survivors,

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.020
they read books, saw documentaries.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:32.080
The same thing that for example,
I survived a handful of people

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.930
who were in Auschwitz
almost for the duration

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:38.560
of its existence from Slovakia.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:42.010
And I asked them when you
arrived, where did you get off?

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:45.460
And to me there was this pause,
you could see them thinking

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.560
and they said, on the ramp.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:54.910
And there was no ramp in
1942, it was built in 1944.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:39:00.670
But because 99.9% who survived
Auschwitz say they got off

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:03.100
on the ramp which in
their case is correct.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.320
They doubted their own memories

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:09.190
because they thought all
these people cannot be wrong,

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:14.970 position:56%
so they started justifying their own
memory by saying, but I think I was

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:18.970
in at the back and we stood
a little bit behind the ramp

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.990
so we were actually
jumping into mud.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:27.350
But it was because
there was no ramp.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:35.970
So with the way my witnesses, I
was actually lucky in the sense

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:40.470
that they often answered I
don't know, I wasn't there.

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:45.440
And knowing even names for example
I memorized because I was looking

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.170
for every single person on the list

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.440
to find material, I
knew them by heart.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:57.100
So they often mentioned -- but
do you remember Peter and he was

00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:00.130
in love with this blond
girl, what was her name.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:03.360
And I know the name but I would
never provide this information,

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.010
so I offer five names and if they
pick the right one it confirms

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.620
another interview that I have.

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:19.940 position:56%
And so -- another thing that kind of
united the witnesses that I talked

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:25.980
to was that they're extremely
intelligent people but most

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:30.590
of them were not philosophers,
what I call philosophers.

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:35.450
People who are into
introspection and they tend

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:37.750
to relive their memories.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:44.020
Because if you revisit your
memory too often you change it,

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:48.100
I noticed it when I was talking
to high schools for example,

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:52.580
and sometimes you can already
-- you hear the questions,

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:56.850
the questions tend to repeat
themselves and I know what works

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:58.700
and doesn't work with the audience.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:04.400
So even when telling my own
story of making the film,

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.860
I think it changes I can do.

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:10.910
It's like with a joke
that you tell often,

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:13.510
the more often you tell
it the better you tell it

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.570
but it's very different,
a hundred time

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:18.620
than the first time you tell it.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:23.320
And so I admire people
for example who can go --

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:27.040
survivors who can go to
schools and tell their stories

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.300
but I would never use them
in the film because I know

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:34.420
that the story is no longer
the story that I want to hear.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:38.460
I wanted to, it's like
with a diamond you know

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:42.390
if you find it a rough diamond
it looks like any other stone,

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:45.750
you have to polish it
and then it takes shape.

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:49.780
But it's a very different stone,

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:56.310
so for example you can always tell
watching a documentary whether

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.690
someone is talking for
the first time or not.

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:06.270
But lots of documentaries
actually I find very realistic

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:10.570
but half the people in the film,
you see how they are tearing up.

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:15.020
People who speak for the first
time they never cry because it's

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:20.190 position:56%
so difficult to actually if you lock
something inside yourself for 50,

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:25.880 position:56%
60, 70 years to tell it after such
a long time, it takes so much energy

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:32.110
and concentration that you don't
actually have energy left to cry.

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:35.570
It's only the second, third
time that you are telling it

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:38.530
that you gain the distance
from your own story

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:41.130
and then you can start actually
feeling sorry about yourself

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:42.430
and that's when you start crying.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:48.340
It works, I mentioned the police
manuals, it actually works,

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:53.940
if the trauma is really fresh
then you have different reactions,

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:59.090
you have tears or not but
with the distance you know

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:03.330
in time you usually don't
get that on the very first --

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:13.070
when you're telling the
story for the first time.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:16.150
Regarding the interviewing
technique also I realized

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:22.350
that when you are convincing
people to talk and sometimes one

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:24.440
of the things that I
used was with people

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.910
who did not want to talk to me.

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:30.570
I knew that deep down
they really wanted to talk

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:33.430
but how to convince them.

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:37.680
So I introduced everyone
around them, their friends,

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.720
completely unrelated topic
about the Holocaust sometimes

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.510
and then they eventually they
come back to you and say, okay,

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:48.230
so why is everyone so
interesting and I'm not?

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:52.120
And I said well two years ago
I asked you for an interview

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.270
and about 50 times
in the meantime, so.

00:43:55.270 --> 00:44:04.120 position:56%
But then they start talking and when
you finally agree to an interview,

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:08.840
you start to prepare -- like today
I woke up at four in the morning

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.140
and decided I'm going
to talk to somebody

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:12.260
about something completely else,
but that's a different story.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:17.650
But before that I was
actually preparing a talk,

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:20.020
thinking of what I'm
going to tell you

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:24.560
and usually you structure
the story chronologically.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.020
You decide what you're going to
include and what you're going

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:32.630
to leave out, but it's your call
what you consider interesting

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:34.350
which is usually the things

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:37.540
that they considered interesting,
but not so interesting.

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:40.820
And the things that they leave out
are the most interesting to you.

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:48.330
So, you have to get those
other things but in a way

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:50.620
that they don't realize
that you're doing it.

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.470
Because very often these
things are the most traumatic

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:57.510
or they are things when they are
not completely sure that they acted

00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:04.120
in a moral way or that
the decision was right.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:08.410
Or very often there's some kind
of sexual abuse, things like that

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:10.580
that they keep for themselves.

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:14.720
So, I let them start telling
the story the way they want

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.070
and they eventually they
get used to the light.

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:21.900
They forget about the
camera in the corner

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.910
and they get more comfortable
with you.

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:30.600
Then I start asking very, very
specific targeted questions

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.970
that completely break
down the narrative

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:36.630
and make a complete mess of it.

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:41.310
Because one of the basic things
is that whatever question you ask,

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:44.090
you get an answer of equal length.

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:49.030
So, if you ask something
general you get an answer

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:51.430
that lasts let's say three minutes.

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:55.960
If you ask a very, very specific
question you get also three minutes

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.580
but the three minutes you
have so much more detail

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.530
in those three minutes of course.

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:08.270
And so, by ways of
association and it looks

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:15.630
like these questions are completely
chaotic but I know what I'm doing

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:19.200
and then I say, oh sorry I got
completely confused now can you

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.020
please tell me again.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.580
I totally don't understand
what was happening

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:27.600 position:56%
and they start telling you the
story again but with all the details

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.280
that they skipped at
the very beginning.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:34.110
And it's also good for editing
because you have the story both

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:41.220
in a condensed version, a longer
version and so you can work

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:44.630
with that in terms of film.

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:47.240
You do look like an idiot
asking these questions

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.670
but you know that's the
price you have to pay for it.

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:57.130 position:56%
And you have to stay neutral because
people are really like a mirror,

00:46:57.130 --> 00:47:01.420 position:56%
you can very often in documentaries,

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:04.570
you can focus on the
people who are talking.

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:07.220
You can see what the
facial expression

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:11.210
of the interviewer was,
because they reflect it.

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:17.980
And so, even though they're telling
something absolutely horrible,

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:25.140
you cannot really show horror
and that also helps you to get

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:30.530
across the individual moments
when they start to break down.

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:34.370
Because you say look we have a job
to do, you agreed to this interview

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:36.780
so please let's get on with it.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:43.610
And they start talking, the moment
you sympathize with them too much,

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:48.280
of course you sympathize, of course
it hurts you and them, everyone

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.010
but you can't show it too much.

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:59.120 position:56%
Because it might destroy the
interview and now my interviews tend

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:02.540
to be very, very long
sometimes 12 hours.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:06.010
And that's when you really
go through these very,

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:09.110
very specific questions
because of course I know

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:11.740
that I'm not going to
use them in the film.

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:17.330 position:56%
And we filmed over 400 hours, I'm
not talking about some extra footage

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:21.480
that places that were disappearing
at that time or interviews

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.010
with bystanders and
some of the Nazis.

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:29.770
We might come back to that if we
have time, which I should check,

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:32.020
okay we don't have much time.

00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:35.790
So I'll show you also some clips,
I decided not to use any clips

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:42.630
from the film themselves because
the films are each 90 minutes long.

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:48.770
And they're linear stories, so
they're sentenced by one person

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:51.180
and another sentence
by another person

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.660
and without the context you
don't really get the picture.

00:48:54.660 --> 00:49:01.270
But I'll show you some for
example I mentioned the Salaspils,

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:08.530
there's one man he's
talking in English also.

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:15.100
And I'll show you some of
the material that I found

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:18.530
because as I said I believe there
is a visual record of everything,

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:23.890
so this is from a camp
called Salaspils in Latvia.

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:32.290 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And in the morning when you woke
up the person on your right was dead

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:36.080
and the person on your
left was dying

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:41.930
and the person behind you didn't
get up and you were very surprised

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:44.130
that you are still around.

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:49.190
That you are still
functioning relatively normally,

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:50.620
relatively normally.

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:57.910
Relative to the condition in which
you got up and went down and lined

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:04.410 position:56%
up on the [inaudible] and stood in
the subzero temperatures for an hour

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:07.670
or so before you went to work.

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:14.150 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lukas Pribyl: So, the photographs
that you saw in the film,

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:16.800
they are really of
Salaspils in 1942,

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.990
I could even identify certain
people on some of the pictures.

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:26.450 position:56%
And the material, I told you already
how I was looking for people,

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:31.260
I was looking the same way
for photographs or footage.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:36.260
Very often I found it, it
depends on the place but let's say

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:44.580 position:56%
in Poland I went around and I traded
bottles of vodka for photographs.

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:46.710
I felt a little bit
like a Santa Clause

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:49.900
because they already knew
whenever I drove into the village

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:52.220
and my trunk was full of alcohol.

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:55.210
And you got drunk with the men

00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:57.920
and suddenly they started
bringing you these photographs.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:04.740
Because the camps in the Lublin
region they usually did not have a

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:11.820 position:56%
permanent Nazi unit stationed there,

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:16.030
the Nazi officers actually
administered several camps

00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:20.260
and the camps were
themselves run by Ukraine.

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:25.060
They called them [inaudible] blacks
because of their black uniforms.

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:29.580
And of course these soldiers,
they had access to the warehouses

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:35.160
where the property
stolen from the Jews was.

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:39.910
And they went out with the Polish
village girls and the transports

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:42.980
from Czech, they were
rich transports,

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:46.700
stuff they never saw
in eastern Poland.

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:54.050
So, they were, the girls were --
the perfumes and all that stuff

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:59.940
and even though it was forbidden
the Jews always brought a camera.

00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:01.900
One of them, it was
in the warehouse,

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:05.330
the Ukrainians didn't know
how to operate cameras

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:08.120
but they wanted a picture
with their girlfriends.

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:14.570 position:56%
So, they asked the Jew to take a
picture and you have the [inaudible]

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:17.910
with his girlfriend and the entire
village standing behind them

00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:19.810
because they also wanted
in the picture.

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:24.440
Because most of the places were so
poor that you had pictures taken

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:31.120
at your baptism, marriage and
then strange enough custom

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:34.250
of your dead body in a coffin.

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:35.550
But those were the only pictures

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:38.400
that you would accumulate
throughout your life,

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.700
so they all wanted pictures.

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.270
And the Jews who knew how to
take a camera took pictures

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:45.800
of the villagers and
traded them, they loved them

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.650
and traded them for food.

00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:53.480
So, very often in the houses
there you find the same picture

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.540
because they made multiple copies

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:59.060
and they gave them
to people for food.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:02.600
But you have to go through
the houses and funny enough

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:09.200
when you get drunk with the
men they, they are now married

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.940
to these girlfriends
of these Ukrainians.

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.120
And they never forget
because even during

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.630
and after the war there was
a sort of a civil war going

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:19.590
on between the e and the
Ukrainians and they never forgot

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:24.950
and forgave their wives for
going out with a Ukrainian.

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:30.900
So -- and the women always keep
pictures, men don't but women do

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:36.510
and soldiers keep pictures
because those are the most sort

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:40.120
of the best times of their lives.

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:44.200 position:56%
So, they always know where the women
have the pictures, they get drunk,

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.850
they start rummaging
through a closet,

00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:49.040
take out the shoe box
with the photos.

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:50.350
And they tell you this is my wife,

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:52.650
this is the Ukrainian,
they remember his name.

00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:56.030
And they can name even some
of the Jews on the pictures

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:59.160
and that's how you for
example find pictures.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:03.600
Another one was Jews were
used for slave labor,

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:07.430
mostly digging [Foreign
language] the drainage canals,

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:10.180
it's a very swampy region.

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.280
But it's technically
quite a difficult task,

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:16.880
so you had to had Poles
from the cities,

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:21.270
engineers come and
design these works.

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:27.940 position:56%
And they had cameras, so they took
pictures of themselves with the Jews

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:30.930
from western and central Europe.

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:33.400
Because they had much more
in common with these people

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:38.230
than with the poor villagers
-- with the Poles themselves.

00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:40.820
But the Poles from the
village remembered the names

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.200
of these engineers so
they give me the name.

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:47.330
I go and I look up all the
people of that name in Poland,

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:53.460 position:56%
then I find the engineer, I find the
family usually, they have an album.

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:57.060 position:56%
I take the album, I go back to the
village and they identify the people

00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:00.430
and that's how you find pictures.

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:02.940
The same thing works with
Nazis, Germans are people

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:08.260
who do not move much, so even
when there were postwar trials

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:11.720
and investigations of Nazis
I find an old address.

00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:15.020
And I go to the town
and I find the families

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:19.290
and they always have something
because soldiers never give

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:24.730
up their pictures even though
often it's basically incriminating

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:29.170
evidence against them,
they mostly keep it.

00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:32.280
So there are many, many
other techniques like this,

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:37.090
I don't know if I have -- how
much time do we have [inaudible].

00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:44.010
Okay, I'll play some more
-- I'll play this one.

00:55:45.510 --> 00:57:48.940
[Foreign language]

00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.190
&gt;&gt; Lukas Pribyl: Yeah,
so that's for the example

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:54.340
that people don't actually
cry, that they're on the brink

00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:56.150
but if they're telling
it for the first time

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:58.680
like this lady in Switzerland.

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:05.260
They don't go over and that's
the moment how you can also judge

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:09.840
whether they're actually
talking for the first time.

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:14.660
Basically, these clips are clips of
interviews with some illustrations,

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:17.070
they're not completely
part of the films

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:20.020
or sometimes I use
a sentence or two.

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:23.880
But I think they illustrate
what I'm saying better

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:29.280 position:56%
than the films themselves because in
the film there's literally a story

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:33.100
behind every photograph,
every story I mentioned.

00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:39.890
KGB for example, I smuggled stuff
from the KGB archives in Belarus,

00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:42.620
the KGB is still called the KGB.

00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:47.630
And they wouldn't let me in, I
wrote them a letter many times,

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:50.620
never received an answer
until I went there personally

00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:53.250
when I finally got
my visas to Belarus

00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:56.090
and they wouldn't let
me into the archives.

00:58:56.090 --> 00:59:01.710 position:56%
So I decided that the only way is to
contact the director but the names

00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:06.610
of directors, I don't know how it
is here but FBI or CIA or whatever.

00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:09.710
But they're not exactly
listed in phone books.

00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:17.520 position:56%
So there was still not too many cell
phones around so I bought a bunch

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:20.550
of calling cards, I went
into a phone booth right

00:59:20.550 --> 00:59:22.980
in front of the KGB building.

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:26.120
And I just -- you can call the
organization, it's an institution

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:29.500
so I called the KGB and I
spoke partly in English,

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:32.150
partly in Russian, depending
who I was talking to.

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:35.670
And I was telling them, look
I need to talk to the director

00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:37.790
and they said what
do you want from him.

00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:40.610
I said well it's none of your
business if I wanted to talk

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:43.190
to you I would talk to you
but I want to talk to him.

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:45.870
So, and because it's an
hierarchical organization

00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:50.660
and they're not really sure
that I'm a kid in front

00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:55.200 position:56%
of the building or it's CIA calling.

00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:59.170
So, they always pass
you on to a superior.

00:59:59.170 --> 01:00:04.160
And eventually I got all the way
up to the secretary of the director

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.850
and she said what do you want and I
said I want to talk to the director

01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:11.110
and what do you want from
him and I said I'm not going

01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:12.820
to tell you but I'll tell him.

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:17.010
So, she said wait a moment, he
picked up the phone and he said

01:00:17.010 --> 01:00:19.550
so how did you get my number?

01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:23.210
So I told him and he
started laughing

01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:26.240
and he said you know what I'll give
my number now and when you come

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:31.420
to Belarus you can call me and
I'll let you in the archives.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:36.700
And I said no need I'm in -- if
you look out of the window I'm

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.230
in that phone booth
so I'll be right over.

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:44.550
So, he really, he had a
lot of really funny stories

01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:48.080
about you know KGB
kind of imaginative,

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.510
this invincible organization

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:53.300
and they're actually
not very professional.

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.620
I asked him about it
because I was followed,

01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:00.800
anyone with a camera is followed
in Belarus and I had some tricks

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.730
and I knew they went
through my stuff.

01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:08.300
And I said look are they so
professional that they want me

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.670
to know that I'm being followed.

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:12.440
Or so unprofessional
that they don't realize

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.930 position:56%
that I know that I'm being followed?

01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:16.930
And he looked at me and said,
you know that I don't know.

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:22.400
But anyway he had a
lot of stories but --

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:28.090
so, he actually allowed
me to go into the archives

01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:32.280
and I got some kind of a minder
and we went, they opened.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:37.040
There were these boxes and
boxes, they took out a few

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:40.890
and there were lots of
other interesting boxes.

01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:45.450
Which they did not take out
and there was this little room,

01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:51.190
it's a building, it looks scary,
it was built by German POWs

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:53.650
in Stalinist style in the 50's.

01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:57.700
And very high ceilings
and very narrow corridors.

01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.390
I was looking through the
material and there was the guy

01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:05.760
who was supposed to keep an eye on
me, he was getting bored obviously

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.740
and he said do you mind
if I go for a cigarette.

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:13.550
I'm like smoke a whole pack, any --
so he went out, smoked a cigarette

01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:16.240
and he said can I go for
lunch, I'm really hungry.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.500
I said look I have so much
material here, of course go.

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:25.620
So, he left and the moment
he left I started running

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:30.210 position:56%
around the building kind of a
little afraid I'm going to get lost.

01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:34.850
And who has keys for
everything, janitors,

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:41.490
exactly so I found a cleaning lady
and it cost me a couple of dollars

01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:43.620
but I did manage to get the keys.

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:49.370 position:56%
Because even in the super-secret
archive you have to clean the floor.

01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:53.180
So, I went actually, I
needed to confirm some things

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:58.080
that Czech partisans told me
and German partisans told me.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.650
So I found the boxes,
I was a little sweaty

01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:05.240 position:56%
because if they caught me I probably
would have spent a little more time

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.800
in Belarus than I would have liked.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:12.840
But sometimes you have to get
material in this way as well.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:20.430
And actually on the other -- I'll
play another, this is from a film

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:22.880
that we are not screening,
here, if you are interested

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.890
in actually seeing the films, two
of them are screening tomorrow.

01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:31.230
This is from the first
film about Latvia.

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:38.650
&gt;&gt; It was indescribable, You
didn't save anything for later

01:03:38.650 --> 01:03:42.410
and you ate it because you
didn't know what happened to you,

01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:46.510
somebody might steal it out of
your pocket, which also happened.

01:03:46.510 --> 01:04:01.890
[Foreign language]

01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:04.270
If you live under cruel
circumstances,

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:07.850
you become cruel yourself
[foreign language].

01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:12.780
&gt;&gt; Lukas Pribyl: Yeah, for example
these are stories that you have

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.990
to really establish a
relationship with this person

01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:19.090
because sometimes they admitted
to killing people and so on,

01:04:19.090 --> 01:04:22.780
no one tells you that after
talking to you for 20 minutes.

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:29.910
So, even I -- sometimes after
I interview these people,

01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:36.140
then once it's like a
well, once you dig the well

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:41.310
and you connect the --
people start talking.

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:46.150 position:56%
So, I've seen a lot of interviews of
the same people, I was the first one

01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:50.050
to talk to them, they are very
different in the interviews with me

01:04:50.050 --> 01:04:55.550
because even then they left out the
things of this nature for example.

01:04:55.550 --> 01:05:01.750
I just a week ago talked to
the daughter of one of the men

01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:04.410
who was actually a
doctor in the camp.

01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:08.740
And they liquidated
some of the bad CAPOs

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:12.930
because whenever they were sick
he was giving them injections not

01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:15.110 position:56%
to help them but to get rid of them.

01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:18.350
So these were some of the examples,

01:05:18.350 --> 01:05:21.520
I'll take some questions
now I guess.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.720
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: We have
time for a few questions

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:28.420
and then later informally
we can maybe [inaudible].

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:33.570
&gt;&gt; There's a showing
tomorrow [inaudible].

01:05:33.570 --> 01:05:39.890
&gt;&gt; Lukas Pribyl: The question was
about the screenings tomorrow,

01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:44.780
there are two screenings,
one is at 2:00

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:52.240
at the United States Holocaust
Museum and the other one is

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:56.080
at Congregation Beth
El in the evening.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:02.310
If you take a leaflet there and
go to our web page the exact time

01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:05.820
and place is on the
front in the news,

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:08.240 position:56%
so just go to forgottentransport.com

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:12.510
and you can find the
information about the screenings.

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:21.260
[inaudible]

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:30.180
&gt;&gt; And I'm wondering do you
have footage in your film

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:32.030
about Poland, do you
have [inaudible].

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:36.080
&gt;&gt; Lukas Pribyl: Did you all hear
the question or should I repeat it?

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.730
Yeah, the lady's parents
were from Czech

01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:44.680
and she's asking whether I
have some footage from Lodz.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:50.390
Actually I did not, there was
several deportation schemes really

01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:56.480
and deportation directions and I
decided to not to talk about Lodz

01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:03.240
because Lodz was less known
than Auschwitz but more known

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:06.870
than all these places
that I was interested in.

01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:12.770
But I can tell you there are films
by Pawel Stengel, a film maker

01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:18.020
and he used some footage, or all
the footage that's known from Lodz

01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:21.020
and he also interviewed
quite a few people

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:23.590
that were deported
to the Lodz Ghetto.

01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:28.140
That why I decided not
to do it because I felt

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:33.650
that this area has been
covered more than others.

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:44.860
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: We have time
for one more question, yes.

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.890
&gt;&gt; I just want to [inaudible].

01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:49.690
&gt;&gt; Lukas Pribyl: Oh,
thank you very much.

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:58.470
[inaudible]

01:07:58.470 --> 01:08:00.510
Oh, thank you very much.

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:06.260
[ Applause ]

01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:10.410
Part of it is actually now
I consider myself lucky

01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:14.770
that I wasn't a film maker
when I started doing this

01:08:14.770 --> 01:08:20.290 position:56%
because I couldn't get the grant
because whenever I told anyone look,

01:08:20.290 --> 01:08:24.660
I want to make four feature length
documentaries about the Holocaust,

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:27.340
I want to do it in a
little different way.

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.300
And they asked me so what
film school did you go

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:30.770
to and I said none.

01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:34.820
And you know have you ever
held a camera and I said no.

01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:41.390
So, they showed me the door very
quickly, so I had lots of time

01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:44.140
because I did not have deadlines.

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:47.920 position:56%
So the films actually took ten years
to make and as I said they took me

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:54.340 position:56%
to five continents and 20 countries.

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:59.620
And we got stuff from Nazi
families in Argentina and Egypt

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:04.290
and we've been to Eastern Europe,
Australia, everywhere with it.

01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:09.070
But I could afford to wait
and that's very important

01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:12.560
if you're doing this because for
example sometimes you even got a

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.240
response two years later.

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:17.200
When I was looking for --

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:22.690
I would never use a story unless
I could document it with a time

01:09:22.690 --> 01:09:25.100
and place precise picture
or footage.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:32.400 position:56%
So I have one story that's really
incredible but maybe I would save it

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:37.570 position:56%
for -- because it relates to Estonia
and you need to see the film.

01:09:37.570 --> 01:09:41.710
It's a Romeo and Juliet story
in the film, it's incredible,

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:46.050
I was looking for the one picture
of the girl for four years.

01:09:46.050 --> 01:09:50.360
I talked to several hundred
people in the process.

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:54.260
But you're looking for a picture
of a particular Nazi for example

01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:57.580
and you only know the name so
I write to everyone in Germany

01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:00.620
of that name and then I wait.

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:04.470
And two years later you get
the picture in an envelope,

01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:08.080
no return address, but in the
meantime I found the picture

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:11.300
of the Nazi so I can
compare it, because also even

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:12.760
if it get the picture
I wouldn't use it

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.710
without actually making sure
that this is the person.

01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:18.640
Now things are so much easier,

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:23.400
I was at the very beginning I
befriended people in the police

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.600
to help me with facial
recognition software now.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.170
You can see this and
it's so easy now.

01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:33.760
But what you cannot do now
is you can identify people,

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.550
you can identify pictures
if you know

01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:38.350
but you cannot connect
them to stories.

01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:42.860
I was very, very lucky that
I could find this material

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.250
and still match it with the words.

01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:50.390
Now when you have material you
have the words, can connect it.

01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:57.270
But yeah, so I had the
advantage of time and patience

01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:59.590
because that was the
only way to do it.

01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:06.340
And I knew that there
must be a picture,

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:08.600
you just had to wait for it.

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.750
And if you have a deadline

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:14.970
from TV that's sponsoring the
film then you can't do it.

01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:19.120
So I always try to turn
disadvantages into advantages.

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.920
Thank you

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:25.470

01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:27.080
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: I

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:32.380
