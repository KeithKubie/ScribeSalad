00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:17.740 align:start position:0%
them yeah I guess that is a question I
 

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.799 align:start position:0%
them yeah I guess that is a question I
get<00:27:18.400><c> and</c><00:27:18.790><c> it</c><00:27:18.910><c> is</c><00:27:18.940><c> an</c><00:27:19.179><c> intuition</c><00:27:19.660><c> that</c><00:27:19.690><c> people</c>

00:27:19.799 --> 00:27:19.809 align:start position:0%
get and it is an intuition that people
 

00:27:19.809 --> 00:27:22.470 align:start position:0%
get and it is an intuition that people
have<00:27:20.200><c> and</c><00:27:20.770><c> it's</c><00:27:20.950><c> it's</c><00:27:21.550><c> true</c><00:27:21.790><c> utilities</c><00:27:22.330><c> don't</c>

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.340 align:start position:0%

they<00:30:09.090><c> take</c><00:30:09.270><c> a</c><00:30:09.299><c> long</c><00:30:09.510><c> time</c><00:30:09.570><c> and</c><00:30:10.370><c> the</c><00:30:11.370><c> 15</c><00:30:11.700><c> months</c>

00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
