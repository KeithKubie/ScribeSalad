00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.140
In the last video, we started
with the 2 by 2 matrix A is

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.440
equal to 1, 2, 4, 3.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:21.925
And we used the fact that lambda
is an eigenvalue of A,

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:27.170
if and only if, the determinate
of lambda times

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.560
the identity matrix-- in this
case it's a 2 by 2 identity

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.360
matrix-- minus A
is equal to 0.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.380
This gave us a characteristic
polynomial and we solved for

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.050
that and we said, well, the
eigenvalues for A are lambda

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.090
is equal to 5 and lambda
is equal to negative 1.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.420
That's what we saw in
the last video.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.160
We said that if you were trying
to solve A times some

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.160
eigenvector is equal to lambda
times that eigenvector, the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.790
two lambdas, which this equation
can be solved for,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.920
are the lambdas 5 and minus 1.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.725
Assuming nonzero eigenvectors.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.300
So we have our eigenvalues,
but I don't even call that

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.110
half the battle.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.510
What we really want is our
eigenvectors and our

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.850
eigenvalues.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.000
So let's see if we
can do that.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.580
So if we manipulate this
equation a little bit and

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.320
we've manipulate it in the past.
Actually, we've even

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.320
come up with this statement
over here.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.650
We can rewrite this over here
as the 0 vector is equal to

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.180
lambda times my eigenvector
minus A times my eigenvector.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.780
I just subtracted Av
from both sides.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.860
We know lambda times some
eigenvector is the same thing

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.330
as lambda times the identity
matrix times that eigenvector.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.040
So all I'm doing is rewriting
this like that.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.470
You multiply the identity matrix
times an eigenvector or

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.230
times any vector, you're just
going to get that vector.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.950
So these two things
are equivalent.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.200
Minus Av.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.440
That's still going to be
able to the 0 vector.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.470
So far all I've done is
manipulated this thing.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.080
This is really how we got
to that thing up there.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.470
You factor out the v so to speak
because we know that

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.710
matrix vector products exhibit
the distributive property.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:28.450
And we get lambda times the
identity matrix minus A times

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.020
my eigenvector have got
to be equal to 0.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:43.960
Or another way to say it is, for
any lambda eigenvalue, and

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:51.030
let me write it for any
eigenvalue lambda, the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.610
eigenvectors that correspond
to that lambda, we can call

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.220
that the eigenspace
for a lambda.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.740
So that's a new word,
eigenspace.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.430
Eigenspace just means all
of the eigenvectors that

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.950
correspond to some eigenvalue.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.040
The eigenspace for some
particular eigenvalue is going

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.390
to be equal to the set
of vectors that

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.810
satisfy this equation.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.790
Well, the set of vectors that
satisfy this equation is just

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.450
the null space of that
right there.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.120
So it's equal to the
null space of this

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.050
matrix right there.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.090
The null space of lambda times
the identity matrix.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.940
And by an identity
matrix minus A.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.040
And so everything I've done
here, this is true-- this is

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.840
the general case.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.450
But now we can apply
this notion to this

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.690
matrix A right here.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.840
So we know that 5 is
an eigenvalue.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.600
Let's say for lambda is equal
to 5, the eigenspace that

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.140
corresponds to 5 is equal
to the null space of?

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.510
Well, what is 5 times
the identity matrix?

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.980
It's going to be the 2
by 2 identity matrix.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:15.730
5 times the identity matrix is
just 5, 0, 0, 5 minus A.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.959
That's just 1, 2, 4, 3.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:27.600
So that is equal to the null
space of the matrix.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.870
5 minus 1 is 4.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.640
0 minus 2 is minus 2.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.240
0 minus 4 is minus 4.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.090
And then, 5 minus 3 is 2.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.130
So the null space of this matrix
right here-- and this

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.560
matrix is just an actual
numerical representation of

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.150
this matrix right here.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.760
The null space of this matrix
is the set of all of the

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.030
vectors that satisfy this or all
of the eigenvectors that

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.950
correspond to this eigenvalue.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.100
Or, the eigenspace that
corresponds to

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.590
the eigenvalue 5.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.540
These are all equivalent
statements.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.010
So we just need to figure out
the null space of this guy is

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.200
all of the vectors that satisfy
the equation 4 minus

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.790
2, minus 4, 2 times some
eigenvector is

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.730
equal to the 0 vector.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.170
And the null space of a matrix
is equal to the null space of

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.290
the reduced row echelon
form of a matrix.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.260
So what's the reduced row
echelon form of this guy?

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.440
Well, I guess a good starting
point-- let me keep my first

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.570
row the same, 4 minus 2.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.350
And let me replace my second
row with my second row

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.590
plus my first row.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.040
So minus 4 plus 4 is 0.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.910
2 plus minus 2 is 0.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.850
Now, let me divide my
first row by 4 and I

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.890
get 1, minus 1/2.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.810
And then I get 0, 0.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.340
So what's the null
space of this?

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.280
This corresponds to v.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.550
This times v1, v2-- that's just
another way of writing my

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.100
eigenvector v-- has got to
be equal to the 0 vector.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.560
Or another way to say it is that
my first entry v1, which

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.810
corresponds to this pivot
column, plus or minus 1/2

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.970
times my second entry has
got to be equal to

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.730
that 0 right there.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:24.530
Or, v1 is equal to 1/2 v2.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.120
And so if I wanted to write all
of the eigenvectors that

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.320
satisfy this, I could
write it this way.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:35.780
My eigenspace that corresponds
to lambda equals 5.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.360
That corresponds to the
eigenvalue 5 is equal to the

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:48.250
set of all of the vectors, v1,
v2, that are equal to some

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.310
scaling factor.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.360
Let's say it's equal
to t times what?

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.170
If we say that v2 is equal to t,
so v2 is going to be equal

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.140
to t times 1.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.550
And then, v1 is going to be
equal to 1/2 times v2

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.850
or 1/2 times t.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.640
Just like that.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.150
For any t is a member
of the real numbers.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.850
If we wanted to, we could
scale this up.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.260
We could say any real
number times 1, 2.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.610
That would also be the span.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.500
Let me do that actually.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.060
It'll make it a little
bit cleaner.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.070
Actually, I don't
have to do that.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:32.820
So we could write that the
eigenspace for the eigenvalue

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:42.060
5 is equal to the span of
the vector 1/2 and 1.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.030
So it's a line in R2.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.190
Those are all of the
eigenvectors that satisfy--

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.700
that work for the equation
where the

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.960
eigenvalue is equal to 5.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.620
Now what about when
the eigenvalue is

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.080
equal to minus 1?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.750
So let's do that case.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:07.620
When lambda is equal to minus
1, then we have-- it's going

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.660
to be the null space.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.370
So the eigenspace for lambda is
equal to minus 1 is going

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:18.760
to be the null space of lambda
times our identity matrix,

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.000
which is going to be minus
1 and 0, 0, minus 1.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.440
It's going to be minus 1 times
1, 0, 0, 1, which is just

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.570
minus 1 there.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.800
Minus A.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.460
So minus 1, 2, 4, 3.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.620
And this is equal to the null
space of-- minus 1,

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.760
minus 1 is minus 2.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.230
0 minus 2 is minus 2.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:49.160
0 minus 4 is minus 4 and minus
1 minus 3 is minus 4.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.270
And that's going to be equal
to the null space of the

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.320
reduced row echelon
form of that guy.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.550
So we can perform some row
operations right here.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.730
Let me just put it in reduced
row echelon form.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:06.430
So if I replace my second row
plus 2 times my first row.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.070
So I'll keep the first
row the same.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.470
Minus 2, minus 2.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.550
And then my second row, I'll
replace it with two times--

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.740
I'll replace it with it plus
2 times the first. Or even

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.560
better, I'm going to replace it
with it plus minus 2 times

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.025
the first. So minus
4 plus 4 is 0.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.940
And then if I divide the top
row by minus 2, the reduced

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.110
row echelon form of this matrix
right here or this

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.210
matrix right here is going
to be 1, 1, 0.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:38.140
So the eigenspace that
corresponds to the eigenvalue

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:48.690
minus 1 is equal to the null
space of this guy right here

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.930
It's the set of vectors
that satisfy this

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.320
equation: 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.110
And then you have v1,
v2 is equal to 0.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.720
Or you get v1 plus-- these
aren't vectors,

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.070
these are just values.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.200
v1 plus v2 is equal to 0.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.020
Because 0 is just equal to
that thing right there.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.170
So 1 times v1 plus 1 times v2 is
going to be equal to that 0

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.080
right there.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.910
Or I could write v1 is
equal to minus v2.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:28.510
Or if we say that v2 is equal to
t, we could say v1 is equal

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.430
to minus t.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.450
Or we could say that the
eigenspace for the eigenvalue

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:41.770
minus 1 is equal to all of the
vectors, v1, v2 that are equal

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:50.180
to some scalar t times v1 is
minus t and v2 is plus t.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.410
Or you could say this is equal
to the span of the vector

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.940
minus 1 and 1.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.710
So let's just graph this a
little bit just to understand

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:00.960
what we just did.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.860
We were able to find
two eigenvalues for

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.390
this, 5 and minus 1.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.370
And we were able to find all
of the vectors that are

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.310
essentially-- or, we were able
to find the set of vectors

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.670
that are the eigenvectors that
correspond to each of these

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.020
eigenvalues.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.460
So let's graph them.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.750
So if we go to R2, let
me draw my axes, this

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.120
is my vertical axis.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.230
That's my horizontal axis.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.430
So all of the vectors that
correspond to lambda equal 5

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.970
are along the line 1/2, 1.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:35.460
Or the span of 1/2, 1.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.320
So that is 1.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.750
That is 1.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.170
So you go 1/2 and 1
just like that.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:46.150
So that's that vector,
spanning vector.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.770
But anything along the span of
this, all the multiples of

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.060
this, are going to be
valid eigenvectors.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.360
So anything along that line,
all of the vectors when you

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.920
draw them in standard
position, point to a

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.540
point on that line.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.900
All of these vectors, any vector
on there is going to be

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.430
a valid eigenvector and the
corresponding eigenvalue is

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.020
going to be equal to 5.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:11.250
So you give me this
guy right here.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.270
When you apply the
transformation, it's going to

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.805
be five times this guy.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.040
If this guy is x, t of
x is going to be

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.870
five times this guy.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.940
Whatever vector you give along
this line, the transformation

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.860
of that guy, the transformation
is literally,

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.140
multiplying it by
the matrix A.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.330
Where did I have the matrix A?

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.040
The matrix A right up there.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.660
You're essentially just scaling
this guy by 5 in

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.320
either direction.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.160
This is for lambda equal 5.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.390
And for lambda equals 1, it's
the span of this vector, which

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:48.730
is minus 1, 1.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.100
Which looks like this.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.460
So this vector looks
like that.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.800
We care about the span of it.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.370
Any vector that when you draw in
standard position lies, or

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.770
points to, points on this line,
will be an eigenvector

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.170
for the eigenvalue minus 1.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.500
So lambda equals minus 1.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.860
Let's say you take the
spanning vector here.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.010
You apply the transformation,
you're going to get

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.730
minus 1 times it.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.240
So if this is x, the
transformation of x is going

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.100
to be that right there.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.670
Same length, just in the
opposite direction.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.340
If you have this guy right
here, you apply the

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.510
transformation, it's going to
be in the same spanning line

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.570
just like that.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:35.580
So the two eigenspaces for the
matrix-- where did I write it?

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:40.610
I think it was the matrix
1, 2, 3-- 1, 2, 4, 3.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:45.280
The two eigenvalues were
5 and minus 1.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.220
And then it has an infinite
number of eigenvectors, so

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.890
they actually create
two eigenspaces.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.040
Each of them correspond to
one of the eigenvalues.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.270
And these lines represent
those two eigenspaces.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.480
You give me any vector in
either of these sets and

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.360
they're going to be
an eigenvector.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.520
I'm using the word
vector too much.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.590
You give me any vector in either
of these sets, and they

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.420
will be an eigenvector
for our matrix A.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.520
And then, depending on which
line it is, we know what their

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.810
transformation is going to be.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.930
If it's going to be on
this guy, we take the

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.060
transformation, the resulting
vector's going to be five

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.620
times the vector.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.510
If you take one of these
eigenvectors and you transform

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.920
it, the resulting transformation
of the vector's

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.550
going to be minus 1
times that vector.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.900
Anyway, we now know what
eigenvalues, eigenvectors,

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.010
eigenspaces are.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.560
And even better, we know how
to actually find them.
