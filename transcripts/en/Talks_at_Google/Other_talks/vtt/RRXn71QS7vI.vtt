RACHAEL O'MEARA: Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.340
I'm Rachael O'Meara.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.860
I'm really excited today to be
hosting an Authors at Google

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.140
event, Talks at Google.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.440
We have Marianne Williamson here
today, and she's here to

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.960
talk about her latest work,
"How to Overcome Financial

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.810
Stress and Live a Life
of Abundance".

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.900
Marianne, if you aren't familiar
with her work, is one

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.300
of our greatest spiritual
leaders right now, motivator,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.950
a lecturer, in general, someone
who is making a big

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.470
difference in the world.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.920
So if anyone here is familiar
with her work, that's awesome.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.680
And if not, hopefully you'll
come away from today learning

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.600
a few things about how you can
live a life of abundance.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.480
Her latest book-- it's called
"The Law of Divine

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.150
Compensation"--

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.750
is available in the back.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.090
And "Return to Love", which is
one of her earlier works, is

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.920
also available in the back.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.070
And I'll just leave
with this comment.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.030
I think it's really important
at Google that we bring in

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.560
authors that challenge what we
think, and speakers who have

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.710
open agendas and really just
make a difference in our

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.390
culture at Google to really be
pushing the envelope and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.730
figuring out what's best, what
we can do and how we can help.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.570
So Marianne is here for
that reason today.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.320
And if anyone saw the movie
"Coach Carter", she has a

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.070
quote in there that I really
enjoy and I wanted to share

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.050
with you before we
get started.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.960
So what is in the movie is the
following, and this is

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.890
Marianne's quote.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.170
"Our deepest fear is not
that we are inadequate.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.230
Our deepest fear is that we are
powerful beyond measure.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.690
It is our light, not
our darkness, that

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.290
most frightens us".

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.710
So with that, I'll leave
you with Marianne.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.000
Thanks.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.276
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON:
Thank you, Rachael.

00:01:45.276 --> 00:01:46.262
Thank you.

00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:49.310
Thank you so much
for having me.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.930
I tell you, I forget that I had
told Rachael I would be

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.150
talking about abundance
and financial stress.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.490
We'll get there, because I'm
going to instead go with what,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.430
since apparently I wrote that
email, I've been thinking

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.790
about that I want to
share with you.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.480
But as you'll also recognize,
it's all one big

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.930
conversation anyway.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.470
So let's start with this
conversation about creativity

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.050
and leadership.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.950
Creativity, the way the Western
mind usually thinks of

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.070
creating something, we think
of ourselves as being

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.810
generative.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.070
And we think, I need to
go create something.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.840
Certainly at a company like
this, you're thinking about

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.220
that a lot.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.090
We got to create something.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.960
We got to create something.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.630
Now a lot of this has to do
with, you could talk about it

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.210
as a worldly perspective
versus a more spiritual

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.070
perspective.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.010
In a very real way, it's a
more Western perspective

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.520
rather than an Eastern
perspective.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.220
The idea of creativity
being generative is a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.840
very Western concept.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.030
It's like the thought that if
you bring a blank document up

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.600
on your screen and you've
got to figure out

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.610
what to write on it.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.740
What am I going to create
on this document?

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.010
A more spiritual or metaphysical
prospective says,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.940
there's already a file.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.710
And your job is to download
the file.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.380
And it is an undelete-able
file.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.110
And it is creativity itself.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.190
Hemingway was famous for having
talked about how unless

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.790
the story was writing itself,
he put the pencil down.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.250
He would write, he said, every
day for as long a period of

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.060
time as the story seemed to be
writing itself through him.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.700
Once he felt that that was no
longer happening, he put the

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.830
pencil down.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.820
And of course, in that fabulous
book, "Letters to a

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.120
Young Poet", the poet Rilke,
when asked by the young poet,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.190
how do I know if I should
be a poet even?

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.680
Rilke's response was, only
be a poet if you have to.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.040
Only if it is the calling that
is within you that is

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.670
undeniable.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.300
Also in the Eastern religions,
in Zen Buddhism, of course,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.020
whereas in the Western mind we
think of learning everything I

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.680
need to learn so that then I can
make something happen, the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.810
highest creative moment in Zen
Buddhism is the empty mind.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.050
The Zen mind in Buddhism is
called the beginner's mind.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.930
So the practice of the East,
or the practice of

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.940
spirituality, is to take all
that you've learned, you learn

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.519
it just so that then
you can forget it.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.950
Now it's still there, so that's
not a reason to not

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.830
become educated.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.150
It's not a reason to not
read the books and

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.330
get the skill set.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.800
But the practice of the creative
mind is to enter into

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.970
the moment without
that clutter.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.100
In the I Ching they talk about
presenting an empty

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.940
rice bowl to God.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.280
An empty rice bowl.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.580
Now it's the same thing., the
idea of an empty rice bowl,

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.810
because it's said in the
east that the Dao will

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.110
fill the rice bowl.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.550
But if you enter in the moment
thinking you already know,

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.080
then that higher force of
creativity, by whatever you

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.370
call it, cannot work
through you.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.890
It does actually have a
corresponding metaphysical

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.470
principle in the New Testament,
when Jesus said, be

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.300
as little children.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.620
Because in the course in
miracles, he says, what that

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.820
means is little children know
that they do not know, and so

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.520
they are teachable.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.790
Where adults too often walk into
a situation thinking that

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.410
they do know, and so they're not
teachable, which I think,

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.680
by the way, is even more of a
psychic crisis for males than

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.260
females in our society.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.900
Because men are so bred--

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.260
we're all embarrassed to say
that we don't know, but men,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.730
particularly, it's almost like
they must act like they know.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.730
And that particular aspect of
the mind is actually very

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.080
detrimental to us.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.490
Because the mind that thinks it
knows is not the mind that

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.520
ultimately knows.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.480
Because the mind that ultimately
knows is the mind

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.160
that, as it were, is receptive
to a higher

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.745
vibration of knowledge.

00:05:57.745 --> 00:06:00.700
Now leadership fits
in to that.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.370
Because in the Dao to Ching,
Lao Tzu said, to be a

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.230
follower-- the way to
be a leader of men--

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.530
is to be a follower
of the Dao.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.760
So if you think of yourself--
it's counter intuitive--

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.990
if you're thinking of yourself
as here to follow something

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:25.300
higher, you manifest as a leader
among other people.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.980
If you act like someone who's
trying to be a leader, people

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.940
kind of wonder what
your game is.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.310
Because like, what are
you trying to do?

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.230
Because particularly today, with
this switch over out of

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.250
the top down model, we're moving
into the idea of-- we

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.170
have moved into the idea of
leadership as someone who

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.540
holds a space for the brilliance
of others.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.120
Now if-- that's what
leadership is.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.090
Leadership is I hold
the space, I

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.610
assume you're brilliant.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.350
That's the best thing-- if
you're a leader on a team, the

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.660
best thing you can do
is to assume that

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.730
everybody there is a genius.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.240
Now the notion, metaphysically.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.310
Is that all minds are joined,
that on a level of energy and

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.870
mind, there's really no place
where you stop and I start.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.620
Everybody subconsciously
knows everything.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.040
If I'm sitting in a room with
you-- this goes way beyond

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.800
behavior modification--

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.760
because if I'm sitting in a room
with you, no matter how

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.410
nice I'm being to you, if I
really assume you have some

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.640
real limits, you know that on
some level, whether you even

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.720
consciously know it or not.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.880
But if I'm assuming that you,
like everyone, has only

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:35.130
scratched the surface of genius
that lies inside all of

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.050
us, that is the word salute.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.360
That's what salute means.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.140
I salute you.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.410
I re-cognize that, recognize
that in you.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.700
And in my presence--

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.600
it's kind of like when you go
to therapy, and you might be

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.500
at a therapeutic session and at
the end of the session, you

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.490
say to your therapist, oh,
thank you, thank you.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.530
This was so good for me.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:56.550
Thank you.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.254
The therapist had hardly
said a word.

00:07:59.254 --> 00:08:01.110
You ever had those times?

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.440
It was the quality of their
compassion and non-judgment.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.810
In the presence, that's what
their skill set was.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.320
The quality of their compassion
and non-judgment

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.920
called you.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.320
And so if a leader is simply
assuming that you're a genius,

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.560
assuming that genius lies within
you, that you have the

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.220
potential for greatness, it
literally, in the presence of

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:28.060
that person who is assuming the
best in you, you will rise

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.070
to that level.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.289
Now, once again, I wasn't
seeking to lead you.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:35.090
I was seeking to follow
an inner light.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.510
Now you can talk about that
inner light or inner

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.419
understanding in secular
terms or religious

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.760
terms, spiritual terms.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.060
It's so irrelevant, the
language that we use.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.010
The point is that we're
beginning to understand that

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.990
there are-- what did I say, we
use 10% of the brain cells--

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:55.080
that there are expanded
dimensions of consciousness,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.350
and that when we enter into
those dimensions of

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.040
consciousness, whether it's
through meditation,

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.540
mindfulness, which is like the
politically correct way of

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:07.750
expressing meditation today,
prayer, whatever our practice

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.750
is, the idea is that we
literally-- it's a conversion.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.010
It's just like converting
in electricity.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.820
You're converting into
the wisdom mind.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.820
You're converting out of
the strategic mind.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.430
You're converting out of
the formulaic mind.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.530
And this is what people are
finally beginning to

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.300
understand.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.390
When you're converting out of
the rational, or beyond the

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.440
rational, you're not going into
the irrational, you're

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.140
just going into the
non-rational.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.590
The non-rational is
not irrational.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.900
Look at nature.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.770
Look at nature.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.260
Look at how nature
always takes care

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.270
of its young, right?

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.170
What is rational about a society
of geniuses that

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:54.020
spends so much more effort on
keeping people down, harming

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.330
people we don't like,
incarcerating if they mess up?

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.510
What's rational about this?

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.610
It is insane.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.190
So if you get a bunch of
rational, so-called rational,

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.280
people together who do not
have a sense of serving a

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.550
higher good, you come up with
irrational actions and

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.270
irrational behavior.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.670
And that is where we have come
to in our society and in our

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.210
civilization, even when you
look at something like

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.220
technology.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.660
Technology, the idea of the
material plane from a

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.590
spiritual perspective is that
there's nothing on the

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:31.450
spiritual plane that is either
holy or unholy, high minded or

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:37.390
low minded, except as the mind
ascribes purpose to it.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:41.760
Nobody needs to be reminded in
this room the incredibly good

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.230
things that technology
can do for the world.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.520
But nobody needs to be reminded
in this room either

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.780
the very destructive ways
that people can use

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.390
technology, as well.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.030
This is where Western
civilization,

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.060
particularly, is.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.730
This is where we are.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:59.350
We have all this, but the crisis
now is the crisis of

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.130
significance and the crisis
of importance.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:07.640
And will we use what we have
done in our society over the

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.630
last 40 years or so is that we
have taken the prodigious

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.220
genius and education and
capacity of generations of

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.330
Americans, the most privileged
in a very long time, and used

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.230
it primarily for unimportant
ends.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.170
And there are a lot of
sociological and political

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.100
reasons for that, but the
analysis of how we got here is

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.960
not as important as that
we start anew.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.690
And in starting anew, we're
really moving out-- many

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.520
people are moving out of the
sense of I don't know, I'll do

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.620
whatever I want to do.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.980
Now the I don't know, I'll do
whatever I want to do-- when

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.220
you look at the Middle Ages, the
Middle Ages was dominated

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.230
by a church structure that
was imprisoning and

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:48.870
limiting to the mind.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.260
And it had a particular world
view, and anybody who didn't

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.470
toe the line with their world
view was cast out, at best,

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.270
and tortured and killed,
at worse.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.120
The Enlightenment,
the 18th Century

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.840
enlightenment, was so important.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.860
And this country was founded of
it. it was the idea of, no,

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.720
the human being of themselves,
without a church sitting on

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.780
top of them, can use
reasoning, can do

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:12.960
whatever they want.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.860
But Heidl said, it's thesis,
antithesis, synthesis.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.070
Because now we realized we had
taken what is really a

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.420
positive character, a logical
image of the rugged

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.420
individualist, and we've taken
it so far that now we're like

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.220
the cancer cell which
has gone insane.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.000
And instead of recognizing its
natural intelligence which

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.720
would lead it to collaborate
with other cells for the

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.950
healthy functioning of the
organ, the cancer cell is a

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.820
cell that says, I don't
want to do that.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.230
I'm want to go do
my own thing.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.230
I don't want to just collaborate
with other cells

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.620
to serve the healthy functioning
of the spleen.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.710
I want to go do my own thing.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.800
And that is malignant.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.380
And it just gathers other
sick cells around it.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.760
That forms a mass, which is then
destructive, not only to

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.860
that organ, but to the
entire system and

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.900
ultimately, to itself.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.540
And that is where the Western
mind has gone.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.630
An individualist mentality has
become malignant mentality.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.520
It's one thing to be an
individual and to know that

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.670
I'm a unique expression,
as all of us are.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.790
That's a beautiful thing.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:19.890
But even the rose knows it's
part of a larger garden.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.810
You have the rose and you have
the tulip and you have the

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.600
peony and you have the
daisy and all that.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.360
But then there's this thing
called the garden, and they

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.380
all belong within the garden.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.670
The malignant thinking of
Western consciousness is that

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.980
we have thought, it's
just about me.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.740
We've put competition
above collaboration.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.770
We have forgotten that there's
a bigger purpose here than

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.860
just me getting what I want.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.590
So I think that's this era
of history that we're in.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:43.970
Because we realize--

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.500
and I think that there is an
awakening in our society, and

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.600
I think, around the world, of
people recognizing that

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.220
whatever mentality has been
dominating things has taken

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.970
us, literally, not figuratively,
literally, to

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.160
the brink of disaster.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.900
Literally.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.980
There are so many
stress points.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.720
There are so many very, very
grim probability vectors for

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.400
the next 20 years.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.240
And I think that all that's--

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.610
I wouldn't say all that's
needed, but really the primary

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.020
foundational thing that's
needed is that shift in

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.960
thinking, from I don't
have these toys.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.850
You here--

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:25.350
if this were something happening
centuries ago,

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:32.340
Google would be seen as a wizard
school, like Hogwarts.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.900
You are carrying--

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:34.890
this is wizardry.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.970
This is what would have
been called wizardry.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:40.920
But the issue that you would
see, if it was centuries ago,

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.290
there would be a conversation,
is it the dark arts or the

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.020
light arts?

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.370
And I think the blessing on a
company like this, from a

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.990
metaphysical perspective, is
that there already is the

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.350
conversation, we want to make
people's lives better.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.070
But even that, I think the
next iteration is beyond

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.020
making just individuals'
lives better.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.610
How are we going to keep this
ship that we're on from

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.410
hitting the iceberg?

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:09.510
Now Rachael mentioned my last
book, "The Law of Divine

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.240
Compensation".

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.700
So in that I talk about
a principle I want

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.210
to move into now.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:18.030
From the metaphysical
perspective--

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.390
and meta means beyond.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.720
So there's the physical,
as above, so below.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.800
The notion is that there are
objective, discernible laws of

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.340
the internal realms of
consciousness, just as there

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.120
are objective, discernible laws
of the external world.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.290
Gravity, thermodynamics.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:34.770
Same with the internal
phenomenon.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.310
Nothing in this world, even
the mysteries, are not

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.110
mysterious if you
understand them.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.140
The notion of a self-organizing
universe is

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.820
that you see certain
imprints in nature.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.545
The embryo, the way
it becomes a baby.

00:15:46.545 --> 00:15:49.260
The bud, the way it
becomes a blossom.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.400
The acorn, the way it
becomes an oak tree.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.150
A little acorn is programmed
within.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:58.086
A little acorn is already
carrying a blueprint by which

00:15:58.086 --> 00:16:01.620
it will one day turn into an
oak tree, a huge oak tree.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:02.650
The embryo.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:03.490
You have one sperm.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:04.600
You have one egg.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.140
And even though we can make
pictures of it, the mystery by

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.960
which it is programmed, somehow
those cells are going

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.450
to divide and become a brain and
become a heart and become

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:19.015
lungs and become eyeballs and
become skull and become hair

00:16:19.015 --> 00:16:22.020
and become skin and become
a vascular system.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.410
I mean, it's phenomenal.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.430
And it's going to be put in this
tiny little package to

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.540
come out through woman's legs.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.730
I mean, the whole thing is a
level of genius that is so

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.320
beyond anything that we
have come up with.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.950
The metaphysical notion is that
it is not just the cells

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.780
and an embryo becoming a baby.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.900
It is not just the bud becoming
a blossom or the

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.950
acorn becoming the oak tree, but
that every single aspect

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:46.700
of nature, there is an imprint
of self-organization.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.710
Not only self-organization,
but self-correction.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:54.400
What that means is, just as the
cell is programmed, its

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.740
own native intelligence,
when it is sane.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.260
We've already talked about
an insane cell.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.530
It's called a cancer-ed cell.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.770
But a sane cell is recognizing
its natural programming by

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.700
which it collaborates with the
other cells to serve the

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.690
healthy functioning.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.240
From a metaphysical perspective,
you and I are all

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.470
cells, also naturally programmed
to collaborate with

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:16.930
others in order to serve the
healthy functioning of the

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.460
total organism, which is life
on the planet as we know it.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:24.250
We had been taught an
insane perspective.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.250
And that's what Gandhi said.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.569
The problem with the world is
humanity's out his mind.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:31.070
So when we are not thinking,
how can I

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.520
serve, we are insane.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:39.170
And when we do think, how can I
serve, it literally performs

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.440
a conversion in the brain.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.810
So if you go into
any meeting--

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.590
and this is what--

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:50.890
I love what's happening in the
world today, because what

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.730
people are doing today is that
they're casting on to what I'm

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.100
about to say, it's woo woo.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.660
But actually ripping it off and
turning it into all kinds

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.745
of leadership seminars and stuff
like that, and say, but

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:00.287
we're not woo woo.

00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:02.730
When actually, they're saying
the exact same things that the

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.300
people they call woo
woo were saying.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.950
This projection onto love
and spirituality,

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:08.850
it's just woo woo.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.330
It's light brain.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.250
It's fuzzy brain thinking.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.710
As though, like I said, it's
really intelligent to just

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.110
incarcerate everybody that acts
out of their desperation

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:21.830
or bomb people who dare to
disagree with you, right?

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.780
So that's really saying.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.500
But the idea here is that
when your attitude, your

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.410
perspective is, before you walk
into a meeting, that you

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:30.910
just send your peace
to everybody

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.420
who's going to be there.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.260
You send your love before you.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.620
For some people, that's
saying a prayer.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.600
For some people, it's
a blessing.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.020
For some people, just sending
peace, sending good energy,

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.330
wishing you the best,
beneficent, namaste.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.580
That's another thing
with Americans.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.650
If we say it in another
language, we'll accept it.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:47.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.680
Particularly in Northern
California.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:51.660
Fine.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.115
Whatever.

00:18:52.115 --> 00:18:53.600
Whatever it does for you.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.750
The love in me salutes
the love in you.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:56.690
The Christ in me
salutes Christ.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.170
God in me salutes God in you.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.800
The Buddha within me salutes
the Buddha within you.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.390
It truly does not matter.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.250
It's that the wisdom in me and
the love in me and the

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:05.910
goodness in me--

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:09.100
you will literally have
a different meeting.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.100
And what it does is it plugs
everybody into their natural

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.080
intelligence.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.070
Now the idea of the law of
divine compensation is not

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.810
only is the universe
self-organizing, which means

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.830
just as every cell in the embryo
is already programmed

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:29.250
to turn into the baby, that
perspective holds that you and

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.580
I are already programmed, each
and every one of us, to become

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.130
fully self-actualized.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.480
The oak tree is the full

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.490
self-actualization of the acorn.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.970
And the blossom is the full
self-actualization of the bud.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.170
And the baby is the full

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.700
self-actualization of the embryo.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.620
The person you're capable
of being is your

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.690
self-actualized self.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.595
And you are programmed to be the
man or the woman that you

00:19:50.595 --> 00:19:54.030
are capable of being on this
planet, this lifetime, no less

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.240
than the embryo is programmed
to be the baby.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.100
But the difference between us
and the acorn and the embryo

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.510
is that you and I can say,
no, I don't want to.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.470
That's what free will means.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.262
I don't have to.

00:20:07.262 --> 00:20:10.760
I don't have to think the
thoughts of complete service

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.870
and compassion and love.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.040
I can say, no, I'm only
here for myself.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.850
I'm only here to
get something.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.110
And I have an idea of what I
need to make happen, which is

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.650
always based on something that
happened in my past that I

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.720
need to compensate for,
that's why I think I

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.880
need to make it happen.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.800
Therefore, my core belief is
that things really aren't good

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.430
enough already.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.350
Therefore, no matter what
I do, I will recreate a

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:32.900
situation in which things are
not good enough already.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.980
So the attitude of, I'm
only here to love is

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.010
hardly woo woo thinking.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:39.900
It's the most sophisticated
thinking.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:40.780
I have no agenda.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.080
I'm empty.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.630
How can I serve?

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:44.970
Wow, you're incredible.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.030
And dear God, if there's any
part of me that can't see how

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.690
incredible she is, please remove
that obstruction, in

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.190
whatever language.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:55.840
And then you are literally
in a parallel universe of

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.190
possibility.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.410
And that's what's happening on
the planet, I think, is that

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:03.560
we are seeking, some in
religious and spiritual ways,

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.650
and some in secular ways, to
return to that natural

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:09.810
intelligence, whether it's
through mindfulness, whether

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.490
it's through meditation,
whether it's

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:12.920
through spiritual practice.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:17.560
And even more importantly that
we remember that when you do

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.720
meditate, when you do align
yourself with these kinds of

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.400
ideas, the point is not just to
be there while you're doing

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:30.230
your practice, it's what happens
when you open your

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.760
eyes, you go back
into the world.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.950
So that if I'm in a business
meeting with you, I'm looking

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.920
at you, thinking, the love in
me salutes the love in you.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.260
If I'm in a business meeting
with you, I'm thinking, wow,

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.690
boy, my judgments
are really high.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.070
That's blocking the
possibilities that could

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.070
happen here.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.210
I'm really willing to see
this differently.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.290
You train your brain.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.750
You train your mind into a
different perspective.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.020
The universe is self-organizing,
yes.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.820
It's also self-correcting.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.630
And that means that just like
once that baby, once the

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:06.540
embryo turns into the baby, once
the body is born and the

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.830
lungs continue to breathe and
the heart continues to beat,

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:13.470
the body also has an immune
system, so that if injury or

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:15.880
illness enters into the system,
the immune system is

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.330
there to take care
of the problem.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.120
We also, the psychic
bloodstream, as it were, of

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.060
humanity, we also have
an immune system.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.820
An immune system takes the form
of conscience, remorse,

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.100
moral concern and so forth.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.070
That's why it's such a
conversation in a society

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.300
about sociopaths.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.455
Sociopaths and narcissists.

00:22:34.455 --> 00:22:35.580
They're cancerous cells.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.690
It's a malignant mentality,
because it's only

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.130
concerned for self.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.480
There's a lot of talk in society
today, don't feel bad.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.650
With some people in some
situations, feel bad.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.610
Because only a sociopath would
not feel bad in this moment.

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:51.100
Conscience is there
for a reason.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.950
Remorse is there for a reason.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:58.270
Nature provides us with these
things as a way of bells are

00:22:58.270 --> 00:22:59.710
ringing and lights
are flashing.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.355
No, it's not OK.

00:23:01.355 --> 00:23:04.640
It's not OK that 17,000 children
are starving on this

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.560
planet every day.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.343
It's not OK.

00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:09.640
It's not OK that America
has 2.4 million people

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.810
incarcerated, that there are
more African American men

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:15.765
incarcerated today than there
were enslaved in 1850.

00:23:15.765 --> 00:23:17.330
It's not OK.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.620
It's not OK that one
in four American

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.310
children are food insecure.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.160
It's not OK.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.640
That's not something that a
Google thing is going to come

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.660
up on your computer and
say, it's not OK.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.920
It's not OK.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.020
But if you say it's not OK,
then when you consider the

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.140
wizardry of things like Google
and the extraordinary

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.830
technological advances that have
come about, then we can

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.160
handle all those problems.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.860
And that's why a place like
this is so important.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:53.010
I heard a man say not too long
ago-- he is a medical doctor--

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.430
and he was dealing with these
extraordinary machines that

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:58.290
are doing all the stuff with the
stem cells and the genome.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:01.190
And it's just amazing what
medical research

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.612
is coming up with.

00:24:02.612 --> 00:24:05.730
But he was talking about the
irony, and he's so right.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:11.830
The work we do to save one life,
and then we so casually

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.890
destroy many.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:17.730
That is an insanity factor, and
no machine can fix that.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:21.770
But when we allow our hearts and
minds to be aligned and we

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:23.400
become deeply rational--

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.650
there's a line in the course
in miracles where it says,

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:30.580
love restores reason and not
the other way around.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.780
And we see that all the
technological and material

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.490
resources, such as a Google,
such as technology, are here

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:43.000
to be used in service to that,
then there's nothing

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.010
that we cannot do.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:50.010
Now the issue of abundance is
that that is the abundance.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.500
That is the abundance.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.380
This mentality is
the abundant.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.140
And when you are living in
that internal abundance,

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.020
Martin Luther King said, you
are surrounded by cosmic

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.460
companionship.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.450
When you're just trying to make
things happen, you're not

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:05.170
creating anything.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:05.990
You're making something.

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:08.260
You're staying on the mortal
plane and you're at the effect

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.620
and will continue to be at the
effect of the laws of chaos

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.290
and randomness.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:14.250
And good luck and I
hope you do well.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:21.580
When you convert to, I'm here
no more and no less than any

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:25.850
other human being for purposes
much greater than my mortal

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:30.200
mind has any idea, I carry
within me no more and no less

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.200
infinite potential for
brilliance and genius.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.110
I am programmed no more and no
less than every other person

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:39.410
to be the highest actualization
of my

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:41.880
possibility on this
planet, manifest

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.080
creatively in this lifetime.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.460
And that as I do that, I will
naturally just as cells find

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.630
themselves in the presence of
other cells who know to

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.700
collaborate with them to do what
they do for the healthy

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.655
functioning of the body, to the
extent that I'm living at

00:25:55.655 --> 00:25:57.900
that higher frequency of
possibility, I will then

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.530
naturally resonate with
people who also play

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.550
in the higher game.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.980
And we are all programmed, not
necessarily through what our

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:10.290
rational mind can determine, but
through our hearts, with

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.830
the rational mind in
service to that.

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:18.520
And then not only do we
actualize, but we become a

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.450
huge corrective force
for a planet that is

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:22.310
absolutely in trouble.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:26.590
Many years ago, when I was a
teenager, I was accosted in my

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:31.910
house, a man who broke into
my parents' home.

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.670
And when this happened, and I
was in my bedroom and he came

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:39.560
in the door, I had an
experience where

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.560
every cell was alive.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.930
Every cell was alive.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:49.010
And I really had an experience
how the human is programmed

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:51.320
when there is real disaster.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.800
Every cell of me was alive.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.130
I was catapulted
into behavior--

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:59.460
and what 17-year-old girl
even knows, right?

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.160
And I think that that's what's
happening on this planet.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:02.820
I feel it.

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:03.340
There's a quickening.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.280
I used to think, just, God,
we would all say,

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.410
Americans are so asleep.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:08.850
I don't think we're
asleep anymore.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:10.980
I think there's a critical
mass-- there's enough people

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.040
who, like, get the--

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.230
it's like storm warnings.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:18.190
And now, for us, remember we are
programmed to be able to

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:20.080
handle this.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.330
An immune system knows
what to do.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.450
And AIDS was a fascinating
metaphysical, just as cancer

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:28.620
is a fascinating representation
of where

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.520
consciousness has gone off, so
is a suppressed immune system.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.070
We have forgotten, we are
the immune system.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:39.630
And when we see ourselves that
way and just have that action

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.040
within, it sparks something.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.860
It sparks something in the heart
and it sparks something

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.060
in the brain, and it makes
other people perceive us

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.560
differently.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.860
Then what will happen,
I think, is

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.280
that we'll get going.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.700
And there is no doubt.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.850
I think we've already started.

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:53.780
I just think we need
to step it up.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.010
And obviously, companies like
this, and anything that has to

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:00.740
do with technology, is part of
what not only can go right in

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.990
individual's lives, but can be
used in a collective way

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:06.980
beyond anything you've even come
up with yet to turn the

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:11.050
ship around, so that
collectively we do more than

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:11.690
we're doing now.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:17.280
What we're doing now is that one
force, people and forces

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.360
in America, seem determined to
just throw us over the cliff.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.390
Another force is trying hard
to keep us from the cliff.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:27.040
What we need to do
is just walk in a

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.970
different direction entirely.

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:33.690
And the universe is not only
organized and knows how to

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:36.170
organize and it is
self-organizing, but within

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.470
the infinity of spiritual
substance, there are also the

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:42.030
capacity to compensate
for any lack or any

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.270
problem, when it exists.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:48.150
And that divine compensation not
only makes sure that you

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.000
personally are taken care of,
but something much more

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.040
important happens than just that
you are financially and

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.700
career-wise taken care of.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.750
And that's that we become a
generation that saves the

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:03.940
entire species from global
catastrophe, which it is

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:08.480
absolutely not unreasonable to
consider possible, if not

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.316
probable, at this time.

00:29:10.316 --> 00:29:13.070
Does that make sense?

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.720
So what I'd like to do, since
there's a microphone right

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.370
there, what I'd like to do with
the time we have left is

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:21.330
for anybody who wants to, come
to the mic to either bring up

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:26.860
a topic or ask a question
within this, and

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.700
we'll talk about it.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.540
From a spiritual perspective,
this idea of the shift, the

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.810
conversion, the shift from fear
to love is nothing short

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:36.230
of a miracle.

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:39.500
Because that miracle has to do
with the reprogramming of

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.340
thought system so that
possibilities exist within

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.830
time and space that would
otherwise have not existed.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:50.180
AUDIENCE: So thank you for all
of that great insight.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:53.380
For folks who are looking to
start that conversation, like

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.810
you said, here at Google, we've
got a lot of analytical

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:58.860
minds and outside of Google,
there's just

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.150
all types of folks.

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:04.780
So how do you just start it,
if there's a question that

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.550
maybe you know others that might
be interested or even

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.860
not even close to where this
is right now, what you're

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.830
talking about, they're just
not in that mindset.

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.350
Can you give us some tips on
how would you start that?

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.570
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON: OK.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:17.090
Now this is what's
interesting here.

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.850
Self-organizing universe.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:22.060
Each of us are cells, so
each of us has natural

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.710
intelligence.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.080
Each of us has a part to play.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.670
Like every cell in the body
has a part to play.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:31.220
Not only does it have its part
to play, but no other

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.520
cell has that part.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.440
So that's true of each of us.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.630
Now, no cell says to the
other cell, I know

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.730
what you should do.

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:44.680
Because the guidance for every
cell comes to that cell.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.470
You start with the idea that
wherever you are, that's it.

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:50.710
Every situation you're in,
whoever you're talking to,

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:52.160
whatever the circumstance.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.830
If you are just standing there,
there to be of service,

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.710
there to be empty, there
to be of service, there

00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:59.550
to not have an agenda.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:02.660
Because that's what we've
done in our society--

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.330
you're taught that the way to
really handle a business

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.470
meeting is to go in beforehand,
what's your

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.640
intention, what's the
result you want,

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.800
which sounds so lovely.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.820
It's so dark, because it
really means, how can I

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:17.660
exploit you?

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.100
How can I control you?

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.260
How can I manipulate you,
and how can i use you

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.280
to get what I want?

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.710
It has turned human interaction
transactional.

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:27.380
There's nothing beautiful
about that.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.750
There's nothing enlightened
about that.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:32.010
So instead, we walk into
any situation--

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:35.310
and remember, I'm not trying
to generate anything.

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.430
Creativity, the intelligence,
the higher intelligence of the

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:42.010
universe, knows exactly how
you and I meeting in this

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:46.625
conversation can best be used,
how it fits into you learning

00:31:46.625 --> 00:31:49.370
what you need to learn, how it
fits into me learning what I

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:50.320
need to learn.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.090
If you and I trigger each
other, that's no

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:53.950
less, by the way.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:57.250
All I need to know is that
this situation is an

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:00.270
invitation to me to rise to the
highest version of myself

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:03.640
that I can be, to be kind, to
just be available, to be in

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.010
the present with you.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:09.735
And then life will take us
wherever we best serve.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:16.590
And literally, it comes out of
quote-unquote left field.

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.520
Out of the blue.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.080
When people say to you, I just
met him out of the blue.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.080
We just happened
to be talking.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.340
When you live that way and you
see it and things just happen,

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.650
that's why it is Hogwarts.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:27.130
It is.

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:29.400
It's like, oh, just
what I needed just

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.170
happened to be there.

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:30.440
Why?

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.300
Because I wasn't trying to make
something happen, she and

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:37.170
I were just talking and being
kind and compassionate, really

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:38.030
caring about each other.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:41.170
And next thing I know, you, who
is exactly what we needed,

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.850
just happened to be
sitting there.

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:47.860
The chaotic universe is the one
that occurs, OK, now what

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.700
is it we need and how can we get
it, and who can we find?

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.600
I mean, there's an aspect of
that, if it's of service to

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.300
the higher.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.660
Does that makes sense?

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.620
So it's none of my business
what any of you

00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:59.490
are supposed to do.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:02.010
It's none of your business
what I'm supposed to do.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:04.040
All we're talking about is
showing up in any room you

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.990
happen to be in, knowing that
the universe, whenever

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:10.090
anybody's consciousness is how
can I serve and I'm available

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:11.640
today, use me.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.340
Use my hands.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.085
Use my feet.

00:33:13.085 --> 00:33:15.810
And it goes without saying,
the universe

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:17.350
can use smart people.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:18.948
A lot of them.

00:33:18.948 --> 00:33:19.844
Necessary.

00:33:19.844 --> 00:33:21.190
Now.

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:22.070
Doesn't that make sense?

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.080
Hello.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.010
Yes.

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:30.310
AUDIENCE: I often find myself
being conflicted when a

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:34.130
thought comes to my mind that
say I need to serve.

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:36.390
For example, animals.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:36.820
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON:
Serve what?

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:37.450
AUDIENCE: Animals.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:38.030
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON: Animals.

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:40.560
AUDIENCE: Or any gods,
for that matter.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:47.150
The thought that comes to my
mind is that a, yes, you are

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:50.910
trying to be present and you're
working on yourself.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:54.590
Is this a calling that's coming
from that truth or

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:57.530
higher self, or whatever you
might want to call it?

00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:02.640
Or is it just your mind, your
smart cell in your mind just

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.000
saying, just presenting
you another

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.380
way of feeling fulfilled?

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:12.670
So for instance, the thought
might say, OK, you need to--

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:15.610
you really like helping animals,
so you should do it.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:18.210
But then, another thought comes
that that could also be

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:20.500
an egoic thing.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.110
How do you know it's coming from
your true self, or is it

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:24.330
your purpose--

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.350
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON: It's love
for another-- it's love and

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:29.810
the end of suffering for
another sentient being.

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:33.130
The ego does not want you to
give yourself to love and the

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:37.630
diminishment of suffering of
other sentient beings.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:40.540
Any voice that is leading to
love and the end of suffering

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:44.420
for other sentient beings
is the voice of spirit.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.989
Now if you have some egoic
motivations around it, like,

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:48.889
oh, those people who--
like me if I do that,

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:50.909
then you check that.

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:52.530
But the impulse--

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:54.449
and by the way, I want
to say this.

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:57.170
You have now been in a room
where for 30 minutes, we've

00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:58.920
spoken these kinds of ideas.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.450
It's very difficult to
lie to yourself.

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:03.290
When you're in a room,
ideas grow

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:04.470
stronger when being shared.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.540
This is a good time to
listen to yourself.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:09.915
You said serving animals
three times.

00:35:09.915 --> 00:35:12.440
Yes, that's what your heart
is leading you to do.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.780
That's your assignment.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.190
And we all have different
assignments.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.010
Some cells are supposed to be
working with the spleen, some

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.360
on the liver, some
on the heart.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.450
Your assignment is animals.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.010
Somebody else's assignment
is the environment.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:24.980
Somebody else's assignment
is sex trafficking.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.400
Somebody else's assignment
is hunger and poverty.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.440
Somebody else's assignment
is--

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.490
because every cell is directed
to go where it

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:35.310
could be best of use.

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:36.380
AUDIENCE: That's helpful.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:39.390
And also, if you could talk
about, a lot of texts, in

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:43.220
different ways, say that no
matter what action you do, it

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.850
doesn't matter.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:48.600
It all comes down to, again,
the consciousness with

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.200
which you do it.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:56.880
So irrespective of whether I
do this or not, should I

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.370
always be centered on that?

00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:01.300
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON: Only an
entitled, narcissistic era of

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.590
Americans could say
such a thing.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:10.480
17,000 children on this planet
starve to death every day.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.600
In addition to that, there are
15,000 adults who are dying.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.420
There are a billion people
living on this planet on a

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:19.130
dollar and a half,
and less, a day.

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:22.930
There are a billion above that
living on $2 and less a day.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.410
This is why the world looks at
us and can't figure out what

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:26.490
we're thinking.

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.320
It doesn't matter what we do.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:32.040
Yeah, that's real easy for us to
say here, isn't it, because

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.843
we're all pretty
much making it.

00:36:33.843 --> 00:36:34.570
See, that's the thing.

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:37.610
The club in America, and in most
of Western civilization,

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:41.410
if you're in the club,
it's a great place.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:42.160
I love the club.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.750
The club's been good to me.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:46.680
Not enough people can get into
the club these days.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.060
And some of the things that are
happening outside the club

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.480
are genuinely horrific.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.680
So the last thing that we need
to be saying to ourselves or

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:58.680
to each other is that what we
do doesn't really matter, as

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.600
long as we have what,
loving intention.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.855
What does that even mean?

00:37:01.855 --> 00:37:04.570
And there are people getting
paid to say that.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:08.460
What?

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.250
How easy can it get?

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:11.960
Oh, that's cool.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.060
I don't have to do anything
to help anybody.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:17.000
I don't have to do anything to
stop oppression or injustice,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.580
or human suffering, because
I'm just thinking love.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.940
There is nothing spiritual,
nothing spiritual about that,

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.450
nothing high minded
about that.

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:28.820
There is no legitimate, serious
spiritual path that

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:33.010
ever makes you feel like you
have a pass, you get a pass,

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:35.882
on addressing the suffering
of other living things.

00:37:35.882 --> 00:37:37.930
AUDIENCE: What are some
things you do to

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:39.830
maintain your presence?

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:40.580
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON:
Well, I'm a student

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:41.610
of a course in miracles.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:43.580
There are many, many
serious spiritual

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.170
paths on this planet.

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:46.240
Some of them are religious.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.250
Some of them are spiritual.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:49.090
Some of them are
pretty secular.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:52.610
It doesn't matter
the language.

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:54.410
If it's in a secular--

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:57.760
If it's in a spiritual or
religious context, it will, by

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.990
definition, involve daily
prayer and meditation.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:04.610
Because the idea here is that
the consciousness of the human

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:07.320
race is dominated by fear.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.190
And so enlightenment is an
unlearning of the thought

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:14.950
system of fear and accepting,
instead, the thought system

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:17.360
that's actually natural to us,
which is that we love each

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.270
other and we want to connect.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:21.640
But we are taught from the
time we are born on this

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.910
planet, we're taught, we're
separate from each other, that

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:26.820
there's only so much abundance,
so we have to

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.170
compete to get some, which is
what that book, "Law of Divine

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:30.750
Compensation", is about.

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:32.570
Rather than converting to the
thought system that there's

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:34.020
more than enough
for everybody.

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.940
And if you get the goods, it's
not like there's less than me.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:41.430
So for me to just bless you,
if I don't rejoice that you

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:44.710
got abundance, then what I'm
programming my mind to

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.570
self-sabotage any time abundance
comes to me.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:50.280
Because once I realize there's
only of us here, if I begrudge

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.640
you, I'll begrudge myself.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:52.710
So you walk around knowing that

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.120
there's enough for everybody.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:57.970
But this is more than an
intellectual shift, more than

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.960
a rational shift, because
it's so at odds.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.010
So it really is a retraining
process.

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.270
Just like you go to the gym
to work your muscles.

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:08.370
And let's say I'm
working my arms.

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:09.190
OK.

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:11.660
And I have to do accumulated
repetitions.

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:12.410
Why?

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:18.260
Because after a certain age,
my muscles are headed down.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:24.760
So I work against gravity for
the anti-gravitational force.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.370
That's how you build your
physical muscles so

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:28.610
that you can move.

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:31.160
Spiritual exercise
is the opposite.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:34.260
You're working on your
capacity to be still.

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:40.980
So you do spiritual exercises,
forgiveness, compassion work,

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.860
meditation, prayer,
transcendental--

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:43.750
that there's so many.

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:47.320
Here in this part of the
country, they're everywhere.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:47.960
Different--

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:48.900
and if you don't know--

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.730
many people in a position
where you know what your

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:52.230
spiritual path is,
but you know you

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.280
haven't been doing it.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.250
A lot of people with their
spiritual paths are kind of

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:56.710
like, I paid the dues
at the gym.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.350
I just don't go.

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:00.370
Other people in this room might
be thinking, I don't

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:02.370
even know what mine would be.

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:04.540
If you and your heart make
a movement towards I'd be

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:08.120
interested, books will
fall at your feet.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.850
And then when we do
that, we're honing

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:12.310
our attitudinal muscles.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:16.170
We're honing our attitudinal
muscles, so that if I see you

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:17.550
and I see something
Id be tempted to

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:18.600
judge, I don't judge.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.370
Or if I do judge, I
stop and go, oh.

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:24.820
And then the interesting thing
about that is whereas physical

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:29.250
musculature gives you the you
can move, you can move,

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:31.920
spiritual musculature,
attitudinal musculature gives

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.640
you the capacity to be still.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.300
You have impulse control.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.850
You don't say that
stupid thing.

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:38.560
You don't send that dumb text.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.640
You don't push the send
button when my--

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.510
technology has really given
us more power to blow it.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:46.775
Because, I'm going to
tell him right now.

00:40:46.775 --> 00:40:48.610
No, don't send that text.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:50.470
Right, right.

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:51.160
Pardon?

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.390
AUDIENCE: We have "un
you send" at Google.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:53.142
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON: Good.

00:40:53.142 --> 00:40:53.520
Good.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.170
Yeah, I know.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:57.520
But then, doesn't it say-- then
it says that you undid

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.710
something, so the person knows
that you unsent it.

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:00.410
I've been there.

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:02.180
OK.

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.110
I know what you were
going to--

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:04.070
OK.

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:06.660
But the other thing about that
illness is not only impulse

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:11.450
control, but the wisdom mind can
get through the clutter.

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:14.520
There's a term in both Judaism
and Christianity, the small,

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.140
still voice within.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.020
We meditate because the ego
mind, the voice of the world,

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.060
speaks first and it
speaks loudest.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:29.960
And we meditate to cultivate a
capacity for a wisdom voice.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.190
It's that feeling of, oh, I
just got this great idea.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.450
I got it.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:36.710
I'm sure that happens here
at Google every day.

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:39.150
In various places, somebody
says, oh my God, I got it.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.890
Well, hundreds of years ago,
they would have said, the muse

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:43.342
spoke to them.

00:41:43.342 --> 00:41:46.945
It's the same thing.

00:41:46.945 --> 00:41:49.030
This relates a little bit--

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.010
but it was fascinating to me.

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:53.430
I read an article in the
newspaper about a bunch of

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:56.966
brain scientists from MIT and
Harvard and all over, some of

00:41:56.966 --> 00:41:59.910
the greatest brain scientists,
who got together.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:02.710
And they were having a meeting
about Alzheimer's.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:05.700
Well, not specifically
Alzheimer's, about memory loss

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.940
in older people.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.260
And they were working
on a theory.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:15.640
And this theory was the idea
that not all memory loss is a

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:20.960
devolutionary factor in the
functioning of the brain.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.090
But rather, they were talking
about the idea that as the

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:31.580
brain gets older, in its genius
it would say, I don't

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:34.060
need any more of
those details.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.230
I get the pattern.

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:37.720
I don't need those details.

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.860
I already jumped to the higher
understanding of what the

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.240
pattern is.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:45.570
And all these brain scientists
were all excited about this.

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:47.150
Everybody at the table was
talking about it, because they

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:49.235
were all getting it, and they
were all recognizing this, and

00:42:49.235 --> 00:42:51.690
really turned on by this idea
that there's something in the

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:54.330
brain that seems to be weaker,
but it's actually stronger and

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:56.030
it said that it dropped the
details for a reason, because

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:57.510
it's recognizing the
higher patterns.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:58.780
And they're all excited.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.180
And somebody said, oh my God,
what do we call this?

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:01.560
This is amazing.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.780
What do we call this?

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.560
And all of a sudden,
it was just silent.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.820
Because everybody got
it at the same time.

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.746
Somebody threw up their pencil
and went, wisdom.

00:43:10.746 --> 00:43:12.840
And that's what we're after.

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:18.100
But we don't have time to wait
'til we're old to be wise.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:18.870
Thank you.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:21.350
AUDIENCE: I want to know, when
you talk about the law of

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:24.150
divine compensation and you
compare it with the law of

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:26.900
gravity, there must be some
strong conviction that you

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:32.120
have that that's a real law that
has some basis for its

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.970
functioning and you have
convinced yourself that that

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:37.870
really exists and
may perhaps some

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:39.990
mechanism by which it works.

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:45.000
So I wonder if you could give us
some of that insight which

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.030
you believe that this is a
true law that can be--

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:51.900
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON: The only
arbiter of that conviction is

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.860
experience.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.790
And I can't give that to you.

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:58.840
So I would say to you, for
instance, why don't you try it

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.310
some time, just in case.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:04.090
Now conviction is a
force multiplier.

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:06.960
So a lot of people, for
instance, there might be some

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.700
people in this room who, let's
say, have been through

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.920
recovery, the 12 steps of
Alcoholics Anonymous.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.170
There are many times--

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.920
I always say, in my work,
people don't come to me

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.570
because things are going well.

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:24.030
Oftentimes, when things are
going well in people's lives,

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:26.520
they listen to people like me
and think we're a bunch of woo

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.940
woo crazy people.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:31.540
But then they get diagnosed with
cancer, or their child is

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:36.320
on heroin, or their wife goes
through rehab, or they get

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.120
divorced, or whatever.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:41.560
And there's something that
happens when we're like on our

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:45.140
knees, and we're willing to hear
things that maybe we were

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.450
not interested in
hearing before.

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:52.320
And then we recognize, because
it cannot not happen, whether

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.530
it's the course in miracles
or 12 steps of Alcoholics

00:44:56.530 --> 00:45:00.930
Anonymous, these steps cannot
not work, any more than when

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:01.660
you go to the gym.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:02.960
I mean, if you do it,
it's going to work.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.910
If I do enough leg lifts, my
thighs are going to change.

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:06.600
It's going to not not work.

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:09.560
You don't say that I have
such faith in the gym.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.120
I just know how it works.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.490
If you go through enough in your
own life where you feel

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:18.980
you really messed up, and you
tried to be a better person,

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:21.660
you tried to clean things up,
you tried to be more loving,

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:25.270
you took responsibility for
your life, you made amends

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:27.180
where you needed to, you
apologized for it, you try to

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.730
be more integrous, you try to
be more responsible, you try

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:34.270
to be more reliable,
your life changes.

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:38.650
And then it's not just that you
believe it, it's that you

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:40.190
experience it.

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:42.410
Belief doesn't mean anything.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:44.640
There are people who say they
believe in God and kill people

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.500
in the name of God.

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.720
And there are people who don't
even believe in God, but they

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.810
love each other and they
stand on love.

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:53.005
So they're conspiring with
divinity, even if they don't

00:45:53.005 --> 00:45:54.030
yet believe in it.

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.910
It's not about belief.

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:55.710
It's about experience.

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:58.420
So where do I get
my conviction?

00:45:58.420 --> 00:45:59.670
My experience.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.690
My conviction.

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:03.520
My life.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.290
I notice that when I do my
best to practice what I

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:09.890
preach, my life really works.

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:12.490
And when I don't practice what
I preach, those are the

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:15.160
moments when I experience
chaos, disorder and

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.120
unhappiness.

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.610
So I'm pretty convinced.

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:19.948
Does that make sense?

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.760
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for all you are.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.460
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON:
Thank you.

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:27.520
AUDIENCE: And for all
the inspiration you

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.810
bring to the world.

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:31.890
And I've seen you already.

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:33.720
And so my question is
about presence.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:38.290
But the question is more about
how do you deprogram yourself

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:42.790
from fear to love, from
scarcity to abundance?

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:43.980
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON: OK.

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.650
Enlightenment, the course in
miracles as alignment, begins

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:49.570
as an abstract intellectual
construct.

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:52.210
We all know these principles
by now, love, compassion,

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:53.270
blah, blah, blah.

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:57.100
But that is so counter to the
thinking of the world.

00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.870
It's easy to sit in a room
talking about how we should

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:00.440
all love each other.

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:03.720
It's when we go out of this
room, that life is constant

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.220
temptation.

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:12.060
So the spiritual journey is the
abstraction, taking the

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.770
journey from the head
to the heart.

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:18.920
And that is what that attitude
we're honing, you're honing

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.440
new attitudinal muscles.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:24.460
And just like with the physical
gym, the repetitions,

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:28.510
the accumulated repetitions of
that which opposes gravity,

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:30.730
after a certain age, whether
it's your physical muscles or

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:32.790
your thought ones, if you're
not working on keeping them

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:34.940
up, they're headed down.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:38.680
And you accumulated repetitions,
and that's what a

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.610
serious spiritual path is.

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:42.360
And that's what meditation is.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.540
And that's what prayer is.

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.030
I'm a student of the
course in miracles.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.990
The course does not claim
to be for everybody.

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:51.690
If it's for you, you know it.

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:55.080
There is some path
for everybody.

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:58.170
There are the world's great
religions that have, they all

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:01.320
have their mystical teachings
which are at the core, so

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:05.780
separate from the organized
dogma and doctrine.

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:07.760
There are meditation paths.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.760
Every person--

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.610
there is, like I said, if you're
interested in it, it'll

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:12.400
occur to you.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.100
It'll be at somebody's house.

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.740
It'll be a book on the
floor, whatever.

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:18.190
But it does take
daily practice.

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:20.570
And I think that a very
important issue that's also

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:23.720
very similar to physical
exercise, you never get to a

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.660
point where you've done so much
physical exercise that

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.140
you look in the mirror
and go, cool, I don't

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.230
have to do that anymore.

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:33.490
On any day that you stop
doing it, the muscles

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:34.270
will head back down.

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:36.940
And the same until you're, I
guess, the level of the avatar

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.370
or the enlightened master or
something, which I'm not, so I

00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:40.270
can't know.

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:44.060
But I know at the level beneath
that, the fact that

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.720
you did it yesterday, then
maybe you ought to do it

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:50.470
today, because today will be a
whole new set of temptations.

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:53.680
And the higher you get,
the higher the study.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.440
So the way life operates, in my
experience and everybody I

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:58.720
know, is hey, you're
doing really well.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.640
God, that was really nice the
way you handled that.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:01.670
That was really great.

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:03.390
You were really dignified,
elegant, wise.

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:04.620
How's that?

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:10.470
Because it comes from left
field, you get triggered, and

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:13.690
then you go later, oh.

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:17.270
But in a real spirit journey,
the word try

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:19.160
is not a bad word.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.880
We all fall off the
spiritual wagon.

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:22.680
We say things.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.220
We do things.

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.470
Not our best moments.

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:29.070
We get up, and even that
becomes part of

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:29.890
what teaches us.

00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:32.740
Because we really want to do it
better next time, and life

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:35.360
will always give us
the opportunity.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.270
But that's where the whole idea
of atonement comes in.

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:41.760
The atonement principle is an
amazing principle that you get

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:45.610
a cosmic reset when you admit
what you've done wrong.

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:48.910
You acknowledge, you take

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:51.660
responsibility for your mistakes.

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:52.770
And then--

00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:56.410
this is where in a religious
narrative, this is where

00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:59.040
Buddha came 500 years
before Jesus.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.670
Buddha talked about action
has a reaction.

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:03.010
Every action has a reaction.

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:06.600
And then Jesus said, yes, but
in a moment of grace, the

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.290
karma is burned.

00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:13.250
So the Eastern religions are
really into the recognition

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:15.070
that every action
has a reaction.

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:17.370
Every thought creates
form at some level.

00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:19.710
Every thought determines how
you will then behave.

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:22.580
Every action will have
a consequence.

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:26.250
And that is the great gift of
the Eastern perspective.

00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:29.820
The Western perspective is, and
I can do something about

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:34.840
it if I don't like that, that
I can, that I can interrupt

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:39.840
the pattern of karma through
atonement, through recognizing

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:43.360
the mistake I made, through
asking forgiveness through

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:44.950
whatever the practice is.

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:49.740
And that's really where-- and
whole nations need atonement

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:53.630
sometimes, just like
individuals do.

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:55.510
And that's very much where
the United States is.

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:57.440
Germany really--

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.340
you have to give
it to Germany.

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.780
Germany flat out owned it.

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.310
And I say that as a Jew.

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:05.040
So Jews are very
aware of that.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:05.970
They owned it.

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:09.780
From the reparations to the
museums, to the everything.

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:10.350
They owned it.

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:12.800
And that, I think, from the
metaphysical perspective, is

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.000
one of the reasons why Germany
is doing so well today.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.320
The universe supported it.

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:20.590
The United States, for whatever
reason, takes this

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:24.050
corporate, never apologize,
never explain and never

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:24.700
apologized.

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:25.690
Terrible.

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:28.110
But whether it has to do with
our refusal to apologize for

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:31.130
slavery, our refusal to
apologize for Vietnam, our

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:36.170
refusal to apologize for Iraq,
we won't allow ourselves.

00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:39.170
As individuals we will, but the
nation has some terrible

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:43.720
karma, because of this infantile
belief that if I

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.795
accept responsibility,
I'm somehow--

00:51:45.795 --> 00:51:47.460
that that's weakness.

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:50.267
When in fact, spiritually, for
an individual and for a

00:51:50.267 --> 00:51:52.680
nation, that's strength.

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.730
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:55.840
You've come up in my life
outside of work and it's

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.780
really special to have
you here at work.

00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:59.180
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON:
Thank you so much.

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.830
AUDIENCE: I wanted to actually
ask about your experience of

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:05.620
integrating or speaking this
language in environments or

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:08.370
communities where the language
isn't spoken.

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:09.680
How do you practice that?

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:10.370
What has your experience been?

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:11.680
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON:
So much has changed

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.450
in the last 30 years.

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:17.630
I mean, when I started my
career, people would hear the

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:21.110
things I was saying and go,
oh, my God I've never even

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:21.610
heard these things.

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:23.260
I've never even thought
about these things.

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:25.716
Today people go, oh, that's
exactly what we were talking

00:52:25.716 --> 00:52:26.260
about yesterday.

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:27.360
That's so interesting.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:30.140
It has become a mainstream
conversation.

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:34.820
Now, your friends, if you
can't talk it, now

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:36.620
you're like, so--

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:39.860
and then, whether you talk about
it in spiritual terms or

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:41.810
secular terms, it's not that
difficult, because it's just

00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:42.640
about love.

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.240
It's about compassion.

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.940
So for people for whom the word
God would seem like a

00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:48.500
freak, you don't use
the word God.

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.550
God himself doesn't care.

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:51.880
It's just a word.

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.510
It's love.

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:56.000
It's the experience of our
loving each other.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.360
Like in "Les Miserables" where
it say to love another person

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.280
is to see the face of God.

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:05.700
So more and more, I find it
easier and easier, because

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:07.810
it's really hit a tipping
point in the culture.

00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:10.400
It's mainstream, which is, I
think, a very good thing.

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.470
Does that make sense?

00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:13.610
Don't you find that?

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:16.400
Sometimes we have to just
change-- if you can't drop

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.360
your jargon, then you're
not deep enough into

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.710
the inquiry, anyway.

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:23.780
AUDIENCE: I was curious, I
recently started learning

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:25.490
about Viktor Frankl
and logotherapy.

00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:28.560
And he talks about the purpose
or meaning in life.

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:33.140
So I wonder how much of that had
an experience or influence

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:34.630
on your thoughts or not?

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:36.290
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON: Very much
so, of course, as I think it's

00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:38.460
a classic in anybody's
development of this

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.700
understanding.

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:44.630
There's only one truth spoken
in many different ways.

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:46.520
And I think Viktor Frankl is
one of those people who,

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:48.610
because of his own personal
experience and his own

00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:51.740
personal suffering, has had
tremendous, obviously, moral

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.110
authority and effect
on generations.

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:57.710
And yes, he has been on mine,
as there's nothing like

00:53:57.710 --> 00:54:01.402
someone who's been there and
says this stuff works.

00:54:01.402 --> 00:54:02.290
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for coming.

00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:03.230
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON:
Thank you.

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:04.230
God bless, everybody.

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:06.330
Thank you so much
for having me.

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:07.580
Thank you.
