00:00:00.345 --> 00:00:01.185
- [Voiceover] Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.185 --> 00:00:03.706
So I'm gonna start talking
about three-dimensional curl.

00:00:03.706 --> 00:00:05.083
And to do that, I'm gonna start off

00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:07.123
by taking the two-dimensional example

00:00:07.123 --> 00:00:08.036
that I very first used

00:00:08.036 --> 00:00:09.889
when I was introducing the intuition.

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.221
You know I talked about fluid flow

00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:12.588
and I animated it here

00:00:12.588 --> 00:00:14.205
where with this particular vector field

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:16.990
you see a certain counter-clockwise
rotation on the right

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.978
and a clockwise rotation on the top.

00:00:18.978 --> 00:00:20.361
So I'm gonna take that vector field

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:22.998
which hopefully we have a
little bit of an intuition for

00:00:22.998 --> 00:00:25.639
and I'm gonna plop it into
three-dimensional space

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:27.436
on the x-y plane.

00:00:27.436 --> 00:00:29.491
So if I just take that whole vector field

00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:31.416
and I copy it onto the x-y plane

00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:32.617
here's how it looks.

00:00:32.617 --> 00:00:34.767
And the vector spacing might
be a little bit different,

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:36.608
the choice of what
subsample of points to use

00:00:36.608 --> 00:00:38.536
in displaying vectors might
be a little bit different

00:00:38.536 --> 00:00:40.124
but this is the same field,

00:00:40.124 --> 00:00:42.148
and it's actually worth writing out

00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:44.853
how it's defined in two-dimensions.

00:00:44.853 --> 00:00:47.119
This guy is a function of x and y,

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:51.503
so it's a vector field function of x and y

00:00:51.503 --> 00:00:53.387
and what it's components are.

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:57.554
Now the first component
is y cubed minus nine y

00:00:58.838 --> 00:01:03.005
and then the next one
is x cubed minus nine x.

00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:06.545
So now if I look at this guy

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:07.770
and I say let's start thinking about

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.890
the fluid rotation associated with it,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.597
because it's in three-dimensions

00:01:11.597 --> 00:01:13.599
it's natural to describe that rotation,

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:15.493
not just with a number at each point,

00:01:15.493 --> 00:01:16.956
you know with a scale or value

00:01:16.956 --> 00:01:18.677
like the two-dimensional curl gives us,

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:21.241
but instead to assign
a vector to each one.

00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:22.131
And when you do that,

00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:24.611
when you associate a
vector to each different

00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:26.682
point in space according
to the fluid rotation

00:01:26.682 --> 00:01:28.034
that would be happening there,

00:01:28.034 --> 00:01:30.347
you get something that looks like this.

00:01:30.347 --> 00:01:31.421
Now this is kind of complicated

00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:33.621
because there's two different
vector fields going on.

00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:34.603
One of them, all the vectors

00:01:34.603 --> 00:01:36.474
are perpendicular to the x-y plane.

00:01:36.474 --> 00:01:37.988
So let's just kind of
take it piece by piece

00:01:37.988 --> 00:01:39.803
and see if we can understand it.

00:01:39.803 --> 00:01:43.412
So I've got four different
circled regions here

00:01:43.412 --> 00:01:45.012
and one of them is this one on the right

00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:47.674
where there's counter-clockwise
rotation happening.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:49.605
And if you think to your right hand rule,

00:01:49.605 --> 00:01:50.438
I'm gonna go ahead and bring in

00:01:50.438 --> 00:01:52.426
the picture of the right hand rule here,

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:54.437
where you imagine curling your fingers

00:01:54.437 --> 00:01:56.675
around that direction of rotation,

00:01:56.675 --> 00:01:58.182
in the fingers of your right hand,

00:01:58.182 --> 00:01:59.666
then you stick out your thumb,

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.505
the direction your thumb is pointing

00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:03.068
would be the direction of vectors

00:02:03.068 --> 00:02:05.364
that describe that rotation.

00:02:05.364 --> 00:02:08.324
So if we do that here and if we

00:02:08.324 --> 00:02:10.209
you know, you imagine curling
your right fingers around

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.637
there and sticking up your thumb

00:02:11.637 --> 00:02:12.839
you're gonna get vectors that point

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:14.691
in the positive z-direction.

00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:16.755
So this is why in that
region you have vectors

00:02:16.755 --> 00:02:19.206
pointing up, positively
in the z-direction,

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:21.959
they're telling you that
as you view this x-y plane

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.466
from above there's
counter-clockwise rotation.

00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:27.480
But then what about at a different point?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.571
What about up here at the top

00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:30.133
where you have clockwise rotation?

00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:31.230
Now there, if you imagine

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.170
taking the fingers of your right hand

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.061
and curling them around
that direction of rotation

00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:38.019
your thumb is gonna be
pointing straight down.

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.103
It'll be kind of in the
negative z-direction,

00:02:40.103 --> 00:02:42.679
and we see that with
this vector field here.

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:44.797
Where below that circle, below that point,

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:47.567
you have vectors pointing
straight down indicating that

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:50.398
that's the direction of
rotation in that region.

00:02:50.398 --> 00:02:51.713
So if you do this at every single point

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.121
and you kind of get an understanding

00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:54.521
of what the rotation is at every point

00:02:54.521 --> 00:02:55.484
and assign a vector

00:02:55.484 --> 00:02:57.355
this is the field that you're gonna get.

00:02:57.355 --> 00:02:58.639
And let's go ahead and describe that

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.841
with an actual, with a function.

00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:03.354
Because we know how to compute
the two-D curl at this point.

00:03:03.354 --> 00:03:04.917
You see if this whole thing,

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:08.288
if we give names to the two
different component functions

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:10.788
as P and Q

00:03:11.688 --> 00:03:14.667
then the curl, the two-D curl of this guy,

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:17.583
two-D curl

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:21.073
of the vector field v

00:03:21.073 --> 00:03:23.406
has a function of x and y

00:03:24.892 --> 00:03:26.768
what it equals is the partial derivative

00:03:26.768 --> 00:03:29.582
of that second component
with respect to x.

00:03:29.582 --> 00:03:33.833
So the partial of q with respect to x

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:36.194
minus the partial derivative
of that first component

00:03:36.194 --> 00:03:37.642
with respect to y.

00:03:37.642 --> 00:03:42.387
So minus partial of p with respect to y.

00:03:42.387 --> 00:03:44.200
And what we get when we do that,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.640
the partial of q with respect to x

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.200
So we take the partial derivative of this

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.171
with respect to x,

00:03:49.171 --> 00:03:50.453
that just looks like a derivative

00:03:50.453 --> 00:03:52.278
since there's only x's in there,

00:03:52.278 --> 00:03:55.778
and you get three x squared minus nine.

00:03:57.681 --> 00:03:58.789
And I actually did this,

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:01.110
there's another video where
this is the example that I do,

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.100
when you take this second
derivative of p with respect to y,

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.681
you're taking the
derivative of this top part

00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:08.262
with respect to y

00:04:08.262 --> 00:04:12.429
and that's three y squared minus nine.

00:04:13.343 --> 00:04:14.372
And what you can do is you can say,

00:04:14.372 --> 00:04:16.218
this minus nine cancels out with that,

00:04:16.218 --> 00:04:17.720
you know minus minus nine.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.689
So these guys cancel,

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:22.621
and what you ultimately get is

00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:27.314
three x squared plus three y squared.

00:04:27.314 --> 00:04:28.946
Now what does this mean
for the vector field

00:04:28.946 --> 00:04:29.779
that we see here?

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:31.938
Because this, this is a
scale of valued quantity

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:34.270
and yet the vector field that I'm showing,

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.719
with all these blue vectors
indicating rotation,

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:38.574
these are vectors.

00:04:38.574 --> 00:04:40.537
And because the rotation is happening

00:04:40.537 --> 00:04:42.320
purely in the x-y plane,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.427
which is perpendicular to the z-axis,

00:04:44.427 --> 00:04:48.219
all of these vectors
purely have a z-component.

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:50.304
So what you might say is that the curl,

00:04:50.304 --> 00:04:51.438
and I'm not gonna say two-D curl,

00:04:51.438 --> 00:04:54.849
but actual curl of v

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.050
of v as a function of x and y

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.581
is a, it's not a scale or value,

00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:02.764
but it's a vector and it's
gonna be a vector that describes

00:05:02.764 --> 00:05:05.355
these blue ones in the pure z-direction.

00:05:05.355 --> 00:05:06.871
And since they're in the pure z-direction

00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:08.568
the x and y components are zero.

00:05:08.568 --> 00:05:12.113
But that last component is
the formula that we found

00:05:12.113 --> 00:05:15.810
that describes the magnitude of the curl.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.259
Three x squared minus three y squared,

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.909
and this, let's see kinda
running out of room,

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.098
this here you can think
of as kind of a prototype

00:05:26.098 --> 00:05:27.407
to three-dimensional curl.

00:05:27.407 --> 00:05:29.286
Because really, this vector field v,

00:05:29.286 --> 00:05:31.885
is not quite a three-dimensional
vector field is it?

00:05:31.885 --> 00:05:33.560
It only lives in the x-y plane,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.796
it only take in x and y's input points.

00:05:35.796 --> 00:05:38.272
So what we wanna do is
start extending this to say,

00:05:38.272 --> 00:05:40.287
how can you make this look
like a three-dimensional

00:05:40.287 --> 00:05:43.721
vector field and still kind
of understand the rotation

00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:46.680
as a three-dimensional vector quantity?

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.224
And that's what I'm gonna
continue doing in the next video.
