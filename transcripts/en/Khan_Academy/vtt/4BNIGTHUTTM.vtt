00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:04.132
- [Voiceover] I have here the number 324,

00:00:04.132 --> 00:00:05.298
which we can view as,

00:00:05.298 --> 00:00:06.765
since I have a three
in the hundreds place,

00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:09.360
we could say this is three hundreds,

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.097
I have a two in the tens place,

00:00:12.098 --> 00:00:15.781
so we could say, plus two tens,

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:17.569
and then I have a four in the ones place,

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:21.326
so I can say, plus four ones,

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:23.564
and if you want to think
about what that looks like,

00:00:23.564 --> 00:00:25.533
you could look at all these blocks here.

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:30.415
Three groups of 100, three
groups of 100, one, two, three,

00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:32.847
two groups of 10, two groups of 10,

00:00:32.847 --> 00:00:35.432
I have two groups of 10
right over here in yellow,

00:00:35.432 --> 00:00:37.613
four ones, I have four ones here,

00:00:37.613 --> 00:00:41.069
so this is 324 blocks.

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:45.068
So now let's get some
practice subtracting from 324,

00:00:45.068 --> 00:00:49.799
and the first thing I want
to subtract from 324 is,

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.064
let's subtract a 10.

00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:57.083
So, I want to subtract a 10 here.

00:00:57.083 --> 00:01:01.419
So a 10 is one 10 and zero ones.

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:03.797
Let me do that in the blue color.

00:01:03.798 --> 00:01:05.648
Zero ones.

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:08.548
So, I'm not subtracting any hundreds,

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.269
I AM subtracting one 10,
you see it right over there,

00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:17.133
so minus one 10, and I'm
not subtracting any ones,

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.332
so what is that going to get me?

00:01:19.332 --> 00:01:22.181
What is that going to get me?

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:24.134
Well, my hundreds don't change.

00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:25.466
I'm not subtracting any hundreds,

00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.097
so I still have three hundreds,

00:01:27.097 --> 00:01:29.131
so I could write that over here,

00:01:29.132 --> 00:01:31.202
I still have three hundreds,

00:01:31.202 --> 00:01:34.798
I had two tens, I'm
taking one of them away,

00:01:34.798 --> 00:01:37.687
so now I have two minus one is,

00:01:37.687 --> 00:01:41.652
two minus one is one 10.

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:45.082
I had two tens, now I take away one 10,

00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:48.314
I should just call that
a ten instead of a tens,

00:01:48.314 --> 00:01:52.178
I take away one 10, and
now I'm going to have

00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:56.322
plus one 10, if I had
two, I take away one,

00:01:56.322 --> 00:01:59.605
I'm now going to have
one, and I had four ones,

00:01:59.605 --> 00:02:01.154
and I'm not taking any ones away,

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:04.737
so I still have four ones,

00:02:04.737 --> 00:02:08.702
four ones minus zero ones, four ones.

00:02:08.702 --> 00:02:11.068
So I'm left with 314,

00:02:11.068 --> 00:02:14.655
three hundreds, plus
one 10, plus four ones,

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:16.237
and if you look at it
over here, what did we do?

00:02:16.237 --> 00:02:20.918
We had 324, and then we
take away one of the tens,

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:24.024
so we took away one of the
tens, and we are left with

00:02:24.024 --> 00:02:27.142
three hundred, one 10, and four ones,

00:02:27.142 --> 00:02:30.280
or 314.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.988
That was interesting.

00:02:30.988 --> 00:02:35.128
Now let's subtract 100 from 324

00:02:35.128 --> 00:02:36.912
instead of a 10,

00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:40.719
so, let's now subtract,

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:44.661
let's now subtract 100,

00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:46.300
so that's one hundred,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.126
so I'm now gonna subtract one hundred,

00:02:51.188 --> 00:02:54.147
and zero tens,

00:02:54.147 --> 00:02:57.367
and zero ones,

00:02:57.367 --> 00:02:59.712
so let's subtract that now.

00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:01.899
What's that going to be?

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:03.167
Well, I had three hundreds,

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:04.006
I take one of them away,

00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:06.050
now I'm going to have two hundreds.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.983
I had two tens, I take away no tens,

00:03:07.983 --> 00:03:10.148
I still have two tens.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:13.700
I had four ones, I take away zero ones,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.948
I'm still going to have four ones.

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:17.016
If you look at it over here,

00:03:17.016 --> 00:03:18.700
what's that going to be?

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.916
Let me write an equal sign.

00:03:20.916 --> 00:03:23.799
I had three hundreds, I take away 100,

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.107
I'm going to have two hundreds.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.034
I had two tens, I'm not
taking away any tens,

00:03:30.034 --> 00:03:32.671
so I still have two tens,

00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:35.501
and I had four ones, and I'm
not taking away any ones,

00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:37.835
so I still have four ones,

00:03:37.835 --> 00:03:39.700
and if you think about
it in this picture here,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.215
what did I just do?

00:03:41.216 --> 00:03:43.326
Well, I took away one group of 100.

00:03:43.326 --> 00:03:45.367
I took away one group of 100,

00:03:45.367 --> 00:03:48.715
so I could take away that
group of 100 right over there,

00:03:48.716 --> 00:03:50.033
and what am I left with?

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:54.466
I'm left with two hundreds, two tens,

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:57.167
that's the two tens there, and four ones.

00:03:57.167 --> 00:04:00.482
Two hundreds,

00:04:00.482 --> 00:04:02.135
let me write it this way,

00:04:02.135 --> 00:04:06.003
two hundreds, two tens, four ones,

00:04:06.003 --> 00:04:09.880
or 224.
