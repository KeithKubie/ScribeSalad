[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:14.945
- Houston, we have a problem.

00:00:14.945 --> 00:00:16.306
- Find Professor Langdon.

00:00:16.306 --> 00:00:21.103
- Either you're somebody,
or you're nobody.

00:00:21.103 --> 00:00:23.144
- So I'm going to turn
around with a great smile,

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:26.925
and walk my white ass
back across 8 mile.

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:29.300
- Trigger that alarm, and
I'll blow your head off.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.675
Stop screwing with me.

00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:34.000
- Woo, might make
your head blow off.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.880
- Was it good for you?

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.366
- I've had better.

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.554
- Awesome.

00:00:42.554 --> 00:00:44.970
- Self-sustained civilization
on Mars will be the greatest

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.200
adventure.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.615
- I mean, the stuff
has been really wild.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.565
- Ooga, booga!

00:00:53.565 --> 00:00:58.710
- If you decide to accept that,
you will seriously fly, son.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.980
- Don't forget to
thank me, baby.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.828
Don't forget to
thank your Cookie.

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.322
- What power?

00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:05.318
- This power.

00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:06.812
- Whose power?

00:01:06.812 --> 00:01:09.800
- Our power.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.756
- You're in the middle of a war.

00:01:11.756 --> 00:01:13.130
One that's been
going on forever.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.338
- What are you talking about?

00:01:14.338 --> 00:01:17.980
- You asked what would
be worth killing for.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.250
Witness the biggest
cover-up in human history.

00:01:23.178 --> 00:01:25.734
- I can't get involved in
these people's problems.

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:27.400
- I don't think they're
going to make it

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.400
if they're not together.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.880
- To help arm our
agents, so that

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.760
they have a fighting chance
against the submachine guns

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.210
of some the most
dangerous characters

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.489
in the history of
American criminality.

00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:44.976
- Stop saying that.

00:01:44.976 --> 00:01:48.968
You're not my son.

00:01:48.968 --> 00:01:52.000
- It's a bigger idea
than just the concert.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.634
We all have the same struggles.

00:01:54.634 --> 00:01:59.062
- Ladies and gentlemen,
here are the Beatles.

00:01:59.062 --> 00:02:02.506
- Thank you so much for
believing in my weirdness.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.410
- Clear eyes, full
hearts, can't lose.

00:02:15.298 --> 00:02:16.855
- How big is the universe?

00:02:16.855 --> 00:02:17.665
- Infinite.

00:02:17.665 --> 00:02:18.790
- How do you know for sure?

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.500
- I don't.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.380
I just believe it.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.080
- It's the same
with love, I guess.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.212
- Gentlemen, it's been a
privilege flying with you.

00:02:24.212 --> 00:02:25.920
- I'm saying that when
the president when

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.274
the president does it, that
means it's not illegal.

00:02:30.274 --> 00:02:33.746

[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:49.122 --> 00:02:51.106
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:57.132
SPEAKER 1: Quite a reel.

00:02:57.132 --> 00:02:57.840
Thank you, Brian.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.270
I really appreciate
you being here.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.430
Let's start from the early
days, if that's OK with you.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.320
BRIAN GRAZER: Sure.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.750
Sure.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.080
SPEAKER 1: It's good?

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.470
You grew up just on the
other side of the hill,

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.880
in the valley.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.480
And it all kind of
started, the way

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.490
you put it, with
your grandmother.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.250
This little Jewish
woman, named Sonya,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.280
who believed in you,
despite you not doing well

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.100
in school, and you kind
of struggling as a kid.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.992
Can you talk about
what she meant to you?

00:03:28.992 --> 00:03:30.450
BRIAN GRAZER: What
she meant to me?

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.180
Well, she was the single person
that would support me or give

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.000
me human, personal validation.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
But I think she spotted such
desperation in me that it was

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.350
attractive to her, in a way.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.760
Because she would always tell
me, I'm going to be special.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.372
You're going all the way.

00:03:52.372 --> 00:03:54.330
And I'm thinking, I'm
going all the way, where?

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.480
Where am I going all the way to?

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.390
Because she would look
at these report cards,

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.530
and there were
always all Ds and Fs.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.690
And so there was
really no evidence

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.255
to support what she was saying.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.400
But it was very important
to have one person that

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.930
consistently believed in me
and then isolated this one

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.470
trait that she thought I
could do, and was doing,

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.830
even though it wasn't
as refined as it

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.180
is now, which was to use
the power of curiosity

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.650
to learn interactively
with people.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.210
And then, of course,
I've taken it

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.510
to some other level, where I
have curiosity conversations

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.130
every two weeks.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.640
I have for at least 30 years,
every two weeks, faithfully.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.630
And in these curiosity
conversations,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.460
it's just science, medicine,
politics, religion, technology.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.480
I've met a lot of people
in your business, some

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.770
of the progenitors of things
that are very important,

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.353
some of the founders
of the companies,

00:05:01.353 --> 00:05:04.050
particularly yours, in fact.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.270
And so it's been
really edifying.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.720
And I've found ways, through
these curiosity conversations,

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.360
to learn different perspectives.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.976
And that's something
you don't do with AI.

00:05:19.976 --> 00:05:24.340
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, and how
you got started in film

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.912
seems very serendipitous.

00:05:25.912 --> 00:05:28.370
You were hearing these guys
literally having a conversation

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:35.320
out your window about an easy
job opening at Warner Bros.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.790
When you were a kid, you
weren't dead set on film.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.240
Did you want to
do something else?

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.130
BRIAN GRAZER: Well, I assigned
myself to do something else.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.770
But I don't know if I wanted to.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.980
I was going to law school.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.230
I went to USC, and
then I was going

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.880
to go to USC law school,
which I got accepted to.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.620
But I didn't really think
that I'd pass the bar.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.977
So I didn't think I'd pass
the bar, if I broke it down,

00:06:03.977 --> 00:06:05.560
even making it through
the first year.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.900
But I thought, well,
this is a direction.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.340
It's a choice.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.640
So I'll take this choice.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.320
But it was within the
first week of the summer,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.020
I overheard in my
apartment complex--

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.930
actually very close to
here-- on Ocean Avenue.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:23.620
What was it?

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.453
Ocean Avenue, it was
right across the street

00:06:25.453 --> 00:06:26.950
from this little
elementary school.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.220
But Ocean and like
5th or something.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.900
And I overhear these two
guys going, oh, my God.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.610
This was the easiest job.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.460
It was so cushy.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.190
I thought, cushy?

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.540
It really grabbed me.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.880
I had never heard
the word cushy.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.440
The guy said, yeah,
I had a company car.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.840
Really, at 40 hours
a week I'd get paid,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.150
but there really
wasn't much to do.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.210
And then, I'm listening
in even closer.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.800
And I pull the drapes closed
in my little apartment

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.170
and open the window further,
so I could make sure

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.970
that I really was
listening and could

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.390
hear what they were saying.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.140
They said, oh yeah,
it was at Warner Bros.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.710
From someone named
Peter Connect.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.420
Peter Connect was--
I didn't know--

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.700
the head of Warner
Bros. legal department.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.310
So the conversation ends.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.010
And I just immediately
dial 4-1-1.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.170
I get a hold of the
number of Warner Bros.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.860
Pictures.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.990
I ask for Peter Connect.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.230
And I said, I understand
that you might

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.210
need a law clerk this summer.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.660
And can I please come in
and interview for the job?

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.261
Of course, he did,
because I just heard it.

00:07:38.261 --> 00:07:39.760
So now, all of a
sudden, I'm meeting

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.340
with Peter Connect at 3
o'clock and getting the job

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.010
to work at Warner
Brothers like at 3:15.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.690
So now, I had a job.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.840
And it happened to be in
alignment with the path

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.340
of going to law school.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.960
And really, what the job was,
it was kind of a bullshit job.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.615
Those guys were right.

00:07:58.615 --> 00:08:00.490
It was kind of a bullshit
job, where you just

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.360
sat in a little, teeny
office, about like this big.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.600
And it was with no
windows, a little desk,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.560
and you'd wait to either
file papers or deliver papers

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.840
to somebody for Warner Bros.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.120
So a couple of weeks go in,
I do have a company car,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.090
all that stuff.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.890
All those things were true
about how cushy it was.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:27.900
And I have to deliver papers
to, ironically, Warren Beatty.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.559
Warren Beatty was huge.

00:08:29.559 --> 00:08:30.850
You know, this was a while ago.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.809
He was a gigantic movie
star, like as big a movie

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.190
star as you could get.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.220
But he was also a star,
and he was a writer,

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.150
and he was a director.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.580
And I think he'd already done
shampoo, if I'm not wrong.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.240
And I didn't even have
to deliver these papers.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.730
He lives at the
Beverly Wilshire Hotel.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.830
So I go to the Beverly
Wilshire Hotel,

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.210
and I'm waiting at the desk.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.670
And one of his assistants
comes down and says,

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.510
hand me the papers, kid.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:01.370
And so I just think
to say, well, I

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:02.640
can't hand you the papers.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.520
I have to hand them
directly to Mr. Beatty.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.800
And the guy goes--

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.580
like a version of
you're full of shit--

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.750
just hand me the papers.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.740
I said, these papers are invalid
unless I hand them directly

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.510
to Mr. Beatty.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.520
And I said it with
enough conviction

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.711
and repeatedly
that they said, OK.

00:09:23.711 --> 00:09:24.210
OK.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.480
And so then I'm intercepted
by another assistant,

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.370
like the higher level assistant.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.150
I say the same thing
and persuade him.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.880
He said, OK.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.010
Just hand him the papers,
and then you leave.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.490
I go up there, and the
minute I hand him the papers,

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.620
I generate a connection.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.830
And I turn that little moment
into an hour conversation

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:48.390
with Warren Beatty, which was
really, really informational.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.420
It was amazing.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.970
And I just got a lot out of it.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.080
And also, I got confidence from
doing it, for having him say,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.895
yes.

00:09:58.895 --> 00:10:01.230
SPEAKER 1: How did you have
that kind of healthy sense

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.710
of entitlement or chutzpah--

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.907
you know, you're
23-year-old legal clerk--

00:10:06.907 --> 00:10:08.490
to be in the presence
of Warren Beatty

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.258
and have his ear for an hour?

00:10:12.258 --> 00:10:17.497
BRIAN GRAZER: Well,
how did I get that?

00:10:17.497 --> 00:10:18.955
Well, I got it from
my grandmother.

00:10:18.955 --> 00:10:20.470
My grandmother
helped that a lot.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.970
Chutzpah.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:28.000
I think I've always been into
disrupting my comfort zone.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.450
And I do it professionally.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.950
And it's really an additive.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.780
I know that you guys
had Simon Sinek.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.660
He did a Google
Talk for you guys.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:44.150
He has two of the top five
TED Talks in the world.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.860
And one of them is on the why--

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.500
why you do what you do.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:54.310
Now, he diagnosed me, because
I got to be friends with him.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.567
And he said my why was--

00:10:56.567 --> 00:10:58.900
because he asked me-- what
was the most important moment

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:03.340
in your childhood
school-life experience?

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.390
And I explain it.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.400
Then he connects all these dots.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.310
And at the very end, he goes--

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:12.010
and I've known him now
a couple of years--

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:17.640
I think you think your why is
curiosity, but that's your how.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.610
Your why is you hate
bullies, which I just

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.230
learned like two weeks ago,
which really came together

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.730
for me.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.540
Because I really
do hate bullies.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.420
And so I think that
was part of it.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:36.310
Whether it's a bully or
just a man in general,

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.680
I wouldn't say I'm
defiant against it.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.230
I'm just cool with it.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.410
I'm cool with going
up against it.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.745
I'm very happy
being the underdog.

00:11:45.745 --> 00:11:52.980
In fact, I'm not happy
being beyond that, actually.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.070
And that's why I probably have
made and produced, I think,

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:01.180
100 movies and seven or eight
really important television

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:01.810
shows.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.550
And they're all startups.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.410
And I think I like startups.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:10.330
I like having an idea,
building it out of zero,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:15.340
and then case building it to
the point that it has value.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:22.370
And once I do that to the point
that that gas becomes a solid,

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:26.022
then I like to start
on another one.

00:12:26.022 --> 00:12:26.980
That was a long answer.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.484
SPEAKER 1: That
was a great answer.

00:12:28.484 --> 00:12:30.400
Warren Beatty was just
the tip of the iceberg.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.334
You spoke to Lew
Wasserman and Mel Brooks.

00:12:33.334 --> 00:12:34.250
Am I right about that?

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.041
BRIAN GRAZER: Yeah.

00:12:35.041 --> 00:12:37.427
SPEAKER 1: And it seems
like you kind of understood.

00:12:37.427 --> 00:12:39.010
You had this fundamental
understanding

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.400
that your career was going to
be made on relationships and not

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.960
on a direct rise
through the meritocracy.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.200
How did you have that
understanding so young?

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.230
BRIAN GRAZER: Well, OK.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.530
That's cool.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.420
Well, just one differentiation--

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.350
look, relationships are
extremely important.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.080
But I think insight
is more important.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.560
And what I gained out
of these conversations

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.830
that I'd have with Warren
Beatty or you know-- what I did

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.815
is I quit going to law school.

00:13:15.815 --> 00:13:17.190
Let's see if we
can capture this.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.440
But I quit going to
law school, because I

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.550
saw that this was a method that
would be pretty awesome for me.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:26.600
And I say to my
boss, Peter Connect,

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.470
I'm just going to stay here.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.470
But I did happen to
notice way down the hall

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.990
there was that vacant office.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.230
This office was
twice as big as his.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:41.100
But he didn't care, because
he started with Jack Warner

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.480
like a zillion years ago.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.130
And so he just goes,
I'll get it for you.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:50.100
He gets me this giant office,
the size of this room.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.220
But really, with two
union secretaries there.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.390
So now, I have this
amazing, big office.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:01.050
And I can use this for
the Brian Grazer business,

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:04.360
even though I'm working there
and still making my $5 an hour.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.010
So once I got this big
office, and I extended

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:11.340
for an additional year,
then every single day,

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.380
whether I was delivering
papers or not,

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.630
I was using a similar speech.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.670
I'd say, hi, my name
is Brian Grazer.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.560
I work at Warner Bros.
business affairs.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.170
I kind of fudged
that a little bit.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.170
And I know everything
about your boss.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.450
I would love to have a
conversation with them.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.160
It will last only five minutes.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.130
And I absolutely
do not want a job.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.100
So I do that every single
day, so that every single day,

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.830
I could meet someone
that was really

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.200
making a difference in the
entertainment business.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.400
It could be
television or movies.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.825
So it wasn't that I counted
on the relationship.

00:14:45.825 --> 00:14:49.320
It was more about a
demystification of how

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.470
this whole system worked.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.500
Ultimately, what I was able
to learn, even very young,

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.430
was how leverage
got created and used

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:05.190
as a tool in our in
entertainment business.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:09.480
So I kind of stayed, doing that
for about a year and a half.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.940
And just before I got
the boot, because I

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.750
kept using their Warner
Bros. assets for me,

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.870
I got this one
big meeting with--

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.570
who I really wanted to
meet was Lew Wasserman.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:26.110
Lew Wasserman was like the Don
of the modern entertainment

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:26.610
business.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:31.630
The most powerful, mythic man
in the entertainment business,

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:37.650
he was really the
founder of MCA Universal.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:43.920
And literally, everything in
the entertainment business

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.180
revolved around Lew Wasserman.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.850
So I find a way to
meet Lew Wasserman.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.510
And I'm already sort
of trying to have

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.337
a conversation with him.

00:15:53.337 --> 00:15:55.170
And he sort of puts his
hands up in the air.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.503
And he says, just wait a second.

00:15:56.503 --> 00:15:58.181
You're not coming
into my office.

00:15:58.181 --> 00:15:59.680
And I thought, well,
like everybody,

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.846
I was going into his office.

00:16:00.846 --> 00:16:02.130
But no go.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:06.550
So he comes back with a
legal tab and a pencil.

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.550
And he said, take these.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:09.900
So I take them.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.660
And he says put the
pencil to the paper,

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:16.320
and it has greater value than
it did as separate parts.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.200
Now, get out of here, which
was kind of embarrassing.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.910
But what I realized was he was
saying that you don't really

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:26.070
have anything.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:30.380
You might have a gift to
get into people's office

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.970
and to turn and
create a conversation,

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.710
but you don't own anything.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.960
So I realized I better put
the pencil to the paper

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.950
and start writing ideas.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:42.930
And I kind of industrialized
the idea of business.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:46.080
And I would, every
day, have many ideas

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.030
and send them registered
mail to myself.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:50.890
And I ended up with a
box of hundreds of ideas,

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.704
including the one
called Splash--

00:16:53.704 --> 00:16:55.620
that was a man falling
in love with a mermaid,

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.530
starring Tom Hanks--
and many others.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:06.839
But I realized that unless you
can codify or write original

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.660
ideas and prove that
they are valuable--

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.020
you have to make them valuable--

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.240
you don't have anything.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.349
SPEAKER 1: I want to talk about
idea generation for a second.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:20.430
I imagine curiosity
conversations probably

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:21.900
play into different ideas.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.566
And you've talked
about how they've even

00:17:23.566 --> 00:17:24.869
turned into movies.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.670
Do you have any other
kind of processes

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:31.960
to help spur creativity
and come up with ideas?

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.820
BRIAN GRAZER: Do I have other
ways to spur creativity?

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.260
Well, I read.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:44.010
But I don't really read fiction.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:49.230
I mean, the first 15 years
of my being a producer,

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.060
I just did comedies.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.890
Comedies are fiction.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.450
Well, I don't know.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.730
Whatever you think they are.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.290
They're kind of a combination.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.580
I like the curiosity
conversations,

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:13.580
because I just know that
knowing your inner truth--

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.760
whatever that is-- and really
diagnosing what that is--

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.590
so you're not
bullshitting yourself--

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:23.300
I know the inner truth that once
you start to understand that

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:29.810
and it's schematic, that
is a way to build ideas.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:33.140
The movie "Friday Night
Lights" was about me.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.150
It was really just
because I got cut

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.140
in a very humiliating way
from high school football,

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.110
from Coach Ogawa.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.660
He cut me in front
of like 250 kids.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:47.870
And the pain of
that was so awesome.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.970
I mean, it was so
memorable to me

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.490
that I was able to sort of
think it through and go--

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:57.549
when he pointed to Richard
Cox, over there, and he said

00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:58.340
he was quarterback.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.423
And he said to Perry
Shellmyer, you're nose guard.

00:19:00.423 --> 00:19:03.800
And he said to Brian
Grazer, your status?

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.330
And I said, tailback.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.330
He said, incorrect.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.570
Cut.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.310
I was no longer a human
being in that moment.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:15.126
And I was able to
sort of catalog that

00:19:15.126 --> 00:19:16.250
and many other experiences.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.730
But that one in
particular, I realized

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:24.340
that that lived inside this book
called "Friday Night Lights."

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.000
Because anything you read
has multiple interpretations,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.326
right?

00:19:29.326 --> 00:19:31.950
SPEAKER 1: I want to skip ahead,
chronologically, a little bit.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.540
You're in the '80s.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.460
You're working at Paramount.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.509
And you want to meet Ron Howard.

00:19:39.509 --> 00:19:41.050
He had done "The
Andy Griffith Show."

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.130
He'd done "Happy Days."

00:19:45.121 --> 00:19:47.620
It almost seems like you knew
you wanted to partner with him

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.080
before you met him.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.810
What about him made you
say, this is the guy.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:56.545
This is the guy I want to work
with for the rest of my life.

00:19:56.545 --> 00:19:57.970
BRIAN GRAZER: Well, I didn't.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.500
I actually didn't know.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:03.430
I just had this quota of
meeting a new person every day.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.640
So I saw Ron Howard
out of my office.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.560
And I yelled out
at him like, hey!

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.360
You know, like that.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.590
And he didn't know who I was.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:12.460
And I scared him.

00:20:14.894 --> 00:20:17.310
Then I called his office and
said, I got to meet with you.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.220
I found a way.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.040
Because you can get in,
if you really work at it.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.860
If you're resourceful,
and polite,

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.650
you can get people
to meet with you.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.640
But then, when he
walked into my office,

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.150
he had this sort of
aura of goodness.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:36.350
Or it was perceptible to
me that, energetically, he

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:40.110
had goodness about him.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:43.170
I'm sure you guys feel
stuff like that, right?

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:47.100
You know, you feel like
that person's a bad vibe.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.120
I don't think I want
to be around that.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.650
So it's a very
important metric to me,

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:56.790
how I feel, energetically,
towards somebody.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.780
Because I can think about it.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:03.800
You feel it, that truth,
and then I often just

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.950
think, how will this end?

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:10.170
And if you build
that out, and you

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:14.715
feel like, I think this will end
bad, then you shouldn't start.

00:21:14.715 --> 00:21:21.210
But with Ron, I felt like he
just had this aura of goodness

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.250
about him.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.530
It was kind of biblical for me.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:28.140
Of course, I was looking
for that, probably.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.210
I didn't know he
could actually direct.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.100
I had no idea he could direct.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.380
I just liked him
and thought I should

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.425
support a guy that seemed good.

00:21:37.425 --> 00:21:39.030
SPEAKER 1: Seemed
like it worked out.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:39.905
BRIAN GRAZER: It did.

00:21:39.905 --> 00:21:42.355
It worked out.

00:21:42.355 --> 00:21:45.210
SPEAKER 1: Can you
give us a story

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.480
of the making of a movie that
seemed very unlikely that it

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.650
would be made at the start,
and you kind of willed it

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:54.409
into fruition?

00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:55.950
BRIAN GRAZER: I've
had a lot of them.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.110
The first one was "Splash."

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:02.400
Because I had hundreds of
rejections over the course of

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.120
like five years.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.350
Just every person
rejected it, repeatedly--

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:11.070
every studio, every buyer--

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:20.630
which caused me to get tough
and become durable, that way.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:27.834
And I think what I
learned was "Splash,"

00:22:27.834 --> 00:22:29.500
even though it was a
man falling in love

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:35.260
with a mermaid, its inner
theme, its interior theme

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.820
was about love.

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:40.630
And I realized in retrospect
that people, through the script

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:44.920
or through my pitch,
couldn't see that.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.780
Or they just didn't like it.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:47.470
I don't know.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.290
But I think if you
can pitch a theme--

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:55.360
if you have a story, but
you know the interior theme,

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.080
and you case build
to sell your theme,

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.690
themes are often irrefutable.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.337
But I just didn't
know that, then.

00:23:06.337 --> 00:23:08.211
So I had hundreds and
hundreds of rejections.

00:23:08.211 --> 00:23:09.260
I finally got it made.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.390
It was brutal.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.770
And then, the movie that
models this best for me

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.614
was this movie called
"American Gangster."

00:23:19.614 --> 00:23:21.030
I don't know if
you ever saw that,

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:22.970
with Russell Crowe
and Denzel Washington.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:29.890
But it was many, many
years later after splash.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.900
And the studio decided
they were going

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.250
to fire the director,
just months before we

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:37.720
were starting to shoot.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.060
And we already had Russell
Crowe in the movie.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.010
Sorry, Denzel
Washington in the movie.

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.720
We didn't have Russell Crowe.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.470
We had a director.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:47.050
We'd already spent $32 million.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.950
But they just felt like
this director scares them.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:52.435
They've thought about it a lot.

00:23:52.435 --> 00:23:54.740
He scares them.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.770
It's going to be a bigger
loss if they actually

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:57.580
make the movie.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.890
They'd rather just
write down $32 million.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.447
And that's really
a lot of money.

00:24:03.447 --> 00:24:04.780
Even today, it's a lot of money.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.400
But then, it was crazy.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:10.070
That was like 12 years ago.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.950
That's how scared
they were of this guy.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.630
And anyways, I was able to
immediately recontextualize

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:20.200
it and get better actors
and a much better director.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:26.130
So I forced them, after
they took the write down,

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:30.060
to talk to me again about
"American Gangster," which

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.330
they didn't want to do.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:32.871
They said, we'll
take the write down,

00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:36.850
but don't ever say American
or gangster to us, ever again.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:40.787
SPEAKER 1: I love the story
of how you got "8 Mile" made.

00:24:40.787 --> 00:24:42.370
Can you talk about
that a little bit--

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:47.520
how you met Eminem and slowly
convinced him to do it?

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.735
BRIAN GRAZER: Well, yeah.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.940
Very quickly, you said,
how do I get ideas?

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.172
I get ideas just by--

00:25:02.172 --> 00:25:04.710
it sounds so simple--

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:08.040
trying to be as
present as possible.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.980
So I happened to be in
a taxicab in New York.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.080
And as the guy's weaving
around and everything,

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.640
I'm listening to this
faint conversation going on

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.260
in the taxicab, on the radio--

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:24.000
a local Manhattan radio.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.620
And ODB, Old Dirty Bastard,
is being interviewed

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.360
by some talk show guy.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.090
And you can't even
understand him.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:33.930
He barely makes any sense.

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:35.990
It's just hard to
really understand him.

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:38.430
But I thought,
what kind of a guy

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.700
wants to be called
Old Dirty Bastard?

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.680
I mean, that was his
choice to be called that.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.680
I thought, that's an
interesting choice.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.460
So I think, I better
go meet this ODB.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.160
So this is like 25
or 23 years ago.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.660
So I go meet ODB,
and he was a trip.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.310
He wouldn't let me
into his studio.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.495
And everything was a
cost a la carte thing.

00:26:01.495 --> 00:26:03.870
If you want to go in the
studio, it's going to cost this.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:05.290
If you want to do that--

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:06.240
so I just think, wow.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.740
This guy's so interesting.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:12.840
He's funny and also kind
of scary at the same time.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.790
So after I met
ODB, then I thought

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.510
I'd meet this character,
Slick Rick, that

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:17.990
wears a patch on his eye.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.060
He's a rapper.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.020
He's really kind of a
comical British dude.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:23.880
And then I go through
the series of Chuck D,

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.090
et cetera, et cetera.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.048
And I'm thinking, wow,
this is like a movement.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.950
East Coast hip hop
is like a movement.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:32.880
It can be funny.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.100
It could be the voice
of the inner city.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.780
It's a lot of things.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.000
SPEAKER 1: Did you listen
to a lot of '90s hip hop

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.106
at the time?

00:26:41.106 --> 00:26:43.050
BRIAN GRAZER: Not really.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:44.802
No.

00:26:44.802 --> 00:26:46.260
No, that isn't what
got me into it.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.400
No, I didn't listen to 90s
hip hop before I met ODB.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.030
It was just a funny name
and a guy wanting to go,

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.150
you call me ODB.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:58.080
Being insistent upon it, that
made me want to go see him.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.960
I didn't know about
the Wu-tang Clan.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:06.190
And so then, no, I didn't
know anything about it.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:10.380
And then, because I was still
doing curiosity conversations--

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.635
I had started them--

00:27:11.635 --> 00:27:14.010
I met with Frank Rich, who
was the editor of the New York

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:14.400
Times.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.691
He was a very, very shishi guy.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.020
We were talking about something
very high faluting, probably

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.020
Broadway musicals and stuff,
which he's quite an expert at.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.810
And I say something about
hip hop, and he goes, oh.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.090
He treated it as an
inferior subculture,

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:31.880
like it was less than.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.560
And I thought, I don't
think it's less than.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.490
I think this is the culture,
not a subculture, much

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.710
less an inferior subculture.

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:44.340
And I kind of thought I'd build
a story to prove him wrong.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.830
And that's where it
sort of came about.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:47.904
Then I found a way.

00:27:47.904 --> 00:27:49.320
I didn't know who
should be in it.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.240
I've spent years trying
to figure it out.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.080
I tried to get
Spike Lee to do it.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.560
And he was cool, but no go.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.880
And then I was just watching
the VMAs, and I see the camera.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.130
This is like seven or eight
years after the Frank Rich

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.620
conversation, or seven
years, and the camera

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.080
comes across the audience.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.250
And it's on Eminem, on his face.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.040
And I didn't know who he was.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.596
But he had this sort
of icy, steel glare.

00:28:13.596 --> 00:28:14.970
Then, all of a
sudden, he started

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.430
laughing or being really fluid.

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.030
And I thought, wow, what a
lot of range that dude has.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.930
He could be that, then that.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.910
So then, I wanted to meet him.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:28.910
Then I met Eminem,
and Dre came with him.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:32.790
And it was just very controlled.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.050
I tried to talk to him,
but he wouldn't look at me.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:39.620
So if I'm looking at him
like this, he was there.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:40.290
Sorry.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.162
He just wouldn't look at me.

00:28:42.162 --> 00:28:44.370
We're at each other, but he
would look the other way,

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:47.130
out my window.

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:51.590
And then, after
about 30 minutes--

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:55.010
I keep trying to get him
to talk-- he goes, I'm out.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.560
I'm thinking, you can't be out.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.650
You didn't say one thing.

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:03.290
And they go, he's out.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:05.900
I go, wait a minute.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.237
I said, come on.

00:29:08.237 --> 00:29:09.320
I mean, you could animate.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.236
You can say something.

00:29:10.236 --> 00:29:14.090
And I think I made
him mad or something.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:19.070
And he came back, kind of
pissed at me, but then talked.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.500
And then he told
this whole story that

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:27.230
later became what "8 Mile" was.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:28.711
So that was it.

00:29:28.711 --> 00:29:29.960
That was the Eminem of it all.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.770
SPEAKER 1: I love that story.

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:31.978
BRIAN GRAZER: And I love him.

00:29:31.978 --> 00:29:33.650
He's a really
super professional.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:36.279
I mean, he's an
amazing, gifted person.

00:29:36.279 --> 00:29:38.320
SPEAKER 1: You said
something really interesting,

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.430
earlier, which is you kind of
started to understand leverage

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:43.570
and the laws of leverage.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.850
And you used Warner
Bros., initially,

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.610
as a platform to meet all
these interesting people.

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:50.200
Can you kind of unpack that?

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.960
Because as a producer, you
probably use leverage a lot.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.950
You're almost like an
entrepreneur for movies.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:01.051
Can you unpack just the idea
of leverage and using that?

00:30:01.051 --> 00:30:02.400
BRIAN GRAZER: Well, OK.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.930
Sure, I think I can.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:12.690
You have to have an idea.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.680
This is so much like a startup.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:19.710
The idea that you have, or
one that one would have,

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:22.920
doesn't have to be
what you end up doing.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.890
It can just continue to change
form, change form, change form,

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:27.395
and change form.

00:30:27.395 --> 00:30:29.020
There are two things
that are relevant.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:34.050
One is to have the
spark of an idea,

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:36.577
so you have something
to say to somebody.

00:30:36.577 --> 00:30:38.910
If you have nothing to say
to somebody, other than like,

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:40.920
hey, what are you doing--

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.890
I always feel like you have
to start with something.

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.630
That's like the gift
of the conversation.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:50.520
If you have nothing to say,
even if you're super smart,

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.380
but nothing to say--

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.230
it doesn't go anywhere.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.450
You can't build
nothing into something.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.539
You have to build the germ
of something into something.

00:31:01.539 --> 00:31:04.080
SPEAKER 1: And you've said that
when you reach out to people,

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.570
it can't be a generic
insight into them, as well.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.640
It has to be something
kind of unique to you,

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.600
that you've recognized.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.060
BRIAN GRAZER: Yeah, in these
conversations that I have,

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.680
it can't be Google-able.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.850
If it's Google-able,
just Google it.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:21.390
You have to ask a question
or have an insight or a gift.

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:22.740
I remember when I met Dre.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.520
One of the first
times, I asked him

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:33.980
if he'd heard the musical
composition to Ernest Gold's

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.030
composition of Exodus.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.730
I think it was like 1979.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:40.090
It was really, really beautiful.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:42.140
And I brought it up
not to be a wiseguy.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.740
But I brought it up, because
when his music really

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.280
clicks or is on fire,
it's very melodic.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.690
It's beautiful.

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:52.670
So he's got rap.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:54.320
You know what it is.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.430
He has a unique component,
that some of his songs,

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:00.980
when they really work,
they have beauty to them.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:01.880
And they are melodic.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.760
And I thought he would
really gain by hearing this.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:05.870
He would dig it.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:08.790
It's just like listening to
Hans Zimmer, or James Horn,

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:09.350
or something.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:14.090
But this was a signature piece
that really stuck with me.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:20.330
And he appreciated it, because
I had something to say.

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:27.610
Or just recently, I was at
your Google Sicily camp.

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:29.500
I get invited to go to
that, and I love it.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.650
It's so amazing.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:32.050
It's a privilege.

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:36.940
And last year, you guys
had Kevin Durant show.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.280
And he was one of the speakers.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:44.680
And I just know basketball
mostly through my kids.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.350
Because these two
boys love basketball.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:48.820
So they know who
Kevin Durant is.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:52.480
But I barely know
who Kevin Durant is.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:58.030
And he goes on
this friend's boat.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:59.400
So we're now in Google Sicily.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.560
We've done the
conference for the day.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:02.705
Now, we go to the boat.

00:33:02.705 --> 00:33:03.330
There's a boat.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:04.579
A friend of mine's got a boat.

00:33:04.579 --> 00:33:05.730
He's on the boat.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.500
Kevin Durant shows up.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.890
And when he leaves,
he says, hey.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:14.160
I'd love to connect with
you when we get back.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.230
And I'll be coming to LA.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:18.450
I'm thinking, OK,
here's my number.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:21.310
But I didn't think
he'd really follow up,

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:24.350
because what are the chances?

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:25.860
But he does follow up.

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.359
It's like weeks and weeks later.

00:33:28.359 --> 00:33:30.400
He says, you want to get
together and have lunch?

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.858
And I'm at the
Beverly Hills Hotel.

00:33:31.858 --> 00:33:34.020
We're playing the Clippers.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.700
Sure, so we have lunch.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:41.410
And I'm inventing stuff
to talk about, nervously.

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.420
And I do say, you
know, what I'd love

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.250
to do is like do
"Friday Night Lights,"

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.179
but in the world of basketball.

00:33:48.179 --> 00:33:50.470
And he goes, oh, you know,
I grew up a little that way.

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:53.320
And he starts talking
about growing up in

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.340
and playing basketball
in a rec center.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:59.470
It was this kind of very,
very, very lower-class rec

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.720
center outside of Maryland.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.580
And then he described it very
quickly, which blew my mind.

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.540
He goes, yeah, we'd
play basketball.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.489
And right next door, we shared
a wall with an old-age home.

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:11.645
And I thought, well,
that's pretty colorful.

00:34:11.645 --> 00:34:13.270
I could see that,
because I always like

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:15.580
to know what things look like.

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.570
Always, always, always.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.598
I won't hire a director, no
matter how smart or good--

00:34:19.598 --> 00:34:21.139
I have to go, what
does it look like?

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:23.780
And then, they
describe the shot.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.159
If the shot is whack, then
I just don't even do it.

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:31.270
Like if you're doing a comedy
and a director gives you

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.219
a wide shot, you know you're
talking with the wrong guy.

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:36.310
Because comedy is
a close-up medium.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:37.540
So there's a lot of rules.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.840
And you can not trick
people, but make

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:45.520
them feel comfortable to
tell you their true impulse.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.850
Because their true impulse
is what they'll do.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:51.040
A lot of people think,
oh, I'll talk him into it.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.070
Or I'll negotiate my
point of view upon them.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:57.130
Artists-- and it might
be true by engineers.

00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:02.200
I don't know, but
artists do what

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.960
they say in the
first few minutes,

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.540
not what you tell them to.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.630
So I met with Kevin,
did this thing,

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.720
and now, we're doing
a television show.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.762
We're doing the "Friday
Night Lights" version

00:35:16.762 --> 00:35:17.470
called "Swagger."

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:21.330
It's like the version
of basketball.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:23.562
SPEAKER 1: That's very exciting.

00:35:23.562 --> 00:35:26.565
BRIAN GRAZER: That's just sort
of starting from scratch, also.

00:35:26.565 --> 00:35:29.170
SPEAKER 1: Do you have a
recent curiosity conversation?

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.320
You've been doing
these for two weeks.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.200
Sorry, every two weeks,
rather, for a long, long time.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.820
Do you have a recent one
that really affected you

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:40.290
and that you really
just enjoyed?

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.200
BRIAN GRAZER: I have.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.990
I have one I can't
talk about very much.

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:46.240
I just went to Saudi Arabia
to do it, actually, last week.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.100
SPEAKER 1: That's crazy.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.760
BRIAN GRAZER: So not a lot
of people have been to Saudi.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.760
I haven't been to Saudi.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.800
And we think of Saudi
as a certain thing.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.670
The beauty of these
curiosity conversations--

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:59.860
I've done at least 1,000
of them over the 30

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:03.420
years-- is that every
preconception that I have

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.680
has been wrong.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:10.390
I have a 100% track record of
being wrong every single time.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:12.572
Because whatever
you think it is,

00:36:12.572 --> 00:36:14.530
wherever you think that
meeting is going to be,

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:17.290
or the party-- oh, that's
going to be a bummer.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:18.790
It turns out to be great.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:20.620
The person I hate
is going to vibe me.

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:21.850
He's not even there.

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.650
I mean, everything
is always wrong.

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:29.390
And so with Saudi, my
preconceptions were very wrong.

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:35.039
Now, some of the things in Saudi
that you do know are factual.

00:36:35.039 --> 00:36:36.580
You know there's
the rights to women,

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.800
and decapitation,
and things like that.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:43.030
But that's also on
a curve of changing.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:47.690
That was super heavy,
going there and doing that.

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:50.140
SPEAKER 1: Most people
think of eye contact

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:54.040
as just normal kind of
etiquette in conversation.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.140
Why is that so important to you?

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.852
You're writing a
new book about it.

00:36:57.852 --> 00:36:58.810
BRIAN GRAZER: Oh, yeah.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:01.030
So I wrote a book.

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:04.160
I wrote this book, right
here, "A Curious Mind."

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.270
And "A Curious
Mind" was really--

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:11.170
I was just going to write
notes on all my conversations

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.060
that I've had over the 30 years.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.650
I had notes of the last 20.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:16.340
But the first 10, I didn't.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.490
And I thought, I better
do this while I still

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:21.640
have some motor skills.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.620
And then somebody said,
well, you should just

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.460
do it as a book.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:26.800
And then I thought
that was an ego trip.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.110
And then someone
said, well, Graze--

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:30.910
some people call me Graze.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.190
And then they go,
it's not an ego trip.

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:36.670
Everyone knows you
don't know anything.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:39.100
I thought it would be
like one of those memoirs

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:43.340
where you're telling people how
to live your life or whatever,

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.490
blah, blah, blah.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:47.260
Anyway, I did write this book.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:52.040
And what it is, is it's
sort of two verticals.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:57.950
One is like the
definition of curiosity

00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:00.230
as a force and a super power.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:05.990
And it is a synthesis of many
of these conversations I had.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:08.450
And then that
synthesis intersects

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:12.190
with narrative storytelling.

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:14.567
Like one conversation I had--

00:38:14.567 --> 00:38:16.400
I don't know if you
read this, but anyway, I

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.600
had a conversation with a
woman Veronica de Negri.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.340
She explained to
me how she survived

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:26.300
torture, every single
day of her life in Chile.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:31.950
And in that conversation,
what I learned was valuable

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:35.060
when I had problems trying to
figure out what "A Beautiful

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:38.310
Mind" should be and
from what perspective

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:41.970
it should be experienced,
like 20 years later.

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:45.730
So all the
conversations just serve

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.500
as sort of dots in a greater
constellation of dots

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.630
that you have faith
will someday connect.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:51.820
And they do.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.752
So I forgot the question.

00:38:54.752 --> 00:38:56.210
SPEAKER 1: I think
you answered it.

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:57.162
BRIAN GRAZER: Did I?

00:38:57.162 --> 00:38:59.542
OK.

00:38:59.542 --> 00:39:02.930
SPEAKER 1: I want to get to the
audience Q&amp;A. But real quick,

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:04.940
you know Hollywood
is changing so much.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:09.170
And Google probably has a
hand in changing it, just

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.790
in terms of content
distribution.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:13.640
What do you see
Hollywood looking

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.726
like in the next 30, 40 years?

00:39:17.726 --> 00:39:19.200
BRIAN GRAZER: 30 or 40?

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.440
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, or
whatever time scale

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.345
you think you can tell me about.

00:39:23.345 --> 00:39:24.470
BRIAN GRAZER: I don't know.

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:32.160
Probably every artist that
can create a sustainable story

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.760
will be their own platform.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.260
There'll be consolidation
of platforms.

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.690
But probably in the
future of 10 years,

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:45.486
more artists will have more
power over their own life.

00:39:45.486 --> 00:39:46.690
SPEAKER 1: Got you.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:47.190
Cool.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.976
Does anyone--

00:39:47.976 --> 00:39:50.436
BRIAN GRAZER: I don't
know-- positive.

00:39:50.436 --> 00:39:53.020
SPEAKER 1: Does anybody have
questions, from the audience?

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:54.771
AUDIENCE: Thanks, I've
really appreciated

00:39:54.771 --> 00:39:56.020
everything you've said so far.

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.797
So I worked in
film for 10 years.

00:39:58.797 --> 00:40:01.130
And a lot of my friends are
aspiring writers, producers,

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:02.260
and actors.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.080
I always think the ones who are
aspiring producers-- it just

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.200
seems like the most impossible
business to get into.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.162
What advice would you have
for aspiring producers?

00:40:12.162 --> 00:40:15.220
BRIAN GRAZER: Well, I'd probably
go back to having an idea.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:21.700
Having some IP, whether it's
your own self-generated idea

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:25.560
or just any IP-- it
could be a short story.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.030
It could be anything-- you have
to have something if you're

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.204
going to be a producer.

00:40:31.204 --> 00:40:32.870
The definition of a
producer is somebody

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:36.500
that can generate
an idea, that can

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.440
see the vertical
line of the most

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:46.670
nascent stage of that idea,
until its final evolution

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.020
or conclusion.

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:51.140
So you have to be creatively
responsible and fiscally

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.040
responsible.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.400
So that starting point
to its end vision

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.810
has to have a corresponding
part, financially.

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:03.500
Both things will change all
of the time, all of the--

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.220
but as I say this, it's
so much like a startup.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.730
Isn't it?

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:10.510
Because you start off.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:13.310
You're making a movie.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:15.740
Let's say the good news
is you have this idea.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.510
The studio wants to make it.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:20.720
You go through this long process
of developing it, da da da da.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.700
They're for sure going.

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.160
Cost is $50 million.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.800
And then they go,
we're making it.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.350
You're in.

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:29.000
And you feel like, wow, great.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.520
They go, but we're
making it $30 million.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.050
Then you have to
figure that out.

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:34.500
You have to cut scenes out.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.200
You have to collapse the story.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.600
Or you have to
convince them it's 40.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:42.080
You know, it's multiple
different possibilities.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.570
But you have to start
owning something.

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:47.450
AUDIENCE: So it seems
that, to me, you

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:52.160
said presence is kind of
the core of how you maintain

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.230
and grow your curiosity.

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:58.430
And I'm just curious about how
you use personal technology

00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:59.510
in your life?

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.410
And I can see that
going in two ways.

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:04.520
One is a distraction,
but one is an enhancement

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.870
to your curiosity.

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:08.120
And how you kind of
control your behavior,

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.610
when it comes to personal
technology, what you use,

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:11.890
how much time you spend
in the offline world

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:13.090
versus the online world--

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:16.760
I'd just love to get
more context around what

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.905
that means in your life.

00:42:17.905 --> 00:42:21.410
BRIAN GRAZER: Well, I
definitely use technology a lot.

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:29.210
And every day, I'm
doing some search binge.

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:32.060
Because it's fun for me.

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:35.120
But I have to start
with some idea.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.330
And I also paint.

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:42.020
And I've painted for
about 20 years or so.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:45.770
Starting is the hardest
thing, touching the canvas.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:48.260
Whether it's an idea to
become a movie or television

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:54.110
show or a painting, for
me, Brian, knowing myself,

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:57.350
I can't execute perfection.

00:42:57.350 --> 00:43:02.060
I don't approach anything
knowing Brian Grazer is

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:06.440
going to execute to perfection.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:12.490
I try to have originality
as a differentiator.

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:19.140
So the original idea
is the one that I

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.450
will put the highest value on.

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:27.540
And it's the original idea that
that stress test is the one

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:30.880
that I'm interested in.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:35.810
To be the greatest artisan is
just not interesting to me.

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:38.270
And I don't think I
could succeed at it.

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:41.750
But I think I can
have original ideas.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:47.150
And like now, there's a lot
of evidence that proves that.

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:50.210
But that's where I put my value.

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:54.210
And then of course, I will
employ, through collaboration,

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:58.430
the ability to execute it to
the highest quality possible.

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:03.130
But I don't start like Chris
Nolan, who did "Dunkirk."

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:06.050
I don't start going, I
know I can execute this

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:10.910
to a level 100.

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:12.530
If I were to compare
to any artist--

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:15.440
I'm not this person, because
I'm not as great as this person,

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:19.900
but Andy Warhol just
did original shit.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:21.980
That was it.

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:26.510
He wasn't like Gerhard
Richter, a scientist of art.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:28.920
So that's how I look at it.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:33.500
So I use your
Google all the time

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:38.360
to enrich original
ideas that I feel

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:43.750
like I'm touching, creating,
or being part of its creation.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:45.030
So yeah.

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:46.120
It's an informant.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.887
It informs all of that.

00:44:47.887 --> 00:44:48.720
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.600
BRIAN GRAZER: Sure.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.000
AUDIENCE: Do you have a
process for these curiosity

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.760
conversations, or a standard
set of questions you ask,

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.110
or research you do
before going into them?

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:59.830
Because it's a skill and
an art to kind of extract

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:01.790
great stories from
people, as well.

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:04.030
So how do you go into
these conversations?

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:07.320
BRIAN GRAZER: You have
to get to the place.

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.370
Like get in flow, right?

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:16.710
Or in the zone, where you're
hoping for the very best date

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:19.410
of your lifetime.

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:22.800
And if you think about
your very best date,

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.220
you weren't constructing
stuff as it's going.

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:29.535
You're not thinking of what
are you going to say next.

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.020
You're really in
a state of flow,

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.210
and you're so present
that everything

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:42.210
is evolving in the most
sincere and authentic way.

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:47.310
I think just being as sincere
as possible, you can be funny.

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.440
And you can goof up,
like I do all the time.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:56.080
But I think people feel
when other people are

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.680
a facsimile of authenticity.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.970
There's a lot of agents
that I deal with,

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:03.520
I just feel like they're bots.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.540
You know?

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:06.190
They go, hey, so
what's going on?

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:08.470
They come up with questions.

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:11.620
They somehow learned that
that was a method that

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:12.760
would create intimacy.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.304
And I just don't
feel like it does.

00:46:15.304 --> 00:46:15.970
Are you smiling?

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:17.350
Because it's true, right?

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:22.210
When you try to
methodologize it--

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:25.240
AUDIENCE: For me, as I
spoke to you earlier,

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.710
I've had some ideas.

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:28.540
And they're written down.

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:31.450
And they're not just ideas, but
the actual scripts are done.

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:37.080
What's the best way, or a
way, that you would recommend

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.190
getting them produced?

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:40.232
Like getting them done?

00:46:40.232 --> 00:46:40.940
BRIAN GRAZER: OK.

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:41.900
This will be horrible.

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.230
What do you think?

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:46.945
Just take a guess, even
if it's the wrong guess.

00:46:46.945 --> 00:46:47.570
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:50.660
For me, like, submitting
to friends in the industry

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:55.700
that are producers, themselves,
or agents, managers.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.045
I submit to contests
and stuff like that.

00:46:58.045 --> 00:46:59.750
BRIAN GRAZER: OK, good.

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.370
But I'd augment that.

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:04.040
People don't really want
to drudge through shit.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:09.810
So I think the best way, if that
would be the mechanics for you,

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:12.950
then you should know how to
say it in a really sexy way,

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:14.936
in like under a minute.

00:47:14.936 --> 00:47:15.650
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:16.700
Working on the pitch.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:17.824
Is that what you're saying?

00:47:17.824 --> 00:47:22.940
BRIAN GRAZER: Yeah, but work
on the sexiest, hookiest--

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:25.940
it could be 30 seconds, but
it forces the person you're

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.500
talking to to ask questions.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:28.306
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:47:28.306 --> 00:47:30.200
BRIAN GRAZER:
People love to talk.

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:33.180
But they only like to talk if
they think you're interesting.

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:36.270
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:37.430
SPEAKER 1: Next question.

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.490
AUDIENCE: So along the
lines of that advice,

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:45.952
can you give the audience an
example of your sexiest pitch

00:47:45.952 --> 00:47:46.660
that you've done?

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:49.270
SPEAKER 1: I was just
going to ask that.

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.130
BRIAN GRAZER:
Basically, my career

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:54.370
began while I was the law clerk.

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:57.880
And after Lew Wasserman
said, you better have ideas,

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:02.320
there was this book-- this
Leonard Maltin's "10,000 Titles

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.390
Of Movies Or TV."

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:05.980
And I realized,
for me, everything

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.950
started with a title or a word.

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:11.590
And there are certain words
that really wake you up,

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:12.250
like revenge.

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:22.660
There are certain words that are
like accelerators that wake you

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:24.640
up, and they make you
go, what does that mean,

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.910
or that have danger to them.

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:30.140
So I'd go through this book.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.030
I'd get these words.

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:33.520
They then became titles
or the ignition point

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.320
of what my question would be.

00:48:38.626 --> 00:48:39.750
I mean, "A Beautiful Mind."

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:41.330
I could do any of them.

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:42.510
You should ask me.

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:45.170
I can do to any of them.

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:47.270
I made three movies
all in a year

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:51.630
that were all because the studio
dared me to make a small budget

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:52.130
movie.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:56.110
So I made the movie "Friday
Night Lights," "Blue Crush--"

00:48:56.110 --> 00:49:01.090
it's like a girl empowerment
movie about three girls at surf

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:02.690
on the North shore of Oahu--

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:06.160
and then "8 Mile."

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:12.710
And they all began
with "did you know?"

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:15.770
I looked at it like this-- have
you ever watched 60 minutes?

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:17.950
It's been on for 30 years.

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:21.250
I thought to myself, if I had
to work for one of those guys,

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:25.240
like Dan Rather or whatever,
and Dan Rather goes,

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:29.740
he only has like a minute,
I'm a junior nobody.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:32.290
I said to everybody that works
for me, including myself, I

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:34.930
have to pretend like I'm
working for Dan Rather.

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:36.910
And I got like
one minute to say,

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:40.060
did you know that this thing
is going on in central Africa,

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:41.610
in the Congo right now?

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:42.970
That duh duh duh.

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:45.610
You have to talk like that.

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:47.812
That would be how I do it, OK.

00:49:47.812 --> 00:49:52.186
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
and now into the valley

00:49:52.186 --> 00:49:53.158
of disillusionment.

00:49:53.158 --> 00:49:56.410
Do you think that could be a
medium for storytelling that's

00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:56.930
viable?

00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:58.304
Or do you think
it's best or not?

00:49:58.304 --> 00:50:03.040
BRIAN GRAZER: Well, I liked your
question that's a conclusion.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.710
I really like it, because
I feel similarly to you.

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:08.830
And I've sort of
been on the same--

00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:13.660
I met the guy that created
VR, Jared something,

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.470
literally 25 years ago,
in northern California.

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:21.370
Anyway, I've been to
every one of those places,

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:22.990
Magic Leap, all that stuff.

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:26.320
I think it interrupts
emotionality.

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:35.470
And optimally, anything
that becomes cinematic

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:38.950
should ignite emotion.

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.410
And when it ignites emotion,
it becomes indelible.

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:43.930
And then, all of a sudden,
it becomes a memory

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:44.860
that you care about.

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:46.030
You care to tell others.

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:47.980
It affects you.

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:52.570
I think VR, so far
in my experience,

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:54.620
interrupts narrative
storytelling,

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:57.790
which is the map to emotion.

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:01.900
So I'd like it to
work, but I haven't

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:04.654
seen it yet work that way.

00:51:04.654 --> 00:51:07.070
AUDIENCE: So I always got the
vibe that in Hollywood there

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:10.270
were tons of aspiring
actors and actresses

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:15.380
who are working minimum wage
jobs trying to "make it."

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.860
And probably the same thing
with screenwriters, I always

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:20.440
see a bunch of them in
Starbucks and so forth.

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.960
Are there any roles
in Hollywood that you

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.490
feel like there's actually
a shortage of people for?

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:28.390
Like if we had more of
this type of person,

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:31.080
more overall stuff
would get created.

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:35.000
BRIAN GRAZER: Anything other
than straight American, there's

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:35.500
less of.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.870
There's too little of.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:41.180
It And it's weird.

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:47.200
The movie business, which is
sort of posited or positioned

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:50.830
to be really liberal, I
found it's not very liberal,

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:52.150
actually.

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:53.590
It's very ethnocentric.

00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:55.420
It's very judgmental.

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:59.230
It's kind of its own
hypocrite, in my opinion.

00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:05.130
It lives in its own hypocrisy,
in that there's usually

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:06.510
only one--

00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:08.110
You know, like Eddie
Murphy, I'll say.

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:09.610
Because I don't
want to say it's me.

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:11.190
Eddie Murphy said,
there's only--

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:13.440
because I made six movies
with Eddie Murphy--

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:16.470
room for one black, funny guy.

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:19.440
Or there's only room
for one fat, funny guy.

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.480
You know there was
Fatty Arbuckle.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.230
Then there's this.

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:23.320
Then there's John Candy.

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.920
Then there's Chris Farley.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:30.270
Hollywood doesn't have a lot
of elasticity, like that.

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:32.760
It should.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.250
That's my new quest of what
I'm going to try to do.

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.200
That's why I like to
go to the Middle East.

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.030
And so I go to Latin America.

00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:45.620
I like to be on the ground.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:50.870
When you're on the ground,
people are not data.

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:53.270
You get to see and feel them.

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:56.536
And then, you don't treat them,
or you don't make "The Great

00:52:56.536 --> 00:52:57.660
Wall" with that Matt Damon.

00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.240
Do you know what I mean?

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:01.996
It's just like they
just thought, OK, these

00:53:01.996 --> 00:53:02.870
are the requirements.

00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:03.994
I'll make "The Great Wall."

00:53:03.994 --> 00:53:05.720
The Chinese will love it, bang.

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.710
Put in Matt Damon.

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:11.119
It was just like you can't
weld things into things.

00:53:11.119 --> 00:53:13.160
Incidentally, I make a
lot of mistakes in movies.

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:16.490
I don't make that particular
mistake, but as you know,

00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:18.640
my movies and television
are fallible, too.

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.706
I have a good movie
coming out, by the way,

00:53:20.706 --> 00:53:21.830
that you guys are handling.

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:25.084
It's called "The
Spy That Dumped Me."

00:53:25.084 --> 00:53:27.500
I'm not trying to just promote
stuff, but it's pretty hip.

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:30.020
It's a super funny,
girl power movie.

00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:33.170
It stars Kate McKinnon
and Mila Kunis.

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:37.970
And I know it's cool and shot
really well, like great action,

00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:38.600
but it's funny.

00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:40.919
These chicks are really funny.

00:53:40.919 --> 00:53:42.210
And you guys are working on it.

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:43.970
SPEAKER 1: That was a
sexy pitch, right there.

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:45.136
BRIAN GRAZER: There it goes.

00:53:45.136 --> 00:53:45.665
Oh, yeah.

00:53:45.665 --> 00:53:46.970
There you go.

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:47.520
Thank you.

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.682
Come back, right?

00:53:48.682 --> 00:53:49.890
All right, I think I got to--

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:51.265
I'm sure you guys
all have to go.

00:53:51.265 --> 00:53:53.740
Thank you for being so polite,
and nice, and everything.

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:56.570
SPEAKER 1: Thank you so much,
Brian Grazer, for coming.

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:59.320
[APPLAUSE]
