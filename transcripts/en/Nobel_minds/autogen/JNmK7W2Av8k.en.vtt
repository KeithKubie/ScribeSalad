the discovery that neutrinos actually

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
the discovery that neutrinos actually
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.040

not massless makes a difference it makes

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050
not massless makes a difference it makes
 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.990
not massless makes a difference it makes
a difference theoretically but it also

supernovas would not be exploding the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550
supernovas would not be exploding the
 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.229
supernovas would not be exploding the
way they explode the elements that we

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239
way they explode the elements that we
 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.650
way they explode the elements that we
all made of would not exist so neutrinos

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660
all made of would not exist so neutrinos
 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.260
all made of would not exist so neutrinos
are very important but this is

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270
are very important but this is
 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.039
are very important but this is
fundamental physics what are neutrinos

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049
fundamental physics what are neutrinos
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.310
fundamental physics what are neutrinos
then well I wish we knew what neutrinos

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
then well I wish we knew what neutrinos
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.929
then well I wish we knew what neutrinos
are neutrinos are among these few

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
are neutrinos are among these few
 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.090
are neutrinos are among these few
fundamental particles which make up

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
fundamental particles which make up
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.660
fundamental particles which make up
matter and we know them from radioactive

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
matter and we know them from radioactive
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.950
matter and we know them from radioactive
decays but what they really are no one

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960
decays but what they really are no one
 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.990
decays but what they really are no one
knows no one has ever seen a neutrino

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000
knows no one has ever seen a neutrino
 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.320
knows no one has ever seen a neutrino
neutrinos have no electric charge and we

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330
neutrinos have no electric charge and we
 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.300
neutrinos have no electric charge and we
can only detect particles which carry

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
can only detect particles which carry
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.030
can only detect particles which carry
electric charge and so we can only

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
electric charge and so we can only
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.980
electric charge and so we can only
discover neutrinos when they interact

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990
discover neutrinos when they interact
 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.660
discover neutrinos when they interact
with something and produce charged

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670
with something and produce charged
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.819
with something and produce charged
particles and this is how we know there

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
particles and this is how we know there
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.190
particles and this is how we know there
are three kinds of neutrinos but no one

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
are three kinds of neutrinos but no one
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.490
are three kinds of neutrinos but no one
has ever seen the neutrino itself and

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500
has ever seen the neutrino itself and
 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.160
has ever seen the neutrino itself and
the price is actually for discovery of

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
the price is actually for discovery of
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.399
the price is actually for discovery of
neutrinos oscillations the neutrinos

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
neutrinos oscillations the neutrinos
 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.080
neutrinos oscillations the neutrinos
change identities also

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090
change identities also
 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.570
change identities also
what does it mean well it means that new

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580
what does it mean well it means that new
 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.560
what does it mean well it means that new
chinos it's very hard to say that the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570
chinos it's very hard to say that the
 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.870
chinos it's very hard to say that the
new Trina changes identity because it

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880
new Trina changes identity because it
 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.490
new Trina changes identity because it
makes you think of the fact that you

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500
makes you think of the fact that you
 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.410
makes you think of the fact that you
know you have a neutrino sitting on the

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420
know you have a neutrino sitting on the
 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.960
know you have a neutrino sitting on the
table in front of you and over all over

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970
table in front of you and over all over
 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.300
table in front of you and over all over
suddenly become something else so

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310
suddenly become something else so
 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.820
suddenly become something else so
neutrinos do not change identity like

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830
neutrinos do not change identity like
 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.520
neutrinos do not change identity like
that they change identity while they

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530
that they change identity while they
 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.080
that they change identity while they
move through space when they do that you

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090
move through space when they do that you
 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.930
move through space when they do that you
can produce one kind of neutrino but

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940
can produce one kind of neutrino but
 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.970
can produce one kind of neutrino but
then if you try to detect it 100

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980
then if you try to detect it 100
 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.550
then if you try to detect it 100
hundreds of kilometers further way you

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560
hundreds of kilometers further way you
 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.920
hundreds of kilometers further way you
discover that what you catch it's not

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930
discover that what you catch it's not
 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.479
discover that what you catch it's not
the same kind of neutrino but a

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489
the same kind of neutrino but a
 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.910
the same kind of neutrino but a
different type in Chino so something has

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920
different type in Chino so something has
 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.250
different type in Chino so something has
happened on the way from the source to

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260
happened on the way from the source to
 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.770
happened on the way from the source to
the detector and this is what we call

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780
the detector and this is what we call
 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.770
the detector and this is what we call
neutrino oscillations and this has to do

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780
neutrino oscillations and this has to do
 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.920
neutrino oscillations and this has to do
with quantum mechanics and quantum

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710
 
 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.800
 
you mentioned that neutrinos still are a

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810
you mentioned that neutrinos still are a
 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.390
you mentioned that neutrinos still are a
big puzzle so what's going on since then

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400
big puzzle so what's going on since then
 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.189
big puzzle so what's going on since then
so since then we'll discover that

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199
so since then we'll discover that
 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.080

neutrinos are massless we do not
 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.689
neutrinos are massless we do not
understand it but at least the mass

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699
understand it but at least the mass
 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.460

in now we know that machino mass is not

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130
in now we know that machino mass is not
 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.879
in now we know that machino mass is not
zero so now the question becomes why is

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889
zero so now the question becomes why is
 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.659
zero so now the question becomes why is
it not zero and why is it so small so if

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669
it not zero and why is it so small so if
 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.879
it not zero and why is it so small so if
we if we physicist discover something

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889
we if we physicist discover something
 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.159
we if we physicist discover something

which is very small but actually not
 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.950
which is very small but actually not
equal to 0 we get very excited because

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960
equal to 0 we get very excited because
 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.469
equal to 0 we get very excited because
there must be something which makes this

to determine exactly what the mass is we

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160
to determine exactly what the mass is we
 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.700
to determine exactly what the mass is we
don't know what the mass is we only know

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710
don't know what the mass is we only know

an upper limit we want to know why the
 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.860
an upper limit we want to know why the
mass is so small and of course theorists

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870
mass is so small and of course theorists
 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.219

have lots of proposals we want to know
why neutrinos only appear in a

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080
why neutrinos only appear in a
 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.990
why neutrinos only appear in a
left-handed variety and not in the

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000
left-handed variety and not in the
 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.950
left-handed variety and not in the
right-handed variety they may be a new

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960

created a wide open field so instead of
 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.520
created a wide open field so instead of
just trying to determine what the

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530
just trying to determine what the
 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.980
just trying to determine what the
neutrino mass is we are not trying to

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990
neutrino mass is we are not trying to
 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.750
neutrino mass is we are not trying to
determine the properties of the machine
