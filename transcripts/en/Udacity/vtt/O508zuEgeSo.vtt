00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.320
So now my goal is to start
thinking about how we going to

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.300
warp an image to a different size.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.820
This is a global transformation, or
a global warping, and to help us,

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.810
we will need to start looking at if we
can come up with a set of parameters

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.830
that on easy adjustment
of these parameters.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.830
We can basically take
a set of equations and

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.736
generate a new output
from a given input.

00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:25.380
So now we want to actually start looking
at how to get an output image G if

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.180
the F is given and we have a certain set
of parameters to do this transformation.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.780
To help us, let's create just
a simple coordinate axis here.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.500
Usually if you remember I always put
the coordinates axis going down in y and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.170
x this way.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.870
Just for simplicity and consistency.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.900
I'm going to start using
the traditional set of axis here.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.620
Of course this would be the x-axis,
the y-axis, and this would be the (o,o).

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.290
All right?

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.800
Let's find another coordinate frame.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.830
And here, so
assuming this is again the (o,o) and

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.870
this is x and y, you notice this
image has been moved a little bit.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.320
Let's claim that this
has been translated.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.319
By tx, and ty.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.940
The translation's in x and y.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.460
So this in essence kind of says,
that now I've translated the image.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.800
So this is basically, warping, or
transformation of translation.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.720
Another similar example would be when
I actually take the image, again,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.510
the x and y axis,
that we've been paying attention to.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.690
Origin except that now we notice.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.930
This image has been rotated.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.500
And if you draw this axis here,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.860
you might say that this has
been rotated by amount theta.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.230
And that's rotation actually now means
that basically the same pixel values

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.190
that I have here, now appear in a
different setup, and of course, thinking

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.510
hard about it, you might also thinking,
this is basically, change the way.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.810
Rows and columns look, and
how my pixel values are looking.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.430
So this is basically looking
at simple rotations.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.400
Let's look at a few additional examples
of this kind of, parametric warping or

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.290
transformation of images.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.170
Again, my input image.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.840
In this one I've stretched the image.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.380
Right.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.860
In essence,
what I've done is I've scaled it.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.008
I've added basic additional
dimension in the.

00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:12.240
X axis then I have here,
y in this one is of course the same.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.030
Result in of course my vit is larger and
in this case the height is the same.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.030
This basically where we just
change one scale parameter is

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.010
the change of the aspect of the image,
and of course we could do this in both

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.590
directions x and y, and of course that's
the change in the scale of the image.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.380
Very simple stuff so far.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.890
Another example where
a basically have the same image.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.690
So this time around if you
notice that we've actually done

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.500
an interesting thing.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.340
What we've done here is,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.140
we've added a little bit of
perspective projector warp.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.610
Now the top row is much top numbers or
top part is much smaller.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.220
Bottom is larger, and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.030
in essence, the image seems to have
flipped on that side a little bit.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.860
This is, referred to as Perspective,
and this, of course,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.310
is an example where we have created
an affine deformation of the image,

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.350
where basically now, the image seems
to have, kind of have a lot more sheer.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.930
Again different types of warps
are transformation applied

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.340
to the same pixel values.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.530
And of course as you noticed the domain,
the number, how the x and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.632
y's change depend on how,
what kind of function we could apply.

00:03:24.632 --> 00:03:25.572
So let's now talk about what kind
of functions we could apply.
