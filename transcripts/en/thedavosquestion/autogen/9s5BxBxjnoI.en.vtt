00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.100
&gt;&gt; I would like to communicate today to you
something rather interesting. You know we

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.110
are going to celebrate our 60th anniversary
in the state of Israel. We went through many

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:22.660
wars and we won them but we also won democracy.
We didn't gave up hope. And we're a very very

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.110
large accomplishment 60th anniversary which
is made to show that given us all the balance

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.410
around the world Israel can become a country
or could we. I think that little power for

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:43.190
our kind is not power, but really good, really
and all of us at the project and then we shall

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.890
live all of us in a better place and live
off in sound.
