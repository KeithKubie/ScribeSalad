artificial intelligence this year at

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400
artificial intelligence this year at
 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.820

Davos and artificial intelligence is not

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830
Davos and artificial intelligence is not
 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.700
Davos and artificial intelligence is not
a technology in and of itself it's the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710
a technology in and of itself it's the
 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.060
a technology in and of itself it's the
use of technologies to model humans or

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
use of technologies to model humans or
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.390
use of technologies to model humans or
to make machines that act like humans

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.429

there seems to be a tremendous amount of

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439
there seems to be a tremendous amount of
 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.439
there seems to be a tremendous amount of
fear about artificial intelligence right

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449
fear about artificial intelligence right
 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.599

now is it going to take over the world

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
now is it going to take over the world
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.000
now is it going to take over the world
are we going to create killer robots

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010
are we going to create killer robots
 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.550
are we going to create killer robots
while autonomy is an important concept

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560
while autonomy is an important concept
 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.610
while autonomy is an important concept
in artificial intelligence

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620
in artificial intelligence
 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.080
in artificial intelligence
interdependence is an important concept

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
interdependence is an important concept
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.069
interdependence is an important concept
in the real world

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079

I build therefore social artificial

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410
I build therefore social artificial
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.069
I build therefore social artificial
intelligence I endow machines with the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079
intelligence I endow machines with the
 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.440
intelligence I endow machines with the
ability to interact with people the way

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
ability to interact with people the way
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.750
ability to interact with people the way
people interact with one another it's

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
people interact with one another it's
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.330
people interact with one another it's
really difficult to understand the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340
really difficult to understand the
 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.790
really difficult to understand the
minutiae of how people interact with

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
minutiae of how people interact with
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.850
minutiae of how people interact with
other people with such attention to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860
other people with such attention to
 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.189
other people with such attention to
detail that we can build those same

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
detail that we can build those same
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.260
detail that we can build those same
skills into a machine it's important

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270
skills into a machine it's important
 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.479
skills into a machine it's important
however we understand the intelligence

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
however we understand the intelligence
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.859
however we understand the intelligence
not just of modeling our ability to work

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869
not just of modeling our ability to work
 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.789
not just of modeling our ability to work
in a factory for example but also

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799
in a factory for example but also
 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.950
in a factory for example but also
understanding and endowing machines with

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960
understanding and endowing machines with
 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.080
understanding and endowing machines with
the ability to interact and collaborate

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
the ability to interact and collaborate
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.810

with people
