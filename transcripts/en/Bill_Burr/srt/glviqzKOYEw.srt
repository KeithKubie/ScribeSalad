1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,150
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,340
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,330
January 29th, 2018
what's going on out? Why?

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,920
Yeah. Um, all right.
Well this was a board,

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,120
this would have been a boring
Sunday because there was, you know,

6
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:26,070
there's no football, right? They got the,
uh, you got the week off in between the,

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,210
between the Superbowl and the championship
games. They had the pro bowl today,

8
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:32,680
which was kind of cool. Look like football
in the future where they would get,

9
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:34,910
you know, they'd start to tackle somebody
and they're like, all right. All right.

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,630
Right, right, right. You know,

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,000
I don't know if that's the
concussion thing or the me too.

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,090
I don't know what it is.
He does not want you touching him.

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,440
Do not throw into the ground.

14
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:47,930
I have a special guest to
liven up my Sunday day. Uh,

15
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,840
uh, Jesus who? One and only 200
rigs for Christ's sake. Todd,

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,850
you all one of my favorite fucking
people in this business and you will,

17
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:59,990
one of my favorite comedians.
So Isabelle, pleasure through,

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
I feel that the feeling's mutual manager.

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,790
You don't have to compliment me
on this idols, man. Dude, you are.

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,560
You are the silliest fucking dude.
You make me feel mature.

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,300
That's what I like about you,
Todd. Rex, okay. Yes. Todd Rex,

22
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:20,010
who checks off a lot of boxes in this
day of caring. That's right. You do.

23
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,720
I don't even know that, man. I don't
even know what it means either.

24
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,770
I'm just trying to be progressive.

25
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,510
You would think that somebody would
come his fucking way and finally tap the

26
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:30,930
magic wand in his head and make
something happen and say, Todd,

27
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,360
you've been destroying at least three
times as hard as 10 times of the fucking,

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,950
or whatever the math is.
All the fucking comics out there.

29
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,630
I love working with you,
but I hate following you.
You fucking murder. Finally,

30
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:43,740
this fucking asshole.

31
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,810
He got himself a special that he's taping
and he needs some people to come down

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,630
and then you can, you know,
go on and I can open for,

33
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,990
for making you sweat a little lit.
No, no, not a chance. All right.

34
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:00,570
He's going to be at the satellite
theater in silver lake. Uh,

35
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,190
the satellite la.com for tickets.

36
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,720
That's right. Uh, February 11th, uh,
you're going to be the one in the show.

37
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,190
It's a Sunday, but usually come out
David support the all right. Sunday,

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,500
which is a week after,
uh, the Superbowl, right?

39
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,940
So everybody knows the seven 30
and nine 32 shows, two shows,

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,850
two shows to show. So you're going
to go out there. You fucking,

41
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,300
you knocked the first one out. Ego. All
right, I got it. And then the next one,

42
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:31,070
you just go off Cruze. Is that what
you do? And you do yours, the button.

43
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,430
The first one is tightened up and then
I spend the whole night trying to forget

44
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:39,060
that I'm taping one real and stop
trying to think like, oh my God,

45
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:41,970
I missed that tag.
Fuck.

46
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:45,000
That needed to be documented
in the comedy universe.

47
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,780
I just try to look at it
like, all right, this is just,

48
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,210
I'm just documenting where my hour was
on this night and this is how it came up.

49
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,270
And I want you to do that because
every night when you go up there,

50
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,520
I don't know about you, but I mean
I'm constantly fucking up jokes, uh,

51
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:03,670
constantly leaving shit out and
then adds to something else.

52
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,940
And I never think of it.
Never think about it.

53
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:10,510
Like I never thought to get you a glass
of water before you sat here for a

54
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,400
fucking hour. What an idiot. I'm going
to have to hit pause here in a minute,

55
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:16,900
but no good. Um, that's just how, uh,

56
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,020
I had to do it that way just because
I wanted to think about your,

57
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,410
I wanted to ask you about your thought
process cause I was curious. Um,

58
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,110
like I know the night before I'm
going to be a wreck, you know,

59
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,250
just was thinking about it and make
it all the funny guys. Worry hacks,

60
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:34,600
don't worry. Packs are already fucking
working on their next happy hour. Yeah.

61
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:36,510
They'd not even fucking nervous to just,

62
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,280
and they'll go off stage with this
shitty material, be like, dude,

63
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:43,180
I fucking crushed, crushed in every
funny guys. Like, who's it? Good.

64
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,110
I'm terrible. I do that every, every time.

65
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:49,940
I just really in a about way compliment
to myself. I know him. Um, I, you know,

66
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:53,140
I got to waste to go people, I don't know
if she's to you, what did they be obese?

67
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,390
Um, yeah, so I I uh, someone told
me, I think Louis Ck told me,

68
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,400
and I think he heard this from fucking
bill Cosby. How funny is that? Um,

69
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,410
that your dad, uh, you work
this hard to get there? Um,

70
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,450
uh, don't forget to have fun, right? So
make sure, yeah. Cause if you haven't fun,

71
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:16,200
that's going to be, you're going to
feel better about it afterwards, right?

72
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,400
If you're someone who
nitpicks set himself,

73
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,600
there's no way you're going to be happy
at the end of it. So just be forgiving.

74
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,100
Just be the fucking silly
fucking hilarious guy. You
all, you'll be fine. Yeah.

75
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,510
I'm not really too worried about it,

76
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:30,850
but I just want to make sure that I
already can tell you, worry about it.

77
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:34,840
You seem you seem tighter than usual.
She's still, I'm doing your podcast.

78
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,140
It's kind of a big deal for me too.
I feel like I didn't the whole thing.

79
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:39,370
Now that you've peeked behind the curtain.

80
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,890
It's just me with a fucking
$99 mixer from gutsiness Ana.

81
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,030
We're sitting here on the
couch like Ernie and Bert,

82
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,140
the all I did to prepare for you as I
turned on the AC and I scored some for

83
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:58,060
breeze. That's it. I know everybody
has these fancy fucking studios.

84
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,470
I just did a, I did your mom's house, uh,

85
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,180
with a Thompson Sigora
and Chrisia presents key.

86
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,820
I just did theirs and they
have this whole fucking studio.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,350
Rogan has like literally like a
stern level studio. She's and um,

88
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,800
I should step it up at some point. Yeah.
But your house is dope. I don't know.

89
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,990
No one can see it, but your
house is dope. Oh, thank you.

90
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,400
It wasn't when I bought it,

91
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,340
but now that I've dumped all this money
into it and I could never get my money

92
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:26,860
back. Yeah, this is pretty good. I I,

93
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:30,700
this house was like almost a
hundred years old when I got it.

94
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,480
Almost 90 years old. I should say. People
live in here before though, right? Uh,

95
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:34,721
yeah.

96
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:37,300
I don't want to talk about that though
because then people will fucking figure

97
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:38,134
out where I live.

98
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,010
I already have to fucking edit out one
of the comments you made earlier that

99
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,240
will fuck two people that fucking
lunatics and that's what they do.

100
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll tell you later just it was just
enough of something to make some psycho

101
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:52,870
just turn around and face speaker
and start writing down information.

102
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:57,380
But I'm a paranoid
dude. Um, yeah. Anyways.

103
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,670
Um, what was I talking about? What
the fuck we just talking about my add,

104
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,330
I don't know either. I have no idea.
You've been watching any hockey.

105
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,220
Did you see my Sean's elbow? I was
a thing of beauty. It was a thing.

106
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,470
It was so, it was perfect.
Filthy. He, he's, he got trips.

107
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,610
I know a, he's the size of
Barney rubble, so nobody paid.

108
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,520
He's not going to get called out like
all foods. Probably one of the worst.

109
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:25,730
But dude, he was and I loved Marshawn
and I loved the fucking bruise,

110
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:29,870
but I love him commodities. But at that,
the thing is, I don't like that aspect,

111
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:33,350
like throwing that shit. Did you see
when, uh, I also and destroyed them.

112
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,060
Oh Dude, my God. Ugh,
that was a brutal hit. Oh,

113
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:41,810
I thought he had like internal
bleeding after that cause he kept,

114
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:45,020
he kept skating but he kept skating.
Yeah. And he was just going like, ah.

115
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,020
And it seemed like beyond
the way,

116
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,190
the thing about PK, well, I'm so
glad he placed her in Nashville,

117
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:55,280
not from Montreal anymore. It was,
he used as best as he used to.

118
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,320
He used to get us all the time and
everybody knew that was his move.

119
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,820
And I don't know why no one,

120
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,520
because he just knew exactly when
your head was down for a second,

121
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,110
it was two crossovers.

122
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:09,770
He was inside and then all of a sudden
he was just in front of you and he just

123
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:13,310
ended your fucking life for
like, I dunno, like two shifts,

124
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,380
but um, yeah, I'm, I'm, uh, I always
liked that guy. I never take it to the,

125
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,490
to the point if there's a guy on a
team that I don't like, you know,

126
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:25,340
like when Derek Jeter played
for the Yankees, I couldn't,

127
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,780
I couldn't get myself to, to get to
the point of like actual g hating them.

128
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,660
It's like the guy's great. Right? It
is good. Yeah. I'll you saying is,

129
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:37,150
I wish this guy was on my tape.
No,

130
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,770
you haven't watched his hockey watching
my son play hockey. He's a beast.

131
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:42,530
Of course. I know you
showed me all the, uh,

132
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,700
the video of them and he like picked it
up and to see who's like playing drums

133
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,520
or something. Right. They also
plays the Romans and he plays drums.

134
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,830
Any place hockey Jesus
kids can be crushing if

135
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,370
were to get more legs than I am.

136
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,110
You can be a fucking grandfather by
the time this special comes out. Jeez.

137
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,020
Where you've been working to a lens as a,
I just flew back today from Phoenix.

138
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:07,550
I was with Craig, Craig
Robinson. You know,

139
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,880
I've been totally on them for like a
couple of years now when he's not shooting

140
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:15,800
television shows, which is all the
fucking time that guy works. Um,

141
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:17,960
so yeah. Uh, where were you guys working?

142
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,750
We were working at stand up
live in Phoenix. Oh, okay.

143
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,490
I know that plays five sold out shows. It
was fantastic. Had a ball. I did the uh,

144
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,520
you know, it's fucking, that's fucking
nuts as far as like that downtown area,

145
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:31,580
how lively it is if there's
something going on. But the second,

146
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:34,890
the workday ends like during the week if
you're there, like at five o'clock town.

147
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,740
Yeah. It's fucking creepy. If the
sons don't have a game, it's over.

148
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,070
Yeah. I love it though. I mean, I
couldn't live there, I don't think,

149
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:45,320
but I had a really good time there.
Um,

150
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,740
I had a good time traveling with
you though. We went down south.

151
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,460
I was just like reading some
comments about, give me the keys.

152
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,400
Just give us the keys. Oh yeah, yeah. That
lady. I thought about that the other day.

153
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,330
We went to check in that hotel and
that lady was just fucking with the

154
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:05,070
instructions. I, Jim is on the fourth
floor. It's open from nine to nine.

155
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,900
We did as a continental breakfast,
blah, blah, blah, blah. And like,

156
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,030
I'm sitting there going like, oh my
God, how long is this going to take?

157
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:14,580
And she's in the middle of eating.
You just choose the key.

158
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,050
She got like offended.
She goes bad for real

159
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,350
dude. I fucking was laughing
like I was in high school, man.

160
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:27,140
It was one of those labs.
So I was just like, oh.

161
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,600
Cause what it was was the fact
that she didn't find it funny.

162
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,720
It was already hilarious, but the
fact that she didn't find it funny,

163
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,890
it hurt her feelings.
She didn't have to deal with it.

164
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:38,880
And then she got mad all in like,
fucking like a half a second.

165
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,850
Then I felt like I was in class
again where it's like, oh my God,

166
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:43,980
don't start fucking laughing.
Or you're gonna,

167
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:46,910
you're gonna get like the tension or
something that you also took me to that,

168
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:51,210
that fucking, uh, was at that
barbecue place or something.

169
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,940
Oh yeah. What does it call it? Was it?

170
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,230
They'll say the name of
it cause it was terrible.

171
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,650
Well the first one we went through,
then we went to, we went to them,

172
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,630
we went to that one where it was a
giant fucking place and they had like 40

173
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:07,500
fried murdered chickens that you could
see. You don't remember that place?

174
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:10,500
It was gigantic and got all my God,
this place is fucking unbelievable.

175
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:12,510
Is that the place where you ate?
And then we went to the,

176
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,070
to the Nascar track and then you were
like t rex that you had a salad. Oh

177
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,870
where was that? In a hotel in
Charlotte. That was Charlotte. Okay.

178
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:28,140
And we did the Nascar experience.
That was very cool though.

179
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,480
So let's talk about crushing it.
That dude was driving us around.

180
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:34,560
Is 20 years old named Dylan. Remember
that? I know any as much as the jockey.

181
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,240
Right. Cause he doesn't
want to slow the car down.

182
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:38,940
I couldn't believe what like what a piece
of shit or race car it looks like when

183
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:41,190
you walk up to it.
I've seen formula one cars up close.

184
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:44,520
They look like absolute like it
looks like if you stepped on it,

185
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,620
the whole thing would fall apart
cause all it is, it's just,

186
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,520
it's just an engine suspension and tires
and everything else is just that the

187
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:54,520
lightest. Did you see the uh,
the, the gas pedal was shit.

188
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,850
It'll look a stick like bent coat hanger.

189
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,930
It's like real would have like if you
had like that just the floor thing,

190
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:06,480
whatever that the pedal is to rest your
foot on the, if you have that in them,

191
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:09,750
that's the difference between you like
I guess winning the race or a coming in

192
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:13,020
like third row because that fucking
thing is sitting there with a piece of

193
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:13,854
rubber that's going to win

194
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:22,200
that race. That actually they're um,
Nascar's not doing well. It's not,

195
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:25,530
the numbers are down now.
And I went to the Daytona 500,

196
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,230
they painted the seats
like every other seat.

197
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,690
Like they had like three colors and they
would paint them to make it look like

198
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,210
those people in the season. Yeah.
Cameras flying by. And you know,

199
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:36,570
used to have it like that was the
Minnesota north stars really used to have

200
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,540
seats like that and I thought it was cool
and now I'm thinking well maybe cause

201
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:43,440
nobody showed up for the game devs and
maybe that's why they moved to Dallas.

202
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,000
So when I hear all those Minnesota north
stars fan still complaining that that

203
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:47,834
team left.

204
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,660
I mean if there was people that well
there was people there I wouldn't have

205
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:54,010
noticed. Right for right,
exactly. You would've been

206
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,430
able to see the season on the road. You're
skating on thousand lakes there. No.

207
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,000
You watched any of the football, was
that, do you watch any of the football?

208
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,620
I haven't been,
I haven't watched any football.

209
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,070
The only thing in my life
is the Washington Redskins
and they're terrible number

210
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:10,030
one on safety from Baltimore hosts.
How'd you become a Redskins fan?

211
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,650
On and off from silver spring,
Maryland,

212
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:14,830
right over the DC line that people are
thinking blah. Okay. But my, you know,

213
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:19,150
I had grass and shouldn't my yard and
two cars,

214
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,140
both parents are, I'm not saying that
that's not available in Baltimore.

215
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,040
What people think of the wire and the
corner where the thing about Baltimore,

216
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,023
but that's not where I lived.

217
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,030
That's why,
cause that's where I met you.

218
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:34,290
I met yet the Baltimore Improv
with that fucking debt long.

219
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:38,940
He had walked down like that
three quarters of a mile
hallway the last mile or

220
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:42,750
whatever. Yeah. That was still
worst location ever for a uh,

221
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,250
for a, for a fucking comedy club
with the club. I was all thrilled.

222
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,010
They let me come down there and they
asked me if I wanted to close out the

223
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:53,160
Sunday one time because somebody canceled
and I was all fucking excited and I

224
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:55,450
drove there from New
York City to do it right.

225
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,190
And I was like I'm going to get in with
the Improv's and I showed up and there

226
00:12:59,191 --> 00:13:04,191
was like 10 people there and the
owner talk was talking to the broker,

227
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,210
never talked to me and then
walked out while I was on stage.

228
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,190
And I remember being on stage.
Like I said,

229
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,980
I think I knew when I was on stage
cause I was kind of glancing over like,

230
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:18,360
okay well is that at least
works at Sonic Burger man.

231
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,730
And we didn't have,
it's really fucking annoying.

232
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,990
I don't know why anybody who ran a club,
why the fuck he would ever do that?

233
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,230
Because you don't know who's
coming down and for all you know,

234
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,830
they're going to go on, you know, and
do something. The fact that she would,

235
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,890
I was driving down from me,
he didn't even say thanks.

236
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,620
Classic fucking club managers. He
fat, big 50 inch fucking waste.

237
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,640
You know what I mean? But those
slacks, that giant fucking belt.

238
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,010
Well, right. That's the Gabardine
whatever they're called.

239
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:50,360
What are those flags called?
Action slacks.

240
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,520
Yeah, the action slacks. The uh, yeah,

241
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,040
I ran into a number of those fucking
people. That's my big thing though.

242
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,780
The shade. Do you know
what? I'm turning 50.

243
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,790
Turning five zero in [inaudible]
49 in May. You do all right.

244
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,190
They're young stuff behind you there.

245
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,190
You want to know what the next year
you life's going to be like? I, uh,

246
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,470
hopefully it's going to be
something like yours now,

247
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,970
while I've decided that I'm going
to, uh, I'm going to fucking

248
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,860
get myself that, like, rather
than looking at 50 would dread,

249
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,170
which I'm really not
considering it. I, you know,

250
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:27,000
so many of my friends had fucking
died, didn't even make it so, you know,

251
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,760
don't recommend DC. Don't tell me
he died. I swear to God. No, no,

252
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:32,880
we didn't see did last
weekend. Last one. The,

253
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,640
he fucking died of what?

254
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,940
Um,
there was like some Carter cardiac event.

255
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:43,270
One of his friends was like coming from
Connecticut and going down to Florida.

256
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,490
Hadn't seen Joe in life 15 years.

257
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,610
Stopped by his house to then they're
going to go to the Improv to watch, uh,

258
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,210
Lavelle Crawford. And Joe said he
had a headache. I went upstairs.

259
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,040
It takes him like aspirin or whatever and
like sit on the bed and like laid back

260
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:58,160
and Kroger while his buddy was there
that he hadn't seen it. 15 years

261
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,310
wash. Yeah. Isn't that crazy?

262
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,050
Oh my to that guy had one of my favorite
fucking jokes were about the compo. No,

263
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,903
the joke he did

264
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,860
when he was having unprotected
sex with the woman. You know,

265
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,200
when it goes on to my thing and I'm
doing my things, she goes, chalk,

266
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,470
don't you come and me,
don't you come and meet Joel job.

267
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,530
Goddamn you don't come to me. And
he goes, I blocks all that out.

268
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,360
Yeah.

269
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,520
Joe was hilarious.
I haven't seen him in fucking,

270
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,170
I haven't seen him in like 15 years.
I was going to be my chairs that now.

271
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,640
Ah Jeez. Ah, fuck

272
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,600
yeah. What we're getting at that age
where people are just dying and say,

273
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,550
you know what's really fucked up? Is that
what it is? It's behind that. I don't,

274
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,360
it's not even like shocking to me anymore.
Yeah. We only want to hear it now.

275
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,980
I used to be like,
oh my God.

276
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,890
But I was at my son's hockey game when
someone called me and he was like, Yo,

277
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,130
Joel, record on those, are you serious?
And he was like, yeah, want to know how?

278
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,570
And he's like, I don't know.
I'll find out. And I was
like, all right, call me back.

279
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,560
And My, my son talk again.
Well I have years ago,

280
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,920
what it is,
is the first wave that goes is,

281
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:09,980
it's usually a be bad genetics,

282
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:12,230
bad luck or bad diet.

283
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,960
And then after that it's like if you
had half a bad diet, half bad genetics,

284
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,310
just literally like when the grim reapers
going to get you. So speaking to that,

285
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:26,750
becoming an a dad at this point, like I
was fucking old as I am. I got, you know,

286
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,670
I've cut back on the Busan and uh,
so I'm,

287
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:33,710
I'm trying to get myself
down to my fucking, uh,

288
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,700
to my fight and weight and actually maybe
get a personally you look fit. Yeah.

289
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:38,460
I I I,

290
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,460
I took four months off of booze and then
for the last month I've been drinking

291
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:46,310
like lightly,
but I don't know,

292
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,490
I think I'm just too old now because I
took those fucking four months off and

293
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:51,550
now going back to it,
just, I get to the next,

294
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,000
I drink too and I'm just like
banged up the next day. Yup. Um, so,

295
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,690
I dunno, I think I'm going to go,
I was joking that I'm going to go,

296
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,040
I'm going to be like staying in my fifties
just to like fucking pilates and yoga

297
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,250
and tantric six,
try to learn how to come for 40 minutes.

298
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,080
That's how a lot of his
music is his recorded.

299
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,360
A lot of people don't know
that it's actually him coming.

300
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,360
And the beginning of a
synchronicity is that Ed.

301
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:24,330
Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

302
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,150
That's him.
That's him.

303
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,430
They've caught him and I record on
favorite quarterback and his wife. Right.

304
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:33,600
For the first 40 minutes.

305
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:36,780
Then the last five minutes he just sings
this song and right as he comes that

306
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,853
stuff.

307
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,023
Yeah.

308
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,860
Gordon, some enough going.
So Gordon in there, Jeez.

309
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,580
I saw him at a, I saw him at the Hollywood
bowl with, um, Emma said Gaylord Perry.

310
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:53,430
It's a pitcher. Who's the guy from genesis
that sank? Sledgehammer. Peter Gabriel.

311
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,930
[inaudible]. Oh yeah, yeah. They both
were fucking awesome. And they had like,

312
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,300
and I was like, all right,
who's gonna? Who's gonna open,

313
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:01,950
who's going to fucking clothes?
And they just,

314
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,990
one would sing a song and then the next
one come out and sing a song and then

315
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,800
they were just both out there and if
there was the other person saw and they

316
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,870
would just sync back up early.
Oh yeah,

317
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,560
that's still Peter Gabriel had like
synchronized dance moves and shit.

318
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,150
It was fucking finish and they were bad.

319
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,780
But that was part of the joke when you
just see was he didn't give a fuck late.

320
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:22,980
It was like two guys like daughter plays
with them too sometimes. Is that right?

321
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,620
I was like the violin and she comes
out and crosses on the violin.

322
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,780
I'm trying to remember
if he had a violinist.

323
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,160
I just know that he was just like the guy
just aged and said fuck it was staying

324
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:36,990
was you know, still in shape and
shit. So PT gator look terrible now.

325
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,410
Oh Dude. He came out looking like, you
know that headliner that didn't make it.

326
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,500
If just doesn't give a fuck anymore. It
comes out with like where I like, oh,

327
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,250
the same sweatsuit he was wearing.
When you pick them up at the airport,

328
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,770
just walks on stage,
maybe put a hat on.

329
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,160
He had a be in a big ones that you on.

330
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,850
Staying always has one of those fucking
those clothes that looks like he's going

331
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:00,684
to do a,

332
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,680
what does that movie did with the Tina
Turner where she shaved the side of her

333
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:07,470
head? Oh my. Um, Thunderdome. Thunderdome.

334
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:10,620
I feel like he got a bunch of clothes
from that movie that still fed them.

335
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,700
He still has a trailer, the
wardrobe trailer, all that Mesh.

336
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:19,140
Spiderman looking shit,
flashy underwear peeking out of the back.

337
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,690
Shane Shane Bell shirt.
Yeah, I saw those guys.

338
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:28,900
They fucking, they absolutely killed
it here. I got to make shit. What,

339
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,410
20 minutes then at some point I do
have to read a little to advertising,

340
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:33,960
but I'm do who's your
fucking Internet provider?

341
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,120
T and t minus just, it's just not
happening for me. Yeah, I think I might,

342
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:41,940
I don't even know who I have.
Nia handles that and it's,

343
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,770
it's just been on the Fritz. I gotta
drive the Fritz. It's been on the Fritz.

344
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,880
I've got to drive over to
Starbucks. Buy something. Starbucks.

345
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,620
I don't drink coffee. All
right. I mean I guess they,

346
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,490
the coffee has to be amazing
maternity line. Strong as it is.

347
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,260
You don't need to be Katherine. Oh, you
know, I don't know. Worst wired as well.

348
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,110
I'm the worst dude. I, I need
like the reverse of that.

349
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,650
But you go into all of that food just
sucks all of their food just fucking

350
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:13,590
sucks. All right, let me, let me read a
little advertising here. Um, how much,

351
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:15,720
how much has been done, how much time
are you going to do when you special?

352
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,410
I'm doing an hour hour
that's doing it now.

353
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,560
Maybe a little longer so we can cut
it down. All I do is a little long.

354
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,370
I would do like whatever
you you want it to be.

355
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:29,250
I would only do a little bit
more than that. Yeah, cause yeah,

356
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:31,550
it makes it to your life so much easier.
If you,

357
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,240
if you want to do an hour special,
do like an hour and 10 are,

358
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,760
then you usually just lift a bit.

359
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:40,650
Or to the same guys that are shooting
want special shot only Adams special that

360
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,600
he's uh, they said that, uh,

361
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,230
the only like an hour and 20 minutes and
that they wanted to cut it down to an

362
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,660
hour because showtime wasn't buying
an hour, 20 minutes specials.

363
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,510
They're just buying ours. Then you've
got a set of killing your babies.

364
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,410
That's the doors.

365
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,550
But he refused to cut it and so they
just took it out in an hour and 20.

366
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,270
So if you watch the special that's on
right now, that's on showtime right now.

367
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:02,410
It's an hour and 20 minutes.

368
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,180
Jesus only yams telling the business
which way it's going. Wow. Call this.

369
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:11,590
I would've been like, all right, I'll cut
it down. All right. Oh, look, all the sip.

370
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,540
Great. Talk about the challenge
of finding great talent.

all he does is he just loses like fucking
10 pounds and then he just sort of

And I'll do you guys,
do you guys celebrate Valentine's Day?

447
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:06,500
Is there now at this point, how long
have you guys been together? Since 95.

448
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,580
That's great man. Yeah, you 23 years,

449
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:15,810
but it took me till 2004 to tie the
knot. Oh yeah. What did they serve?

450
00:26:15,811 --> 00:26:20,780
She was the one that somebody uses
that like 10 years, man. Wait, 2000.

451
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:25,360
One, 2004, 2004. So that's
nine years old by, uh,

452
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,450
it took me

453
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:33,290
when I was doing it took me nine years
to really the fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Stupid.

454
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:37,410
I knew in nine months, but I was
just like, I don't know. Right.

455
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,850
And then also my wife was a
little bit of a commitment.

456
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:44,220
Phobe we're both like commitment
phobes yet totally relationship people.

457
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:46,670
So it totally worked. You know what
I mean? Right. So we lived there,

458
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,310
our whole sid and Nancy fucking lifestyle
for awhile, you know, not married,

459
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:53,220
no kids.
Partying had a great time.

460
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:57,100
We did that for awhile to
hit all the water parks,

461
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,990
the magic t shirts. Oh
yeah. Matching me undies.

462
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,820
Uh, it took me forever to propose to her,
but I'll tell you why, why it happened.

463
00:27:06,821 --> 00:27:09,550
I went out partying with friends of mine
one night and I ended up spending an ad

464
00:27:09,551 --> 00:27:14,080
out in Virginia and I was on my way
back the next day, like 10:00 AM.

465
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,540
And my wife was furious.
She was my girlfriend at the time.

466
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:19,090
We were living together and she
was furious and she called me.

467
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,640
She already left me a message and I
checked the message and then she called me

468
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:23,530
again when we were driving home.
I don't know.

469
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,570
And so when I picked up
the phone and said, hey,

470
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:29,530
I was just was out here thinking with
my friends. The reason I was like,

471
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,870
I'm out here with my friends that spread
the night that it's like I was talking

472
00:27:31,871 --> 00:27:34,600
to a man, I think, uh, I think I'm
ready to settle down and marry you.

473
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,110
Wow. That was in that way. She,

474
00:27:38,111 --> 00:27:41,790
that you had to come up with that
she know that she better condition.

475
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,720
She will now when she listens
to this Nellie way. Oh Dude,

476
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:49,150
I want to get you in trouble. So what
does she do? What's that? She was like,

477
00:27:49,151 --> 00:27:52,860
really? Oh my God, I can't wait for
you to come home. And I was like,

478
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,890
dude, I didn't want to have
a fight what I at home for,

479
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,820
for spending the night out. So yeah,
so that defused the whole fight.

480
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,783
Then it was coming up

481
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,220
and set you up for another thousand
more in the next year there.

482
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,410
Um, I, I just want to fuck did I do?

483
00:28:09,411 --> 00:28:13,550
And I finally just realized, uh, yeah.

484
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:18,480
I just knew she was going to
leave Sundays off the pot. No,

485
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:22,580
it was some days when I was mad at her.
I would fantasize about breaking up,

486
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:25,580
but even in the fantasy of her
breaking up when she would walk out,

487
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:28,260
even in the fantasy of that, I
would still go, no, no, no, no, no.

488
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,140
That sounds like all right. I got
to make, oh yeah, that's, that's,

489
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,280
that was the,
Paul Versey helped me get through that.

490
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:42,020
Poverty has actually helped a
number of comedians get over that.

491
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,100
Like, uh, that's, that's thing, you
know, you think it's a mountainous,

492
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:49,530
you just stepping up on the
curb, which just like, dude,
where are you going? Right.

493
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,860
Or do you know she's going to be so happy.

494
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,370
You're going to be happy once you get
through the fucking vows and all of that

495
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:58,520
bullshit. Then you just said a party with
all your friends and is fucking great.

496
00:28:58,521 --> 00:29:03,470
He was, he was 100% 100%
fucking right. So, um,

497
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,880
I was going to ask you, do you
guys go out on Valentine's Day? No,

498
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:07,723
we don't really sell celebrating.

499
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,180
Like what? I'm going to chocolate. There's
nothing like that or cards, you know,

500
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,830
we might know we have the kids,
so a lot of the times we're just a,

501
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,840
we'll wait till the kids go to sleep
and then we'll have a bottle of wine and

502
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:19,990
watch a movie or some downstairs, some
corny like that. And that's way better.

503
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:23,260
We're going to go an hour and go out to
dinner. Like, dude, we're so old now.

504
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,170
Sometimes it feels like a,
we want to go out and have a good time.

505
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:26,680
So we're gonna like,

506
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,770
we're gonna go out to dinner and then go
into Hollywood and get some drinks and

507
00:29:29,771 --> 00:29:32,510
maybe go to a dance club or whatever that
by the time we're done eating dinner,

508
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,800
like you just go home. Uh, and it's,

509
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,590
how psyched are you on the other person
says that? Yeah, this is like, yes, yes,

510
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:42,160
I do. Just want to go. I don't want to
go to Hollywood right now. Yeah. Like I,

511
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,090
I for years would rather drink at home.
I got better stuff here.

512
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:48,980
Then they got out at the bar. They
always have some shit stuff in the rape.

513
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:50,560
You all the praise also.
Yeah.

514
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,430
And once you're with the person you're
going to be with that they got the worst

515
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,790
booze. I'm not interested
in meeting anybody. Right.

516
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,460
So all I'm going to do is go out there
and then I've got to deal with like how

517
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:03,250
am I getting fucking home? This is before
like Uber and all that Shit. I've been,

518
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:06,760
I've been drinking at home
the for for years.

519
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,420
[inaudible] have some like,
yeah, we have what? Bourbon.

520
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,690
Bourbon whiskeys. Scott. I think
Tequila. Yeah, there's really smokey,

521
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:21,310
I think whiskey. One time I was here
that was probably a scotch. Scotch.

522
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:26,350
It was like, yeah, it wasn't good. Yeah,
it was good. Oh, did we smoke cigars? Uh,

523
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,630
oh no, no. I don't think we
did because as I was thinking,

524
00:30:28,631 --> 00:30:31,660
my daughter just had her first birthday
and I was looking at the house.

525
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,290
And to do that, we had like
16 kids over here. Really all,

526
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,240
I have friends who have kids now
cause you know, once you have a kid,

527
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:39,010
all your friends who don't have kids,

528
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:43,120
it's just like they keep live in their
rock star life and you're like, you just,

529
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,550
you get like six more calls.
Like Ah,

530
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,640
you got gotta watch the kid and he gets
the gist. You just fade out and started.

531
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,120
Yet they start disappearing.
Horizon, you just fade out. Uh,

532
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,330
like that bad member who's on
the first album and he goes like,

533
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,720
what am I fucking half that can
happen. Then they, then, you know,

534
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:01,780
they never see that guy until like the
VH one behind the music. He's just like,

535
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,820
why am I,
you know,

536
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,700
they're putting out a second album and
they just didn't have a call me and all

537
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:10,990
of a sudden I was just like,
we're like, get them out. Um,

538
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,440
yes. So I was looking around
the living room and we had like,

539
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,480
like 16 little kids in there. Oh
my goodness. Agency encounter.

540
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,020
Yeah.

541
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:24,520
And just like toys Galore and
just shit all over the place.

542
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:26,770
And I was just looking,
thinking like, you know,

543
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,480
18 months ago this would
have been five of my friends.

544
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:35,020
We would have been getting shit faced
watching a game and smoking cigars and

545
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:38,560
just how like how much it changes
in a good way. Like we went to the,

546
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,360
went to the park today for
the first time I went over,

547
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:45,840
I put her on the swing and shit. She loved
it. Oh yes. Squeeze means the greatest.

548
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,990
See all your pictures and video
of that man because of high,

549
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,860
Nelson goes by so fast and you'll look
back at those pictures with a tear in

550
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:52,720
your eye.
Oh I know I'm already doing it.

551
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,330
I'm already like this a
part of me that's like uh,

552
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,590
uh as psyched as I am to be a dad there,

553
00:31:58,591 --> 00:32:02,440
there was a mild depression with
her turning one going like ah,

554
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:04,260
she's not a baby anymore man.
She's a Todd.

555
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,360
The next year she turns to her age
doubled in a year. Yeah she's helped.

556
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,380
But I see why people keep having babies
cause you just want to keep hitting

557
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:13,720
reset row cause it's so fucking awesome.

558
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:18,721
And I like talking in a positive way about
it because when my wife got pregnant,

559
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:22,450
just so many people said all this
negative shit and they all do yo know boys

560
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,910
Lincoln, it's over for you. Yeah,
no more getting a little coozie plus

561
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,290
no more go into Thailand and
see what's up over there.

562
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,630
Like all this degenerate shit.
And I was just like, yeah,

563
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:37,000
this is way better than that shit though.
Yes.

564
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:42,260
Now today we were over there and was just
uh, I was having the best time and I I,

565
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:44,540
you know, it was yeah, it was quite good.

566
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:49,450
Clean Fun is actually getting a little
bit of exercise right. Um, clean and, and,

567
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:53,240
and she kind of took her first
step in the park, which was cool.

568
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,390
And uh,
so yeah,

569
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,450
so now we figured out what the motivation
tactic was to get it going. Dude.

570
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:02,870
I see you have to tell you what's fucked
up though was Imani is the definition

571
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:07,250
of organic in the deaf in the dictionary
versus the definition of organic within

572
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:11,600
the food industry. Like they
literally changed it like with law,

573
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:16,250
what organic means. Cause I know when,
when we're giving her like poisonous shit,

574
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:21,440
she's fucking so excited to eat it.
Like the real organic,

575
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,830
no, no, no, no, no. The shit
that they call it organic,

576
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:26,570
but it's really got like fucking this,
like,

577
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:30,410
like they try to get you addicted to it,
like cigarettes,

578
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,150
the same fucking thing.

579
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:37,150
So we had these little puffs
that said organic on them and uh,

580
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,990
I just noticed that like,

581
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:42,020
we would have like really good food and
she would start pointing at the other

582
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,420
ones, like a lab rat. And
then one time I went to reach,

583
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:48,360
just reached for the can and she
started like hopping up like, yeah man,

584
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:54,590
give me a hit. So you should either fix.
Yeah. So, um, yeah, we phased those out.

585
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,670
I'm actually, that's not true. We
have, we have one more canned down,

586
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:01,580
so we're going to wean her off
and then it's all, you know,

587
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:05,030
she's a kid so she doesn't see it. She's
not going to be thinking of them. But, um,

588
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:09,830
I, that's the thing that's, uh,
that can also drive you nuts is, uh,

589
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,950
that type of shit. And then
if you have any sort of, um,

590
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,560
friend with a kid in your life that is
totally up on all these issues and then

591
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,020
they just, they just come
to you. It's like a fucking,

592
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:25,370
it's like this cloud of
fear that they just dump on.

593
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:27,740
You go to this website,
you have to fucking

594
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:28,783
being a dad and I,

595
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,900
we have friends like that or at least
a couple in their fucking annoying and

596
00:34:32,901 --> 00:34:35,300
it's like,
and even though our kid likes their kid,

597
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,210
we have to like cut them back a little
bit and I'm like, my daughter's like,

598
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:41,210
well when did she come over? And I'm
like, if the kid comes over is fine,

599
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:42,950
but I can't have the parents
come over here to like,

600
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,330
did you get your kids vaccinated?

601
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,533
How do you handle that?

602
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,470
Because that's what I realize
now is that you can have like,

603
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,270
you can be friends with people,

604
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,600
like a couple of you and your wife are
friends with a couple and then all of a

605
00:34:54,601 --> 00:34:55,200
sudden,

606
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,080
and they have kids but you don't have
kids so you're not dealing with them on

607
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:00,960
that level. But then when you have
a kid, the relationship changes.

608
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:04,440
Now you not only do you guys have to
like get along socially when you go out,

609
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,770
you know, you both vibe.
You got to kind of on some,

610
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,790
they gotta be within your wheelhouse
of how they raise their fucking kid.

611
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:16,350
And if the kid comes over and he's a
fucking lunatic like bite and a dog and

612
00:35:16,351 --> 00:35:19,780
shit like Elon, what? What is this cave
man? You got to kind of be like, oh,

613
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:21,210
I don't want my kid acting like that.

614
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,840
Right? No, we have a,

615
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,870
I'm not saying any names says I don't
want to alienate any people that might be

616
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,481
listening to this,

617
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:31,480
but we have one family who has a kid
that's just fucking rude and I can't have

618
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,610
it and I just, I cannot stand. But my,

619
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,710
my kid wants this kid to
come over and was like,

620
00:35:37,711 --> 00:35:41,970
Jesus Christ should we lends this fucking
kid come over and then like maybe they

621
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:44,400
changed over the last six months and
they come spend the night and it's a

622
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:46,650
fucking nightmare.
What are the rules?

623
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,310
If a kid comes home and he's rude,

624
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,460
like what can you say
now to a fucking kid?

625
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,910
Did I started just getting serious
with it all? I do go back to the bed,

626
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,390
go back to bed.

627
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:00,770
So I fucking waking up every 10 minutes
of calling for your mommy and then

628
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,080
when I say I'm going to call
your mommy, there's, you
know, no, don't call my mommy.

629
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,950
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm like,
then do, what the fuck are you doing?

630
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:09,910
I don't say fuck no, no, cause I
don't know. I'm not going to be linen.

631
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,460
Shut the fuck up.
You being a fucking asshole.

632
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,750
All right, so I'd be a little asshole.
Notice that I told my wife. Am I doing,

633
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,370
he gets up one more time.
I'm not talking to them.

634
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,680
You got to talk to them cause
I'm going to start getting mad.

635
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,360
Do you remember back in the day,
like if your friend's Dad said anything,

636
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:27,850
you will fail.
You are afraid of us,

637
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:32,640
right? Yeah. Hell yeah. Go back to
the room and go to bed. Like, Oh shit,

638
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,750

639
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,930
and it needs to come down. I hate that
they call me by my first name tied.

640
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:42,670
No they don't. Yes I did.
Todd. I'm scared. Can you
call my mommy? I'm old school.

641
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,800
I'm old speech. He had called
me Mr. Burke that said let him,

642
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,750

You Little Shit. I won't say that,

645
00:36:58,231 --> 00:37:00,930
but that's what I'll be thinking.
So that of course, as I say,

00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:10,350
And then he'll say to his mother and yeah,

649
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,240
right. Let's walk. A little girl comes
over to her house and she was like,

650
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,111
she'll come downstairs,

651
00:37:15,111 --> 00:37:18,500
I sleep in all morning and then come down
with the kids where my wife and I are.

652
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:20,960
My daughter's still asleep and she'll
come downstairs before everybody and she

653
00:37:20,961 --> 00:37:24,980
be like, what's for breakfast? And
my wife was like, well, you know,

654
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:27,680
pancakes and sausage. She was like,
yeah, I don't like that stuff.

655
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:30,620
What else is there?
And my wife says looks at me and was like,

656
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,860
this is a bit serious right now.
Like oh the fuck back upstairs.

657
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,790
Yeah, what the fuck? Oh my,

658
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,870
I would love to hear a kid now
and he's saying to my mother,

659
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,690
my mother would just be, well
that's all there is. I guess.

660
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:42,890
You know I've talked to you at lunch.

661
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,180
My wife's a lawyer says,

662
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:46,990
I guess you'll just be hungry then cause
that's what we're having. If you're in,

663
00:37:46,991 --> 00:37:48,440
if you don't need to
just going to be hungry.

664
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:52,130
It's amazing how like some of these kids
are rude to sit and you say something

665
00:37:52,131 --> 00:37:56,930
to the parents were like, yeah, she's a
little crazy. She, she's, she's like, no,

666
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,240
now that's, that's like when people have
a dog that's fucking nuts. Like I did,

667
00:38:01,241 --> 00:38:05,560
but I, I quarantine the thing when people
would come over except one time I got a

668
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:08,560
little confident and watch to me the
dog whisperers and then my friend end up

669
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:13,350
getting bit j law had got bit by a dog.
Yeah. Bit of on his calf given nip.

670
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:14,400
Um,

671
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,840
yeah,
that dog scared the living shit out of me.

672
00:38:15,841 --> 00:38:19,740
One time we were downstairs and
there she was in a cage. Oh yeah.

673
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:21,930
That doesn't know that she was in there.
And I was like walking past

674
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:26,090
and like went out the case with the
battle of the cage and scare the fucking

675
00:38:26,091 --> 00:38:29,870
Piss island all point. God Yvette
Cage, I'll be shredded right now. Yeah.

676
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,480
Yeah.
She was an adorable Hell Hound.

677
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,880
She loved the hell out of me and
about six people and everybody else.

678
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:41,830
She treated as a fucking intruder.
And, uh, I just, you know,

679
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,610
it was the smartest, most painful, uh,

680
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:50,290
decision I ever made, but I didn't
understand, uh, that I was still going,

681
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,300
I guess are, you know, the last two
days in a row she's in town, uh,

682
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,560
like you've kinda still take care of her
in a way, right? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah,

683
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,920
definitely. And I get pictures
of her all the time and when,

684
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:07,300
like once every two months she'll
come to town and I just take for,

685
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:11,330
for a hike every single day like this.
You remember, you're like, Yup. Anyway,

686
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,980
she did and she does. She
does. And uh, if, when I,

687
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,250
when I go out to where the guy lives,
if I show up,

688
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:20,470
she's kind of looked cause she's not
used to seeing me down. You know,

689
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:23,380
first they see the shape and it's
the smell like the whole way that dog

690
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:27,970
brainworks or whatever. Right.
And then, um, then, you know,

691
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:30,340
then she's all back to normal
and everything. But I got to,

692
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,210
I was nervous meeting her because of
the way she was because I knew at that

693
00:39:34,211 --> 00:39:37,240
point she had bonded with the new person
and it might view me as like a threat.

694
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:42,190
I mean the dog was like through that
dog. It, my buddy said that there, uh,

695
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,180
as Cleo Ferzli yeah, verse he goes to,
this should be a 30 for 30 on that dog,

696
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,170
that dog's life. Like how it was
abandoned by the La River. I mean,

697
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:53,740
so many times this thing should've
just been like, you know,

698
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:55,150
like whenever the Olympics come around,

699
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:58,240
they always have like those crazy stories
that make you tear up all the shit

700
00:39:58,241 --> 00:40:01,390
that they went through. Like,
you could do that other yeah.

701
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:05,380
And like as a pitbull be in that
big of a pain in the ass like that,

702
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:10,030
those things, if those things sneeze, they
get put down, it's fucking terrible. But,

703
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:15,400
um, the fact that she still like living
this awesome life, uh, makes me feel good.

704
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:18,590
And every time I see her, like,
um, you know, the dude had gotten,

705
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:21,760
it was my former trainer,
so, uh, and he, he just like,

706
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,360
she has her first dog friend now.
Every dog, she tried to murder,

707
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:27,950
now she's like friends with the dog,
but like they,

708
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:32,340
they needed like his level talent like is
he says jokingly said, yeah, I'm, I've,

709
00:40:32,341 --> 00:40:34,990
I've been slow cooking or she's
not someone that you like, okay,

710
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:36,490
this is how it is.
And then boom to that,

711
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:40,930
it's just been this year long thing
that she's now finally ready to just,

712
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,870
and even when he started hanging,
she started hanging out with another dog.

713
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:49,170
There was this whole fucking process that
he had to go through and totally keep

714
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:53,590
an eye on my dog because my dog does
this shit where like when she's going to

715
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:58,210
attack, she's in the cage. Wow. She did
that shit, but she was out in the open.

716
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,570
Um, she just made the decision.
There was no growling,

717
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:05,020
there was no warnings going right.
She just did it. She just, she had,

718
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:06,370
she would just fucking do it.

719
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,560
Let me read 'em let me read some of
the questions here. All right. Um,

720
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,680
taught by the way, you're gonna. You're
gonna fucking, I can already tell, Dude,

721
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:17,680
you're already wound up about this thing.
You're going to fucking murder, dude.

722
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:18,923
Thank you there.

723
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,890
I'm excited about it. I really am.
I feel like this is like, you know,

724
00:41:21,891 --> 00:41:24,620
I've been doing this shit for so long
and I'm at the age right now. Like,

725
00:41:24,621 --> 00:41:27,130
if it doesn't fucking pop for me right
now, it's not going to fucking happen.

726
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,810
Nah, that's, that's the old dude.
That's the old way of thinking.

727
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,930
You're totally in control.

728
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,280
I do this business like it's a giant mall.
Okay.

729
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:41,450
And I have my little store in the
mall and you walk into my store, hey,

730
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:45,770
why don't I tell jokes? I
do a podcast. Got a cartoon,

731
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:50,600
see anything you like. That's what I'm
selling. If you don't fucking like it,

732
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:55,550
I get it. See you later. But when I
first got into this business, I would,

733
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,310
you know, it's like you're walking around
the mall. Oh my God. This selling shirts.

734
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:02,240
I gotta sell shirts. Oh Fuck Day. They
got sneakers. I've gotta be doing.

735
00:42:02,241 --> 00:42:05,390
You try to like do everything with
the Joneses. Right. Fuck that too.

736
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:08,480
Just by the way, your cartoon is
fucking hilarious. I'll thank you.

737
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:12,700
Frank Murphy and a vicar. Motu Vera
guys. Oh yeah. You wait till the UHC,

738
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:17,000
you wait for the third season where
we're editing, editing like fades.

739
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,970
It's going to be out later on this year.
I'm not allowed to say exactly when.

740
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:23,690
I don't have an exact date either.
But like Netflix has like, you know,

741
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:27,440
they like the fucking geniuses
of this new thing is they, they,

742
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,140
I remember the last time
like, well last time, uh,

743
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,970
when I had a special coming out there,

744
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:35,930
they wanted me to come in to meet
with them to like talk about,

745
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:38,870
discuss promoting it. And
I'm thinking like, what the
fuck are we going to discus?

746
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:41,990
Throw up a couple of billboards. I'll talk
about my podcast. Dude. I went in there,

747
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:47,330
it was like bill Belicheck
shit until, I can't even,

748
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,520
I can't even explain it.
Like I went in there going like,

749
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:53,660
this is ridiculous that this is just an
idiot like me with a bunch of Dick Jokes.

750
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:54,770
And then I just,
I,

751
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,920
I watched them breaking down to how
they were going go up promoting it.

752
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,540
Like two people who are watching Netflix
and their fucking algorithm and all of

753
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,630
that shit judged by what you
watched and all that shit.

754
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,420
And not saying it's a perfect
system. It, it blew my mind.

755
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,590
Just fucking blew my mind.
They didn't listen. Dude.

756
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,720
There's a reason why they're
global right now. Um,

757
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,670
and it's not from hanging out with me
there. All right. A peach cobbler recipe.

758
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:26,330
Hey Billy Cross king. I like
to bake by the way. Yeah.

759
00:43:26,331 --> 00:43:29,420
I mean my daughter told me that before
I made my daughter a birthday cake.

760
00:43:29,421 --> 00:43:31,390
I'm doing that every
year of a life's easy.

761
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:36,110
Are you doing the non GMO with the no.
Gluten, the non tasty for us. Oh No.

762
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:40,100
There was a bunch of sugar and fucking
nice stuff on talking dead baby seals in

763
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:43,970
it.
That's a big politically incorrect cake.

764
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,200
Um, alright. Deliberately crest king.

765
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,720
I am invited to a super
bowl party by the way.

766
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:52,340
You know the Patriots are
in it again this year.

767
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,360
Do you realize if Tom Brady
gets another ring? Jesus, Chris,

768
00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:00,530
him and bill Belicheck we'll have more
rings than every franchise in the NFL

769
00:44:00,531 --> 00:44:03,590
except for the Pittsburgh
Steelers. There'll be tied. Wow.

770
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,020
Then their entire 50 years,

771
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,920
50 something years of every franchise
trying to win one at Brady doesn't lose

772
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:12,470
though. I'll just let you know
that right now. Yeah, he does.

773
00:44:12,471 --> 00:44:14,240
He lost twice to the giants.
I think this is going to be,

774
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:17,330
it's just give him the
ring. No, no, no, no, no.

775
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,490
That talk makes me nervous
through the eagles.

776
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,810
The Eagles got a fucking
horrific horrifically
terrifying fucking running game.

777
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:25,400
And uh,

778
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,850
nick folds is not a backup quarterback
that as a starting quarterback who lost

779
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:32,430
his fucking job and he's coming
back like a fucking revenge movie.

780
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,940
That defense looks,
looks fucking great row.

781
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,410
And I don't think we would have done
to the vikings what they did. So yeah,

782
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:44,760
I dunno. I would say take the, trying to
be humbled and to keep the gods happy.

783
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:49,380
Take the eagles and the points. That's
what, that's what I would do with my mind.

784
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:54,780
I'm not doing Edelman's out.
Gronk got a concussion. Um,

785
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,410
Ammon Dola had the game of his
fucking life. Did you get that song?

786
00:44:58,411 --> 00:45:02,590
The Hammond Dola Song? Ah, it's like
that song, Lola. Really? Oh Dude.

787
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,740
It's fucking go.

788
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:09,130
D O l a doe now that play a nick fold
and the super bowl as far as it may not

789
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:15,210
show old. Alright. Hey Billy. Chris King.

790
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:19,470
I'm invited to a Superbowl party.
Don't worry.

791
00:45:19,471 --> 00:45:23,820
Just dude's and nobody interested in
commercials or half time shows. Thank God.

792
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:27,660
And I am the designated dessert maker.
Uh,

793
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:31,080
you are talking about peach cobbler
on a Monday morning podcast,

794
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:34,500
but I can't quite remember if it was
a recent one or an old one. Anyway,

795
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:38,220
would you mind sharing your recipe with
me? Because I want to have the real deal.

796
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:43,410
I'm from Germany and can't figure out
if the recipes I find here any good hope

797
00:45:43,411 --> 00:45:45,180
to hear from you and go fuck yourself.

798
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:50,181
I just googled and looked at pictures and
then I found one that looked good law.

799
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,770
This is what I would say. I would say, uh,

800
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,700
I would say if the cinnamon,
nutmeg,

801
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:03,630
whatever they tell you to fucking put in,
add more,

802
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,080
cause they always be like an
eighth of a teaspoon of court.

803
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,900
They're going to make it taste good,
but they're not gonna make it taste great.

804
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:14,070
So definitely be tasting you're filling
and don't be afraid to get a little

805
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,380
light, a little heavy handed
with some of the spices,

806
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:19,200
especially the cinnamon sugar.
A little bit of some butter in there.

807
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,970
And then I give it a little Dustin before
I closed the Pi of the, the really?

808
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,000
Oh yeah, you got, it's gotta to be
a big fucking delicious going mess.

809
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,450
Um, that's how I do it too. It,
everything's gonna be on fucking baking.

810
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:35,130
I'm trying to get you all right.
Political relationship advice. Oh God.

811
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,530
Here we go. All right, let
me, I want to hear this one.

812
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,980
I literally unfollow people on Twitter
if all they do is talk politics.

813
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,420
Unless you're rationally kind of trash
in both sides, but like, you know,

814
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:49,950
it's going to be like, you know,
so our Trump just did this.

815
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,420
It's just like, all right. I will tell
you that. Well, I mean, yeah, I mean,

816
00:46:54,421 --> 00:46:56,910
trauma one sided to Conan,

817
00:46:56,911 --> 00:47:00,270
Conan O'Brien and the funniest fucking
joke about Trump. They go, how do you, uh,

818
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:01,463
Andall the whole trumps that she,

819
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,900
what's the hardest part about the
Trump situation right now? He goes,

820
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:08,130
he goes trying to write a joke that's more
absurd than what's actually happening.

821
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:15,950
I like how we have like
Trump on Twitter just is,

822
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:20,670
it's just considered normal now that
like a president has the time to,

823
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,830
I don't even like people
shit on me all the time.

824
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:27,820
I don't even get back to them watching
the quote leader of the free world or

825
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:32,140
this is all just, you know,
that wasn't a stain on my tie.

826
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,800
That was actually a presidential seal.
The all right.

827
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,450
Political relationship advice.
Hey Billy Willy Concoct,

828
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,050
I don't know what that
means. That's an, you know,

829
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,800
one with a little bit of alliteration,
uh,

830
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,550
to pair love the podcast and of
course the stand up. Thank you.

831
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,560
You're the only comic that actually
makes me bust out laughing. I'll wait.

832
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:53,360
You see Todd special cheese.

833
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:57,760
So I'm a 21 year old guy and I've been
seeing this girl now for about nine

834
00:47:57,761 --> 00:48:00,610
months. She's great. Treats
me good, loyal and is pretty,

835
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,850
all of these relationship things that
we start off like a horror movie.

836
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:08,170
Well that was all sunshine.
Everything. I'm 21 prime of
my life. I get darker ship,

837
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,580
everything's going great.
All right.

838
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:14,740
The main problem I have though
is she is a big Democrat,

839
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:18,700
big democratic.
It's promise.

840
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:23,410
She's a big democratic and
he's a super conservative. Uh,

841
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,650
she's black and I'm almost
as white as you. Oh God,

842
00:48:26,651 --> 00:48:28,360
this is like a fucking bad porno.

843
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:32,320
She gets upset when I post
political stuff on Facebook,

844
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:34,870
like pro a pro video of Trump,

845
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:40,530
but yet she posts all this stuff about
kneeling for flags and Obama is all that,

846
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:46,690
uh, yeah, dude does this relationship's
not going to fucking less. Uh,

847
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:51,340
she wouldn't even talk to me when I wore
a Trump shirt. Oh my God. Yeah. It's like,

848
00:48:51,341 --> 00:48:52,051
dude,
like this is,

849
00:48:52,051 --> 00:48:57,051
this is a guy who like sort of saw how
the Nazis were baited into running over

850
00:48:57,431 --> 00:49:01,270
somebody with a car going, well, you
know, there's hatred on both sides.

851
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,970
Um, dude, I really wanted to side
with you, but you know, this is,

852
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:10,150
this is like astoundingly fucking,
like,

853
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:14,540
I respect the fact that you like Trump
and all of that shit you want to wear as

854
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:19,420
t shirts, but your confusion that she
gets upset is a little fucking weird.

855
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:20,800
Uh,
touches me off.

856
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:24,070
But I don't want to ruin the whole
relationship over something as dumb as

857
00:49:24,071 --> 00:49:25,660
politics that's too late.

858
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:30,280
So since you are already in an interracial
relationship and for and for a lot

859
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:34,970
longer than me, period. What's
your advice? Question Mark?

860
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:41,350
The lovely mia. It's Nia with an end. Um,

861
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,330
can tell me her 2 cents as well, even
though she'll just side with the chick.

862
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:49,830
Just kidding. Thanks. And is
always go fuck yourself. Ps.

863
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,720
Tom Brady's the greatest
of all time. Ah Sir. Um,

864
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,990
I gotta be honest with you, like if you
don't understand why she is upset, um,

865
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:03,970
you'd have to try to put yourself in
her position and then read some of this

866
00:50:03,971 --> 00:50:08,170
shit and some of his opinions I
guess would be the best way to do it.

867
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,910
But I'm like,

868
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:13,840
you're not just a conservative if
you're were like rocking the t shirt,

869
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,910
like you're all in. You
know what I mean? Like a,

870
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:22,590
his girlfriend hates when I wear my
swastika tee shirts. Not that deep.

871
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,530
Do you think that's, it's that bad?
I mean he has, he hasn't run like,

872
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,070
I'm going to know mean no,

873
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:28,903
but I'm just saying

874
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,540
is he like a Trump icy,
like a Hitler light?

875
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:35,080
Ie

876
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,410
booze would hit Luby was that he's
gotta be like Moonshine. So where's

877
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,630
Trump Yeager?
He's a Yag of body.

878
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,230
Like that's shitty.
Bourbon goes schlog.

879
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,840
Yeah, he's like a Lulu flakes instead
of gold flakes. Yeah. Johnny Walker red.

880
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:59,020
And there's, there's no, there's
no, yeah, there's no fun.

881
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:03,210
Okay. And uh, got whatever soft
drink to fucking mixed with it.

882
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:06,630
What's the worst when you approach this?
What's the worst period of ahead?

883
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:11,280
Constantly. Yeah. College age. Ah, Shit.

884
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:14,010
Uh, Milwaukee's best. No.

885
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:18,120
Warren that or natty bow and there was
no Bohemian was pretty damn bad. Oh yeah.

886
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,020
I always hated was fucking a Bush light.

887
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,170
Bush light was like, Bush itself was
just, yeah, that was just like, yeah,

888
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:31,980
it was like water. And then they wanted
that town we used to eat. I never,

889
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:32,873
you know,
something.

890
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:37,710
I never got into Pabst blue ribbon
because I resented the hipsters that we're

891
00:51:37,711 --> 00:51:41,940
drinking them because it used to be this
blue collar beer that all these fucking

892
00:51:41,941 --> 00:51:43,050
townies drank.

893
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:48,060
And then all these hipster people
were wearing their a flannel shirts.

894
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:49,490
Well you know those shirts for awhile,

895
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:52,990
were they wearing like the gas station
shirt that had somebody else's name on it

896
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,460
where they actually had to do the fucking
job and they funded some thrift shop.

897
00:51:56,461 --> 00:51:59,850
Like my fantasy was that they ran
into the guy who owned the shirt.

898
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,440
They just walked up like,
Hey, I'm Jim. You know, it's,

899
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:08,070
oh I just needed a shirt and then
he gets the shit kicked out of them.

900
00:52:08,071 --> 00:52:12,900
But most of my fantasies are
violent. Um, my advice is,

901
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:18,690
uh, to, I don't if get a bunch of empathy.

902
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:21,660
Uh, I don't know. I don't, I
don't see this thing working.

903
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,810
I just don't see it working. That's
going to be like, cause you guys,

904
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:30,210
so if you're that far
away from each other,

905
00:52:30,211 --> 00:52:34,590
you're not going to get married and
have kids. Oh yeah. That's like,

906
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:38,130
yeah, there you'd be fighting over
them politically too. Like, so what?

907
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:41,020
They're going to be Democrats
or conservatives when they
grow up with a refill.

908
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,350
That's a whole nother can of worms.

909
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:46,720
Yeah.
So enjoy banging her and uh,

910
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,960
I would while she lets you while she
let you and then I would fucking, yeah,

911
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:53,170
I would just be like, yeah, but
he's also 21. He doesn't know.

912
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:57,040
He generally seems like he doesn't
understand unless that was just, you know,

913
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:59,890
sometimes people just lie and they
writing crazy shit. All right.

914
00:52:59,891 --> 00:53:03,190
Girlfriend drinks too much. Uh, dear bill,

915
00:53:03,191 --> 00:53:05,470
I was telling me you gotta help me
out with the problem I've been having.

916
00:53:05,471 --> 00:53:07,720
I've been living with my
girlfriend for almost a year now.

917
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:11,680
We are in our mid to late
twenties just for some background.

918
00:53:11,681 --> 00:53:15,510
Everything's going great except for one
thing we worked regular nine to five

919
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:19,060
type jobs, which means most of
the fun we have is on the weekend.

920
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:20,050
And like most people,

921
00:53:20,051 --> 00:53:23,710
we tend to lube up on the liquor while
we're out and about or even just staying

922
00:53:23,711 --> 00:53:26,790
in, well, I don't think anything
wrong with, with drinking.

923
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:30,600
My girlfriend doesn't know her limits
often. She will drink way too much,

924
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:35,750
too early and ended up passing out or
throwing up though commonly both will

925
00:53:36,361 --> 00:53:39,300
occur. Wow. Yeah. She
doesn't know how to drink.

926
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,110
You've got to pace yourself
out there. A few examples. Uh,

927
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:46,050
she will insist on watching a
movie after we've had a few drinks.

928
00:53:46,051 --> 00:53:48,540
We finally decide,
uh,

929
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:51,750
we'll put it on and then after
15 minutes she passes out.

930
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:55,830
Then I'll have to stop because of
course I can't watch it without her.

931
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:59,670
Yeah. What we'll teach her a lesson.
Watched the whole movie and be like,

932
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:03,090
you missed a great one and
in the end the Butler did it.

933
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,800
So lay off the booze cause I'm going
to start fucking doing that to you. Um,

934
00:54:07,801 --> 00:54:08,371
number two,

935
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:12,540
we went to a hockey game a few weeks
ago and when we got to the arena she

936
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:16,650
ordered me a beer and herself
to double gin and tonics.

937
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:21,390
Oh my God. She has a promo. We had
already had a couple of before arriving.

938
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:25,800
She then proceeded to down both of them
in 10 minutes before the puck drop and

939
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:29,370
passed out soon after
the hockey game by God.

940
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,050
That's the fucking problem.

941
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:35,880
I had to drag her up to stand for the
anthem and again when they were honoring

942
00:54:35,881 --> 00:54:40,230
the troops. This is fucking, this
is like a Kristen Wiig character.

943
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,990
Uh,
she then left for the washroom.

944
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:46,740
That's been one of my favorite scenes
though when she gets fucking wasted on the

945
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:50,390
plane in bridesmaids and she just,
when she goes [inaudible] the fuck is,

946
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:55,020
he was walking out, uh, I see.
Then left for the washroom,

947
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,440
but came back with two more doubled
Jen's a hotdog and a bag of popcorn,

948
00:55:00,661 --> 00:55:04,140
which she spilled and blamed it on me.
Oh my gosh.

949
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:08,280
Sounds like a episode of intervention.
Even if I did do it,

950
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:12,330
the first thing you're going to
do is snitch on me. All right.

951
00:55:12,331 --> 00:55:15,630
That just took a left turn. But,
uh, get the fuck out of here.

952
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,500
We're supposed to be a team,
but I digress. Sorry for
the rant. Uh, last weekend.

953
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,650
My God, these are all like
bullet pointed. By the way,

954
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:25,500
in the Uber ride home she preached,

955
00:55:25,501 --> 00:55:29,700
she proceeded to whip out
her tit to try and seduce me.

956
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,360
I told her to put it away because she
was in no condition and I didn't want to

957
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:38,190
fuck up my Uber rating
passes out. Wait, what?

958
00:55:38,191 --> 00:55:40,700
The passenger gets an Uber Rating.
Oh yeah.

959
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:45,770
The radio's too for the drivers.
That might actually boosted his rating.

960
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,220
The driver will look back and slows,
looks sloppy to me.

961
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:55,500
We'd fucking gin and tonic on it. Uh,
anyways, I'm gonna fuck up my Uber a pet.

962
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:59,820
She passes out 30 seconds later in pukes
in the elevator on the way up to the

963
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:02,220
apartment.
It didn't make it a lot.

964
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,410
It didn't make a lot of a mess as she was
able to hold it back before I got into

965
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:11,190
the toilet. Oh my God. This guy's
just truncate the piece de resistance.

966
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:16,290
Uh, she passed out during the bill
Burroughs show at the Sony Center. Uh,

967
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:20,550
how do you pass out for that create man
who just came in to entertain us? Uh,

968
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:25,060
just a pre face. I had an allergic
reaction that morning was toast.

969
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,660
Had a little bit of weed before the
show and I was able to be fully alert.

970
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,350
But yet you are the one that's
falling asleep. Jesus Christ.

971
00:56:33,351 --> 00:56:37,420
This is like the fucking war and peace.
This is like Barfly,

972
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:42,550
uh, saying all this. However, I have
to admit that I'm no saint either.

973
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:46,750
I arguably drank much more
than she, Ireland would drink
much more than she does,

974
00:56:46,751 --> 00:56:49,390
but I hold my boobs a
little better than she does.

975
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,390
I probably made her sound
worse than she actually is.

976
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:55,190
You gotta take it all away.
That going to go back a little.

977
00:56:55,191 --> 00:56:57,110
Now you already begin to
look like a drunken mess.

978
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,120
Yeah, but in truth, she's a wonderful
girlfriend who cooks with math for me.

979
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:06,430
Cleans to me is very beautiful.
Well in fucking live happily ever after,

980
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:08,020
which is not three sheets.

981
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:13,450
She's not puking on the
sheets and as you can tell,

982
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:16,840
is willing to come to a
hockey game with me. And yes,

983
00:57:16,841 --> 00:57:19,420
she did buy me bill bird
tickets for my birthday.

984
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:22,780
She is a truly amazing person and
I planned to marry her someday,

985
00:57:22,781 --> 00:57:26,500
but this is just getting out of
hand and I want my weekends back.

986
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,400
Can you do me a favor and turn that
light on my fucking eyes or a shot here?

987
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:35,770
The Sun's going down here. I'm not trying
to have a romantic podcast with you. Um,

988
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:41,770
uh, let's see here. I've had conversations
with her before and when she,

989
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:43,060
she's sober,
she gets it,

990
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:46,810
but it doesn't stop her when she's drunk
and she will get angry at me when I

991
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:50,590
tell her she's had enough and I can't
stop her from sneaking off to get secret

992
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,610
drinks with my money.

993
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:56,590
She feels bad and I honestly feel guilty
writing this to you and she is truly

994
00:57:56,591 --> 00:57:57,280
amazing.

995
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,490
I feel like he wrote the first half and
then she walked into the room and is

996
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:03,250
looking over his shoulder.
Um,

997
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:07,930
but it's tough not only for me,
but I know this is not easy on her,

998
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:10,960
but some to her body sometimes as well.

999
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,930
I just wanted her to be all right
and for us to be able to have a good,

1000
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:16,240
healthy time.
I'm not quite sure what to do here.

1001
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,400
Am I right to tell her that
she's got to take it easy,

1002
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:21,430
particularly when we go out
because it seems to be working.

1003
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,200
Do I have to set a better example and
drink less, if at all? Yeah. I mean,

1004
00:58:26,201 --> 00:58:29,770
if she's a fucking boots
town, maybe, uh, maybe both.

1005
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:35,530
Maybe both. Try to, uh,
drink a little bit less.

1006
00:58:35,531 --> 00:58:38,350
She might be one of those people,
you know, where once she has a kid,

1007
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:40,900
she'll just fucking knock
all that shit off. Or

1008
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:41,771
Oh God,

1009
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:44,920
I could just drive a rover the completely
where she just stays hammered all the

1010
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:45,600
time.

1011
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,200
Yeah. You'll have a drunken
baby, you know, coming out,

1012
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:52,960
fucking stop emailing and Bill
Byrd started emailing drew Pinsky

1013
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:58,530
it's
kid comes out dressed like foster Brooks,

1014
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,510
um,
to do a fucking,

1015
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:08,080
I love Boston Brooks run the
simulated drunk comedian. Oh yeah.

1016
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,320
It was fucking hilarious.

1017
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:12,700
And He, uh, and he never
really drank. Yeah. The way

1018
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,033
I know

1019
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:21,300
he had it down to like do,

1020
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:26,260
that's back when like being an alcoholic
was like funny, right. This is how,

1021
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:29,510
this is how much I have to be careful
though is talking about all that drinking

1022
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:33,140
made me want to drink.
Like I love it. I fucking,

1023
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,610
I hate how it makes me feel though
now. So I kinda, I just lay off

1024
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:37,570
Craig.

1025
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:42,100
Craig Robinson didn't drink for a year
and then we just had drinks and Arizona

1026
00:59:42,101 --> 00:59:46,590
this past weekend. We felt like trashed
both mornings that we drink. Yeah.

1027
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:49,600
And so he was like, yeah, I thought
I was back after taking a year off.

1028
00:59:49,601 --> 00:59:53,170
I thought it was back, but I'm good on
drinking. I think I was like, yeah man,

1029
00:59:53,171 --> 00:59:54,820
I don't feel good either.
I had a headache every day.

1030
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:59,850
It's an age thing. Like
it's really, that's a young
person thing. Like is it like

1031
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:04,200
we had fun. We were down to like we'd
do those shows, those theater shows.

1032
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,130
We would go to like the cigar
bars have a drink with cigars.

1033
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:12,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I, I
still, I think what I, I'm, I
my drinking may be, we'll be,

1034
01:00:12,361 --> 01:00:15,690
is like a,
this year when I go on the road,

1035
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:19,610
I think like if I go up for three
days, like that Middle Day, yeah.

1036
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:22,820
Not the first night because I
traveled and not the, not, you know,

1037
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,130
the night before I have to go to the
airport, but just that in the middle one,

1038
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:30,990
finding a good place. Um, I dunno if that,

1039
01:00:30,991 --> 01:00:33,900
that might be the, uh, that
might be the way I'll do it.

1040
01:00:33,901 --> 01:00:35,730
You know what I went to last night?
Oh my God,

1041
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:40,350
I went to this fucking
this eighties, like, uh,

1042
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:44,490
all these bands, this crazy
fucking lineup was, um,

1043
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:49,050
the real bedrooms attributed
them. No, it was like tutor was,

1044
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:54,420
uh, what was it? Ah, like
drama Rama and with them.

1045
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:58,590
Holy Shit. I think, I can't remember
the song is that flock of Seagulls,

1046
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:03,060
the Romantics, they were all
really their tone. Loke oh my God.

1047
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:08,090
Fucking the violent femmes Melly Mel
than the furious five for his phone.

1048
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:14,130
Uh, and boy George closed. No Way. It
was fucking, it was, that was this,

1049
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:17,790
this was at, uh, the Microsoft
theater, which used to be the Nokia,

1050
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:22,610
me and Nia went down there and, um, I,

1051
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,940
it was fucking awesome,

1052
01:01:23,941 --> 01:01:28,941
but I learned a lot about show business
watching those p you could tell like who

1053
01:01:31,351 --> 01:01:35,490
is sick of singing their hits. And it was
also like, fuck this, I'm bringing it.

1054
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,680
And then I also learned, you
know, watching, you know,

1055
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,420
he got to take care of yourself.

1056
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:46,500
I have a story about that
because I swear to God, Dude,

1057
01:01:46,501 --> 01:01:50,100
if you see a band that let themselves go,

1058
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:55,340
it's like depressing on like yours
because you love them and they look like

1059
01:01:55,351 --> 01:01:58,530
shit. And then all you're thinking
is like, oh my God, I'm all,

1060
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:02,850
I'm fucking 20 years older than he
was when he put that song out a fuck.

1061
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:03,930
We're all gonna die.

1062
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:08,160
But when you just see a band come out
and they kept themselves in shape and

1063
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:11,580
they're fucking killing it as much as
they are older, it's, it's like, uh,

1064
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,080
like I'm not gonna name names, but I saw
one band that made me think like, dude,

1065
01:02:16,081 --> 01:02:17,340
I'm never drinking again.

1066
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,000
And then I when saw the violent femmes
like two pages came out and with just a

1067
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:27,660
fucking tight sick aspect, like
I watched them, I was like, man,

1068
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:30,210
I want to go play drums. I want
to practice. I want to get better.

1069
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:35,450
Like there was nothing like
negative about watching them.

1070
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:39,570
They just came out and find they for,
they went on after uh,

1071
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:44,600
Melly Mel in in a 35 who fucking killed
and you couldn't be more of a different

1072
01:02:45,871 --> 01:02:49,360
band, like literally up to
the stage would just turned.

1073
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,600
Oh yeah, that's bad. As I did the
I heart radio music festival thing,

1074
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:55,450
they have like the band,
the stage of rotate one 80,

1075
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:59,020
and then they'd have the band and then
they'd do the set dressing behind and

1076
01:02:59,021 --> 01:03:01,420
then it would keep turning through ios.

1077
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:05,540
I loved it. I loved that. They
get like a down in Anaheim,

1078
01:03:05,541 --> 01:03:08,120
they had it in like salt and pepper
was on in a couple of people.

1079
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:08,990
It was fucking nuts.
It was,

1080
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:13,610
he just knocked out like 10 of the
bands that I should have seen back then.

1081
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:17,690
And uh, you know, they all sounded great.
There was just, well I'll tell you off.

1082
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:22,130
It was just one person that I looked
at and it was just like my God,

1083
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,890
but he was still singing great.
But it's just like fuck dude.

1084
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:29,580
Right. See we saw cameo like
six months ago down. Uh,

1085
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:34,610
I can't remember what it was like by
the water somewhere here in La and Roger

1086
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:39,060
Troutman. I remember Roger Blackmun,
wasn't it? Yeah. What songs does he say?

1087
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:44,240
Um, Shay's all BRAC. Oh yeah. House. Okay.

1088
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,830
Of all those dude, he came, you know,

1089
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:50,100
cause he used to come out in like
leather chaps and a cup, you know,

1090
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:54,340
it's the 70s fucking coke spoon around
his neck and dude, he's still doing this.

1091
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,980
Like he can't, he can't win
the belly. And I'm like, oh,

1092
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:01,830
not bad. Hips and knees and
it's still wearing a company.

1093
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:05,670
It was like his leather pants in the
back of look like the diaper and he would

1094
01:04:05,671 --> 01:04:06,590
come out and he does like,

1095
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:09,390
dude was a little like trying to be
sexy and wrote swivel his hips up.

1096
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:13,590
My wife has died laughing. She was
like, he needs to fucking stop. Stop,

1097
01:04:13,591 --> 01:04:15,180
stop doing that company.
Even even,

1098
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:18,820
even when you keep yourself in shape
and he was not in shape, you as you,

1099
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:22,340
but you it,
you can't do that sexy shit.

1100
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,570
And I'm telling you that is a self
involved baby boomer thing that is being

1101
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:27,404
passed down.

1102
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:32,450
Like do Madonna is an unfucking
believable shame for her fucking age.

1103
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:34,910
But when she starts
twerking, it's just like, ah,

1104
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:39,160
mom,
what are you doing right?

1105
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:41,870
Can't. Yeah. And then
it's like the older guy,

1106
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:46,550
which you got to do is you got to like,
uh, I sucked to de Rosa about this.

1107
01:04:46,551 --> 01:04:51,380
You know, you gotta dress like Dana
White, right when you get older,

1108
01:04:51,381 --> 01:04:56,330
right? Like Dana White is roughly my age.
Dana White, you know, he wears as suit,

1109
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:59,870
he ways to college. Sure doesn't have
the title, the title, rather than,

1110
01:04:59,871 --> 01:05:04,430
so he's a little bit relaxed, but he's
dressed like he doesn't look like a creep,

1111
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,880
you know what I mean? But if he was
to show up, you know what I mean?

1112
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:10,250
I'm not just putting it on him, just
saying that, that fucking look, just,

1113
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:12,470
you take a guy the same age,
my fucking age,

1114
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,350
and you're going to try to
fucking pull off like a tank top.

1115
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:19,150
Like even like when you watch these,
these, those P90x things, right.

1116
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:22,570
And the old guys that are working at a
58 year old guys with the ABS, it's like,

1117
01:05:22,571 --> 01:05:23,250
dude,

1118
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:28,250
amazing putting your fucking shirt on
because there's nothing they could do for

1119
01:05:28,301 --> 01:05:32,170
the loss of Alaska density
in your fucking skin. Yeah.

1120
01:05:32,171 --> 01:05:37,070
You're decomposing in front of me.
Yeah.

1121
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:40,970
She'd be sitting in a giant fruit bowl.

1122
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:46,600
Little little fruit flies flying around
you. So I learned a lot. That guy watched,

1123
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:48,010
uh,

1124
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:53,010
those bands and it was the people that
we're comfortable with their age and kept

1125
01:05:53,231 --> 01:05:57,690
himself in shape and came out and we're
having a good fucking time. Oh yeah.

1126
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,430
It was just like, aw man,
this is fucking granular.

1127
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:05,410
Like you just were really excited.
But if they came out like you know,

1128
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:07,500
they'd fucking this,
this still fucking partying.

1129
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:10,120
Like you know Keith Richards back in
the day and then they're coming to and

1130
01:06:10,121 --> 01:06:14,130
you're going to still wear
like leather and shit bro. Um,

1131
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,320
HD net have this concert series a
couple of years ago and there were,

1132
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:21,060
so these commercials for them for the
concert series and they would show they

1133
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:24,150
show at Steppenwolf.
Right? You don't know,

1134
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:28,180
you can are gonna kill me.
Then again.

1135
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,900
And then that middle section that goes
on for fucking ever memories used to work

1136
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:32,734
in a warehouse.

1137
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:38,800
That whole fucking the psychedelic
part. Yeah, it goes on for two.

1138
01:06:38,801 --> 01:06:39,820
Sorry I interrupted your story.

1139
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:44,190
But they would show like them playing
concerts back in like the 70s and there'll

1140
01:06:44,191 --> 01:06:46,810
be jam packed arena
and people going crazy,

1141
01:06:46,811 --> 01:06:50,710
the crowd and then they show him now like
it was smashed cups from then to now.

1142
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,830
Oh now they're playing on like
an outdoor stage tire audience.

1143
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:56,980
Oh,

1144
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:01,980
only about 300 people are sitting on this
lawn in like lawn chairs and I'm like,

1145
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:03,920
I know because we're all too well.
Yeah.

1146
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,980
All the people that love him
back then are old now too.

1147
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:10,600
So it was like watching people perform at
like shady acres, retirement community.

1148
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:14,900
I know, but those guys are like 70 I
know it's fucking, I'm sure that guide,

1149
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:16,330
the band still sounds
great and everything,

1150
01:07:16,331 --> 01:07:18,340
but it's gotta be weird having
fun with it. Just like fuck,

1151
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:22,390
we still have to make money. Only
one. A lot of those guys they got,

1152
01:07:22,391 --> 01:07:27,310
they got so stolen from and
just completely ripped off
and then you add that if

1153
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,420
somebody got divorced and shit, yeah,
you're going to be singing that song. Ugh.

1154
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:34,540
I just realized I cross my legs wearing
slippers in front of you. I'm sorry.

1155
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:37,300
Those are great celebrities.
Great slippers.

1156
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,270
Now I finally bought some new socks and
I just wanna I wanna to try to keep them

1157
01:07:40,271 --> 01:07:41,910
white for a lot of things for you.
I bought,

1158
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:45,400
that's why I wear black socks all that.
Well,

1159
01:07:45,401 --> 01:07:49,150
I can't wear black socks if I have on like
dark sneakers though. Why not? I mean,

1160
01:07:49,151 --> 01:07:51,660
I can't wear white socks
with dark sneakers now if,

1161
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,240
I'm sorry if I have white sneakers,
I need white socks. Really? Yeah,

1162
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:59,260
I guess. Yeah, I have mostly
white sneakers. No offense.

1163
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:06,280
Um, no, but I think a lot of those guys
that, that's what ends up happening.

1164
01:08:06,281 --> 01:08:09,910
So I think the way to do it is,

1165
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,910
and I haven't figured out
how to get into the game yet,

1166
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:17,270
is you get to a certain point when you're,
the height of your, your earning power.

1167
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:21,980
I think you should already be planning
your graceful exit from this business

1168
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:25,800
because it's so broad strategy.
So I think rather than going out and buy,

1169
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,320
buying flashy shit,

1170
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:31,760
fucking hovercraft and all the
dumb shit that that art is by,

1171
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:37,040
by start buying rentals, man rental
units, I'm not buying a helicopter.

1172
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:39,470
I'd love to, but I, I can't, uh,

1173
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:44,030
I can't justify like maintaining it to
fucking play this. I got a kid now, man.

1174
01:08:44,031 --> 01:08:48,890
I came from smash cut
[inaudible] the,

1175
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,220
you know what's cool is I'm doing
Irvine on Tuesday and Wednesday.

1176
01:08:52,221 --> 01:08:55,880
You know that's like, you know, it's
like two hours of traffic. Oh to, yeah,

1177
01:08:56,270 --> 01:09:00,410
I'm renting a little 22 I'll blah
blah blah blah. Up Bubba. Bob.

1178
01:09:00,411 --> 01:09:05,210
Go right over it in like 20 minutes.
That was fucking awesome. It is us. Yeah.

1179
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:08,700
Oh my God dude.
Fuck five.

1180
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:14,210
I did my time. I did my, I'm
not fucking do it. Am I me yet?

1181
01:09:14,211 --> 01:09:17,930
Another comedian talking
about how horrific the traffic
was during the first 10

1182
01:09:17,931 --> 01:09:21,080
minutes. How about I go up there and be
the comic who's in a good mood, right?

1183
01:09:21,081 --> 01:09:25,190
That's what people are coming. Outflows.
10 minute helicopter ride. Oh yeah,

1184
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:28,520
that's fantastic. Oh right up in
fucking over it. And this is the thing,

1185
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:33,780
I'd like to look at the parking structure
on the roof of the Improv. Now, um,

1186
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,630
we're trying to find,
you got to call up.

1187
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:38,810
It's like every time you
fly you learn something.

1188
01:09:38,811 --> 01:09:41,480
So I'm learning this time is like,
they'll have this,

1189
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:44,300
all these helipads so you can
even go beyond the airports.

1190
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:47,330
Cause I'm thinking like
John Wayne is close by,

1191
01:09:47,331 --> 01:09:49,070
but then there's another
one that's even closer,

1192
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:53,380
but then there's like these helipads
on top of buildings and all were,

1193
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:54,980
I'll just all around it.
But you have to,

1194
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:59,780
you just have to call him and tell him you
go fly down a solo. No, no, no, no, no.

1195
01:09:59,781 --> 01:10:03,620
I don't have confidence to fly at night.
I fly solo during the day,

1196
01:10:03,621 --> 01:10:05,960
but at night it's just a
whole different ballgame.

1197
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:10,550
And I'll never forget one night doing a
night flight. I was with an instructor.

1198
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,270
And how you transition,
uh,

1199
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:18,680
the airspace at lax is either you fly
under, you're not underneath it, but you,

1200
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:22,250
you're, you're along the coastline
flying like a hundred feet off the water,

1201
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:25,280
which is awesome and scary as shit.
Um,

1202
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:30,710
and or you fly over [inaudible]
over like those glow stick things.

1203
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:33,800
Like, you know, I think it's like a 2000,

1204
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:37,190
I've only done it once like 2000
feet or above. So with night,

1205
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:41,600
we flew over over the
[inaudible] and you know,

1206
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:46,430
it's fucking freaky because there's all
these jets coming in that if you're at

1207
01:10:46,431 --> 01:10:50,240
the same altitude altitude t-bone, you
said we're flying. And I go, yeah man,

1208
01:10:50,241 --> 01:10:51,920
I go to the cow pig,
that end, that's crazy.

1209
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,100
And how big these planes are landing
here? And he just goes, yeah,

1210
01:10:55,101 --> 01:10:58,580
there's one right there.
And it was like almost underneath us.

1211
01:10:58,581 --> 01:11:02,550
But because when you're looking down and
there's not a lot of streetlights and

1212
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:06,350
just the lights from the city, I didn't
see like a fucking, you know, holy seven,

1213
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:08,480
49, seven 40, say whatever
the fuck they fly. Now,

1214
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:11,510
I don't know what the numbers are anymore
was like going right underneath this

1215
01:11:11,511 --> 01:11:16,010
and I was just like, wow, you didn't
see that? No, but he did this the right,

1216
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:18,670
this is when I was getting my license,
so I didn't know how to,

1217
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:23,010
to look for Shit and everything.
So night flying isn't entirely,

1218
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:27,450
entirely different games. So,
uh, I'll be flying down, um,

1219
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:31,650
with one of my instructors. So, but
if it was, if it was like the, uh,

1220
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:35,550
if it was the fucking summertime though,
but every time, every time it's going to,

1221
01:11:35,551 --> 01:11:37,140
by the end of the show
it's going to be dark out.

1222
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:42,000
But that is a goal of mine
who's I would love to fly solo.

1223
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:46,560
Now let me ask you this, how much does
it cost? It will cost you to do that.

1224
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:49,820
It will fly down to, you have to
like run through vehicle and peds.

1225
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:53,670
It's like 300 bucks. I mean it's,
it's a decent amount of money,

1226
01:11:53,671 --> 01:11:57,780
but it's also like that bad though.
It's not just going to close.

1227
01:11:58,010 --> 01:12:02,010
[inaudible] grown, but no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, nothing like that.

1228
01:12:02,011 --> 01:12:05,100
It's like 300 bucks and then,
uh,

1229
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:09,240
and it's fun and then I get another,
like I'll get like another,

1230
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:14,250
I'm going to get another two hours
under my belt flying at night. And uh,

1231
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:16,470
I got this killer fucking
instructor right now.

1232
01:12:16,471 --> 01:12:19,200
My auto rotations are the
best they've ever been,

1233
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:23,850
where they basically will fly around now
when he just sorta like he'll just out

1234
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:24,990
of know what go,
you know,

1235
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,730
engine failure and then you just have
to pick a fucking spot. And you know,

1236
01:12:29,731 --> 01:12:30,564
you just,

1237
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:34,160
I mean we don't take it all the way down
to the ground and I land on somebody's

1238
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:39,030
fucking front yard. But
um, I have learned so much,

1239
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:42,200
I always had great instructors,
but this guy that I have now is,

1240
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:45,420
is really got my confidence
back up again where, um,

1241
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:49,230
for me to go solo and everything would be,
you know,

1242
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:52,860
I would have the confidence to do
it, but I like, but what's good is I,

1243
01:12:52,861 --> 01:12:55,470
I'm super fucking cautious. I'm
not one of those people, you know,

1244
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:58,800
with the fucking nine oh two one
oh look on my face, you know,

1245
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,260
show up with like a fucking sculptures
now. But there's a lot of people that get,

1246
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,111
they get their a,

1247
01:13:04,111 --> 01:13:07,320
they get their license and once they get
the license they stopped the training

1248
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:11,160
and because it got it well cause they
know how to fly. And then, you know,

1249
01:13:11,161 --> 01:13:15,440
and then you just, they just started
flying around. Oh my God. Yeah.

1250
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,740
So did you fly your parents? Yeah. Then
when they came out here and visit it.

1251
01:13:19,741 --> 01:13:23,940
But I also did that with
like an instructor and that
was a will the impress your

1252
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,550
parents blown away that a,

1253
01:13:26,551 --> 01:13:30,060
they definitely day had a good time and
they are very conservative people. So,

1254
01:13:30,061 --> 01:13:30,361
you know,

1255
01:13:30,361 --> 01:13:35,020
sometimes you don't necessarily know
what they're thinking or going crazy.

1256
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:39,150
They won't go crazy. They were just like
lovely. That was nice. I was very, uh,

1257
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,340
very in trouble.
I was exhilarated.

1258
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:47,560
I heart is beating out of
my chest right now. Um, no,

1259
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:51,390
my, my dad, uh, had a pilot's license.
It has a positive cause once you get it.

1260
01:13:51,391 --> 01:13:53,860
So like he knows other,
no, he had fixed wing,

1261
01:13:53,861 --> 01:13:58,050
so he knew a lot of the shit
that was going on. So, uh,

1262
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,140
you know,
but my mother thought it was awesome.

1263
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:04,770
She loves it and wasn't scared at all.
My Dad, I think because he had a license,

1264
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,760
understood that probably more of the
danger of it and that type of shit.

1265
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:12,190
So he probably thought it was a little
squirrely when we will 100 feet off the

1266
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:15,600
fucking water flying under the, you
know, the jets or whatever. But, uh,

1267
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,580
I'd say it's one of the great things
that I've done in my fucking adult life.

1268
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,270
And, um, I don't know, but we're
not here to talk about make,

1269
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:23,170
we're here to talk about you.

1270
01:14:23,171 --> 01:14:28,090
We've already done an hour and 15
minutes just like that. Uh, Hey, can I,

1271
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:32,440
can I come down the 90th tape
dude or nothing more? Okay.

1272
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:35,890
All right. Well, some people, you
know, like me, I'd be like, no,

1273
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:38,320
I don't want anybody there.
Nobody. I fucking know.

1274
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,520
So it's just one more thing for me to
think about. We're going to do like,

1275
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,850
you know, I'm going to come on, I'm
going to be brought from all stays out.

1276
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:47,890

and Frankie quiñones who does the Cholo

1277

towards the Craig and I,

1278
01:14:50,561 --> 01:14:53,710
and so I'm going to have someone
bring me on stage from offstage.

1279
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,730
You got that fucking voice. Oh yeah. I'll
definitely do it. I'll definitely do it.

1280
01:14:57,731 --> 01:15:01,460
Yeah, I'll just double check my schedule.

And Go February 11th, February
11th Sunday Day. Yeah.

1282

What have I got?
I got reno,

1283
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:11,200
I got Santa Barbara and then it gets
something at the Patrice O'Neal benefit

1284
01:15:11,201 --> 01:15:14,400
towards the young month.
Oh Man. Um, let's try that.

1285
01:15:14,401 --> 01:15:17,350
I met Patrice was mom and sister with
you. That was, that was fucking amazing.

1286
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:22,060
Oh yeah, that was great. A lot of the
best. They're the best. Hey, so I'll uh,

1287
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:26,200
I'll tell you this when you do
soundcheck. Yeah, just make sure,

1288
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:28,690
speaking of Patrice, cause
I haven't, one time he,

1289
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:33,670
he did some taping and the sound wasn't
right and when it came time for him to

1290
01:15:33,671 --> 01:15:37,060
do his taping, you know, they thought he
was a pain in the ass, but he was like,

1291
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,560
this sound isn't right.
And he was like,

1292
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:40,660
I want to be the loudest
thing in the room,

1293
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:44,350
so make sure your monitors so you know,

1294
01:15:44,351 --> 01:15:49,330
you gotta just make sure that is right.
That's fucking right. Then it's like,

1295
01:15:49,331 --> 01:15:53,260
yeah, you light saber is totally on
and you know, you know that deal.

1296
01:15:53,261 --> 01:15:56,320
If you get up there and you can't fucking
hear yourself and God knows when you

1297
01:15:56,321 --> 01:16:00,550
go to tape, there's always somebody
who fucks something like that. Oh,

1298
01:16:00,551 --> 01:16:04,330
I thought it'd be good to just have
the sound way down, you know? Um,

1299
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,300
just make sure all of that shits right
and then go to school up there and kill

1300
01:16:07,301 --> 01:16:09,970
it. Oh yeah. That's the plan.

1301
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:15,970
I've never seen you so fucking nervous.
I'm not nervous. I'm just like you.

1302

bit hung over other than that.

1307

But other than that and a little
bit, yeah, I always wanted like this.
