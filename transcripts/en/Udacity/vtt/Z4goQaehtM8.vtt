00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.950
Here's an example of how not to do it. Say you have a nice address book

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.330
application with an address book class in it, and that class has a sort method

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.595
in it. And now you're writing some financial application that or, or

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:20.140
a financial part of an overall application, in which you'd like to do sorting.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.220
And the piece you are working on has to do with ledgers, for

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.465
keeping track of credits and debits, and so on. So you'd like to,

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:33.090
to use the sort that's part of the address book in your ledger class. So

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.620
one strategy for doing that might merely be to have ledger be a subclass that is

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.100
inherent from address book. But this would not be an example of generalization.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.230
An address book is not a general version of a ledger.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.920
This would be an abuse of power. So what can you do instead?
