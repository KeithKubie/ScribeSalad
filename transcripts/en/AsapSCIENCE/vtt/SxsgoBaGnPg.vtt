00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The perception of intelligence is extremely important in human evolution,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.500
and as a result, pretty important to your life.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.500
Psychology shows that in text, when a middle initial is used,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.500
there are positive evaluations of a person's intellect and abilities.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.000
Middle initials are generally saved for more formal contexts like John F Kennedy.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
One study asked participants to choose academic team partners,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and those with middle initials were more likely to be chosen.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Middle initial equals increased perceived status.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.000
Hey! Reservation for Lilly, please?

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.740
No, I don't see it.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.320
So (sorry)

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.440
Uh, Lilly Singh?

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.140
No, It's a bank ambassador golf tournament

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.300
We're so swamped

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.500
What about Lilly S. Singh

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.980
*Slowed down* Oh my god

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.820
Let her in

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.320
It has been found that when something seems

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.180
more "scientific", it has a greater power to persuade

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.340
In a study,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.940
67% of participants believed a specific

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.890
piece of information without a graph but

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.870
if a graph was added then ninety-six

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.190
percent of the participants believed it

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.620
even though it was the same information

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.539
OMG we should totally watch Magic Mike

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.560
it got 80 percent on Rotten Tomatoes

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.220
I don't know about dude dancing. I don't think that's for me

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.880
No, yeah me neither. That's gross

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.400
Did I mention it got a 80% on Rotten Tomatoes

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.440
Oh, okay yeah yeah

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.720
Lilly, why don't you try a new science fact for us?

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.540
No, I don't know anything about science. I don't want to seem stupid

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.560
No, you just have to speak expressively

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.909
and people will believe you

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.220
It's scientific fact

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.500
Really?!

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.680
Waddup everyone! It's your girl, Superwoman!

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.479
When two people have the same things to say

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.189
one modulates their speak and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.520
keeps pauses to a minimum

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.100
they come across as more knowledgeable

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.860
In a recent study

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.200
participants were asked to present to a hypothetical employer

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.619
and those who use various pitches, tones and volumes

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.860
were perceived as more thoughtful, intelligent and

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.260
left a better overall impression

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.600
Was that okay? I have no idea what I just said

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.320
There's actually a correlation between

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.360
what a university professor wears

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.880
and how the students learn

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.220
In fact, if the instructors wear more formal attire

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.340
the students are less likely to misbehave

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.880
Stereotypes play a big role in how people perceive you

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.719
and there's a pretty big stereotype that

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.580
smart people wear glasses

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.720
In fact, studies even show that those people who wear glasses

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.440
are perceived as more intelligent

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.740
I just finished the most fascinating article about ISIS

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.520
and the impact it's having on Lebanon borders

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.980
I mean, will the sanctions work?

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.640
Have you read it?

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.720
Um, yes, obviously

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.260
I am fully aware of all issues related to the Middle East

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.300
Are you sure you've actually read it?

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.200
Yes!

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200
OMG! You're so smart!

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.120
You definitely have.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.220
To be honest I don't fully understand the Iran deal

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.320
The ability to accurately assess someone else's intelligence

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.160
is of great evolutionary importance

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.540
You don't want to mate with a dummy

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.740
Studies have found that when people observe headshots

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.660
the ones that are rated as highly intelligent

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.140
are more often smiling

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.640
so show them pearly whites

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.720
I hope we're making a good impression

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.600
I really want her to think that we're smart

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.680
Keep smiling

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.800
She's turning around!

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.120
ASAP science is so smart

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.480
They even look intelligent in real life

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.440
She looked!

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.400
Alcohol consumption and cognitive impairment go together

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.380
Known as the imbibing idiot by a study

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.440
found that managers perceive candidates to be less

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.100
intelligent if they ordered a wine over a soda

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.260
Another study found that those

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.520
who are actually just holding alcoholic beverages

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.980
were perceived to be less intelligent than those who were not

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.620
Hey, boo

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.120
Where you from?

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.000
I'm from Toronto but I'm just visiting LA

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.860
Oh, just visiting

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.480
Ok, what kind of girls you into

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.960
Well, I'm scientists so I really like smart girls

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.740
(record scratch)

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.800
Oh (throws cup away)

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.760
So weird because just happen to be one of those smart girls

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.980
Did you know?

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.060
The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.000
Thanks for watching!

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.400
