1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,380
Like a boss. Kenny was, let's
talk some F1 action. Did anybody,

2
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:15,381
did you watch the Australian grampy
grampy Grand Prix down in Melbourne,

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,660
Australia? Uh,

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,100
it was a great fucking race and it
lived up to the hype that this year the

5
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:27,720
Ferrari's we're going to be going, I've
only watched this sport for one season,

6
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:28,890
so I don't know shit about it all.

7
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:33,060
I knows last year it was all about
the Mercedes team, Lewis Hamilton,

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,320
Nico Rosberg, you know, they had
the whole days of thunder. You know,

9
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:39,760
I'm the guy who's been around
the block on the other fucking,

10
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,040
I'm the Tom Cruise Guy,

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,180
somebody fucking Robert
Duvall and everybody else,

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,680
which is watching last year. And if
those two guys didn't hate each other,

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,550
it would have been fucking boring as
shit because basically every race was a

14
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,160
race to the first corner.

15
00:00:56,161 --> 00:01:00,090
Whoever got there first was just driving
through clean air and the cars was so

16
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:02,610
equally matched. Nobody
could catch up with somebody.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,900
You basically had to fuck
up where your car died. Um,

18
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,630
so all the exciting racing was
for like funeral fourth, fifth,

19
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:14,520
sixth place or whatever. Three cycles
going after it for the last, you know,

20
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,780
championship point is they say, you know,
back in 10th place that was exciting.

21
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,090
But up front it was just Lewis Hamilton
or Nico Rosberg just just doing laps

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,880
was, you know, Kinda got a little boring.

23
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,570
So this year they were
talking about how um,

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,390
Ferrari was very quiet,

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,680
eerily quiet during the off season working
on their [inaudible] suspension and

26
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,230
the engine and all that type of
shit with the new regulations,

27
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:41,940
whatever the fuck they are.
I don't know what they are.

28
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,280
Uh, the ties are 25%
wider than last year then

29
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,430
that they were going to make
a serious challenge for, uh,

30
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,150
against Mercedes issue.
So the fucking race starts

31
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,090
and a, the Australia Dude, I already
forget his name. Rico Rican Berg.

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,080
I have no fucking idea.
Like eventually I'll, I'll,

33
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,210
I'll get these people's names.
Style Ricky rocket, I forget. Okay.

34
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,760
Everybody wanted him to
win. The poor bastard.

35
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,150
He's down there and they're
taken like the, the,

36
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,360
the warmup lap or whatever. And uh,

37
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,370
not even a warmup lap.

38
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,380
They just going around and getting
ready to get into positions.

39
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:21,140
Just to do the warmup lap and
his car gets stuck in sixth gear.

40
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,600
I think there's a, an
electronic sensor issue, um,

41
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:25,940
that it's stuck in sixth year.

42
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:29,850
So if it can be cleared with a reset,

43
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,010
we've all been there, right?
The side of the highway,

44
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,730
except he's got 100,000
people in a fucking zillion
millions of fans around the

45
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:36,690
world watching this shit.

46
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,040
So they got to push his car and they got
to take out the fucking transmission in

47
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,840
like five minutes, throw
a new one in there,

48
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:47,160
try and get it back in the fucking car
before the race starts. That alone,

49
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:48,690
if they just showed that,
that would've been amazing.

50
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:51,060
They can't kept cutting back to
it. I wish they showed more of it.

51
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,710
A long story short, he wasn't able to
get out there until, uh, the second lap.

52
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,820
He was already two laps down.

53
00:02:56,821 --> 00:03:01,120
So that kind of sucked for all the
Australian fans and uh, then his car shit,

54
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:05,470
the bed halfway through the race,
however, so the race fucking starts.

55
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,983
All right.

56
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,390
I think Lewis Hamilton had the
pole and then Sebastian Vettel, um,

57
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,570
for Ferrari was in second place and uh,

58
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,810
Louis had a great start and he was out
front and I go, wow, I guess that's it.

59
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,820
I guess the Mercedes are
gonna win it this year, right.

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,920
So they get about 20 laps
in and Lewis Hamilton pits,

61
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:28,990
it's one of these races,
it's like 57 laps.

62
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,130
And the announcers were saying that they
were going to pit one time and it's all

63
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:34,840
when you pit and blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

64
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,820
So all this shit is
becoming fascinating to me.

65
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,530
So Lewis Hamilton goes into Pitt,
right? Sebastian Vettel was,

66
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:42,670
I don't know how far behind,

67
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:45,880
a couple seconds behind he
decides to stay out there.

68
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,950
So the whole time when Louis
was out there in first place,

69
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,900
Sebastian's behind him. All right.
So Lewis is driving in the clean air.

70
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,890
It's like, you know, if you were on
a fucking on a lake and you bring,

71
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,180
it's just still water. You could,

72
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:04,510
you could go way faster and your boat as
opposed to if the water was all fucking

73
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,690
choppy, you got to go slower than,
it's the same thing except it to,

74
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,210
it's with air. I'm just saying
this for everybody else out there.

75
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,140
Who's dumb like me in the fact that air
is invisible, you don't understand it.

76
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,280
So no matter what this guy's
doing, Sebastian Vettel,

77
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,940
he can only get so close to a,

78
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,910
to Louis Hamilton because all
the air coming off of him,

79
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,610
and I guess the tires are bigger this
year, which causes more turbulence.

80
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,850
It would actually, it,

81
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:33,280
he's going to use more fuel and chew up
more of his tires if he gets too close

82
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:35,650
to him, which is really fucking, I dunno,

83
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,690
I don't know if that's
a good or a bad thing.

84
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,500
So Hamilton was having problems
with the tire. He pits early

85
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,060
and it's the soft tire for Mercedes.
So it starts to cool off down here.

86
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:46,510
It can fill it.

87
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,480
So the Ferrari team takes a
gamble and says, fuck this.

88
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:50,740
We're gonna stay out there.

89
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,180
So Sebastian now is in first
place driving into clean air.

90
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:56,410
He's got the nice smooth lake,

91
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:59,050
he's bringing the boat across except
it's a car and it's going through air.

92
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,320
You still with me and he stays
out there for one lap and they go,

93
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:06,340
he's definitely going to come in
for the second lap. Meanwhile, um,

94
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,160
Louis Hamilton came right back out
of the pits and then was you know,

95
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:12,700
technically in fourth
place but he's, you know,

96
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,670
but he already pitted the other two
guys in front of them have to pit and so

97
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,091
does the other guy.

98
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:19,300
So technically it's like he's still in
first place but now he's driving in dirty

99
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:23,110
air back there. So Sebastian's
flying around the track,

100
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:27,550
he goes around a second time and you
know the tires are getting chewed up.

101
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:31,390
He's driving like a fucking maniac and
then he comes around a third time and

102
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:33,640
then like he's not gonna, he's not
going to fucking stay out there.

103
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,960
He stayed out there again,

104
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,760
Hamilton losing time on this lab.
Bet on you. Imagine not losing time,

105
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:43,480
but he is going to lose time if
he carries on and doesn't a pit.

106
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:45,830
And guess what Ferrari
have left him out. And

107
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,830
now basically it was like this was the
most exciting part of a consistent to

108
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,270
fucking race. So basically
what he's trying to do,

109
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:58,271
he's trying to get out so far ahead
that he has time to pit when he goes in,

110
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,620
get his tires and get back out on
the track in front of fucking uh,

111
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,700
Louis Hamilton. It was like a fucking
movie. He pulls in his fourth time around

112
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,890
Zen. So we're Ferrari
just waiting for that gap.

113
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,940
They fucking take the tires. You've
got to go so fucking slow too.

114
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,530
Now he got to slow down to like,

115
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,270
like you're driving a
Prius when you're in there.

116
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,300
And as he's slowing down this
show and Lewis is coming around,

117
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:23,270
he's coming around, he's coming
around, he gets the tires,

118
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,270
fucking Sebastian's coming out.
It's like a fucking action movie.

119
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,160
And it was literally, he just,

120
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,480
Sebastian's battle comes in
to stop now. Lewis Hamilton,

121
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,900
is that the penultimate quarter? But
Sebastien panel's going to come out,

122
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,160
I guess walk surpassed bevel
now ahead. Oh, blue is Hamilton.

123
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,000
How about so behind for stepping or
we've got federal Vistaprint. Hamilton,

124
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,910
Sebastian for Ferrari.

125
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,430
Just get out in front of Louis
Hamilton and then that was the race.

126
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:53,050
You saw the Mercedes guy slammed his
hand down on the guy in the pits,

127
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:55,300
right? The head fucking guy, right?

128
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:58,150
The guy goes the eyes wide shut illuminati
parties at the end of the fucking

129
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,090
race right there. Probably on
some yacht that's like invisible,

130
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:02,500
like the air that they
drive through. Right.

131
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,940
He fucking slammed his hand down like
medium and then fucking slammed it down a

132
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:08,020
second time. Right. Then I was like,

133
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:11,680
this guy knows that this fucking
race is over. And that was it.

134
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,780
Ferrari won the first race.

135
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,830
So does Jim Federal starts off 2017
by winning the Australian grown play,

136
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,060
you know, backing up
their lack of shit talk.

137
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,110
They were real quiet in the off season.
So, uh, I was actually really, you know,

138
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,810
I like way my, I'm one of
those guys, I like both,

139
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,200
both team proceedings and Ferrari. I mean,

140
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,670
I don't know how you'd get mad at either
one of them. The fucking beautiful,

141
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,760
amazing cars that they've built all
this fucking, uh, over the years.

142
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,170
So I'm just happy that this seems like
there's going to be competition and if it

143
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:45,880
can be as exciting as that,
um, for the whole season,

144
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,570
uh, I think, um, maybe some more you
guys can get into it. Like I did,

145
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,560
I believe the next races
in China, in Indochino,

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,420
in China. Um, that's going to
be the next one. But I was,

147
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,630
I was thrilled with the race. Um,

148
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:03,460
I don't know how many F1
fans listen to this shit. Uh,

149
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,690
I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.

150
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,200
It was a great race. I enjoyed it a
lot. Thank you. Thank you very much.

151
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,750
The basketball,

152
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,050
all that wraps it up for our first
round in the Australian grumpy here in

153
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,070
Melbourne. See everyone in two weeks
time in Shanghai, in China for round two.

154
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,760
Thank you very much.
