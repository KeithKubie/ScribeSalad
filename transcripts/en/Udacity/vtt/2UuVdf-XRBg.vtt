00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, in this situation, the electric force has the balance the force of gravity, the weight.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I know the equation for the electric force is qE.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
That tells me that q must be mg/E.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
When I enter this into a calculator, I get a result of 3 * 10⁻⁵ C.
