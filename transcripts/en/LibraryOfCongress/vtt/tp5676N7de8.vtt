Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.870
Welcome to the Library of Congress
and to the Pickford Theater.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.590
My name is Nick Brown, I am in
the office of special events

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.400
and public programs here at the
library, and also a past chair

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.880
of LC Globe, which is the library's
LGBTQ employee association.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.710
Very pleased to be here with you
today, and also David France,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.380
my colleague Lisa and
also my colleague Meg.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.700
Lisa's going to do a
formal intro in a moment.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.390
But I just wanted to give you some
updates on housekeeping things

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.060
and also some event announcements.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.940
The program today is being
filmed for future webcast.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.020
So, that will be up on the
library's website in a few months

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.520
and on the YouTube Channel.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.370
So, when we get to Q&amp;A
ask questions accordingly

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.220
for the permanence of the archive.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.850

LOC.gov/lgbt to learn

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.320

relating to the topics

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.620
that we're covering today.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.530
If you didn't attend the pop-up
exhibit in June, it was remarkable

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.090
and we had several sections that
addressed HIV/AIDS and culture.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.200
And the bibliography
from the exhibit is up

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.010
and available on the website.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.650
If you're into film, we have
a bunch of events coming

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.790
up that you would be
interested in attending.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.030
First off, this Friday night
we're having the creators

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.910
of "The Blair Witch Project" here
in the Coolidge Auditorium to talk

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.600
about making modern ghost stories.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.520

fake news kind

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.340

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.420
And there will be a screening of
the film immediately following

o'clock, we're going to be screening

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.120

are more inclined to that.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.500
You're welcomed to attend in
costume for either, but please note

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.040
that there are rules about
masks and the police and such.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.640
So, if you plan to come in costume
read the press release first.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.150
Also, the library's new pop-up
exhibit, LOC Halloween Chambers

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.020
of Mystery opens this Thursday,
runs through November 1st.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.760
We have an entire room
dedicated to film.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.580
There are silent films
and sound films,

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.910
and also there's a radio horror
montage which is pretty cool.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.800
And we have a day of the dead alter
for Frida Kahlo, which is amazing

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.110
and would not have
happened in years past.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.880
So, check that out, there's
been a lot of work going

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.920

Mr. France has been writing
about the AIDS crisis since 1982,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.320
beginning in gay community papers.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.910

he was senior editor

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.860
for investigations until 2003.

get through this with you.

&gt;&gt; Mr. Mayor, in campaigning
for the lesbian and gay vote

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.340
in an election year, a bit of
historical context is necessary

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:58.900
in dealing with the AIDS
crisis in New York City.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:11.700
It wasn't until 1983
that you met with people

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.000
to deal with the AIDS crisis.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.630
How do you respond
to these criticisms?

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:22.260

described Act Up as fascist,

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.330
yet in the press release, you
called them "concerned citizens"

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.630
and I was wondering
what changed your mind?

you can't use both.

they are fascists,

which are being decimated
by this epidemic are so weak

into this demonstration this week?

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.050
The municipal hospitals
are totally falling apart.

people that get diagnosed

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.040

the emergency rooms of our city.

yourself waiting four days

look at all the people.

it's worth putting yourself

on the line for.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.120
&gt;&gt; There is no accurate diagnosis.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.900
There are incentives in the city
hospitals not to diagnose people

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.310
with AIDS and therefore,
people don't get treated.

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:41.280
We are angry at the way this
city has handled this crisis

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.630
and we demand that Ed
Koch exert leadership

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.720
and declare a state of emergency.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.340
He was a professional sex worker.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.640
"Like immunologists?"

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:36.430
"Yes. They haven't proven they are
competent to do any of this work.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.210
Who is Dr. Friedman
Keene [assumed spelling]?

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.690
He's a society skin
doctor as far as I know.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.210
He's certainly not equipped to
get into this kind of stuff."

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.830
Diners from around the surrounding
booths could make out every word.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.160
"These people have lymphadenopathy,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.490
and he's not equipped
to deal with that.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.180
So, they're dealing
with the skin cancer.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.670
They grab up all the patients.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.980
They're killing any number of
patients with chemotherapy."

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.030
His eyes narrowed.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.730
"He's a skin doctor."

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:06.310 position:56%
He was even more venomous about Dr.
Linda Labenstein [assumed spelling].

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.410
"Labenstein has got
no experience at all.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:09.710
She's very young.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.320
She hasn't been out of
medical school for very long.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.570
Why should you go to
person with no experience?

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.310
She's fooling around.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:17.610
They're fooling around.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.110
I would never let any of my
patients go anywhere near NYU."

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.070
He shook his head balefully.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.340
"The patient's I've had
there, I've taken away.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.530
One patient, thank goodness, he
went there and he's still alive.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.370
He would've been pumped
full of chemotherapy

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.170
and he be quite dead right now.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.990
There's no question about that."

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.570
Sonovand didn't have to
be oncologist to know

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.120
that people were not doing well
on traditional chemotherapy.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.910
"There are new agents that are
not that devastating," he said.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.210
"Interferon?

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:47.510
" Berkowitz asked.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.790
The grapevine was full
of praise for interferon.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.230
Sonovand shook his head.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.320
His experiments had shown
it offered little hope.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.290
It caused fevers and
inhibited development

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.360
of white blood cells,
especially CD4 cells.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.160
The body's elite disease
fighting squadrons.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.440
Interferon's massive proliferation
in people with AIDS appeared

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.050
to contribute to the
course of their disease.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.560
Yet, numerous well-meaning
researchers, including those

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.630
at the NIH, were injecting
even more interferon

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.860
into immune deficiency patients,

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.950
believing its antiviral properties
might simultaneously fight whatever

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.570
was causing illness.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.400
"I wouldn't let any of my patients
even smell the stuff," he said.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:32.230 position:56%
"There's only one treatment that's
rational and that's plasmapheresis."

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.630
Plasmapheresis was used for lupus
and other autoimmune diseases

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.510
in which the body produces
excessive antibodies,

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.820
just as AIDS seemed to be doing.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.340
The procedure removes those
antibodies mechanically

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.870
by rerouting blood out one arm
passing it through a centrifuge,

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:50.900 position:56%
then returning the blood through
the other arm, minus the antibodies.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.350
He had sent his other patient
Michael Callan [assumed spelling]

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.110
to Boston for the procedure,

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.860
noting that the patient felt
much less fatigued afterwards.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.790
"It's relatively harmless,"
Sonovand said.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.980
Still most other doctors were
not offering plasmapheresis

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.680
and some had openly criticized
him for championing it.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.150
"In other words, it
cleans your blood?"

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:10.970
"Yes," he snapped impatiently.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.630
Then more tentatively,
"it might've saved lives."

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.710
Berkowitz looked up from his food.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.920
"If a person has the immune
deficiency, but doesn't have any

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.070
of the debilitating diseases,"
he wondered, describing himself;

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:25.370
"what do you think the chances are

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.490
that the immune deficiency
could reverse itself."

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.380
Sonovand answered carefully,

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.230
"I think if you get
plasmapheresised it might help.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.700
You would be a candidate,
for example.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.680
I'd like to get you
plasmapheresised to see

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.610
if we could reverse
your parameters."

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.450
Berkowitz was numbed
by the recommendation.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.830
He thought that his
parameters, though cockeyed,

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.120
didn't merit dramatic intervention.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:52.350
Since having his gland biopsied,
he'd gone totally celibate

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:55.600
to protect against any new
challenges to his immune system.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.430
Consequently, he was
also off cocaine.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.940
In the world of sex work, they went
together like tea and crumpets.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.010
Only cigarettes and marijuana
remained in his regular routine,

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.730
though in dramatically
reduced quantities.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.340
He was eating better, sleeping
better, showing his body respect.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.920
He had hoped that this alone
would allow his body to heal

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.440
from the dual infections of
cytomegalovirus and hepatitis A,

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.220
which Sonovand had
diagnosed over the summer.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.350
Obviously, his doctor
was less patient.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.970
"There was a plasmapheresis center
in New York," Sonovand said,

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:28.770
"but the director there had
so far refused AIDS patients.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.880
I have to call Bruce Gordon and
beg him to do you," Sonovand said,

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.430
adding another item to his
impossibly long agenda, he sighed.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.740
"It's being denied people
because these doctors,

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.710
these great experts" he
didn't finish the sentence.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.810
Waiting for the waiter's
attention, he looked exhausted.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.420
"I've got to get back
to the office."

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.980
They sat in silence
waiting for the check.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.680
After a time, Sonovand tilted
his head toward a tape recorder

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.830 position:56%
that Berkowitz had brought with him.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.940
"All this is happening, there
really is no one of substance

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.920
to chronicle this, the
tragedy of all this.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.440
A person who knows how to write,

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.510
who knows people, where
is such a person.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.520
This is New York City and
nobody's chronicling this?"

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.030
If he was asking Berkowitz
to create a record,

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:16.830
he didn't say so directly,
nor did he have to.

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:20.580
That fall, Michael Callan spent
$39 on a recorder of his own

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:24.090
and joined Berkowitz in taping
new Sonovand disquisitions.

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:28.700
By now, researchers had starting
using a new name for grid,

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.300
answering the question
about the concerns

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.460
about naming a disease
after the community.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.760
There was nothing gay

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.440
about collapsed immunity,
as Sonovand put it.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.460 position:56%
The disease was rebranded as
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome,

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.730
but the new name didn't
change perspective.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.950
In the guise of AIDS rage
across the country came wave

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.050
after wave of anti-gay violence.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.790
Just as Sonovand had prophesied.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.320
Callan and Berkowitz
taped Sonovand over lunch,

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.210
when he met with the researchers
and during late night phone calls,

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.990
which had become commonplace.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.120
Cassettes piled up
in both apartments

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.140
where they were reviewed
and swapped.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:08.410 position:56%
They had become Sonovand's unpaid
amanuensis and self-styled acolytes;

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:11.290
standing in the spillway
of his developing thoughts,

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.320
so that others might benefit.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.910
"I got it on tape," Berkowitz
would announce, "if you forget."

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:22.780
"Paranoid fantasies," 1984.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.240
The summer of 1984 saw a fulcrum
of disease in the gay ghetto.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.700
At St. Vincent's emergency room
was visible behind enormous windows

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.830
on the corner of West 11th
Street and Seventh Avenue.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.940
Before the crisis exploded,
how many hundreds

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.380
of times had I walked
past those windows,

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.890
oblivious to the small
kabuki dramas enacted there.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.970
Now, I find myself choked with
panic anytime I came here.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.850
One sticky afternoon, I slowed

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.790
to measure the epidemic
through the plate glass.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.370
Praying to see only strangers.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.220
Three-quarters of the
seats were filled.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:01.130 position:56%
Scanning the rows, I could see every
third or fourth man had the look.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:05.890
Sunken cheeks, sparse hair,
eyes that showed fear.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.320
Shoulders that bent in pain.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.980
One, all spots and
bones, balanced painfully

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.240
on a pillow he brought
along from home.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.030
Another seems to be dozing.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.720
His head was cocked backward onto
a companion's arm and his mouth

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.210
and his eyes were both wide open.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.700
The blind, like horses
and snakes don't need

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.560
to close their eyes to sleep.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.030
A cab pulled up beside me, a
healthy man first out the door,

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:34.160
bent to carefully extract this
frail companion from the back seat,

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.160
and operation as ordered
and precise as origami.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.760
I held open the hospital
door and blinkered

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.420
by their mission they picked
past me without a nod.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.410
They were no older than I was.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:46.710
I remained on the sidewalk

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.450
for a long time watching them
navigate the admissions process

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.270
and settle into bucket
seats to await their turn.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.430
The healthy partner
whispering nonstop

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:57.340
into his lover's nodding
and sweaty head.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.260
That was my experience
with early AIDS.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.370
I stood on the sidewalk
of the plague,

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.860
grateful to not enter its tower.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:11.140
In San Francisco, Bobby
Campbell and his message

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.980 position:56%
of patient empowerment were in great
demand leading to urgent invitations

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.320
for him to address people with
AIDS in New York, Miami, Atlanta,

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.250
Washington, Seattle,
Dallas, and Los Angeles.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.980
He appeared on "Nightline,"
the late-night ABC news program

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.080
and on Phil Donahue's show.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.470
On June 28, he was in New York to
give one of his inspirational talks

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:35.150
and to attend the 15th annual Gay
Pride March, reuniting with people

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.620
with AIDS leaders from
around the nation.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.410 position:56%
On that weekend, he fulfilled his
biggest dream formally incorporating

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.780
The National Association of People
with AIDS to further the work

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:48.680
that they'd begun the
year before in Denver.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.920
Campbell returned home in time for
the Democratic Ntional Convention,

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.170
which opened in San
Francisco on July 15.

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.080
On a gusty afternoon,
he stood on a stage

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.710
across from the Muskogee Center
with his lover at his side,

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.210
delivering a well-paced
and strident keynote speech

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.970
to 100,000 protesters.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.230
He looked frail and tired, but
his connection to the crowd

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.930
that day was electric
and his voice was strong,

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.090
echoing across the sea of heads.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.810
"I have a message for
the nation," he said.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:21.370 position:56%
"Very often lesbians and gay men
are portrayed as isolated, alienated

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:26.410
and alone, or in a pathetic
search for desperate sexuality.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.660
I don't think that
that's true about us.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.870
I think it is important for
people to understand that lesbians

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.930
and gay men do not exist
outside of a context.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:35.230
We exist in the context

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.000
of the people we love
and those that love us."

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.640
The crowd roared as he kissed
his lover on the forehand.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.140
"I the message for the person with
AIDS who may be in Des Moines,

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.790
or Indianapolis, or in
Queens, or anywhere.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.110
Keep the faith, baby.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.030
I love you."

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.980
Campbell cemented his place as
the preeminent infected militant

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.700
that day, but his whirlwind
efforts took a toll on him.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.900
A few days later, a nasty case
of shingles engulfed his head,

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.290
leaving behind a field
of deep scars.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:08.400
And in a few weeks, he entered the
hospital with a brainstem overrun

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.140
with cryptococcal meningitis.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.200
A horrifyingly painful experience.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.340
When the news reached New
York City, Michael Callan,

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.730
bought a card to cheer him up with
a photo of the performer, Divine,

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:25.330
in a nurse's uniform
menacingly hoisting an enema bag.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:26.650
"How many of this card
have you gotten?

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:27.950
It's just so you."

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:31.030
He wrote. "Get well,
that's an order."

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.130
But Campbell never saw the card.

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:35.560
Bob Hilliard, his lover
watched helplessly

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.800
as the blood pressure monitor fell
from 100 to 50 and then 40 than 0.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.140
Instinctively he allowed
the medical staff space

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.070
for gently removing all the
hoses and pipes and devices

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.040
from Campbell spent body.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.800
At precisely noon on August
15, 1984, a month to the day

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.860
after his memorable last address,
Campbell ended his battle.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.920
He was 32 years old.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.690
News of the death spread
quickly through San Francisco.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:04.990
It wasn't long before someone

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.360
at the Badlands Bar took the
big chalk stick and wrote

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.210
on the blackboard, "love
after death for Bobby."

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.480
Knowing how devastated
community would be,

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.060
the city shut down
Christopher Street

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.770
for his funeral cortege
two days later.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:24.080
Hundreds of bereaved men and women
arrived through the dusking light,

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.970
followed by hundreds more.

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.510
Soon, a sea of grief stretched

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.580
down the hill past the
famous Castro Theater

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.820
into the next intersection
and beyond.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:36.530
A thousand people standing
hushed in Bobby Campbell's honor.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:40.510
Whether through his work as a
nurse, or a tireless AIDS advocate,

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.980
his leadership had touched the
community like nobody else's.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.750
The eulogies were stridently
political.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:50.920
Holly Near and Lea
Delaria sang tributes.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.210
A bit of footage from
Campbell's recent speech flickered

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.370
on a large screen over the stage.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:58.930
Momentarily returning him
to his beloved people.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:00.960
"I have a message for the
lesbian and Gay community,"

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.560
he was saying, as if from beyond.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.470
"it's important to understand
that sex does not cause disease.

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.320
Homosexuality does
not cause disease.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.290
Germs do. Learn and
practice safe sex.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:17.080
The throne on Castro Street
nodded silently to his manifesto,

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.430
but then the voice of
Campbell added something

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.450
that they had trouble accepting.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.350
"It's important for us
to learn about AIDS,"

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:24.950
he said, "but not to panic.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.320
There's no reason to
become hysterical."

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.630 position:56%
At that moment, it seemed that
there was ample reason for hysteria.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.640
The bad news was piling on.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.530
A new study from DC, in which
healthy appearing gay men were

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.640
screened for signs
of viral infection,

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.590
showed a prevalence
rate of 60 to 70%.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:47.140
Men just like those filling
the street at the Castro.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.110
Using conservative estimates of the
number of gay men in the country,

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.260
that meant that 8 million
were marked for death just

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.170
as cutting as Campbell's.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:58.150 position:56%
The cataclysm awaited the community.

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:04.150
About a week after his
massive memorial service,

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.950
which failed to garner coverage
in the East Coast press,

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:09.930
a large envelope from Bob
Hilliard arrived at the offices

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:11.820
of the New York native,
where he worked

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.660 position:56%
as a reporter and typesetter inside.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:20.060 position:56%
Inside, he'd written a note, "Bobby
Campbell, died yesterday, August 15,

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.660
of AIDS-related meningitis in
San Francisco General Hospital."

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.250
This was how we received
the awful news.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.760
In the course of my reporting,
I had spoken to Campbell

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.220
on the telephone, but we never met.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.150
Reading Hilliard's
note, I wept angrily.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:35.450
Hilliard went on to say,

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.160
the enclosed was found among
his papers stamped and sealed.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.110
It seems clear to us that Bobby
intended the letter to be sent.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.730
So, we are forwarding it
to you for publication.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:48.470
Thank you for complying with
what surely was his final wish.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:52.200
I carefully smoothed Campbell's
last communiqué onto my desktop.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.780
It was not a farewell,
and carried no hint

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.720
of the opportunistic infection that
would sneak up on him so violently.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.590
Instead, it was a letter to the
editor, addressed to an article

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:05.740
that I ran about the
bathhouse controversies.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.210
In his quiet voice, and
gentle optimism he warned

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.990
against moral absolutism
on either side.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.360
"AIDS partisans are
not either traders,

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.840
or murderers, or heroes," he said.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.450
My hands trembled as I sat at
the enormous photo offset machine

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:25.210
and put his last public words
into crisp columns of text.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.660
That December, Lester
Kinsaulding [assumed spelling]

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:37.140
in his late middle years,
took his usual chair

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:40.580
at the White House Briefing
Room just afternoon he rose

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.880
with a question.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.850
The president's spokesman
an agile and sandy haired,

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.850
Mississippian named Larry
Speaks eyed him playfully.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.960
"Lester's beginning to
circle now," he said,

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.330
as though he were narrating
a sporting event.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.680
He's moving in front."

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.190
Kinsaulding was more of a
gadfly than a journalist,

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.120
a self-syndicated columnist known

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.100
for wearing an ecclesiastical
collar to briefings.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.560
He had been ordained once
in the Episcopal Church.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.020
And issuing challenges from
Reagan's rightmost flank.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:14.970 position:56%
Sometimes his questions were just
plain kooky, like the time, perhaps,

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:18.020
moved by a tune stuck in
his head, he wondered,

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:22.310
what does the president
think about muskrat love.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.090
Other reporters christened
him 'the mad monk'

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.810
and 'the price we pay
for democracy.'

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.610
Few took him seriously.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.760
For Speaks, Kinsaulding's
intercessions were always occasions

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.060
for merriment.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.320
"Go ahead," he said cheerfully.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.770
Kinsaulding launched into one
of his customary dispositions.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.280
"Since the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta reports

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.900
that an estimated," an explosion
of laughter cut him off.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.080
The regulars knew what
was coming next.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.380
So, did Speaks.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.910
"This is going to be
an AIDS question."

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.790
The spokesman beamed.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.750
Kinsaulding had raised
the subject before.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:02.400
Once in October 1982,
and once in June 1983.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.080
The only two times AIDS was
ever mentioned in that room.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.450
Each time was the same;
guffaws and dismissal.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.030
These were the only times the
subject had arisen in connection

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.010
with the administration in any way.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:17.280
Which remained silent
on the disease.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.580
"You were close."

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.880
Speaks ribbed him.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.180
"You're close."

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.970
"Well, look, can I just
ask my question Larry?"

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.960
Kinsaulding's poker face broke.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.990
He wanted a serious
answer this time.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:31.320
"An estimated 300,000 people
have been exposed to AIDS,

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.020
which can be transmitted
through saliva."

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.710
He said. That last part was
never true, but his concern was

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.010
that people with the disease,

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:42.130
members of what he called the
sodomy lobby were endangering

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:43.720
American life.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.780
"Will the president,
as commander-in-chief,

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:49.770
take steps to protect Armed
Forces, food and medical services

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.740
from AIDS patients, and those who
run the risk of spreading AIDS

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.410
in the same manner that they
forbid typhoid fever people

00:28:56.410 --> 00:29:00.400
from being involved in
health or food services."

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.210
Speaks regarded him warmly.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.510
"I don't know."

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:05.970
He said. More laughter.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.280
"Is the president concerned
about the subject, Larry,

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:12.690
that seems to have been evoking
so much jocular reaction here?"

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:14.720
"I haven't heard him
express concern."

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.020
Speaks winked.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.490
Gales of laughter followed.

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:20.310
Everyone knew that only
homosexuals concern themselves

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.610
with the epidemic.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:25.700
It was beyond the pale to imagine
the president talking about it.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.920
Chatter flew around the briefing
room as other reporters piped in.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.610
"Has he sworn off water faucets?

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:33.710
It isn't just jocks now, Lester?"

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:35.900
"Lester," said Speaks.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.330
"I have not heard him
express anything on it.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:42.510
Sorry, but I must confess, I
haven't asked him about it either."

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:45.460
A year ago he had responded
to Kinsaulding's question

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.020
by "acknowledging your
interest in the subject."

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.830
A year before that he had
parried, I don't have it.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:30:00.400
Do you?" With 7699 reported
cases, and 3665 Americans dead,

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.190
Kinsaulding was no longer
satisfied with jokes.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.970
"You mean that he's expressed
no opinion about the epidemic?"

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:12.370
He persisted, "Would you
ask him, Larry, would you?"

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:17.960
To which Larry replied,
"Have you been checked?"

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.990
Reporters fell out of their seats.

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:23.810
The press conference was
over, that joke always worked.

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:33.690
1986, in the East Village, where
I shared a rundown apartment

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.220
on Avenue C, the scene was grim.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.820
Every building was a
microcosm of the plague.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:44.160
Two floors above in our building,
a slender redhead from Georgia.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.720 position:56%
In his early 20s fell into a drunken
tailspin following his diagnosis.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.360
For the several weeks before
his family came to collect him,

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.340
he lamented his fate
operatically in our living room,

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.620
incapable of steeling
himself for the coming battle.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.280
At a time when examples
of surprising grace

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.910
and fortitude dominated,
his reaction, however,

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:06.080
understandable, stood out.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.080
His sobbing was a tropical squall.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.630
We never heard from him again.

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:14.820
Across the hall, Evelyn exiled
her husband after a bout

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.010
of pneumonia won him
a month in a hospital

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:20.070
and in a discharge
slip that said AIDS.

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:22.320
When he tried to return home,
she met him in the hallway

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.160
with the scorching rage
over his admitted drug use,

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.050
and as their two young
daughters screamed in confusion,

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:32.190
she issued final banishment orders.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.550
Day after day he returned
seeking forgiveness.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:37.930
She was too panicked about
her own future to grant.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:40.900 position:56%
One morning I found that he had made
a nest for himself in the hallway

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.810
between the doors, heartbroken
and desiccated as close

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:47.610
to the girls as he was allowed.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:48.910
"Are you all right, Juan?"

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.560
I asked. "Can I get you anything?"

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.810
I had to lean in close
to hear his reply.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:56.940
"My bones hurt."

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:01.980
He whispered, shifting painfully
from one emaciated hip to another.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.370
He pinched at his yellow
bedroll, unable to turn it

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:06.530 position:56%
into the cushion that he longed for.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:08.450
His voice was hallow and raspy.

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:10.610
The unmistaken sound of PCP.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:13.310
"Do you have a doctor?

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:14.610
Anyone I can call?"

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:15.910
He shook his head.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:21.500
"The VA, they told me to go
home to Puerto Rico to die.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.850
But how?" He stared at
the door keeping him

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:26.810
from all of his resources.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:30.990 position:56%
A sudden pain contorted his face, he
gripped his abdomen and gave a look

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:34.420
of terrified foreknowledge,
but there was no time.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:38.370
His bowels emptied in a
terrible force painting a mandala

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:41.400
of excrement on the
floor where he sat.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.130
"Let me get you some help,"
I said, reaching around him.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.460
I pounded urgently on the
door of his old apartment.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.620
"No, no, no," he cried
out of embarrassment.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.910
He whispered an incantation
in Spanish meant

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:55.390
to spare his daughters the
site of their father like this.

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:59.460
He managed to get to his feet,
stroking the hallway clean

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:03.070
with his bedding and on
fragile legs carried his shamed

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:05.950
down the stairs to the street.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:10.470
He need not have fled, his
wife never came to the door.

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:21.870
I'm going to read forward
just a little bit.

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:26.440
My own personal narrative had
me leaving New York to go work

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.710
as a journalist in Central
America during the wars there.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:36.420
I felt the need to cover
someone else's war for a time.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.240
Letters from friends reached me in
the war zones of Central America.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.910
Sometimes weeks in transit
undermining my efforts

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:44.110
to escape the epidemic.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:49.540
JT, Roger, Michael E., Richard
they'd all dropped dead.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.460
I started keeping a book
with each name and bits

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.970
of our last conversations
or intimacies.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:56.930
Attaching a few sentences like
buoys to memories of them.

00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.860
JT, young, charming, irresponsible.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.680
Was sleeping on friends
couches at the very end.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:08.610
Roger, a filmmaker, dead at 40, on
the cusp of a very powerful career.

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:10.000
Richard was the husband of Susan,

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.110
our building superintendent,
a bisexual it turns out.

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:17.340
Michael E. had climbed from
poverty to medical school,

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:21.520
and had only begun to practice
when he became a patient instead.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.590
Remembering his heartbreaking 30th
birthday party turned my stomach.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.290
His mother, fulfilling an
old promise had come north

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.640
for the first time to cook him
his favorite Southern fare.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.450
But before the guests arrived,
he had told her that he was gay

00:34:34.450 --> 00:34:36.960
and that all the guests
would be gay.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:41.190
This gave her more of a
shock than she could handle.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:44.470
Already unsteady at the
beginning of the evening,

00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:47.600 position:56%
her wobble grew more pronounced each
time she returned from the corner

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.780
in the kitchen where
the bar was set up.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.610
Before the meal was fully plated,
she slid to the floor unconscious.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:56.980
I helped Michael lift her into bed.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.280
"Are you one too?"

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.670
She asked me before
beginning to snore.

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.330
"And that was the easy
part," Michael said.

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:06.220
"In the morning, we'll
talk about AIDS."

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.490
I'd heard once from Brian Guejuan
[assumed spelling] my old roommate,

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:13.080
his letter was full of exciting
updates about his artwork,

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.960
about life in Chicago,
about his lover, Dough,

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.660
whom he had nicknamed Buster.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:23.250
He seemed in good spirits
despite the frank last paragraph.

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:27.310
"My Frankenstein knobs are bigger,
big, hard buttons on my neck.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:28.610
But at least they don't hurt."

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:32.100
He wrote. "I've had a couple of
other weird health things, thrush,

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.230
which is like a gross
blanket in my throat,

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:36.540
and shingles, which hurt like hell.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:40.030
Obviously, something's gone haywire
but the doctor doesn't know what."

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:42.830
He wasn't letting it get him down.

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:44.970
"I mean, it's been three
years and I'm basically fine."

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:46.270
He insisted.

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:49.840
He didn't mention whether he'd
been tested, and he seemed content,

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.360
determined actually to exist
in a state of unknowing.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.960
I didn't address the subject in my
return note, concentrating instead

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.390
on lavish descriptions
of life in the jungle.

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:04.250
In our contortions, we were as
purposeful as Tolstoy's amputee

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.260
who told a judge how
he coped with the pain.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.050
"The main thing, your honor is not

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:11.120
to spend too much time
thinking about it.

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.840
If you don't think about
it, it doesn't seem much."

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:18.240 position:56%
When the thinking cannot be
vanquished, it drowned out all else.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.300
Sitting on the curb outside my
Managua hotel room one night,

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.370
sharing a beer with a friend, I
traced a finger absentmindedly

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:27.270
above the waistband of my jeans

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:30.620
and on my hip I came upon a
spot raised in letters [chime].

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:34.010
That was scary [laughter].

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.470
Quickly excusing myself
and returning to my room,

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:41.380
I tore off my clothes and stood
before a bare bulb staring

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.890
at the dreaded stigmata.

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:44.190
It made sense.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:47.120
I had had the battle with
shingles those three years ago.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.820
Countless nights in the
jungle, I woke drenched in sweat

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:54.590
and convinced myself that it was
from tropical heat, nothing else.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:57.120
The KS had gotten me.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.450
I never mentioned my
lesion to anyone.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:02.030
And I immediately began
planning to return to New York

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:03.590
to face this new reality.

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:06.690 position:56%
For a number of frustrating
reasons, this took many, many weeks.

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.680
Before departing, I was
overtaken by dysentery

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.030
of a dreadfully familiar kind.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.090
The cramping, the inability

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:17.260
to control my bowels,
I had no appetite.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.560
Weight slid off of me.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.920
It could be anything of course, in
this country of non-potable water,

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.740
mosquito clouds and casual hygiene.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:28.040
During the time that I was embedded
with soldiers we had no ready rolls

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.310
of paper for cleaning ourselves.

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:33.150
No barracks for washing ourselves.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.030
We had no kitchen for
scouring the pots.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.330
And no silverware at all.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:40.840
Just shallow plastic bowls we
rotated in a complex choreography,

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:46.250
scooping the gruel to our mouths
with hands as dirty as dirt.

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:50.240 position:56%
In Managua, I consulted a succession
of well-meaning doctors who admitted

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.070
that they had no drugs to
prescribe, and little in the way

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.530
of diagnostic tools
given the tight embargoes

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.570
of the Reagan administration.

00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:59.270
Nobody suspected HIV.

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:01.260
There wasn't a diagnosed
case in the country yet

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:05.130
and since gays they were rounded up
and thrown into a special prison,

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:07.690
out of caution, I didn't
bring it up.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:10.520
Finally, I presented myself
to a private hospital.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.550
I'd heard rumors that
inpatients were given priority

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:16.610
to access to the armamentarium.

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:22.890
There, I received the presumptive
diagnosis of amoeba infection.

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:25.210
A rampant assault requiring
daily shots

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:27.950 position:56%
of a viscous remedy into my buttock.

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:30.620
After two weeks, they sent me
back to my hotel with a supply

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.410
of loaded needles to
finish the course.

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:36.550
I proved an unskilled
self-administrator.

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:39.310
A friend visiting from New
York didn't mind helping out,

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:41.190
though he proved even less adept.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:44.400
On his first effort, he
discharged the needle

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:48.360
to shallowly creating a
painful blister in the epidermis

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.830
that slowly receded into
a permanent purple scar

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:54.370
that took a shape eerily
of a crucifix.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.180
This all did little
to slow my symptoms.

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:59.850
When I stepped on a scale,
I found I had lost 30 pounds

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:01.590
since leaving New York.

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:06.130
Luckily, my ticket home soon
came and I returned to the city

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:09.250 position:56%
and to modern medicine, such as was.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:12.240
It was winter, a year
away I was astounded

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.630
to see the stark visual
presence of plague

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:18.650
on the sidewalks below 14th
Street, having the same harrowed,

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:21.990
trembling appearance,
I fitted right in.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:23.650
Dr. Wakavitcz [assumed
spelling] squeezed me

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.150
into her packed schedule.

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:28.670
I stood before her, naked as she
drew her warm hands along my body

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:31.000 position:56%
to look for knobs on my lymph nodes.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.380
She found none.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.420
She studied the lesion on
my hip with a hurried smile.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.300
It was a type of mole, she
said, nothing to worry about.

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:42.920
But my bony appearance, and
abdominal distress stumped her.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.730
She sent me to a clinic
specializing in tropical diseases

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:49.930
where they diagnosed a spectrum of
bacterial and protozoan infections.

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:53.310
They prescribed Flagyl,
a powerful antibiotics

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:57.190
so punishing it put blood in
my stool, numbed my fingers

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:59.720
and seemed to compress my brain.

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:05.750
Officially, the National Toxicology
Program reasonably anticipated

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:09.670
that Flagyl was carcinogenic,
but it served its purpose

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.710
and it put me on the mend.

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:15.260 position:56%
Despite the fact that I had begun
gaining weight, Dr. Wakavitcz wanted

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.560
to see me for a follow
up appointment.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.600
She ran down a list of questions
about possible exposures

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.580
and indicators of infection.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.500
My answers all fell
in the safe column,

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.230
until she asked about shingles.

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:28.870
I hadn't thought to tell
her about that before.

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:32.190
It hadn't left any scars
and it never returned.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:34.940
"It can mean a compromised
immune system."

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.740
She said, which I knew.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.720
But, she hastily added
"Sometimes, not always.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.020
Sometimes.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.320
Simple stress can bring it on.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.300
Sometimes there's no
triggers at all."

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:48.110
She said. "But I'd like you
to consider an HIV test."

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:50.030
Reluctantly, I agreed.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:53.280
Reasoning that a positive
diagnosis would do no more harm

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.570
to me psychologically than not
knowing, which was consuming me.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:00.740 position:56%
It was by now possible to send blood
to commercial labs for testing,

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.970
but the risk was still too great.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:06.510
Insurance companies were dropping
patients who tested positive.

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:10.160 position:56%
Labs were reporting positive
results to the Department of Health.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:13.170
The potential for serious
revocations was real.

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:16.150
So, Wakavitcz recommended
using the network

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:19.080
of alternative confidential
testing sites

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.580
that had been set up by the CDC.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.000
After drawing my blood, she filled

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.760
out a form assigning an untraceable
code number to the sample.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.430
Referenced only inside
her medical files.

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:32.810
Then she handed me the
form and the deep red tube.

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:35.280
"Carry this to the Health
Department on First Avenue."

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.790
She said. "There's a
drop off in the lobby.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:40.660
Don't sign the visitor's
log, just tell them

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:43.260
that you're dropping off a sample."

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:44.560
I did as she said.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.190
At 455 First Avenue,
I passed through a set

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:49.890
of glass doors, fogged by neglect.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:52.910
The lobby was grimy
and nearly empty,

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.390
but for an old gray metal desk

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:58.070
on which a uniformed
guard rested a lazy elbow.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:02.180
I showed the red of my
vial and without a word,

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.560
he pointed to an alcove
beside the elevator bank.

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.190
Standing there was a
simple white refrigerator.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:11.010
The kind you'd expect to
see in a suburban kitchen.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:14.070
Opening the door suspiciously
I found nothing inside

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:18.540
but a cardboard basket holding
more of what I had brought,

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:24.210
tubes of blood with confidential
identifiers rubber banded to them.

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:27.260
I placed mine on the top of the
pile, praying that the next person

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:31.540
to open the cooler, didn't
perversely scramble the vials

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:35.250
and the forms, giving me
someone else's diagnosis.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:39.700
I waited two sleepless
weeks for the results.

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:43.670
When it was time, I returned to
the doctor's office for my results.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.070
They were negative.

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:47.240
I was so relieved,
I nearly collapsed.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.430
"But don't live your life any
differently," the doctor said.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:52.340
"This could be a false negative.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.880
Or, there could be an incubation
period, we just don't know.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.700
And anyway," she said, gesturing
to the fishbowl of condoms

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:02.130
on the receptionists counter,
"everybody else is positive,

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.720
so the old rules still apply."

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.020
How to survive a plague."

[ Inaudible Audience Comment ]

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.820
So, the book talks about the kind
of disorientation that took place

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:36.280
in 1996 when effective
medicine was finally available.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.490
When the plague went from an
almost certain death sentence

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:42.800
to a survivable infection.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:49.230
And that was a confusing time
for everybody in the movement.

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:53.680
And certainly, in the community
that was afflicted by HIV.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.960
Nobody knew how long it would last.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:03.430
And then when it lasted, no
one knew what to do next.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:07.120
The plague years lasted 15 years.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:12.690 position:56%
And for anybody who was on the front
line, that was all that we did.

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:19.740
And a lot of people left that time
ill-prepared to do anything else.

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:27.930
Activism lost a lot of its urgency
and especially from those people

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:30.990
who were in activism to
save their own lives.

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:34.630
And once they saved their own
lives, they achieved this thing

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:37.170
that they never thought
they would get to.

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:43.290
They turned to trying to figure
out what their lives would be.

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:47.340
And all the money for AIDS ended.

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:51.520
And you know, I continued on as an
AIDS journalist, I was lucky enough

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.770
to have been able to find a
way to move my AIDS activism

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:58.570
into the future, but I found
that it was harder and harder

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:00.180
to get stories published.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:04.360
I was explaining earlier, that the
reason I did the documentary before

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:08.080
the book was because I could
get nobody to publish that.

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.630
Nobody would publish
a book about AIDS.

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:12.980
Because it had already been told
and we'd already been through it

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:16.320
and nobody wanted to hear it
anymore, and the was so much death.

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:21.060
And, so we all went quiet.

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.640
Activism did continue.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.830
Many of the people who
were front-line activists

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:32.030 position:56%
in the plague years, especially
those who were working on treatment,

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:34.980
turned their attention
to accessing treatment.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:38.320
And they moved to Africa many,

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:43.980
and helped establish the movements
there for treatment access.

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:49.550 position:56%
And that was very slow going, but in
recent years it's been phenomenal,

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:52.880
you know, at the end of the
film which came out in 2012,

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:57.180
and the film is all about the
discovery, the interaction.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.500
And the book is between these
activists, and patients,

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.920
and researchers that
brought about the drugs.

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:08.080
It says that 6 million people
are alive thanks to these drugs

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.380
that were discovered in that way.

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.990
Well, that was 5 years ago,

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.010
now 20 million people are
living on those drugs.

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:15.410
So, that activism is
pushing those prices down

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:17.670
and building those
networks and giving people

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:21.470
across the globe access
to healthcare,

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:22.890
sometimes for the first time.

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:25.280
So, that has worked.

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:29.620
What hasn't worked is any
significant slowing in the country,

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:32.320
even, of the transmissions.

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:40.830
And HIV rates have been at about
50,000 a year in the US in 1996.

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:44.500 position:56%
And they were 50,000 a year in 2012.

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:48.160
And until the last two years there
had been really no significant

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.460
change in that number.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.830
And it's finally starting
to come down now.

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.950
But, you know, one of the things

00:48:55.950 --> 00:49:00.960
that activists lost
access to is money.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:06.190
People had spent a fortune
on empowering the movement

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:08.750
and creating the institutions
around AIDS.

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:10.050
And they were depleted.

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:12.930
And wanted to do something
else with their money.

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:18.530
So, we lost a lot of traction I
think on many different levels.

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:26.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Well, I think
it's a different population now.

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:35.240

is contracting AIDS, is that fair?

largely southern, largely of people

The largest demographic group is gay
kids in the South, ages 14 to 20.

And we just haven't reached them.

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:02.470
And you're right, it's moved
out of cities for the most part,

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:05.070 position:56%
and it's moved into parts of America

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:09.270
that our national media
doesn't reach or go to.

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:14.060

our hearts don't reach either.

I write a lot about AZT in the book.

00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:36.780
The AZT was the first drug
of course that came out.

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:41.320
It held incredible promise in the
hearts and minds of so many people.

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.630
It turned out, in the long run,

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:47.330
although it dominated the
drug market for many years,

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:49.680
it did nothing to extend life.

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.890
It really made, [inaudible]
very rich,

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:57.180
but it did not have any
kind of desired impact.

00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:01.690
However, in 1996, when
the new drug compound,

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:04.600
the protease inhibitors
were brought to market,

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:08.320
they also didn't work very well
on their own and only worked

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:11.210
in combination with
two other drug classes.

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:13.090
And one of those drugs was AZT.

00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:16.120
So, AZT finally did work in '96.

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:20.450
And was still being prescribed
up until just a few years ago.

00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:27.590
So, it did life up to its
promise, but it took a long time.

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:30.780
In the cocktail, right,
that three drug cocktail

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.060
that proved so miraculous.

00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:34.530
And what a miracle, right?

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:37.760
You know, it emptied hospitals.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.060

to ever leave

Yeah, yeah way too late.

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:51.000
And I think the point and the
reason I wanted to go back

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:57.230
to this history was, it wouldn't
have happened even in '96,

00:51:57.230 --> 00:52:01.580
I'm certain, if it
weren't for AIDS activism.

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.380

had started earlier,

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:06.830
fi the rage in the community
had taken hold earlier,

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:08.360

at what's going on

could use an Act Up to go

One of the things of that kind

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:46.670
of aggressive street activism
did was empower the good voices

in government and in pharma
and in research institutions.

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:54.330
It gave them power.

00:54:54.330 --> 00:55:01.170
It gave Anthony Fauci, for example,
the ability to go to Congress

00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:02.470
and say I need this money,

because look what's
happening in the streets.

worked then and could work again.

that they laid out a blueprint

00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:19.530
for how social justice activism can
be taken to any number of issues,

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:23.510
and certainly back to
healthcare again today.

[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:45.980 position:56%
And I think the book kind of bears
this out, but activism fails mostly.

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:54.280
And that you know, takes away
the spirit from a lot of people,

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:57.480
if you don't get immediate results.

00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.500
But what Act Up showed us is that
if you, I mean Act Up was at it

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:05.940
for 10 years, it took them 10
years to you know, to rest the kind

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:07.850
of victory that they
were looking for.

00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:09.750
And they just never stopped.

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:13.420
Every failure and every
disappointment they brought back

00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:16.920
into those crowded meetings,
and discussed, and tore apart,

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.100
and debated, and they
re-strategized,

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:24.380
and went out again the
next day to try it again.

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:29.040
And I think so many of the recent
movements, the Occupy movement,

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:32.030
for example, that seemed
to gather strength all

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:36.030
across the country,
it didn't keep at it.

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:40.310
They didn't, you know,
they succumbed to failure.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:47.290
And one wonders how a group
of people can overcome

00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:49.290
that so thoroughly
the way Act Up did.

00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:53.800
And Act Up was not just in New
York, there were 147 chapters

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:57.810
of the organization around
the world, 19 countries.

00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:00.690
And they just kept going.

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:02.550
So, how do you find that?

00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:05.990
How do you find the inspiration, or
the motivation to just keep going?

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:08.510
I don't know.

[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:17.220
Of course, I think that's mostly
what I wrote about were the people

00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:19.510
that I considered heroes.

[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:41.440
Well, I think the other thing that
you can't not take into account

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:44.150
when you watch the
film or read the book,

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:47.920
there was no social media then.

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:52.190
And so, people had to be together.

00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:53.490
They had to be the same room.

00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:55.430
There had to be rooms with
people in those rooms.

00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:58.230
And there's something about
that kind of gathering

00:57:58.230 --> 00:58:04.260 position:56%
that social media doesn't replicate.

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:07.770
And social media makes
it easy to reach people,

00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:11.770 position:56%
but we should be reaching people and
inviting them into rooms I think.

00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:16.400
And in those rooms is
where ideas become grand.

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:21.890
Ambition becomes finally,
you know honed,

00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:24.740
and yeah, get off social media.

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:27.700
I think that's the big
message I have for everybody,

00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:30.680
except you should sign up to
my Facebook page [laugther].

00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:34.750

01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:06.510
It has been, but you know, I think
one of those ancestors maybe.

01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:09.190
But I think prep is a great idea.

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:14.080
And prep, which is pre-exposure
prophylaxis is why the numbers have

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:17.110
gone down from transmissions
over the last couple of years.

01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:20.840
It's also why people stop
using condoms and why gonorrhea

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.800
and syphilis have gone
through the roof.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.690
So, it's creating another problem.

01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:31.710
But in fact, it could bring an end
to the epidemic, or participate

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:35.980
as one of the significant tools in
bringing an end to the epidemic.

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.250
Putting people on treatment,
we know people who are

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:40.710
on effective treatment
are not infectious.

01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:45.660 position:56%
Putting people who are at high risk,
these kids in the south on prep,

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:50.240
and that's where the virus is being
bounced around so dramatically.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:53.550
That we could bring the numbers
down so low that it's you know,

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:57.120
no longer a steady state
you know of infections.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.330
And it could work.

01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:03.630
But you know, I frankly
don't know what's going on,

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:09.600
if anything in the area
of trying to cure HIV.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.160
I think maybe that
needs to be jumpstarted.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.030
I know that there's a
lot of profit to be made

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:18.720
in treating a disease
without curing it.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.660
It's, exactly.

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:28.750 position:56%
And then you increase the
marketplace by selling the same drug

01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:30.430
and calling it prep, right?

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:35.710
So. It reminded me that the first
of the demonstrations that Act

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:41.380
Up brought to the NIH, it was
because in those first five, six,

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:45.280
seven years of the epidemic,
eight years of the epidemic,

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:50.210
the only research that was
being conducted was on HIV.

01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:53.230
Or what was presumed to be
HIV in the earlier days.

01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:57.280
But nobody was doing any research
on the opportunistic infections

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.600
which were what were
taking people's lives.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.080
Nobody was doing research
on pneumocystis pneumonia.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:05.600
Nobody was doing research
on any of the diseases

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.040
that were the actual
proximate causes of death.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.660
And they determined, the activists,

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:15.540
that it was because there was
no potential for a Nobel Prize

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:20.380
in being able to impact pneumonia.

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:25.210
So, the chant of the
demonstration at the NIH was

01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:29.320
"Every four minutes someone
dies, fuck your Nobel Prize."

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:33.120
And their message was a
little on the sharp side,

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:38.190
but they really were exposing what
was a major issue in research,

01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:41.130
that no one had prioritized
the opportunistic infections

01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:47.420 position:56%
and that no federal money, even by
1988, 1989 was going to the research

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:52.310
on any of the 23 OIs that
were killing people then.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.320

[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.190
The question is about stigma.

01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:08.820
And it surprises me that we should
still have stigma around HIV.

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:15.330
But it is really a
structural problem.

01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:19.230 position:56%
It keeps people from getting tested.

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:25.800
And we still have, in many states
and in many parts of the world,

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:30.730
it's illegal for people with HIV
to have sex with other people.

01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:33.090
Even if it's safe sex.

01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:36.040
Even if your undetectable.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.860
And you know, there are
people in jail today

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.950
who have not infected
anybody, but who simply had sex

01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:46.450
with them under those laws.

01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:49.040
So, the culture's not
dealing with it,

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.870
the politicians aren't
dealing with it.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:56.890
And the only place you find
HIV stigma being discussed is

01:03:56.890 --> 01:04:01.190
in HIV publications, where
people are already HIV positive.

01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:03.940
And it's certainly one of
the factors that's keeping us

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:05.920
from reaching those
kids in the south.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.080
And they really are kids.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.660
And the epidemic is still
really a gay epidemic,

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.920
gay or transgender epidemic.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:20.050 position:56%
And there's still stigma around that
too, about being gay in the south,

01:04:20.050 --> 01:04:21.530
and about being trans in the south.

01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:23.870
And in America, and in the world.

01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:26.910
So, there's much yet to be done.

01:04:33.310 --> 01:04:35.040
That's it?
