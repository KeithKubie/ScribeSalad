done the kind of research I've done then
 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.320
done the kind of research I've done then
you know the truth reverberation

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330
you know the truth reverberation
 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.890
you know the truth reverberation
experiments are done here mm-hmm notices

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900
experiments are done here mm-hmm notices
 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.019
experiments are done here mm-hmm notices
a certain vibration levels the dirt will

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029
a certain vibration levels the dirt will
 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:34.170
a certain vibration levels the dirt will
change

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180
 
 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:47.459
 
[Music]

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469
 
 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.459
 
yeah

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469
yeah
 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.160
yeah
that's it that's what it does you see

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170
that's it that's what it does you see
 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.160
that's it that's what it does you see
does what the change is this yeah this

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
does what the change is this yeah this
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.619
does what the change is this yeah this
wasn't what it looks like now a week ago

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629
wasn't what it looks like now a week ago
 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.200
wasn't what it looks like now a week ago
the reverberations the harmonics change

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210
the reverberations the harmonics change
 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.259
the reverberations the harmonics change
it organically well what what did it

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269
it organically well what what did it
 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.509
it organically well what what did it
look like before it was marinara sauce a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519
look like before it was marinara sauce a
 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.649
look like before it was marinara sauce a
week ago I wasn't dirt no it was orange

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659
week ago I wasn't dirt no it was orange
 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.399
week ago I wasn't dirt no it was orange
and quite tasty yeah so that's the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409
and quite tasty yeah so that's the
 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.649
and quite tasty yeah so that's the
miracle of science you're saying what's

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
miracle of science you're saying what's
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.660
miracle of science you're saying what's
this have to do with Stonehenge

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670
this have to do with Stonehenge
 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.490
this have to do with Stonehenge
everything well how does it have a sign

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500
everything well how does it have a sign
 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.370
everything well how does it have a sign
no no no I'm getting impatient because

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380
no no no I'm getting impatient because
 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.020
no no no I'm getting impatient because
you don't seem to really be connecting

you don't seem to really be connecting
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.850
you don't seem to really be connecting
all the dots do you if you took this

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
all the dots do you if you took this
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.160
all the dots do you if you took this
guitar in the amplifier to Stonehenge in

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
guitar in the amplifier to Stonehenge in
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.570
guitar in the amplifier to Stonehenge in
you plugged it in and you're saying it's

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580
you plugged it in and you're saying it's
 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.760
you plugged it in and you're saying it's
a rock no it's not a rock it was an

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
a rock no it's not a rock it was an
 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.070
a rock no it's not a rock it was an
amplifier originally and I plugged it in

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080
amplifier originally and I plugged it in
 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.609
amplifier originally and I plugged it in
I'm sorry

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
I'm sorry
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.260
I'm sorry
Stonehenge was an amplifier originally

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
Stonehenge was an amplifier originally
 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.529
Stonehenge was an amplifier originally
of course it's not a fire for who

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539
of course it's not a fire for who
 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.539
