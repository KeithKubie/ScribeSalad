00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.860
I've been wanting to make a
video on a couple of terms

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.050
that people have really thrown
around for a while now.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.190
And I think it really hits the
core of some of the issues

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.230
we're dealing with now with the
credit debacle but it's

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.550
kind of at a deeper level.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:20.970
So the things I want to go over
are the ideas of savings,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.150
consumption, and investment.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.460
And you hear these a lot.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.980
Everyone obviously says, I've
invested in the stock market

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.440
or I've invested in a house and
I really want to give you

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.740
a framework for how I think
about these ideas.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.180
And frankly, I haven't seen them
depicted this way in any

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.210
economics book, although they've
kind of touched on

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.320
this, but I think this is really
how you should think

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.690
about these things.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.680
So if you save money, and I
think we all know what that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.950
means, that's money that you
didn't spend, there's a couple

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.370
of things that you
can do with it.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.800
You can either consume
your money or you

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.130
could invest your money.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.530
So, let's just think about a
bunch of different situations

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.110
and think about whether those
things are consumption or

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.720
investment.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.066
So let's say, I have $100,000
that I'm dealing with.

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.350
So let's say, I take
that $100,000

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.415
and I build a factory.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.080
And I think that that factory
is going to be able to

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.662
produce-- I'll make up some
product-- it'll be able to

00:01:29.662 --> 00:01:33.640
produce cars more efficiently
and cheaper than any other car

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.130
factory out there.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.060
Well, I think we'd all agree
that this is an investment.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.390
And why is it an investment?

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.550
Because I'm taking this $100,000
and I'm putting it to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.110
some use that is creating,
hopefully, more value than my

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.110
original $100,000.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.220
In fact, I'm expecting some
type of a return on this

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.690
investment.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.180
And I've made a bunch of videos
on what a return on

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.430
investment is, and you can
usually quantify it.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.610
If I take a $100,000 and I build
this factory and this

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.710
factory spits out $50,000 a
year, it's probably creating

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.130
at least $50,000 a year value,
assuming that nothing corrupt

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.490
is happening in our system.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.020
In fact, it's normally creating
more than $50,000 a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.490
year of value.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.930
It may be creating a $100,000 a
year of value and $50,000 of

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.910
that may be going to the
person who's doing the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.150
production and then the other
half of the value is actually

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.740
going to the consumer
of whatever

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.730
this factory is making.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.550
And you have to think about
it, because if all of the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.150
value went to the person who
produced the factory then

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.380
there's not a huge incentive
for someone to use his

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.340
products anymore.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.560
But anyway, that's not the
topic of discussion.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.370
We're just trying to get at
a mental framework on what

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.640
consumption is versus
investment.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.710
So I think we all agree that if
I were to build a factory

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.680
that this is-- let's say I'll
do everything in green as

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.320
investment.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.180
So building a factory
is an investment.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.460
Now let's say that I'm homeless

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.960
and I have this $100,000.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.340
And because I'm homeless, I
don't have a place to go and

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.180
eat dinner and rest and relax.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.360
Because I don't have that, I
can't get a job and I can't

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.340
become a productive
member of society.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.830
So maybe, I'm going to use this
$100,000 to buy a simple

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.560
house that meets all
of my needs.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.400
Let's say build a simple house,
and I'll do that in a

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.650
neutral color.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.260
This is my other use of this
$100,000, instead of building

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.730
a factory, I'm going to
build a simple house.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.830
And this house, it provides
shelter for me and my family,

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.160
it allows us that security that
now my kids can go to

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.640
school and they can
themselves become

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.720
more productive citizens.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.410
I now have an address.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.440
I have a place to take a shower,
that allows me to go

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.750
get a job and I can now create
value for society as a whole,

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.710
instead of being on the
corner and begging

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.220
for money from people.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.880
I would argue that this
is also an investment.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.340
Why is it?

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.460
Because I'm taking this
$100,000, that maybe I had or

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.150
someone gave to me, and it's
generating a return.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.690
And what is that return?

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:12.940
Well, with a factory,
it's maybe a

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.770
little easier to quantify.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.089
But at minimum, it's this work
that I'm able to do because I

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.970
now have a house.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.670
Because I have the security,
I have the address.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:20.399
I have the shelter.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.880
I'm able to relax.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.360
It's that security and it's also
the return that probably

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.420
my kids are going to be able to
now contribute to society.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.150
Maybe if they grew up homeless,
they would have

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.500
never been able to contribute.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.120
And now that they have a roof
over their head, and are able

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.670
to go to school, et cetera, they
are going to be able to

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.130
give some economic value
back to society.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.920
It's hard to value, maybe I
didn't have any job before and

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.970
now I have a job and
I can contribute

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.480
$30,000 a year to society.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.670
Maybe I'm working at
someone's factory.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.130
Maybe I'm providing
some other-- maybe

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.260
I'm a farmer now.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.330
Whatever, I'm providing
some source of value.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.390
And maybe my kids-- if they
never got an education, they

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.300
would have maybe added $10,000
of value per year to people

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.120
and now they can add
$20,000 of value.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.520
So that difference would also be
some of the return on this

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.280
investment.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.880
So I also consider this
to be an investment.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.730
Now, my question to you is,
let's say that I already had a

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.570
house-- so this is
an investment.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.900
Let's say I already had a house
and my family is happy

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.020
and we have everything
we need.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.820
We have food on the table and
my kids go to school and I'm

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.360
able to get a job and
all of that exists.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.960
But let's say, I still have
a $100,000 and I use that

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:40.350
$100,000-- I'll do it in
yellow-- to put in some

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.650
granite counter tops.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.960
I have some money left over,
let's say, I'm going to add a

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:55.360
bathroom to my house and I will
put the latest hardwood

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.990
floors, so that my family
will be impressed.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.660
You can imagine.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.410
And maybe I add 2,000
square feet.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.620
You normally can't get all
that for a $100,000 but I

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.990
think you'll bear with me.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.750
So I'm essentially doing some
major home improvements.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.160
So my question to you is-- is
this an investment or is this

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.620
consumption?

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.480
Now, in our everyday world, with
most people we deal with,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.280
they will call this investment
in my house.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.080
And why are they saying that?

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.990
Because they say, by spending
a $100,000 in the house in

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.050
this way, that maybe-- if you
watch the Home and Garden

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.210
channel, they're doing this
all the time-- that if you

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.150
pour this a $100,000 into your
house, that maybe the value of

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.170
your house is going to
increase by $150,000.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.990
Or someone else, all of a
sudden, is going to perceive

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.690
the value of your house
as being $150,000.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.390
They'll say, well, you got a
$50,000 return on investment.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.440
I'd argue that that
is not investment.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.070
That it's speculation.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.000
You are, essentially, piling
money into this stuff-- and

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.930
I'll do this in red,
consumption is red.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.080
What's happening here
truly economically?

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.220
When you add granite, or you
add an extra bathroom or

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.080
hardwood floors or this extra
2,000 square feet, is it

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.260
making anyone who's living in
that house more productive?

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.670
Is it making you harder working;
is it making you more

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.680
likely to invent the cure for
cancer, or more likely to

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.120
invent a way of getting
cheap energy, or

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.390
produce more widgets?

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.900
No, it's just, if anything,
providing more things for you

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.220
to have to take care of, that
you're not going to be able to

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.480
focus as much on your work.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.790
Or more energy is going to
have to be extended to

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.060
maintain this type of place,
to heat and cool a 2,000

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.020
square foot house.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.100
So if anything, by actually
pouring the $100,000 here,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.920
you're actually creating
something that is going to

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.420
suck more out of society.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.440
In fact, in no way is this going
to contribute to the

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.870
collective wealth of society.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.770
The last two examples I gave
contribute to the collective

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.530
wealth society, some of which
you share, and that is your

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.710
return on the investment.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.950
But as a whole, this is an
investment into society.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.360
And it's going to make
the pie bigger.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.750
This right here, does not
make the pie bigger.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.130
It might make you a little bit
happier, make your ego feel a

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.880
little bit better, let your
pride grow, and your self

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.210
righteousness grow, and show
other people that you've

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.490
arrived, but it's not
going to increase

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:22.890
the wealth of society.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.980
And when you say that you've
invested, you are really just

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.720
saying I've speculated.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.340
What you're saying is-- by
paying this $100,000, you're

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.260
going to find, essentially,
a greater fool out there.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.830
They could have done the same
thing, they could have bought

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.210
your house, spent $100,000 and
done this, if this is what

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.640
would have made them happy.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.169
But what you're saying is,
essentially, that you're going

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:45.730
to find somebody out there who's
willing to pay $150,000

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.060
extra for something that should

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.970
have only cost $100,000.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.800
And in fact, if anything, if you
use this at all, the value

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.850
of this is going to go down.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.060
So you're just somehow assuming
that the granite

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.110
counter tops that you choose are
going to be the taste that

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.080
someone else would like or that
the hardwood floors are

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.680
going to be the taste someone
else would like.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.280
I would actually argue that when
you customize your house

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.820
in this way, you are creating
$100,000 of consumption to

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.710
your taste.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.660
And I'd be surprised if someone
else, truly, is

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.820
willing to pay more than
$100,000 unless they're being,

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.360
in some way, irrational or they
can finance this because

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.150
it's part of the mortgage.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:27.700
Anyway, this is, I think, just
the big picture: investment

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.400
adds value to society.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.480
A simple house adds
value to society.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.230
Consumption is something where
people might call it an

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.460
investment because it's
kind of speculation.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.840
One might find some other guy
willing to emotionally pay

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.710
more for something.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.820
But it's money that's burned;
it's not creating more value

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.970
for society.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.220
I continue this in
the next video.
