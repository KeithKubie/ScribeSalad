CLIFF: So good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.680
Welcome to another
Talks at Google event.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.910
We are extremely thrilled
today to have Erik Hall, who

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.770
is a contemporary artist and
the co-owner of the Hall Spassov

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.220
Gallery in Bellevue,
Washington and Seattle

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.410
and expanding throughout
the Pacific Northwest.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.210
Our subject today is building
a modern art collection,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.100
which I think is pretty timely,
and also to expand the thesis,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.280
talking about the role of the
artist in contemporary society

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.820
in this age of storytelling
and attention deficit.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.390
And so he'll speak
to us not only

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.300
about forming an art collection,
either as a personal passion

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.580
or as a potential
investment, and he will also

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.000
outline the current
state of the industry.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.770
So, without further
ado, please join me

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.090
in welcoming Erik to Google.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.710
Thank you.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.210
ERIK HALL: Thank you.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.350
Thank you.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.775
So as Cliff mentioned,
my name is Erik Hall,

00:00:55.775 --> 00:00:58.150
and I'm the co-owner of Hall
Spassov Gallery in Bellevue,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.650
Washington.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.880
We have a location
in Seattle as well.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.250
I own the gallery with
my wife, Amy Spassov,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.790
and we started the
gallery in 2006.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.670
Now we're both artists,
and that has with it

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.000
some kind of-- maybe some would
reference it as a faux pas,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.690
but in truth I
think it's given us

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.420
a lot of understanding of
the plight of the artist

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.420
and therefore gave us
a little bit of an edge

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.470
in doing what we do for living.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.830
And it's an unusual
relationship.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.250
That is to say, that artists
don't typically run galleries,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.950
and I don't think
they-- definitely,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.370
as far as I understand,
don't run two galleries.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.800
But one of the reasons
that we opened the gallery

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.780
to begin with was to help
cultivate the next generation

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.469
of art collector,
and we defined kind

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.010
of what we thought
that was, but that

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.010
was really the main mission.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.060
And the growth that
it's had over the years

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.200
was not something that
necessarily we planned.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.630
We always just kind
of shot from the hip

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.220
and acted on our
instincts, and I

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.610
thought that was really,
really important in the success

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.790
that we've had, because
we didn't really

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.100
follow the flow of what
was going on around us.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100
And we did most of our
growing, oddly enough,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.070
during the Great
Recession, and we did so

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.440
by taking advantage of
maybe lower property values

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.180
when we were looking
for a gallery.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.700
But the gallery itself
started in a basement,

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.412
and it was a place where
for a time we lived,

00:02:20.412 --> 00:02:22.120
because we couldn't
afford anything else,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.340
and as the business grew we
decided we wanted a street

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.150
front spot, and
we got that spot,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.910
and we grew out of
that within a year.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.040
And today this is our
gallery in Bellevue.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.780
I think we've been
there for about five,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.230
almost six years now.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.140
That's a piece of
toast in the window,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.824
and that's also a
cap gun over there,

00:02:42.824 --> 00:02:44.990
and I think that's actually
a really good indication

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.660
of the type of work
that we want to carry.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.535
It's something that's
a little bit out there.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:51.160
It's not necessarily a
pretty landscape or something

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.890
that you're going to want to put
above your couch necessarily,

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.550
although we do
have those things.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.900
But as a rule, we want to
challenge people a little bit

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.120
with the art that we represent.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.370
This is the show that's up
currently in the gallery.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.606
It's an artist named
Francesca Sundsten.

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:07.230
We're really proud
of Francesca's work,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.850
and it's been described
as otherworldly.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.802
There's always a narrative going
on in her work but, as such,

00:03:13.802 --> 00:03:15.260
I think it's still
something that's

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.920
really pretty and
appealing to look at.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.090
The stories about art are
really, really important,

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.760
and I'll get into
that a little bit.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.930
That's Amy, my wife.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.630
That's before an opening that we
had probably a few years back,

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.020
but this is what we
really look like.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.720
And that's an
important photo for me,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.330
because the truth
of our business

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.220
is that we built
every bit of it.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.470
We don't sub out when
we open a gallery.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.220
We are exceptionally
good drywallers.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.900
I know a little bit
about electrical,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.110
enough not to get
the city involved.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.080
We might have to edit that.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.664
So, in truth, we labor so that
we can keep our overhead low

00:03:56.664 --> 00:03:59.330
in the beginning, so that we can
exist, because in this business

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.510
sometimes just
existing is succeeding.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.952
It's a tough business
to exploit for a living,

00:04:04.952 --> 00:04:07.160
but we've done so because
we do all the heavy lifting

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.800
ourselves.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.750
I have a great picture of
Amy, and please forgive me,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.600
of tears streaming down
a drywall-ridden face,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.000
because we were just done.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.229
We just wanted the work to be
over on this particular place,

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.270
but we got it open and it
worked out really well.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.790
This particular photo is of
us deciding that we wanted

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.240
to learn how to pour concrete.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.900
We'll use it in some practical
application on another day.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.890
So this was the question that
I thought was the most pivotal,

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.627
and this is a risky
question for me,

00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:41.960
because in truth I didn't
know who was going to be here.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.600
So it might have been--
the "us" was a weird thing,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.100
because if there was just
one of you, it would be,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.800
why is this guy talking to me?

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.940
And if none of you
showed up, then it

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.820
would be why is
this guy talking.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.200
So why is this
guy talking to us?

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.790
And I'm here because I want to
talk to you about this print.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.550
This is a
Toulouse-Lautrec print,

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.580
and if you're
familiar with it, it's

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.946
because it's being
sold everywhere

00:05:06.946 --> 00:05:07.820
in the United States.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.528
You can get that at
Bed, Bath and Beyond.

00:05:09.528 --> 00:05:11.900
You can get it anyplace
that sells prints.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.350
Its value is aesthetic and
maybe that it fills a wall,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.850
but its actual monetary value
and it's emotional value

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:24.230
is diluted, in my opinion,
because it is so mass produced.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.050
And so I'm here
really to talk to you

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.410
about the mass standardization
of this type of work,

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.130
that I'm hoping
that you will avoid.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.275
And I want you to replace
it with something like this.

00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:39.850
This is a piece
by Gerard Cambon.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:47.057
He's a French artist, and
he has land in France, acres

00:05:47.057 --> 00:05:49.640
and acres and acres of it that's
been in his family for years,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.400
and he scavenges it for
things to make art out of.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.260
You can imagine
what you might find

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.020
in the countryside
of France after it's

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.800
been war ridden for centuries.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.090
And the stuff that he's
found, in particular,

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.910
are really special.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.120
But what's more special about
it is the story behind the work,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.000
and the story behind
the work is this,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.940
is that Gerard is actually
a cancer survivor,

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.266
and he started making a lot
of these particular pieces

00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:17.890
that we call bas
reliefs, and those bas

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.760
reliefs were a story for him.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.020
And the story goes
is that he would

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.530
go to his socialized
medicine-- or excuse me--

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.330
he was in a socialized
medicine system

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.935
in France, where
he was receiving

00:06:29.935 --> 00:06:31.760
his chemotherapy
treatment, and he

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.740
was in the treatment with the
same people at the same time

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.680
all the time, so
they became friends.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.060
So it was them looking
out on the world together.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.060
And so you imagine the
friendships and the bonds

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.980
that you might form
but, luckily for Gerard,

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.460
he found himself in remission
and has been cancer free since,

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.670
but he started
making these, also

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.240
things that he found from
the countryside in France.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.752
But the great story here is that
these are get-away vehicles.

00:06:57.752 --> 00:06:59.460
Still him and his
people, but now they're

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.135
flying down the road, they're
free from their cancer,

00:07:02.135 --> 00:07:03.010
and they're together.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.340
So there's a great
story in there,

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.714
and it doesn't have to be that
story for you necessarily,

00:07:06.714 --> 00:07:09.280
because we all can't
necessarily relate to that.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.430
But what we can
relate to is the bonds

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.170
that conform over
discussion that we

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.250
have with other people, a
general understanding that we

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.810
gain from simply communicating,
even on a basic level.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.032
In this case we're
communicating through art.

00:07:23.032 --> 00:07:24.115
Or I'll have you get this.

00:07:24.115 --> 00:07:26.580
This is something that I think
is also better than a print.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.000
This is an Ellwood Risk piece.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And we all know Felix
from our childhoods--

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.240
or I do from my childhood--
and we laughed at him

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.660
as he dropped bombs on
things and blew things up,

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.270
and it's odd that the
conversation in current media

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.510
is almost an entertainment
sort, because we

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.180
look at a television, and we
see bombs and things exploding,

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.090
and we've almost
become numb to it.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.240
And so what's being called out
in this particular piece of art

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.430
is to question how we look at
the things that are going on

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.840
on our television, and do
we look at it as education

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.000
in world affairs or do we
look at it as entertainment.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.760
And so this art
has a street bent,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.910
but the story is
still a poignant one.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.880
Or I'll have you get
something like this.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.720
This is an example of extremely
technically challenging work.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.420
It's really beautiful
work, in my opinion,

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.870
but it's technically
challenging.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.330
This is Alicia Tormey.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.489
She's a local artist
that we represent,

00:08:29.489 --> 00:08:31.280
and what's so phenomenal
about this work is

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.179
this is an encaustic.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.620
Encaustic is one of the
oldest mediums known,

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.559
and it's one of the most
impervious to the environment,

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.580
because it's wax and
resin and dry pigment.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.960
But what's unique
about Alicia-- and this

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.680
is the technical
aspect that I'm hoping

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.680
people will find
fascinating, aside

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.170
from the beauty of the
work-- is how it's done.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.200
She barely touches the
surface of the painting.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.560
She moves this around with
alcohol immersions and a torch

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.020
and forced air.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.210
And so she's painting,
but she's barely touching

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.690
the surface of the pieces.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.720
And so it becomes really,
really technically

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.090
challenging in its execution.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.680
And when you step back from
it, it's just flawless.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.380
It's absolutely a
flawless surface,

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.524
and it's really,
really beautiful.

00:09:11.524 --> 00:09:12.940
But if people want
to invest in it

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.710
and understand the
technical nature of it,

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.930
there'll be an added bonus
for you in its value.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.970
So we're used to seeing art
in a lot of different formats,

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.230
and I think that it becomes
the question of, what is art

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.043
and what isn't.

00:09:26.043 --> 00:09:29.100
It's something that comes
up in our lives quite a bit.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.420
And so, as such, we look at it
with kind of discerning eyes,

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.220
and I see things
on the internet,

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.440
and I see things in
editorials, and I

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.270
see things in print
advertising, and they're

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.160
saying that this is
art, and sometimes it is

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.180
and sometimes it isn't,
and discerning the two is

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.790
really, really important.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.850
So if you might
look through, say,

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.980
a piece of print
advertising, you

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.180
might see something like this.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.680
And there's nothing
wrong with this.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.860
That's a piece of art, and I'm
sure it's beautifully executed,

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.720
but that particular thing
isn't a piece of art.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.080
That's a print.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.560
And if you can
spend money on that,

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.700
I would encourage you
to go out and spend

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.220
that same amount of money from
an artist's studio, that's

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.440
budding, that's new, that maybe
it was something that spoke

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.630
to you, and get that
instead, because this

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.135
is going to show
up in your house

00:10:21.135 --> 00:10:23.510
and then it'll show up in a
bunch of other people's homes

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.450
as well, thus diluting
its importance.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.210
So what I'd rather you do
is get something like this.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.880
Works in the same room.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.520
It's not necessarily as
pretty, but that's certainly

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.390
a matter of opinion.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.270
But this particular
piece by Chris Leib

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:46.480
called "Sabotaging Eden" is
a really strong narrative

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.800
on what happens when
we show up to places.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.360
We're already fighting over
the damn piece of pizza.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.250
What's going to happen
next as resources dwindle?

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.310
So you can see some of
the relative importance

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:04.322
of this, especially with the
modern themes in the news.

00:11:04.322 --> 00:11:05.280
Here's another example.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.110
Beautiful room.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.710
I'm not sure what that is.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.590
In my personal taste,
I don't care for it.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.840
But why not have a
dialogue something

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.400
more like this,
about how technology

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.600
and our natural environments
are becoming so convoluted

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.290
that it's hard to
separate the two,

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.380
and it's hard to
figure out necessarily

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.790
which one we want to live in.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.050
So you take this room
that's still very beautiful,

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.290
it still works, but
now there's something

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.780
that causes a bit of pause.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.597
Has the same colors, has
the same general feel,

00:11:39.597 --> 00:11:41.180
but requires an
intellectual response.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.080
Here's another example.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.680
So I would put it to anyone
looking at this to discern

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.600
that print from the pillows.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.600
So the print has the
same feel as the pillows,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.680
and I had a really
big issue with that,

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.740
because that means
that we're looking

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.160
at those things the
same way, and we

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.790
shouldn't do that with art.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.190
So when you're initially getting
into a place in your life

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.070
where you want to
buy artwork, I would

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:12.360
encourage you to buy artwork.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.641
Don't buy something that people
are selling as decoration.

00:12:16.641 --> 00:12:19.140
The difference between art and
decoration is paramount here.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.340
Here's a better piece for you.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.450
So this is a piece
by Jeff Peters.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:33.420
Still works in the room,
but what the heck is that

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.790
antelope doing in that
institutional-type hallway?

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:40.370
It still works
effectively in the room,

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.750
but now you have cause
for conversation.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.050
Like, what the hell
is going on there?

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.420
And why is that important?

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.010
Why did you spend money on that?

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.540
That might be a
conversation that

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.310
happens when your friends
come over to visit.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.810
I know that something certainly
that's come up in the gallery,

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.520
but the artist
here is the story.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.210
It's a beautiful
piece to look at,

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:03.080
but what's essentially
going on here

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.060
is this artist's whole
childhood playing out

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.620
in an individual piece.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.210
And if you took time to
understand it and invest

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.000
in the story, you
might actually find

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.340
that it relates in some ways to
your own personal life, which

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.490
is going to be quite a bit
different than pillows.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.800
But with this piece
in particular,

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.720
this artist grew up
in an environment that

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.840
was so confined
and regimented, so

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.050
filled with pristine
white and pristine this,

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:32.860
and even touching
these things would've

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.990
been off limits and against
the rules in this house,

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.597
so his ideas about beauty
are a little bit convoluted.

00:13:39.597 --> 00:13:41.180
So what he's doing
is he's showing you

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.510
things that are simply a
little bit out of place

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.259
but still glitzed up and
act like they belong.

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:47.800
They are almost
untouchable in a way.

00:13:53.042 --> 00:13:53.750
One more example.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.146
Instead.

00:14:02.146 --> 00:14:03.520
And so what we're
looking at here

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.939
is a piece by Daniel Ochoa.

00:14:04.939 --> 00:14:06.480
Now you're probably
not going to want

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.980
to have breakfast next to
this guy every morning,

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.376
but maybe you will, because
you've invested in the story

00:14:11.376 --> 00:14:13.260
and you understand
it a little bit.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:18.276
And so it comes down to what
you can be comfortable with.

00:14:18.276 --> 00:14:20.150
And if you understand
and invest in the story

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.858
behind a piece of art,
you might actually

00:14:21.858 --> 00:14:24.630
further understand its value.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.640
But it gives you something to
converse about over breakfast,

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.000
if for no other
reason than for that.

00:14:34.687 --> 00:14:36.020
Plus it still works in the room.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.320
It's nice.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:43.740
So I want to kind of break away
from the visual part of this

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.582
and touch a little bit on
the statistical part of it.

00:14:46.582 --> 00:14:48.540
And when it comes to
buying art, the difference

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:53.850
between decoration and art
is that your investment

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.110
into a piece of
artwork is something

00:14:56.110 --> 00:15:00.182
that's going to last as long as
you purchase it the right way.

00:15:00.182 --> 00:15:01.890
And when I say purchase
it the right way,

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.750
I mean don't buy something
because your friend told you

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.212
it was the next hot
artist and you run out

00:15:07.212 --> 00:15:08.920
and you spend thousands
of dollars on it,

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.250
hoping that it will
increase in value.

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.740
If you're buying
it as a commodity,

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.045
you're already short changing
yourself to some degree.

00:15:14.045 --> 00:15:16.420
If you buy it because you have
an affinity for something,

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.503
because you love it, it
speaks to you in some way,

00:15:18.503 --> 00:15:21.440
your investment in it
will always be safe.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.610
Now that's not to say
that you shouldn't buy art

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.901
as a commodity, that's
certainly something that you do.

00:15:25.901 --> 00:15:31.220
And to that point, this
chart illustrates the course

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.444
of art over the last 20 years
or so, and as you look at it,

00:15:35.444 --> 00:15:37.110
it's got a nice little
pitch at the end.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.942
Now there's certainly
an ebb and flow to it

00:15:38.942 --> 00:15:40.900
that can be related to
certain things happening

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.300
in the economy, but what's
true about art sales

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.230
over the course of
history is there's never

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.320
been a significant dip.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.040
It's been a consistent
rise, and sometimes they

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:49.874
have meteoric rises.

00:15:49.874 --> 00:15:51.914
And what's interesting
about this, in particular,

00:15:51.914 --> 00:15:54.210
is some of these meteoric
rises are happening at a time

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.640
where everything else
is absolutely tanking.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.410
And so, if you take a look at
individual artists-- this one

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.240
I always thought
was pretty pivotal.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.650
Basquiat is right
up there with Warhol

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:11.700
in auction sales over
the past 20 years

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.210
and, more specifically,
in past ten.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.680
So what's interesting here
is that Basquiat is kicking

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.440
the S&amp;Ps ass.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.650
And so if you want to make
a purchase as a commodity,

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.390
not necessarily for
the love of the work,

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.210
that's a pretty safe bet if
you educate yourself about what

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.540
it is that you're purchasing.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.180
And so that is a really, really
important part of buying art.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.740
Buy it aesthetically
but understand

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.650
what it is that you're buying.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:35.300
You do it with everything
else in your life.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.760
We go and we look
at something, we

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.707
have an affinity for it and then
research the hell out of it.

00:16:41.707 --> 00:16:43.290
And in researching
the hell out of it,

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:44.810
we understand more
about it and then

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.351
we can make a more
informed purchase.

00:16:46.351 --> 00:16:48.270
And maybe not more
informed so much as

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.080
that we're more
comfortable with it,

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.580
because we understand
more about it.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.705
And that's kind what it is.

00:16:52.705 --> 00:16:55.557
You have to create a
comfort about the purchase

00:16:55.557 --> 00:16:56.640
that you're going to make.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.430
But art, as a rule, over the
long run is a fairly safe bet.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.740
This is a fun one, I thought.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.130
You guys also kicked the S&amp;Ps
ass during the same amount

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:09.630
of time.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.069
All right.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.650
So I did that.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.504
That's the self promoting
I'm going to do today.

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:20.420
I wanted to talk a little
bit about this thing

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.050
that I've been holding
my hand the whole time.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:23.508
This was a really
interesting piece

00:17:23.508 --> 00:17:26.380
that came out in an
underground paper in Seattle,

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.527
and what they essentially
did, is they took artists

00:17:28.527 --> 00:17:30.860
and they pitted them against
people in the tech industry

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.880
to have a conversation to
see where the gap was and see

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.430
if we could cross that gap.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.960
And in reading it,
I didn't necessarily

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.330
see what I wanted
to see out of it,

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:45.707
which was some kind of
bridge between the two sides.

00:17:45.707 --> 00:17:47.290
There was a lot of
name calling in it,

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.530
but some things stood
out to me specifically,

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.830
and this one is one of the ones
that stood out specifically

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:53.380
to me.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:57.700
So this is quoting, "and so
there's this sort of divide.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.190
It's the sort of
lunch tablism of life,

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.610
like there are nerdy
kids over there,

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.770
and here's the art
fag kids over here,

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.500
and we are never
going to get along."

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.980
That came from an artist
speaking specifically

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:14.050
about the tech industry, and
so it went back and forth.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:17.240
Here's another one.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.750
"Money feeds art in a way, so
we're hearing all about money,

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:22.390
but it's new money
from people who,

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:24.850
instead of renting
their $4,000 apartment

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.000
and then buying a
$10 piece of art,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.250
going to the ballet,
gallery openings,

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.120
and being a sophisticated,
cosmopolitan part of the city's

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.140
culture, they're interested
in seeing how many Star Wars

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.320
toys can I buy.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.040
It's like, oh my god, you should
actually own a work of art.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.440
It makes you a whole person.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.180
It makes you real, and not
just the facade of money."

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:50.970
I strongly disagree with that,
because we live a block away

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:57.020
from a massive tech base,
and we see people all day

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.670
long walking by
our gallery, and I

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:04.670
think that there is a reason
to not blame but to invite,

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.630
and so our job as
gallery owners is

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.960
to find a way to bridge the
gap and not just call names.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.870
So I guess if there
was a crossover that

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.820
was going to be had, it's based
on awareness and understanding.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.990
Simply speaking to an
audience and telling them

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.695
what they should see is
not really the pointed way

00:19:24.695 --> 00:19:26.820
that we want to communicate
with the tech industry,

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:31.600
but you have to understand that
everyone is after you guys.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.470
They want you as an
audience, and it's not just

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.830
where we're from in Bellevue
and Seattle, it's everyone

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.020
that we talk to that's
in this business,

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.440
all has a concern with crossing
over to the tech industry

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.170
and finding out a way to
embrace that community

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:51.190
and try to usher them
in as art collectors.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:56.850
Now, so it becomes a
question of interests.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:00.910
Like how do I create
an interest as a dealer

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.590
to those in that industry?

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:03.910
And we don't know.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.780
What we're trying
to do, simply, is

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:10.440
to show art that speaks to
us, that we hope that everyone

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.390
else will have an
interest and educate them

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.570
and giving any
opportunity that we

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:19.690
can get to kind of broaden their
horizon a little bit about what

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.760
might be something that
they could live with.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.530
And art is just one of them.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:31.652
I wrote an editorial
piece for an online blog,

00:20:31.652 --> 00:20:33.360
and I want to read
that to you real quick

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.650
just to kind of sumize
everything that's going on

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.970
and to illustrate one
particular story about a couple

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.260
that some of you may
be familiar with.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.680
The Vogel's have always been a
source of inspiration for me.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.400
That's a couple from New York.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.217
They were collectors back in
the '50s and '60s, and the story

00:20:49.217 --> 00:20:51.050
that they had always
resonated, because they

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:52.100
bought within their means.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.933
They bought things that
they were interested

00:20:53.933 --> 00:20:56.500
in and in doing so amassed
a collection of artwork that

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.840
was worth millions and
millions of dollars.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.900
But what's most interesting
about them is they

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.782
were just normal people.

00:21:03.782 --> 00:21:05.490
They didn't spend
outside of their means.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.550
They didn't come
from a ton of money.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.370
So I'm going to read some of
that to you real quick just

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:15.920
because I'm not smart
enough to memorize it all.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.090
"Herbert and Dorothy Vogel were
the very best art collectors,

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:21.469
in my opinion.

00:21:21.469 --> 00:21:23.260
They purchased only
what they could afford.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.480
They did not get
caught up in hype.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.729
They did not subscribe to
trend, and they consistently

00:21:26.729 --> 00:21:30.400
educated themselves about art by
attending openings and visiting

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.230
artist studios.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.550
Herbert worked at
the post office

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.579
and Dorothy worked
as a librarian.

00:21:35.579 --> 00:21:37.620
They amassed a collection
of art worth millions."

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.830
What's important here is they
went to art where art was,

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.632
and it allowed them to
kind of open their eyes

00:21:43.632 --> 00:21:45.840
and see what was going on
out there in the art world,

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.881
and they became fascinated
with these people that

00:21:47.881 --> 00:21:50.200
were creating, and they
realized that these people were

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.800
really important to
city they lived in.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.460
It was kind of the lifeblood
of the city they lived in.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.410
"Collecting art is
romantic, sophisticated,

00:21:58.410 --> 00:21:59.550
and intelligent purchase.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.300
It is a time-honored
interest that

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.070
speaks largely to one's
capacity for understanding.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.700
Understanding in this
regard is paramount.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.150
Understanding is a
byproduct of education,

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.220
and education about money is the
most powerful tool in acquiring

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.920
important pieces of art."

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.292
Thinking back to what I said
about understanding what

00:22:17.292 --> 00:22:19.500
it is that you're looking
at or considering purchase,

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.870
no different than
a vehicle, it's

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.639
no different than a
sofa in that regard.

00:22:24.639 --> 00:22:26.180
You have to understand
more about it.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.180
What we're trying to get you to
do is look at it a little bit

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:28.679
differently.

00:22:28.679 --> 00:22:30.690
Understand the stories,
understand the person

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.947
creating those things.

00:22:32.947 --> 00:22:34.530
"New collectors who
educate themselves

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:35.988
about a potential
piece of art will

00:22:35.988 --> 00:22:37.620
avoid bully dealers
who selfishly

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.540
pawn opinion for fact.

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.630
Opinion can be a
useful tool as long

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.310
as one is knowledgeable
about the person offering

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:45.464
said opinion.

00:22:45.464 --> 00:22:47.380
Dealers and galleries
should be vetted as much

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.380
as the art they sell.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.940
Familiarizing yourself
with galleries and dealers,

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.680
understanding their
qualifications

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.330
and how long they
have been in business

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.871
will broaden your understanding,
trust and selection of art."

00:22:56.871 --> 00:22:57.985
This is really big.

00:22:57.985 --> 00:22:59.860
You have to go where
the art is, but you also

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.820
have to vet the person
selling you the art as much

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.440
as you have to vet
the art itself.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.180
If you want to make
sure that you're

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.480
buying an authentic
piece from someone,

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.850
it comes from trust
built with the dealer.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.200
"Simply acquiring art was
the most important things

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.080
the Vogel's did, and
for new collectors

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.800
this is the first step.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.460
Part of this step is to ensure
you are acquiring art and not

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.140
decoration.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.950
As all women are human,
not all humans are women.

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:26.560
Such is the case with art.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.320
That Toulouse Lautrec print
you have of the Moulin Rouge

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.800
dancers is not art unless
you recently robbed a museum.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.170
It's decoration.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.080
To acquire art, you
need to go where art is.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.030
Galleries, art
fairs, work studios.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.440
Art has paint on it.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.700
Art is made of metal, wood,
canvas, and found objects.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.959
Art is made by hand,
and it has a pulse.

00:23:46.959 --> 00:23:48.500
And the initial
visit to an art venue

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.374
should include many
things, foremost of these

00:23:50.374 --> 00:23:51.819
is observation.

00:23:51.819 --> 00:23:52.860
What manner of art is it?

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.360
Don't know?

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:53.870
Ask.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:54.430
Who is the artist?

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.930
Don't know?

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.070
Ask.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.909
Medium.

00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:58.700
Do you have others?

00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.370
Got questions?

00:23:59.370 --> 00:23:59.990
Just ask.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.670
You're going to run into a vast
array of gallery personalities,

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:08.970
while many of the snotty
Hollywood versions with very,

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.550
very important work
to do, many more are

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.550
very happy to have you
come and don't expect

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.940
you to walk away with art.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:18.274
They simply want to have a
discussion with you about it.

00:24:18.274 --> 00:24:20.190
All of them, however,
should be able to answer

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.800
any of the aforementioned
questions without blinking.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.040
The most important thing
is to open a dialogue.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.680
Don't be intimidated
by a gallery.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.620
Don't be afraid to
ask any questions.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:32.040
Regardless of how
uneducated it may seem,

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.850
it is how you become educated.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.100
If you find a piece you like
that you keep coming back

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.310
to, then you have to
asked questions about it

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.890
and are satisfied
with the answer

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.740
and it is within your
means, acquire that piece."

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.660
I talk about the sting
of art, and the sting

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.837
of art that I'm referring to is
when you walk into a gallery,

00:24:48.837 --> 00:24:50.420
or you see something
that someone did,

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.400
a sculpture somewhere,
and you love it.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.210
And you go home and
you think about it,

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.800
you can't stop thinking about
it, and this goes on for weeks,

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.770
and then you go back
to buy and it's gone.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.810
That sting that you feel
is really important,

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:04.870
and I'll tell you why.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.590
Because it gives you a
compass, a true north.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.400
So when you come across
a piece of art again,

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.820
and you feel that way,
you'll know that feeling

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.810
and you won't wait.

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.260
You'll grab that one.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:21.052
Acclimating yourself, not just
being excited in the moment,

00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:22.760
is really important,
but that takes time,

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.550
and it takes going to those
places that I mentioned.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:30.030
"When you have acquired your
first piece of work, stop.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.810
Many first timers-- and we
run into this all the time--

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.270
want to run out
and buy something

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:36.470
for every damn wall
in their house.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.260
That's not collecting,
that's buying.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.290
Collectors acquire work
and, despite the fact

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:44.020
that money is changing hands
and technically a purchase

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:48.410
is being made, please remember
that you buy a toaster

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.712
and you acquire a piece of art.

00:25:50.712 --> 00:25:52.420
It's not just a fancy
word change either.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.680
It is representational
of a slow process

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.610
in which you get acclimated
to your tastes in art.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:01.480
Allowing time in between
acquisition sheds light

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.820
on the great effect art has
on your living environment

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:04.860
and your mood.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.390
New collectors
should use this time

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:08.450
to gauge their comfort
with art and gain

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.820
an understanding
of the work's value

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.940
after the money
has changed hands.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.884
Allowing time to pass will
guide you in future acquisitions

00:26:15.884 --> 00:26:17.800
and save you from buying
pieces you will never

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.310
have a relationship with.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:21.210
Learn about artists.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:23.280
You have longed for
a way to reconcile

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.190
despair, hope,
hatred, love, regret,

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.370
and beauty, and their work
can be your deliverance.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.130
Collect art.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.330
It is how history was recorded.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:36.580
It will make you look smarter.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.940
It is sexier than flat
screen television.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.880
Make an effort to
understand your new works,

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.370
your new artwork's purpose.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:45.850
Make it a priority.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:51.210
It may take time, and it may
never fully reveal itself,

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.140
but it is the pursuit that
will keep you interested in it.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.800
Look at your
collection as it grows.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.520
Appreciate it, as it
says more about you

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.420
than you can about
yourself, and it does so

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.060
with a better voice."

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.970
These artists are here
pouring themselves out

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:06.110
onto these canvases.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.810
The more you know
about these artists

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:10.930
and the reason they're
painting what they're painting

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.404
will help you equate value.

00:27:13.404 --> 00:27:15.320
So when you walk into a
gallery and you think,

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.380
god $100,000 for that piece.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.610
That's insane.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:22.750
Maybe, but you'll never
know until you find out.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.150
What is this artist's history?

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.260
Why is this going on?

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.140
Why am I looking at this, and
why am I looking at it here?

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.920
Do I want this in my own life?

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.342
Is it worth that much to me?

00:27:31.342 --> 00:27:32.800
Only you will know
that, but you're

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.330
going to know what if you get
out there and ask questions.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:40.500
It's a pivotal part of our life,
and understanding the story

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.580
sometimes can be a great
way to equate value,

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.136
but it also can be entertaining.

00:27:45.136 --> 00:27:47.010
You might find out
something you didn't know.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:52.630
And this is for Claire that
works for us at the gallery.

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:56.340
Caravaggio was a
great master painter.

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.010
Brilliant.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.010
But what many people don't
know about Caravaggio

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:03.610
is Caravaggio was quite
excellent at murder as well.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.880
But when you figure
these things out,

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.990
it gives you a story to
tell when people come over

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.600
to your house.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.140
Now if you're looking at a
Caravaggio in your own home,

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.720
well done.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.470
But in truth, it could be
a little bit more basic

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:20.550
than that.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:23.290
For instance, just understanding
the technical aspect

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:25.260
of how something was
created so that when

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.970
people come over and go,
you spent what on what?

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.780
You can go, wait
a minute, here's

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.510
what really happened
with this piece.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.480
And you will seem way
sexier, way more educated,

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.430
because you know exactly
how that piece was done.

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:39.300
And I'm going to use
my-- this is horrible--

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.550
but I'm going to use my
own work as an example,

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:43.841
because you could look at
this piece, which you've been

00:28:43.841 --> 00:28:48.030
looking at for a while now,
and go, oh, well that's pretty,

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.310
but it's how it was completed
that's important to me.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.760
I actually think that landscape
in my work is secondary.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.430
What's more important to
me in my own personal work

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:58.660
is the evolution of the
color, how it was built,

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.868
and I'll give you an example
of that, because this is

00:29:00.868 --> 00:29:02.280
how a painting starts for me.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.550
Red.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:04.370
Simple layout.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.720
Nothing fancy.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.890
Little blue, little yellow.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:15.690
More blue, more yellow,
more red, never green, and I

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.260
never used green once
in this whole painting.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.060
It was built color,
layered transparently one

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.320
over the next.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.090
No different than how old
televisions used to work.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:27.800
It's an old, old way of
painting called glazing.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.750
It's nothing fancy.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:29.670
It's nothing new.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:31.900
I simply adopted it
to a technique that

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.760
felt really good to
me, and it allowed

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.450
me to create a green that was
much better than any green I

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.940
could ever get out of a tube.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.170
Why is that important?

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:43.040
Because I don't really care
about much more in life

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.420
than the act of painting.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.780
I want to paint, because
it feels good to me.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.300
And I have found
a way that makes

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.650
me paint the same
painting over itself

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:58.840
10, 15, 20 times just
with different color

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.116
and different opacities.

00:30:02.116 --> 00:30:04.240
The technical aspect of
how it's done is important,

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.600
but not all work looks
like a landscape.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:13.775
Some work that we start to
get excited about is neon.

00:30:13.775 --> 00:30:15.150
But if you talk
to the artist, he

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:17.090
will give you a
complete understanding

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.890
of how this relates
to the human psyche

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:22.390
and interaction with
technology in our life,

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:24.264
and its pivotal to
hear him talk about it.

00:30:24.264 --> 00:30:26.430
Just being around him and
hearing and talk about it,

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:30.922
it's infectious, and that's why
you need to go where art is.

00:30:30.922 --> 00:30:31.880
Here's another example.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.140
This is a Chris
Dufala piece, and this

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.430
is a great narrative on what's
going on in the world today.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.580
So this piece is,
look, like they're

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.770
made out of wood and
steel, but they're all

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:43.880
made out of ceramic.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.790
It's all earthware.

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:48.270
And it's a narrative on the
fact that these things are all

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.061
sitting around in a
waiting room somewhere,

00:30:50.061 --> 00:30:51.860
because no one
uses them anymore.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:52.360
Right?

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.109
They're desperate.

00:30:53.109 --> 00:30:54.370
They need some help.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.680
JD Hansen.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.580
Sculptor artist.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.680
If you got to know
her, she might tell you

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.043
that she's also a
trained fighter pilot.

00:31:04.043 --> 00:31:05.950
She's never been
in the military.

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:06.947
That's her hobby.

00:31:06.947 --> 00:31:09.530
I always found that fascinating,
because it's a very long road

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:12.009
to be able to do that.

00:31:12.009 --> 00:31:14.550
But what's more important about
this particular piece of work

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:15.966
and the thing that
I like the most

00:31:15.966 --> 00:31:18.630
and what I learned as I
came to understand it more,

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.860
was this piece called
Grief and the Gardener

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:23.100
was about one woman's
reconciliation

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.770
of the death of her
husband and how she

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.616
turned to gardening as therapy.

00:31:27.616 --> 00:31:30.340
And so her connection
to the earth

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:35.370
was pretty literal
in this sense,

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:38.020
and if you read the
story and you know JD,

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.771
she tells it with
such great passion

00:31:39.771 --> 00:31:41.770
that it creates a connection
with this work that

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:42.353
is undeniable.

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:49.820
An installation
piece in Seattle.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.420
"Just Be Your Selfie."

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.780
You could take this a
million different ways,

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:56.420
but this thing blew up
the internet in our area

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.270
for a really long time.

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:03.500
And so it's a narrative
on how you live your life.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:04.340
Just be your selfie.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:08.110
Do you want to just
be your selfie?

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.470
Is that who you are or
are you someone else?

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:11.816
It questions who you are.

00:32:11.816 --> 00:32:14.190
What's the difference between
your real life and the life

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.082
you live online?

00:32:16.082 --> 00:32:17.540
Does there need to
be a difference?

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.540
Are you selling yourself as
something that you're not?

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.623
Are you actually representing
yourself as you are?

00:32:24.224 --> 00:32:26.390
People were taking pictures
in front of this all day

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:27.840
long, as you might imagine.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.340
But that was hardly
the point of it.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.820
So one of the pieces that
I really, really love

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.190
is from an called-- his
name is Ben Britton,

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:39.540
and Ben is a frenetic thinker.

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:42.430
He talks very fast, he's
really exciting to talk to,

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:43.770
he's very energetic.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:45.730
And one of the
things that I always

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.980
talk about when I talk
about Ben Britton's work

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:52.310
is that he has a way of
putting his brain right out

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:54.870
onto a piece of
canvas, and he does it

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.370
in such a brilliant way.

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.960
And so for a minute before
I show you this slide,

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.800
I want you to think
about a wedding.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.290
What's that look like?

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:08.810
Black and white, flowers,
people, movement, happiness,

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:13.120
joy, tears are flowing, but it's
an exciting time in your life.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.690
It's one of the
most exciting times

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:16.770
two people that come
together can have,

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:21.560
and it's this just infusion
of joy and color and movement

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.350
and shapes and Ben was
just great at putting it

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:26.875
into a painting.

00:33:26.875 --> 00:33:29.000
This painting is called
"This is Your Wedding Day."

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.220
It's one of my
favorite pieces of art

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.580
from this particular artist,
and when I saw the title

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.750
I needed nothing else.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.870
Yes that's exactly
how I felt. There's

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:40.900
excitement and shape
and color and movement.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.690
It just goes on and on and on.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.650
And it's like this
explosion, and the whole day

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:47.099
you're just thinking, wow,
this is like my wedding day,

00:33:47.099 --> 00:33:49.140
and you wake up the next
morning and you go, man,

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.540
I don't remember
anything from that day.

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.330
Well, you don't need to.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.690
It's supposed to be
remembered in this way,

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.992
and Ben knows that, and so
he put it down on canvas.

00:33:58.992 --> 00:34:00.450
And so the home
where this resides,

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:02.650
it's right in this
entryway, so they walk in

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:05.320
and every day they'll remember
this excitement that they felt,

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.861
and that's what art
should feel like.

00:34:06.861 --> 00:34:09.145
That sting?

00:34:09.145 --> 00:34:10.520
This is what it
should feel like.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:16.679
So I'm here talking to you
today simply for one reason,

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:19.980
and I've covered a lot of
things I wanted to cover,

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:23.345
but the basic reason I
want to talk to you--

00:34:23.345 --> 00:34:24.969
and I have to thank
you for inviting me

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:30.440
here-- is so that your home
doesn't look like this.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.480
I want it to look like this.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.059
Thank you.

00:34:33.059 --> 00:34:35.835
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:40.820
Any questions from the audience?

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.060
AUDIENCE: You made a number
of statements about prints,

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:50.570
but I hope you
draw a distinction

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:53.010
between the kind of
mass produced prints you

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:57.925
were talking about and showing
and limited edition serigraphs.

00:34:57.925 --> 00:35:00.050
ERIK HALL: Absolutely, and
thanks for the question.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.250
There is a definite distinction
and, in fact, the art market

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:06.780
now is-- the last
stat I saw on it

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.290
was that 3% of the
art market is actually

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:11.220
being driven by
the print business,

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.870
and that print business is
actually very limited edition

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:15.940
lithographs.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.100
There's a fancy word
out there called giclee,

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.580
and that's just a made up
word, and people, galleries

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.340
will toss that word
out there it's just

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:25.720
a fancy word that was made
up in the '70s for four color

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.590
printing.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:29.690
That's the kind of stuff that
I want people to kind of like

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.370
understand and know that there's
really not a whole lot of value

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:33.070
in that.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:36.360
Lithograph runs signed by
an authorized print house,

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.030
by an artist, have a
great deal of value.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.820
They trade on the open market.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.600
And, like I said,
they drive about 3%

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.680
of the art market,
the auction market,

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.430
so if you do any
kind of research,

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:49.030
you will see that there's
Warhol's and there are still

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:52.880
Picasso's trading out there that
were from the authorized houses

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.410
that were signed, numbered, and
they have the stamp and seal

00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:59.147
of the authorized print house.

00:35:59.147 --> 00:36:00.730
So the more you
understand about that,

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:03.021
the more that distinction
actually becomes quite clear.

00:36:03.021 --> 00:36:04.970
Yes, thank you, there
is a definite difference

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:06.410
between the two.

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:10.700
AUDIENCE: But there
are artists who

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:17.390
work in giclee as a medium and
have limited edition, signed

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.959
runs.

00:36:17.959 --> 00:36:18.750
ERIK HALL: They do.

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:19.490
That's true.

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:19.630
AUDIENCE: Giclees.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:20.255
CLIFF: They do.

00:36:20.255 --> 00:36:21.110
That's true.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.110
Let me be clear that the
artist doesn't actually

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.009
work in giclee.

00:36:24.009 --> 00:36:24.800
That's not a thing.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.939
That's four-color printing.

00:36:27.939 --> 00:36:30.480
So what I'm referring to is the
difference between a painting

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.400
that may be-- and
what I'm encouraging,

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:37.400
really, is that if say a giclee
print is 500 bucks that you

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.250
take that 500 bucks,
instead of buying

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:43.580
that that mass-produced print,
that you go to visit, say,

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.167
an artist's studio
and find something

00:36:45.167 --> 00:36:46.250
that hits you really well.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.184
AUDIENCE: Not all giclees
are mass produced.

00:36:55.110 --> 00:37:00.130
I understand that it's
a technological process,

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:03.250
but there are artists
who I consider

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:07.570
fine artists who work
in a digital medium,

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:15.960
and they physical output of
it is a limited edition giclee

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.442
that might only be 100 copies.

00:37:18.442 --> 00:37:19.150
ERIK HALL: Right.

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:20.532
AUDIENCE: And they
sign each one.

00:37:20.532 --> 00:37:21.240
ERIK HALL: Right.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.915
AUDIENCE: So just
the fact that it's

00:37:22.915 --> 00:37:25.810
a giclee as opposed to
a lithograph, I think,

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:28.574
is not important.

00:37:28.574 --> 00:37:29.990
ERIK HALL: Right
and, to be clear,

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:31.823
I'm not saying that
giclees are a bad thing.

00:37:31.823 --> 00:37:34.890
I've actually reproduced my
own work for a friend of mine

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:36.374
on a certain occasion.

00:37:36.374 --> 00:37:38.290
They couldn't afford an
original piece of art.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:40.890
I desperately wanted them
to have a piece of my work,

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:43.190
because they were in a
crisis in their own life,

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:46.230
and I thought that that would
be uplifting thing for them.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.634
And so I did have one done.

00:37:47.634 --> 00:37:48.550
They called it giclee.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:51.040
It's just four-color printing.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.124
Lithographs are done in much
larger runs than giclees even.

00:37:54.124 --> 00:37:55.540
Giclees you can
do in anything you

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.830
want, because of the
type of print that it is.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.510
Having said that, I'm not
really specifically talking

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:05.170
about the type, whether it's a
lithograph, serigraph, giclee.

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:08.390
Moreover I'm talking about the
volume that it's produced in

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:10.350
and whether that
volume was produced

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.800
by an authorized house.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.290
So the distinction there
just lies in the rights.

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:18.920
Who has the right to do it
and how much were allotted,

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.900
and were those done well.

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.880
A reputable printing house is
going to do really great job.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.330
The physical manifestation
of digital art

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:28.850
is something that we're going
to contend with more and more,

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:31.040
and I think that there's
a great market for it

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.720
as long as it's
done in limited runs

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.810
so that the product
itself isn't diluted.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:37.360
That's all I'm saying.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:37.974
Thank you.

00:38:37.974 --> 00:38:40.390
CLIFF: And I think that raises
an interesting question too

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:42.130
in the photography space.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.130
You have the large
prints, you'll

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:46.490
change it to black and white
or do a certain crop of it

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:50.040
and then sell it as
a completely new run.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.950
ERIK HALL: So what artists
do with the reproduction

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:56.420
of their own work, I think, is
part of the artistic process,

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:59.290
and I would never hold
that against anyone.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.050
All I'm saying is that I
would encourage someone,

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:05.220
that if they wanted to buy
an original piece of artwork

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:08.030
to educate themselves and
make sure that this is truly

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.770
at original piece of artwork.

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:12.820
If it's a physical manifestation
of a digital print, then

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.770
that's the original
form that was

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:19.600
presented to the public and,
as such, that's original work.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.490
But when you go to a place
like Bed, Bath and Beyond

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:25.020
or some other place,
it becomes less art,

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.750
it becomes decoration,
and I'm simply

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:29.110
just trying to get people
to avoid decoration

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:30.144
in favor of art.

00:39:30.144 --> 00:39:32.060
AUDIENCE: I don't really
know how to ask this.

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:35.610
I'm sort of stuck on this
idea of art versus decoration.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:42.130
Like, why does it make sense
to put art in people's homes?

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.600
Like that is decoration.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:49.900
It's kind of a weird-- to me,
it's kind of a weird way for us

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.910
as a society to be
valuing art as to have it

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:56.100
on the wall in your house
or something, like just you,

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:56.890
one person?

00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:00.910
I don't know-- I feel
like that actually

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:03.640
is a good place for
decoration, because it's just

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.910
like furnishing your room.

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:08.110
ERIK HALL: I think I touched
on it-- first of all,

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:10.600
thank you for the question.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.520
As I understand
it, you're asking

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.530
why isn't a home a good
place for decoration

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:21.160
and the difference between art
and decoration in that regard?

00:40:24.275 --> 00:40:26.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
maybe the other way.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.790
Like why is a home a
good place for art?

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:31.332
ERIK HALL: I think the home
is the best place for art.

00:40:31.332 --> 00:40:32.280
AUDIENCE: Why?

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.240
ERIK HALL: For me
specifically, and that's

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.490
the only way I can talk about
it, to go with what I know

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:41.410
about it, and every piece that's
in our home has meaning to us,

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:44.780
and it surpasses the
monetary value of the piece.

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:47.407
It has something
poignant about it

00:40:47.407 --> 00:40:48.990
that speaks to
something that happened

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:53.160
in our life or a relationship
we had with an artist.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.400
Just recently we
purchased a piece

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.810
from an artist that
was really, really

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:01.370
special to us, Cheryl Engstrom.

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.943
A sculpture piece titled
"The Paris Wheel."

00:41:03.943 --> 00:41:06.100
It's a found object wheel.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.920
It's got letter openers
that were made out

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.039
of bronze as the people
riding the wheel,

00:41:13.039 --> 00:41:14.080
and it's a pivotal piece.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.840
And it became even
more pivotal to us,

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.100
because Cheryl passed
away four days ago,

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:25.420
and so the home is a good
place for decoration, sure,

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:30.430
but the art that you place in
there to decorate your home,

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:35.160
it needs, in my opinion,
to speak to you at a higher

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:39.030
level than something that you
said, oh, that looks nice,

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:40.780
as you were passing
the decorative pillows

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:41.737
section of the store.

00:41:41.737 --> 00:41:44.320
Like something that has meaning
to you, that's a deep meaning,

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.736
and I'm not saying
that that needs

00:41:45.736 --> 00:41:48.920
to be something that came
from a gallery or a museum.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.050
That can simply be something
that you saw after you just

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:54.350
had a heart-wrenching
moment that was laying

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:56.404
by the side a street, a stick.

00:41:56.404 --> 00:41:58.445
Put it up in your house,
decorate it in some way,

00:41:58.445 --> 00:42:00.944
and when you look at it, let
it remind you of something that

00:42:00.944 --> 00:42:02.230
was important to you.

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:03.530
That's all I'm saying.

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:07.950
Just please try not
to equate those things

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:10.231
that you see in a store
next to decorative pillows

00:42:10.231 --> 00:42:12.730
or glasses as something that's
going to be meaningful to you

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:13.396
in the long run.

00:42:13.396 --> 00:42:14.710
That's decoration.

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:16.920
That stick, in my
opinion, because it

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:22.400
has a value that's bigger
than the cost, is now art.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.928
Does that make sense?

00:42:23.928 --> 00:42:26.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:30.000
CLIFF: And also it
is a question, should

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.290
the art be publicly on display?

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:37.260
Are you preventing
people from seeing it

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.370
by it being in your
house, just taking away--

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:43.140
many great works of art
are in private collections,

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.600
much to the consternation of
the people that go to museums.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.340
ERIK HALL: Right.

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.796
That's a question that comes
up a lot in our industry,

00:42:49.796 --> 00:42:52.340
and there's a lot of dialogue
going back and forth on it.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.600
I am a subscriber,
and I firmly believe,

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.230
like many in our industry
do, that artwork is borrowed.

00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:59.430
You don't own it.

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:01.320
You rent it almost.

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.490
You pay for it, you have
it, but you have a lifespan

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:07.170
that pales in comparison
to a piece of art,

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:10.870
and that's why art winds up in
museums or in estates that's

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:13.980
passed on through families
and eventually winds up,

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:17.780
hopefully, taken care
of in a public space.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:22.430
But the reality of it is
that some pieces do go unseen

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:25.170
for hundreds of
years, and that's

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:28.480
why when a piece
does surface again,

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.600
it becomes such a big
deal in our community.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.360
But I'm a firm
believer, and many of us

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.490
are, that artwork
is simply borrowed.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:39.080
I know all of our artwork
will be eventually given

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.500
to someone else, and I'm hoping
that we do well enough in life

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.450
that we're able to
set up a public space

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:48.950
for that collection to be
viewed, if for no other reason

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:52.720
so that I can feel that someone
else might feel what I felt

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.480
when we purchased that work.

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.940
AUDIENCE: Do you think there's
such a thing as bad art?

00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:59.610
ERIK HALL: Definitely.

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.867
AUDIENCE: What makes
something bad art?

00:44:01.867 --> 00:44:03.950
ERIK HALL: There's two
ways to answer that for me.

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:05.790
One of them is the
technical aspect.

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:07.445
I'm a painter myself,
so I look at art,

00:44:07.445 --> 00:44:09.060
and I'm very
discerning about it.

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:11.760
I think it's a great question,
because understanding

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.060
good from bad might
be the very thing that

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.467
saves your investment if
you're buying as a commodity.

00:44:17.467 --> 00:44:19.550
So that's why I say don't
ever buy as a commodity,

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:20.520
because you're safe.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.000
Even if it's a bad piece of
art, you like it, you love it,

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.520
and therefore its
investment is safe.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.310
Having said that,
technically speaking--

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:30.980
and I'm still learning to
look at, say, abstract art,

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.920
for instance-- but I
can recognize things

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.050
very specifically now
about abstract art that

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:38.164
lets me know that
this is a new painter.

00:44:38.164 --> 00:44:39.580
And I'm not going
to say it's bad.

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.954
I'm going to say it's new,
someone that needs to progress

00:44:41.954 --> 00:44:43.340
a little bit in their career.

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.600
And part of the
gallery's role is

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.130
to be a really great
filter for the public

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:51.430
so that that trust can
be developed over time,

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:53.140
where you know that
we've already vetted

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.500
a lot of this art for you.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:57.249
You vetted us over time,
we vet the art constantly,

00:44:57.249 --> 00:44:58.790
and that way when
you come in and you

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:01.920
have that visceral
response to something, then

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.180
you know that it's safe.

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:09.260
You could buy this, it's
been vetted through us.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:12.510
The world doesn't agree on this,
but we do, and if you trust us,

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:14.154
that kind of helps
it out a little bit.

00:45:14.154 --> 00:45:16.570
But, technically speaking,
like with an abstract painting,

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:17.820
there'll be muddy parts in it.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.590
And by muddy I mean where things
happened while the paint was

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:22.590
wet, and it turned this
kind of brown color,

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:26.210
and the composition
was kind of poor.

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:31.410
I'm a big believer in the
rule of odds, paintings being

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:34.610
dissected into thirds as
a way to present them,

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:37.050
in a way that gives you a
center line when you look at it.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:38.600
There's a bunch
of little things.

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.260
Sometimes, for me, it's just
the technical aspect of it.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.110
Painting can be
great, but I think

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:46.810
if there was a painterly mark
in it that just didn't sit well

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:49.110
with me, that to me is
going to make it bad,

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:52.086
but bad is kind of a tough word.

00:45:52.086 --> 00:45:53.710
And most of the time
I come across what

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:55.961
you're calling bad artwork,
it's just new artwork.

00:45:55.961 --> 00:45:57.960
Someone that needs to
develop a little bit more.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.680
We see it all the time, and
instead of telling people no,

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.470
we always try to
take that opportunity

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:04.080
to coach them up a little bit.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.740
Sometimes it's tough love,
but it helps them evolve.

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:10.265
So eventually that bad
artist becomes really good.

00:46:10.265 --> 00:46:11.640
CLIFF: I had
another question too

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.920
about the role of names
and supply and demand

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.410
in the expanding internet age.

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:19.040
You have dvnr.com.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.690
Anyone can throw
up a piece of art.

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:24.200
They get the likes on
it and the popularity,

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.850
but at the same time, if
you were to ask somebody

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:29.300
on the street, name a
really great sculptor

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.270
or visual artist
or glass artist,

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:34.390
there's only a few names,
and it's a crowded space.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:36.940
How is that evolving
as the years go on?

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:39.130
ERIK HALL: Well, first of
all, I love the internet

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:41.300
as a medium to promote artwork.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:45.227
I think it's a really,
really tough occupation

00:46:45.227 --> 00:46:46.810
to exploit for a
living, first of all,

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:49.390
for anyone that's in
it, on any level of it,

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:52.310
and it favors the few.

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:55.570
And so the people that rest
in the middle and the bottom

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:57.470
are always kind
of scraping along.

00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:59.520
I mentioned earlier that
sometimes just staying

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.290
in the business is
succeeding in the business,

00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:02.930
and that's kind of
what I mean by that.

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:11.180
So the question of,
say, places like DVNR.

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.710
Great landing spot
for people that can

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:15.214
get an opinion on something.

00:47:15.214 --> 00:47:16.880
But those places are
really no different

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:20.285
than any other platform
that we use to promote,

00:47:20.285 --> 00:47:21.160
even if it's not art.

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:23.582
Whether it's ourself or
our vacation or our kid,

00:47:23.582 --> 00:47:25.290
you know, these are
all places for people

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:27.180
to go and kind of
form an opinion.

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.380
The more places you see
it, the better, the broader

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.170
the audience gets.

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:33.770
And I think for that reason
those platforms are really

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:35.270
super successful,
and I personally

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:37.186
don't have a problem
with them even though I'm

00:47:37.186 --> 00:47:38.640
in the business of selling art.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.670
I think that a broad
awareness of art in general,

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:44.510
in all of its forms, is
really, really important

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:47.520
and becoming kind
of a lifeline--

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.236
a financial lifeline--
for many artists.

00:47:50.236 --> 00:47:51.860
You sell a few
paintings here and there

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:54.304
and keep that studio rent paid.

00:47:54.304 --> 00:47:55.720
CLIFF: And how do
you guide people

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.140
towards the lesser
known names, like things

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:01.561
that aren't household names as
they walk into your gallery?

00:48:01.561 --> 00:48:03.060
ERIK HALL: We get
personally excited

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:07.890
about a lot of different art,
but the gallery represents

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:13.200
30 artists, and we're
really excited about them,

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.890
and not all of them
are household names.

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:16.610
As a matter of fact, few of
them are household names,

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:17.443
but that's the goal.

00:48:17.443 --> 00:48:19.914
We're trying to make them
household names, because we

00:48:19.914 --> 00:48:22.080
feel strongly about them,
because we've vetted them,

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.580
because we've been
to their studios,

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:26.100
and we see how they paint,
because we understand

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.060
what it means to them.

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.117
It's not just painting
to make money.

00:48:29.117 --> 00:48:30.450
They're not producing a product.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:32.390
They're producing a
piece of themselves.

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:33.090
It's important.

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:35.400
They would do it even if
they didn't get paid for it.

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.816
When it comes to putting those
artists in front of people,

00:48:37.816 --> 00:48:39.990
I don't ever get more
passionate than that.

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:41.810
I really want people
to feel it, and it's

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:44.690
got to start with
me as the dealer.

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:47.610
But those artists still
need to be properly vetted.

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:49.749
We need to understand
what it is they're doing

00:48:49.749 --> 00:48:50.790
and why they're doing it.

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:53.440
It helps us equate value
to it and make sure

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.790
that we set the market right.

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:56.700
One of the things we
do with those artists

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.870
is we help them
kind of life plan.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.540
I am coming to you today.

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.430
I don't have a college degree.

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:05.970
I learned what I
learned the hard way.

00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:11.080
I found my way into art in
the most oddest of paths.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.250
I come from two military people.

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.550
My dad was in the Navy,
my mother in the Army.

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:19.070
Their ideas about art, although
not their fault, were limited.

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:24.587
And so I had to kind of
fight my way into it.

00:49:24.587 --> 00:49:26.670
There's a misperception
about us as gallery owners

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:29.086
that we're silver spoon kids,
and that couldn't be further

00:49:29.086 --> 00:49:29.840
from the truth.

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.750
Military family.

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:33.601
Both of Amy's parents
are educators,

00:49:33.601 --> 00:49:37.680
and you know there's not a lot
of money in those occupations,

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:42.900
but what we try to do
is go about what we

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:46.950
can using two basic principles.

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:51.421
Just hard work and--
I have a saying

00:49:51.421 --> 00:49:53.045
that I use and its
spend what you have.

00:49:53.045 --> 00:49:54.610
If you have time, spend time.

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:56.110
If you have money, spend money.

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:58.350
Well, in the beginning
we didn't have any money,

00:49:58.350 --> 00:49:59.150
so we spent time.

00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:00.274
We built all of our places.

00:50:00.274 --> 00:50:03.210
We have a little bit more
money now, so we invest in art.

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:05.310
We'll buy a piece
every once in awhile,

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:07.670
but-- and I'm deviating
a little bit--

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:10.400
but the question specifically
was getting those new artists

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.120
and getting them to
be household names.

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:15.110
And in truth I'm hoping that all
of our artists can be that way,

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:18.370
and I'm a big fan of putting
my stamp on them once I believe

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:20.030
in them, but takes me awhile.

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:22.836
And we've been wrong before,
if I'm being perfectly honest.

00:50:22.836 --> 00:50:24.210
We brought art in
that we thought

00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:26.460
was really, really
great only to find out

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:28.280
the it was missing parts.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.390
There was something
wrong with it ultimately,

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:34.670
whether it was a technical
aspect or a discrepancy

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:36.380
just with the
artist's intentions.

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:38.460
And we've let those
artists go very quickly.

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:40.350
I have no problem
with cutting that tie,

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:43.370
because I owe that
to our collectors.

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:45.540
Round about kind
of wordy answer,

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:47.387
but that's where we're
at with that one.

00:50:47.387 --> 00:50:49.470
CLIFF: Thank you very much
for speaking at Google.

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:49.770
Thanks.

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:50.520
ERIK HALL: Thanks.

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.620
