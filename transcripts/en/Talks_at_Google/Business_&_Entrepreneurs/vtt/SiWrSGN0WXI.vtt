MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Please
welcome to the stage the Death

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:10.220
Wish Coffee Company.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.750
This is the welcome crew.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.239
So there are a lot
of you up here,

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.060
and I know you guys all have
very unique and complicated

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.240
roles inside the company.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.126
So it'd probably be best-- why
don't you guys just go down

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:22.626
the line?

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:25.095
Introduce yourselves, and
let people know what you do.

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:26.470

I do inventory, and
I do purchasing.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.636

KANE GROGAN: I'm Kane Grogan,
and I run our customer service

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.260
department, some
of our event stuff,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.725
and sales, wholesale,
stuff like that.

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:54.850
JEFF AYERS: I'm Jeff Ayers.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.860
I run our brand new

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.140
and I write and edit and produce
our weekly podcast, "Fueled

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.447

00:01:02.447 --> 00:01:04.030
ALYSSA HARDY: My
name is Alyssa Hardy,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.195
and I'm the content
manager for Death Wish.

00:01:06.195 --> 00:01:07.570
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
So the reason

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.440
why we brought Death
Wish here today--

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.440
and I think it's relevant
to a lot of Googlers--

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.870
is there's this great sort of
just Homecoming King-esque type

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.110
story of starting out
in a basement and just

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.000
the explosion of
the past five years

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.740
that your company
has gone through.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.622
Why don't you recap the history
of the company for us, Mike?

00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:28.330
MIKE BROWN: Yeah.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.470
So back in 2008, I opened
Saratoga Coffee Traders,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.662
and it was a small coffee shop
in Saratoga Springs, New York.

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:37.120
And I learned pretty
quickly that I

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.760
didn't know how to run
a very good business,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.080
because I lost all my money.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.070
I lost it all.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.320
It all went out the door.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.951
But I was very--

00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:48.200
I didn't want to be a failure.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.339
So I kept trying and
trying and trying and doing

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:51.130
everything I could.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.310
I actually hired my best friend,
Scott, to come work with me

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.230
for basically free.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.010
And we just struggled,
and every single day, we

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.160
were in that shop trying to
figure out how to make it

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.780
in a brick and mortar business.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.240
And then one day, we
were like, why don't we

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.180
try to sell our coffee online?

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.400
And that's when we
developed Death Wish Coffee.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.404
And it was a recommendation
from our customers,

00:02:16.404 --> 00:02:18.570
because they would always
come in, and be like, hey,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.140
can I have-- give me
your strongest coffee.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.077
And we'd go and be
like, all right,

00:02:23.077 --> 00:02:24.410
do they want the darkest coffee?

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.367
Or do they want the
most caffeinated coffee?

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:28.950
And we were like,
well, wait a minute.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.910
Let's just sit down for a
minute and figure this out.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.220
Let's make a coffee
that's not only dark,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.130
not only tastes strong, but
also has the most caffeine.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.110
And that's what we did.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.810
We developed this
coffee by just blend--

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.062
well, through a lot
of experimentation.

00:02:45.062 --> 00:02:47.270
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well,
let's back up, because I do

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.640
think it's important
to qualify Death Wish

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.274
Coffee is known online as the
"world's strongest coffee."

00:02:52.274 --> 00:02:52.940
MIKE BROWN: Yes.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.070
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: How do
you qualify and quantify

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.382
what that means to be the
world's strongest coffee?

00:02:57.382 --> 00:02:59.840
MIKE BROWN: Yeah, you know, I
was never focused on caffeine

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.260
at the outset.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.280
It was always about
taste and flavor.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.360
"Caffeine Informer" and a
few other publications online

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.100
deemed us the "world's strongest
coffee" with caffeine levels.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.942
But I don't know.

00:03:13.942 --> 00:03:16.400
Personally, I don't like to
focus on that, just because you

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.070
can brew coffee stronger
by just adding more coffee

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.690
and using less water.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.000
So to me, it was all about
flavor, and good flavor.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.620
And everything
that-- when I drink

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.480
a cup of coffee in the
morning, I want to wake up.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.420
I want it to hit my taste buds,
and my eyes just shoot open.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.210
That's what I focused
on, that experience.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.557
But going back to your
question, like I said,

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:45.140
I don't like to focus
on the caffeine.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.265
But the caffeine does have
something to do with it.

00:03:47.265 --> 00:03:49.790
And because we use
robusta beans--

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.620
robusta beans have
between two and three

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.300
times the typical caffeine
content of arabica beans--

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.469
we do naturally get more
caffeine in our coffee.

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.760
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And that's
a big part of it, right?

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.560
Because one would
think that it would

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.400
be easy to make a new
"world's strongest coffee."

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.900
You just go make a coffee, and
then find a bunch of caffeine

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.399
and add it.

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:10.980
MIKE BROWN: Get
your caffeine, yeah.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.396
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: But that's
not really what's going on.

00:04:13.396 --> 00:04:15.620
You guys have brewed
this batch of beans

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.506
and roasted it in such a way to
just naturally get this effect

00:04:19.506 --> 00:04:20.630
without having to force it.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.320
MIKE BROWN: Right, yeah.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.010
It's organic.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.820
It's fair trade.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.230
There's no additives.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.240
We don't add any caffeine to it.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.820
It's just pure coffee.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.420
And we're purists,
believe it or not.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.069
And we love just straight
black drip coffee.

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:37.110
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Sure.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.350
So you find this niche, and
you say, OK, I can start.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.700
People are demanding a
certain thing from me,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.200
the strongest coffee,
high caffeine,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.120
but also really bold flavor.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.751
We got that.

00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:49.250
We want to get it
out to the people.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.980
So you left brick and mortar
behind, and just said,

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.300
we can do this via the web.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.080
MIKE BROWN: Yeah, pretty much.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.621
I still own my coffee
shop right now,

00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:58.280
and it's doing
better, thank god.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.710
But yes, we took a stab
at the online market.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.210
Because my customers
were like, hey,

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.870
why don't you try
selling this online?

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.369
And I was like, all
right, I'll try.

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:11.239
And I sold the bag
via Google Ads.

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:12.530
That's how I sold my first bag.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.180
And I got my first good review.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.130
And the guy was like--

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.230
I still remember his
name, Philip [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.353
out of Oakland.

00:05:22.353 --> 00:05:23.500
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Hi, Phil in Oakland.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.620
It's adorable.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.286
MIKE BROWN: Yeah, I
felt out of Oakland.

00:05:25.286 --> 00:05:27.820
He bought the first bag, and
he gave me a good review.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.480
He was like, this is some
strong coffee and some

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.550
of the best coffee I ever had.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.710
And from there,
that review led up

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.840
to another sale
and another sale.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.930
So I was selling basically
one pound a week,

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.800
and then two pounds a week,
and then three pounds a week.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.660
And all of a sudden, it just
snowballed into this company

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.596
where it was me at first, me and
one of my ex-baristas, Megan.

00:05:52.596 --> 00:05:54.970
And then one day, "Good Morning,
America" gave me a call.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.400
They were like, hey, we heard
about your coffee online.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.200
We want to open the
show with it tomorrow.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.660
Can we come up
and interview you?

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.054
And I was like, at that moment--

00:06:03.054 --> 00:06:05.220
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Let me
ponder that for a second.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.130
MIKE BROWN: Yeah, you'd think
I would say yes immediately.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.040
But I don't know.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.399
There was that--

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:11.940
I don't know.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.230
For me, it was a brave step,
because I knew I wanted it,

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.240
but I didn't know
if I was ready.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.520
But I was just like, yes.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.479
And they came that day.

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.020
I'm like, when are
you going to come?

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.550
I was thinking a week or two.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.800
They were like, we'll
be there in three hours.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.009
So "Good Morning America" showed
up at my story in three hours.

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:30.800
I closed the store.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.250
I cleaned it up.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.080
And they interviewed me.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.410
And the next morning, they
opened "Good Morning America"

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.050
drinking Death Wish
Coffee in our mugs.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.230
And Sam Champion was a
weather man at the time.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.860
And he was their coffee expert.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.480
And he said, this is
some great coffee.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.300
And then from there,
orders took off.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.300
I didn't have enough coffee,
enough bags, enough people.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.280
And that's how I
basically hired everyone.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.386
It was just because it
was just me at the time.

00:07:01.386 --> 00:07:03.510
And I was like, oh, my god,
I have all these orders

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.430
that I have to fulfill.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.554
Where am I going to find
people to help me do this?

00:07:06.554 --> 00:07:09.590
So I went to my customers
in my coffee shop,

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.720
and I literally
asked my customers.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.190
Can you help me
fulfill my orders?

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.540
And that's where it
started, and that's

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.120
where I found the
greatest people.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.000
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Great, and which

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.740
brings us to a lot of you guys.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.740
And the interesting thing I find
about that is, like you said,

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.320
you picked people that
you knew or people

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.640
who were customers of yours.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.104
You guys are not necessarily
barista, coffee related.

00:07:32.104 --> 00:07:33.020
KANE GROGAN: Teah was.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.650
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Yeah.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.500
TEAH TERIELE: Yeah, I knew
nothing about marketing though.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.076
I knew a little bit about
coffee, but I was [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:38.076 --> 00:07:39.576
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
So how was the--

00:07:39.576 --> 00:07:41.400
KANE GROGAN: We're skipping
a few major, major points.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.470
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
So fill it in.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.553
What are the major points?

00:07:43.553 --> 00:07:46.010
KANE GROGAN: So one of the
things that Mike has omitted

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.150
in that rags to riches story is
that he was looking for a way

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.320
to supplement some income
because the coffee shop was

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.080
failing, and he found a
product that worked out.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.200
And they, him and Megan,
would just reach out

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.820
to massive amounts of--

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.270
just send e-mails, cold e-mails.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.340
Hey, we have the world's
strongest coffee.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.140
That's how "Good Morning
America" found it.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.223
It was literally in a
basement, and they were just

00:08:08.223 --> 00:08:10.340
sending e-mails like,
we have this thing.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.070
It got mentioned in a few
other publications first,

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.090
and then when "Good
Morning America" came,

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.300
it was way worse than
what Mike just said

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.680
when all those orders came in.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.709
And I came on at that point.

00:08:23.709 --> 00:08:25.250
Teah came on a little
bit after that.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.170
Our good friend, Eric
Donovan, was there,

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.040
who you know him personally.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.080
And there was thousands
and thousands of orders.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.970
And I remember just seeing it.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:34.970
And we were in
this basement where

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.344
the floor is not
really finished,

00:08:36.344 --> 00:08:38.630
and it's shorter than I am tall.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.780
And it was just piles,
literal piles, of orders.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.510
And we were stickering bags,
filling coffee, and weighing it

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.890
out one bag at a time.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.030
It was insane.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.480
We got kicked off of Amazon.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.240
We got a lifetime
ban off of eBay

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.500
because people
thought we were scams.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.859
So that was interesting.

00:08:53.859 --> 00:08:54.650
So it took us the--

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.186
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
What was the scammy--

00:08:56.186 --> 00:08:57.290
KANE GROGAN: They
didn't get their bag.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.720
On our website at
the time, which,

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.190
if you could go back there--
as I'm sure you guys know,

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.140
there's an archive.org
or whatever it

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:03.820
is, where you can see websites.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.861
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Yeah,
Google Wayback Machine.

00:09:05.861 --> 00:09:07.547
KANE GROGAN: The
Google Wayback Machine?

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.380
I wouldn't have bought
it, so that's on them

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.570
because they bought
it off that website.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.770
TEAH TERIELE: Comic Sans,
embossed everything.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:13.896
KANE GROGAN: "World's
Strongest Coffee,"

00:09:13.896 --> 00:09:15.479
Las Vegas, flash,
flash, flash, flash.

00:09:15.479 --> 00:09:17.970
MIKE BROWN: I was the web
developer of that web site.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.980
It converted like
crazy, first of all.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.230
The conversion rate on there
is better than it is now.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.524
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:23.524 --> 00:09:25.190
KANE GROGAN: You'll
get it in five days,

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.523
and it's like three, four weeks.

00:09:26.523 --> 00:09:28.570
And we thought it
was a dead company.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:29.570
I didn't get hired for--

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.115
I kept coming back every
day for three months,

00:09:31.115 --> 00:09:32.570
and I didn't actually
get hired because we

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.778
didn't think it was going
to be a company after that.

00:09:34.778 --> 00:09:36.620
Well, we just
watched a ship sink,

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.260
and let's play the "Titanic"
song as we go down.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.640
And it wasn't that.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.970
We, through customer
service, and just

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.730
apologizing to everybody and
saying, you're going to get it,

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:47.780
people kept ordering.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.530
And then we spent the
next year and a half

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.547
trying to build a
foundation to the company.

00:09:52.547 --> 00:09:53.630
We moved into a warehouse.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.880
We begged and begged and
begged Amazon and eBay

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.847
to let us back on.

00:09:56.847 --> 00:09:59.430
TEAH TERIELE: And now we're the
best selling coffee on Amazon.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.750
So that worked great.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.430
KANE GROGAN: And I
think on Google too.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.990
And for the internet,
for a lot of times,

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.550
we're the number one
coffee, and sometimes,

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.258
the number one grocery
product on Amazon.

00:10:06.258 --> 00:10:10.299
So that was just a testament
to Mike, and him being like,

00:10:10.299 --> 00:10:11.840
we're going to do
this the right way.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.950
We're not going to
screw people over.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.220
We're not going to fold.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.670
We're just going to give
everybody what we promised.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.360
And we were able to deliver,
and it was a pretty amazing time

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.830
for the company.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.500
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: One of the
common threads of the story

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.190
seems to be this foundation
based around communication.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.409
You guys are very,
very communicative.

00:10:31.409 --> 00:10:33.200
Like you said, people
were placing an order

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.387
expecting it in five days.

00:10:34.387 --> 00:10:36.470
You're then reaching out
to them three weeks later

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.280
communicating the delays.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.670
But this is not uncommon.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.950
Like you guys embraced
the online space,

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.260
you guys embraced so
much social media.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.327
Talk about why going
that route, like

00:10:48.327 --> 00:10:49.910
you could easily
have taken out a loan

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.630
and spent $100,000 on
a marketing campaign.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.420
MIKE BROWN: Yeah.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.200
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
But going this route

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.950
seems to have been
very effective for you.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.430
MIKE BROWN: Yeah, our number one
value is customer satisfaction.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.110
I give everyone absolute
freedom to go above and beyond

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.520
to make sure our customers
are satisfied and happy.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.700
And I know people say that a
lot, especially businesses.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.950
But our number two
value is profitability.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.780
And it's all a ranking system.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.590
So we will, because customer
satisfaction is our number one

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.710
value, and then to
be profitable is--

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.960
it's two or three or four,
I can't remember exactly--

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.280
but we will take losses to
make our customers happy.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.570
So we'll go above and
beyond to do that.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.990
One story I'm thinking of
that just pops into my head

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.410
is one day a customer
called, and he

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.690
was very upset with our K-Cups.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.730
We had to do K-Cups,
and Keurig came out

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.800
with a new brewer,
the Keurig 2.0.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.000
And the guy is like,
I bought your cups.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.700
They don't work
in my new machine.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.290
And he was very upset.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:55.700
And I'm like--

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.795
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: You don't
mess with people's coffee.

00:11:56.795 --> 00:11:57.910
MIKE BROWN: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.597
So I was like, oh, how am I
going to fix this problem?

00:12:01.597 --> 00:12:03.930
So I talked to the customer
service, and they were like,

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.263
oh, we can send him another bag.

00:12:05.263 --> 00:12:08.810
And I'm like, no, let's just
send him a better brewer.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:13.370
So we went, and we found the
top rated single serve brewer.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.700
And we sent this guy
a brand new brewer.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.780
And it wasn't a Keurig brand.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.310
I think it was the OXX BOXX.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:23.251
And it was just the top
rated brewer at the time,

00:12:23.251 --> 00:12:24.250
and we sent that to him.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.570
And I've never--
and that guy, he

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.850
turned out to be a CEO of
some big construction company.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:30.830
And he was floored.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:34.220
He was like, you
guys are amazing.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.689
And to me, that's
what I'm saying.

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:37.230
I don't know.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.188
That means a lot about
my customer service team

00:12:39.188 --> 00:12:41.490
that they would think
of it, think to do that.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.540
And that's what we're all
about, just making people's day,

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.800
being able to provide that
type of value to our customers.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:53.320
Where it's not just here's
another bag of cups, good luck.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.760
No, we want to really
embrace customer service.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.410
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well, it
seems to go more than just

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.080
embracing good customer service,
because you've expanded out

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.750
into social media
in unique ways that,

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:09.200
again, foster communication
and community.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.230
Which is interesting for a
consumer product company,

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.600
I think, and that
sort of leads us

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.734
into the conversation
about the podcast.

00:13:16.734 --> 00:13:18.650
So as part of all of
this social media growth,

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:23.980
you guys have created your own
identity and branded a podcast.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:24.710
MIKE BROWN: Yeah.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.960
Dustin could talk a little
bit more about that, I bet.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.500
But I mean, to me, we want
to fuel people's passion.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.600
That's our motto.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.340
And to do that, I feel like we
have to be in contact with them

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.580
on a regular basis.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.040
And sometimes people are only
buying coffee once a month.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.780
So we were thinking, how can
we be a part of these people's

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.509
lives on an ongoing basis?

00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:48.050
And that's where
the podcast came in.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.860
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: Yeah, when
Michael first brought it up,

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.120
to me, it was a way to give
a voice for the company.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:01.586
Not only with our employees,
so we do employee interviews,

00:14:01.586 --> 00:14:02.960
but also with all
the influencers

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.418
that we work with
because we worked

00:14:04.418 --> 00:14:07.010
with a lot of influencers
that now have a voice

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.050
through the company
with the podcast.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.420
But on top of that, it
gives a little bit more

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.390
for the customer to be
a part of the company

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:18.140
and also keep really well
informed with the company.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.480
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
There's a clear style

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.490
to the identity of the company.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.500
Obviously, it's a bold step
to call yourself Death Wish

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.000
Coffee.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.100
Why would you want to
actively drink something

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.040
that is threatening your life?

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.120
But that sort of is--

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.810
MIKE BROWN: Do you want to
hear the story behind that?

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.580
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
I do, absolutely.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.310
MIKE BROWN: So the whole
thought of the name

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:42.345
and the image of
the coffee is when

00:14:42.345 --> 00:14:46.640
I was coming up with Death
Wish Coffee, I was sitting.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.990
It was at night.

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:50.330
So imagine me sitting
in a room at night.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.080
It's dark out.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.163
All I have is this computer
screen in front of me.

00:14:53.163 --> 00:14:55.670
And I was in my second
floor apartment.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.780
And poor, I was broke as a joke.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.500
I was so poor.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:06.410
And I'm like, what am I--

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.580
I had this product in mind.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.190
And how do I put
this on a screen?

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.960
And I looked down at this can.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.340
I was I was drinking a
Four Loko at the time.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:15.960
All right.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.850
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: If that
doesn't say [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:17.285
work does.

00:15:17.285 --> 00:15:17.580
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.955
MIKE BROWN: Yeah, I was drinking
a Four Loko at the time.

00:15:19.955 --> 00:15:22.430
And the koozie I had on it had
a picture of this mean dog.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:24.749
And my girlfriend
bought me this koozie

00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:26.040
when she went away on vacation.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.373
And it said death wish under it.

00:15:27.373 --> 00:15:31.220
And I'm like, oh, that's
a pretty cool name.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.720
I could go with that for
a name of this coffee.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.719
And how am I going to--

00:15:36.719 --> 00:15:39.260
what would I want to see if I
walked into somebody's kitchen?

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.470
Like if I saw a
bag of coffee, what

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.530
would I pick up and look
at and be intrigued by?

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.350
And I had this image
of a poison bottle,

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.090
like an old school poison vial,
where you'd pick up and be

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.210
like, what is this?

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.000
What kind of coffee
are you drinking

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.512
with this poison label on it?

00:15:54.512 --> 00:15:56.220
And that was the whole
concept behind it.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.360
And I was like, death wish,
poison bottle, this could work.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.860
So I went into Photoshop and
Photoshopped some stuff around.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.120
And so I got the
preliminary logo.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.040
It's not the logo it is now.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.120
I'm pointing to my
wrist, because I actually

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.204
have the logo on my wrist.

00:16:09.204 --> 00:16:10.328
KANE GROGAN: It's not real.

00:16:10.328 --> 00:16:12.350
MIKE BROWN: It's just
a temporary tattoo.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.400
KANE GROGAN: There
are tattoos though.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.860
We do have tattoos of it.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.050
MIKE BROWN: Yeah, it
was that poison logo.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:22.204
That's the whole image I
had in my brain at the time.

00:16:22.204 --> 00:16:24.620
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well, it's
fed so much into the larger

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.670
identity at this point.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.080
You guys with the podcasts
have really embraced this.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.562
Dustin, I know
you're big into MMA.

00:16:29.562 --> 00:16:30.520
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: Yeah.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.790
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And you
guys have some influences

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:32.720
from that space.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.090
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: That
and rock and roll, yeah--

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.370
that whole area of
edgy influencers

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.412
has just opened up to us.

00:16:39.412 --> 00:16:41.370
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: It
becomes like a lifestyle

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:42.620
brand at a certain point.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:42.730
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: Absolutely.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.830
KANE GROGAN: Pretty early on
it became a lifestyle brand.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.890
We realized-- and I don't think
it was the intent-- if you look

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.460
at some of our
original ads, it was

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.600
a lawyer who can't
wake up in the morning

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.890
so he drinks the coffee.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.390
But we found out
that our number one

00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.230
people that were spreading
the word were either musicians

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.120
or recovered addicts
who wanted something

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.089
to sink their teeth
into and a brand that

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:06.319
really spoke to them.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:08.069
And so many people drink coffee.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.150
It's the number two commodity
in the world behind oil.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.450
And we had the edgiest,
most bad ass brand.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.160
And when we started this
thing, or when Mike started,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.910
there was no "world's
strongest coffee."

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.689
Now, you can Google--

00:17:19.689 --> 00:17:20.730
it's weird that I'm here.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:21.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:22.730
I get to say that.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.619
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: You, you--

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:28.144
KANE GROGAN: Now you can
search on the internet.

00:17:28.144 --> 00:17:29.060
No, it's kind of cool.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.014
But you can see so
many different people

00:17:31.014 --> 00:17:32.180
claiming to have that claim.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.570
And one of my
favorite stories is

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.420
we see so many websites
that try to knock us off.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:43.870
And there was one that
used our exact HTML code

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.200
and didn't take the bottom off.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.700
So it said, why try Death Wish?

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.680
Click here.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.470
And our bag.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.980
TEAH TERIELE: Our address.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.610
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: It was also
effectively signing people up

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:54.066
for your [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:54.066 --> 00:17:54.510
KANE GROGAN: That was cool.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.940
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Totally.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.390
TEAH TERIELE: Exactly,
yeah, the opt in,

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.240
actually, we collected
email addresses

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.410
from some imposter's website.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:58.880
KANE GROGAN: Yeah, they failed.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.720
TEAH TERIELE: It was crazy.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.760
KANE GROGAN: They had our bag
with their logo Photoshopped

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.330
on top of it.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.730
And we would email them and
be like, that's our bag.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:05.510
And they're like, no, it's not.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.040
I'd say it has our address
on it, on the side of it,

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.060
the bag that you still
put on your website.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.040
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: We
half Photoshopped it.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.581
KANE GROGAN: Yeah,
it was ridiculous.

00:18:11.581 --> 00:18:14.510
TEAH TERIELE: But speaking to
it being a lifestyle brand,

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.637
there are people who rock
our shirts and our hats

00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:18.845
and everything like that
without actually even trying

00:18:18.845 --> 00:18:19.362
the coffee.

00:18:19.362 --> 00:18:20.570
KANE GROGAN: And get tattoos.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:23.300
TEAH TERIELE: And get tattoos--

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.638
they've probably tried the
coffee at that point, though.

00:18:25.638 --> 00:18:26.679
KANE GROGAN: That's true.

00:18:26.679 --> 00:18:27.300
I'd hope so.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.240
TEAH TERIELE: Sure, just do it.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.570
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
You've mentioned tattoos.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:30.800
Sorry to cut that off.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.540
Were you--

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.480
TEAH TERIELE: Oh, yeah, so
a few of our biggest fans

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.460
definitely have
our logo tattooed

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.845
on them, which is insane.

00:18:38.845 --> 00:18:39.150
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Is it five?

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:40.310
TEAH TERIELE: People
call us all the time.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.590
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Do
five people have them?

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:41.760
TEAH TERIELE: It's
way more than five.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.360
MIKE BROWN: It's way
more than five now.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:42.907
I'd say it's closer to 20.

00:18:42.907 --> 00:18:43.130
TEAH TERIELE: They call
us, and they say, hey,

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.630
we want to get
your logo tattooed.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:45.604
Is that OK?

00:18:45.604 --> 00:18:47.270
Well, that's a big
commitment, you know.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.780
We're never like, ah,
just go ahead and do it.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.946
It's kind of like, are you
sure you want to do this?

00:18:50.946 --> 00:18:53.624
We do try and kind of talk them
down, but it is pretty cool.

00:18:53.624 --> 00:18:55.040
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
We're honored.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.737
You guys just finished the
New York City tattoo artist?

00:18:57.737 --> 00:18:59.570
KANE GROGAN: Tattoo
artist [INAUDIBLE] Yeah.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.840
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Did you watch anybody

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.950
get a Death Wish tattoo?

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:03.130
TEAH TERIELE: No, actually.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:03.950
KANE GROGAN: We weren't--

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:04.820
I mean, it's tough.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:05.570
It's a weird commitment.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:06.538
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Just you.

00:19:06.538 --> 00:19:07.506
KANE GROGAN: Yeah, Mike got one.

00:19:07.506 --> 00:19:09.380
TEAH TERIELE: Yeah,
but that's temporary.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.940
KANE GROGAN: Yeah, we
always joke after they

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:11.880
get it like, oh, that sucks.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.213
We're actually selling our name.

00:19:13.213 --> 00:19:15.000
We're going to be
something else now.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:15.910
But no, it's insane.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.880
It very early became
a lifestyle brand.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.180
And one of our first marketing
campaigns was, what fuels you?

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.140
You're fueled by death.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.879
And to skip forward
back to the podcast,

00:19:26.879 --> 00:19:29.420
which started a few months ago--
and Jeff is also the co-host

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.090
of that, and he headed
that whole project--

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.550
we found out very early
on that it wasn't just

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.590
musicians and all these people.

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.370
It was engineers.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.220
It was comic book
artists, nurses.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:40.520
JEFF AYERS: Nurses.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.240
KANE GROGAN: Passionate
people about what

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:41.690
they do for a living--

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:42.860
JEFF AYERS: Astronauts,
your parents--

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:43.565
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
--and their art.

00:19:43.565 --> 00:19:44.731
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: Olympians.

00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:46.680
JEFF AYERS: Fueled by
death isn't just an idea

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.850
of what is your coffee.

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.002
And coffee, like we keep
saying, is a lifestyle.

00:19:51.002 --> 00:19:53.460
But fueled by death is every
single one of us in this room.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.270
Every single one of us outside
of this room on this planet

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.060
wants to do
something significant

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.980
before we leave this
planet for good,

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.750
because death is
inevitable, whether you

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:07.220
get hit by a bus in five minutes
or you live to be 90 years old.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:11.930
And what's interesting is
that everybody in the world

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:17.074
enjoys figuring that out,
whether it's a hard journey

00:20:17.074 --> 00:20:18.740
to get there, or it's
something that you

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:19.948
know you're passionate about.

00:20:19.948 --> 00:20:24.410
And it's very interesting to
attack a conversation that way,

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.770
and that's where the idea
of this podcast came about.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.260
And it's interesting to be
able to bring it to a business.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.627
And because we're not
sitting there and being like,

00:20:33.627 --> 00:20:35.210
well, what kind of
coffee do you like?

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.435
And why does that fuel you?

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:37.670
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: It'd
get boring real quick

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:38.270
JEFF AYERS: What?

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.500
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: That
would get boring real quick.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.291
JEFF AYERS: It would
get incredibly boring.

00:20:41.291 --> 00:20:43.420
But we've talked to
astronauts and rock

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.890
stars and normal people.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.720
And why are you-- what gets
you out of bed in the morning?

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.620
Why do you get out of
bed in the morning?

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.060
And what gets you out
of bed the next morning?

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.000
Why are you doing it?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.720
Not the coffee,
there's something

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.780
that you're passionate
about, and that conversation

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.450
will never not be interesting.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:05.750
And that's what we are all
about as a lifestyle brand

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.590
too, because what's fun
about a coffee company

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:12.000
is coffee is a lifestyle.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.374
All of you out there
probably have your own way

00:21:14.374 --> 00:21:16.790
that you drink coffee, and it
becomes your morning ritual,

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.350
whether it's just putting
it in a drip machine

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.415
and hitting the brew button--

00:21:19.415 --> 00:21:20.150
KANE GROGAN: Or going
to a gas station.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.733
JEFF AYERS: Or going
to a gas station,

00:21:21.733 --> 00:21:24.860
or taking out your chemistry
set and really making

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.510
that perfect cup of coffee.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.210
Whatever it is,
that is your passion

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.670
for your coffee at that moment.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.110
But after you drink your
coffee, then your day starts.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.959
And then what are you
doing with your day?

00:21:34.959 --> 00:21:36.500
And we want to be
a part of your day,

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.070
not just in that
beginning of it.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.070
KANE GROGAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.930
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
It's a great narrative

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.599
to hear about the passion,
the seeking passion

00:21:44.599 --> 00:21:47.140
in the people who are around
you and apart of that lifestyle,

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.760
and then equating
that back to what

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.000
you went through to actually get
this thing up off the ground.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.695
Looking back at
it now, were there

00:21:54.695 --> 00:21:56.320
times when you
thought-- you know what?

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.060
This isn't worth it.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.190
Or were there times
that you had to re-find

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.074
that passion in yourself
of we can make this work?

00:22:03.074 --> 00:22:04.990
I do want to do it, even
though it's daunting.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.180
MIKE BROWN: Early on
with the coffee shop,

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.150
I believe when I
started Death Wish,

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:13.690
I was probably only one or two
months from closing the doors,

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:16.750
because I just didn't
have any money left.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.200
I had my car repoed.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.519
I had to sell my house.

00:22:19.519 --> 00:22:20.935
I had to move back
in with my mom.

00:22:20.935 --> 00:22:23.540
I was living behind the garage.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.790
So I was very close
to calling it quits.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:31.240
But I am super--

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.680
I didn't want to be a failure.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.695
That to me, that word--

00:22:34.695 --> 00:22:35.320
and it's funny.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.760
I think back, and people,
my friends and family,

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.690
they'd be like, hey
Mike, how are things

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:39.430
going at the coffee shop?

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:40.930
And every time like,
ah, they're going great.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:41.770
Thanks for asking.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.350
But deep inside,
I was just like,

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:46.306
I'm crashing and burning here.

00:22:46.306 --> 00:22:47.170
Oh.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:53.080
So yeah, after that, I'm
like, I got to try something.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.650
So once the online sales
started to pick up,

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.370
I'm like, holy crap.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.880
Maybe I can keep this thing
open a little bit longer.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.230
And I'm like, if I just
make $5,000 a year,

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.240
that's pretty much all
I need to make things

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.790
if I worked a little longer.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:15.430
So yeah, there was that time
where I was at the absolute

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:16.660
ready to call it quits.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.290
But yeah, I hung on, and
I kept going with it.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:24.760
And I was just like, I'll pay
my bills back someday, I guess.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.414
And I did, so.

00:23:26.414 --> 00:23:29.080
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: I do want to
speak about something specific,

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.330
which is I would like for you
guys to talk about the Super

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:31.892
Bowl ad.

00:23:31.892 --> 00:23:32.725
MIKE BROWN: Oh, man.

00:23:32.725 --> 00:23:34.641
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And
how that came to pass,

00:23:34.641 --> 00:23:36.940
because I think it's a
testament to your activity

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.030
on the social media space
and how hard you guys

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:41.860
work to build that
community, and then

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.860
actually, that community
paying you back interestingly.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.780
JEFF AYERS: We have
the greatest fans,

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:51.995
community, customers in
the world, hands down.

00:23:51.995 --> 00:23:53.720
We keep going back to lifestyle.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.150
We keep talking about that.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:56.570
They made it a lifestyle.

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:57.904
They made this brand what it is.

00:23:57.904 --> 00:23:59.569
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: And
they're the reason

00:23:59.569 --> 00:24:02.080
why we got the Super Bowl
commercial in the first place,

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.200
because it was--

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.840
it was into, its--

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.340
MIKE BROWN: Small
Business Big Game.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:06.400
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: You
don't have a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.090
DUSTIN ALEXANDER:
Small business.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:07.480
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.355
TEAH TERIELE: So basically,
Intuit QuickBooks

00:24:09.355 --> 00:24:11.930
put out a contest
for a small business

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.380
with less than, I
think, 50 employees.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.505
And about 15,000 businesses
actually entered that,

00:24:17.505 --> 00:24:19.137
and we were one of them.

00:24:19.137 --> 00:24:21.220
And it was a vote-based
contest, so basically, you

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:25.090
would ask your community
to vote for you.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.400
Click a very simple link.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.790
And essentially, the
contest was very simple.

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:33.332
The person with the
most votes would win.

00:24:33.332 --> 00:24:35.290
So it ended up being
narrowed down to, I think,

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:39.520
a few hundred, and then
10, and that was insane.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.010
Out of 15,000, we had no idea.

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.390
But coming back to the
failure conversation

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.940
that you were having, I think
that was the first time where

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:50.800
we said, if we don't win
this, that would suck.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.510
It felt like it
would be a setback,

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.930
and it was almost our--

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:54.510
KANE GROGAN: We put so
much work into that.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.259
TEAH TERIELE: We put
so much work into it,

00:24:56.259 --> 00:24:58.190
it felt like it would
be the end of the world.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.760
And I think that is one of
the reasons why we ended up

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.750
winning.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.670
MIKE BROWN: Because we
put 100% of our focus

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.140
on winning the competition.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.090
Which sounds silly,
but it really

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:11.020
brought our team together,
that one driving purpose.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.120
And every day, we'd start.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.170
We'd be like, how are we
going to get more votes today?

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.530
How are we going to
get more votes today?

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:16.280
TEAH TERIELE: Yep.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.300
MIKE BROWN: And it came down to
us and Chubbies and Vidler's.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.430
Vidler's, is a five and
dime out of Buffalo, New

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:22.930
York, great small little store.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.960
They had all of Buffalo, all
6 million people in Buffalo

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.371
behind them, voting every day.

00:25:27.371 --> 00:25:29.120
TEAH TERIELE: They
were a brick and mortar

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.899
shop that would sold
the tiny figurines,

00:25:32.899 --> 00:25:33.940
and Chinese finger traps.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:34.240
JEFF AYERS: Little candies

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.010
KANE GROGAN: They
didn't even want to win.

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.730
They were like, we're not online
but what do we do if we win?

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:39.340
TEAH TERIELE: They were
like, wow, this is amazing.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.150
KANE GROGAN: And Intuit
did tell us after.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:40.990
I don't know if I
should say this.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.370
But they were like,
if someone like that

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.160
won, we wouldn't ever
do this contest again,

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.534
because there's no way to
quantify that or help that out.

00:25:46.534 --> 00:25:48.780
But it was insane.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.280
In the first three months-- it
was a six month competition--

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.070
and the first three months
started with 15,000.

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.680
And I honestly didn't
think we had a chance.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.300
We were seven
employees at the time.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.060
We were going against some
juggernauts of companies.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.950
For instance, Chubbies
Shorts, while they

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:04.840
have a little less
than 50 employees,

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.890
they have 125 college-brand
ambassadors spreading the word,

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:10.080
which aren't on the books.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.360
Which I think that's cheating.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:11.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.875
That's just my
opinion, no big deal.

00:26:13.875 --> 00:26:16.000
MIKE BROWN: Very nice,
those guys are good guys.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:16.540
JEFF AYERS: They were cool.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.320
They were cool.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.100
MIKE BROWN: We're
friends with them.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.650
KANE GROGAN: But when they
said we were in the top 10,

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.130
it became very real.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:23.816
And then it was like, OK, we did
a lot of work up to this point.

00:26:23.816 --> 00:26:25.690
But we were still doing
our day to day stuff.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.481
Once they were like,
you guys are 1 of 10--

00:26:27.481 --> 00:26:28.646
and they basically picked.

00:26:28.646 --> 00:26:30.520
You had to have a
community of people voting,

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.910
but they also picked
really good stories.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.160
Some of the people we were
going against in the top 10

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.220
were this Harvard
Business person.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.950
This awesome, awesome
chick was trying

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.520
to solve world hunger
by you put your fruit

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.000
or whatever on this paper, and
it will make it last longer.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.740
And it's like, we
just sell coffee.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.592
We're going against
amazing, amazing stories

00:26:52.592 --> 00:26:54.300
and amazing companies,
and all 10 of them

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.790
were very incredible stories.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:00.570
So when we actually won
it, it was the first time

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.070
we came together as a team.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.160
And really, team is the
most important thing.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.910
You can really do
anything you want to do.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.700
You just have
everyone bought in.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.050
And I think we realized
that we can accomplish

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.729
pretty much anything,
and it sounds so cliche,

00:27:12.729 --> 00:27:14.020
but if you put your mind to it.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.740
And every day, Mike
would be like, what is it

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:17.776
$7 million worth to you?

00:27:17.776 --> 00:27:19.150
What would you do
for $7 million,

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:20.850
because that's essentially
what you're getting?

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.040
You're getting a $7
million commercial,

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.017
and we were going to
be set as a business

00:27:24.017 --> 00:27:26.100
if we could just figure
out how to win this thing.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.669
And it was a lot of pressure,
and there were months

00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:29.960
where we didn't have a day off.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.580
We were to go into every event.

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.350
And me and Mike would go
to a literal football game

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.600
and just hand out things
like, we're a coffee company.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.080
Vote for us.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.610
TEAH TERIELE: In
Buffalo, I might add.

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:39.580
KANE GROGAN: In
Buffalo, we didn't

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.940
realize we were going
against those guys, but--

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:41.470
Teah knows.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.520
Teah, she's the head
of our marketing.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.270
So she had, OK,
let's try this today.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.250
Let's try this today.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:46.950
We're not there.

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:47.700
We're not winning.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.717
And it was insane.

00:27:48.717 --> 00:27:51.300
TEAH TERIELE: I would say that
if we didn't establish customer

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:55.476
service as our number one value
way before this competition,

00:27:55.476 --> 00:27:57.600
I don't think we would have
won because it wouldn't

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.990
have resonated with our fans
or with our community at all.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:07.260
And we have made it a point to
involve them with the company

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.230
the entire time.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.650
So I think that kind of sets up.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.100
Our fans would contact
us, and say, hey, I

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.600
set a calendar
invite on my calendar

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.550
so that I remember to
vote every single day.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:18.990
KANE GROGAN: Every day.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.330
TEAH TERIELE: I created a
separate mailing list opt in

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:22.230
for people.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.977
We would send one a day, and
almost no one unsubscribed

00:28:24.977 --> 00:28:26.310
from that list, which is insane.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.020
And the open rates and the
click rates were incredible.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:32.010
So our community and
just placing them

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.920
on top of our values I think
is the most important thing

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.720
that we ever did.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.910
And we never knew it would
have actually come back

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:40.442
to us in such a great way.

00:28:40.442 --> 00:28:42.150
KANE GROGAN: Being
real and genuine also,

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:44.940
and one of the things
that Mike and Teah found

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:49.100
out early on where people
wanted to see your faces.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.990
You're now their
favorite coffee brand.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.900
And we made our
brand very relatable.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.910
None of us have experience
in any of the things

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:58.110
we have jobs in now.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.020
Most of us didn't
graduate from college.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.832
We basically Googled
how to run a business.

00:29:04.832 --> 00:29:05.790
JEFF AYERS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.440
KANE GROGAN: Yeah,
thank you so much.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.870
No, but seriously
it was literally

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.350
like we had a Google education.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:12.330
I know you guys
probably heard that,

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:13.620
and it might be one of
those weird triggers things

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.140
like, blech.

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.736
But we did.

00:29:15.736 --> 00:29:17.080
How do you run social media?

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.330
How do you run an ad campaign?

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.350
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: And
we still do it today.

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.890
KANE GROGAN: We still do that.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:22.950
And because of that,
we were able to--

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:25.475
we didn't have a whole
20 years of experience,

00:29:25.475 --> 00:29:26.559
and this is the way it is.

00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:27.974
This is the way
we're going to go.

00:29:27.974 --> 00:29:29.970
A lot of those dinosaurs
fall with the times.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:32.220
We are the times,
like we literally

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.106
grew up in this
age and this era,

00:29:34.106 --> 00:29:35.730
and we figured out
how to do everything

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.360
by just searching it online.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.860
And it's like a testament to
the power of what you guys do,

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:44.216
which is incredible, and why
we are where we are today.

00:29:44.216 --> 00:29:45.840
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Well, it is a story

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.680
of a very meteoric rise.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.210
A very short time period to
go from the brick and mortar

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.480
basement roasting, coming
up with the recipe,

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.989
to where you are now, where
the line is diversified.

00:29:57.989 --> 00:30:00.280
Like you said, you're making
everything from whole bean

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:04.410
to K-Cups that people can buy
and just pop in a machine.

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:08.010
I want to have you guys
speak to someone out there.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.260
Maybe here, it's a
Googler, or maybe it's

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.020
somebody who is watching
the video at home that

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.690
has their thing, their
passion, and they want

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:17.970
a similar kind of experience.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:19.200
What would you tell them?

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.360
How would you advise them to
get involved into that, to maybe

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.010
not mimic what you
guys have done,

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.830
but at least be on that path?

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:30.290
MIKE BROWN: Yeah,
just go for it.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.760
And when you feel like
you're getting uncomfortable,

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.890
then just push a little further.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:40.160
Because I feel like, thinking
back, at that point in my life

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.045
where I almost quit, I
was that close to success.

00:30:43.045 --> 00:30:43.920
You know what I mean?

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.860
I was that close, and I did
just push a little bit further.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.991
So whatever you're doing, if
you have a passion, go for it.

00:30:51.991 --> 00:30:53.490
And right when you
get to that point

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.890
where you're about to quit,
just be like, actually, no.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.820
I'm going to push myself
two steps further.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.845
And I think if
everyone did that, was

00:31:01.845 --> 00:31:04.140
just a little bit
more persistent,

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.060
the things you can
accomplish are amazing.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:06.590
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Do you guys agree?

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.910
TEAH TERIELE: Yeah.

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:07.050
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: Yeah.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:09.480
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: You
guys, the podcast creators

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.545
who are here, you guys
just started doing it out

00:31:11.545 --> 00:31:12.045
of nowhere.

00:31:12.045 --> 00:31:13.380
JEFF AYERS: Right, yeah.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.088
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
And you guys have now

00:31:15.088 --> 00:31:17.310
grown to a fairly
decent presence.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:18.810
JEFF AYERS: We're
still a baby cast,

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.370
just 30 episodes out right now.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:23.490
But yeah, one thing I
say about this company,

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:27.060
and this really works
towards anything

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.790
you're passionate about, is
that this company, Death Wish

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:33.660
Coffee, I always equate it to
a living, breathing organism.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.990
It's something that
learns every day.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:38.061
It's not just coffee.

00:31:38.061 --> 00:31:39.060
It's not just the brand.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.030
It's what we're
trying to achieve,

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.190
what we're trying to do.

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.570
And anything, whether it's
the video game you like,

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:50.500
or the hobby that you're
creating in your workshop

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.350
at home, or the job that
you have to go to day in

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:55.780
and day out, there's
always another journey.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.940
There's always another path you
can take to get to the goal.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.835
The goal is just there, but
that's never the finish line.

00:32:01.835 --> 00:32:04.210
There's never a finish line,
and we talk about that a lot

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:04.835
on the podcast.

00:32:04.835 --> 00:32:07.540
In fact, one of the
influencers of the company

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.257
said it the best.

00:32:08.257 --> 00:32:10.090
And we quote him probably
every single time.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:11.330
And Dustin knows who
I'm going to say.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:11.520
DUSTIN ALEXANDER:
Yeah, EJ Snyder.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.645
JEFF AYERS: It's EJ Snyder.

00:32:12.645 --> 00:32:14.590
He's on "Naked and Afraid."

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.550
He said it the best.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.010
He said you either
win or you learn.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:19.150
There is no losing.

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:20.230
There's never losing.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:25.730
And when you win,
there's more to go.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:28.480
And that's a testament
to what we do, but it's

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.030
a testament to what you all
do, what anybody can do.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.850
And I think that's powerful.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.580
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: And just to
speak on what Michael brought

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:40.310
up, Jeff and I were
podcasting before we started

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:41.560
podcasting before the company.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.019
We had our own
little mini podcast.

00:32:43.019 --> 00:32:44.976
But we were kind of
hitting the end of the road

00:32:44.976 --> 00:32:46.990
there where it was
like, is this done?

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.010
Are we done with this?

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:51.550
And we decided we were
going to hang on to it,

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.259
and then that's when
Mike was like, well,

00:32:53.259 --> 00:32:54.758
why don't you do
it for the company?

00:32:54.758 --> 00:32:56.270
And it was like,
yeah, let's do it.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.280
Let's get it together.

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.870
Now we have a vision.

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:04.580
We have a focus, and
now it's been great.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.360
It's been amazing.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.818
It's been an amazing trip, and
it's been very short so far.

00:33:07.818 --> 00:33:10.930
JEFF AYERS: And we're
not even started.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:12.677
We started out doing the idea.

00:33:12.677 --> 00:33:14.260
Hey, let's have a
weekly podcast where

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.718
people can learn
about the company,

00:33:15.718 --> 00:33:17.980
but we can also
ask those questions

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.810
to influencers and
interesting people,

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.630
and the employees as well.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:25.180
But now, we're adding video,
and we're adding live video.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.060
We're doing Facebook Live,
and we're doing as we do it.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:34.180
And live, I'm learning how to do
TV tricks as we're going live.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:38.530
So I'm on camera talking to you
and also putting camera two on,

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:40.180
as it's happening,
with other graphics.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.346
And I'm failing, but
I'm doing better at it

00:33:42.346 --> 00:33:43.762
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
He's learning.

00:33:43.762 --> 00:33:44.887
KANE GROGAN: He's learning.

00:33:44.887 --> 00:33:45.890
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:48.670
JEFF AYERS: So there's
always new ideas.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.460
There's always new ways
to, not even just-- it's

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:52.630
not improving something.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:57.160
It's just going farther,
going that extra step.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:57.880
It's awesome.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.255
DUSTIN ALEXANDER:
And it's always

00:33:59.255 --> 00:34:01.390
going to be tough when
you're breaking ground.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:04.930
We're doing things that no other
specialty coffee companies.

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.570
No other coffee companies
are making a podcast

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:13.130
like we're doing or making
comic books like we do.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:15.639
But when you break ground,
nobody's been there before.

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:17.050
You can't just Google it.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:19.030
How do I start a
podcast and make it

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:20.380
a live show on Facebook Live?

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.780
You're not going
to get an answer.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.884
So it's just the nature of
the beast of breaking ground.

00:34:25.884 --> 00:34:27.550
You're going to have
to figure out stuff

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:30.040
that nobody's figured
out yet, but that's

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.330
where the success comes from.

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:33.038
TEAH TERIELE: Going
back to Mike's story,

00:34:33.038 --> 00:34:34.510
I think this is
really important.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:40.361
Mike mentioned pushing past
your uncomfortable point.

00:34:40.361 --> 00:34:42.110
Making a list of your
worst case scenario,

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.735
I know that's what
Mike definitely did,

00:34:43.735 --> 00:34:46.780
and weighing whether or
not those things are worse

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.280
than failing business wise.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.460
I know Mike made a list of
his worst case scenario,

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.199
and all of them
ended up happening.

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:54.272
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:54.272 --> 00:34:57.830
He moved back into his mom's
place, et cetera, et cetera.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.334
But you do have to push
past that a little bit.

00:35:00.334 --> 00:35:02.500
So I do think, going back
to your original question,

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.280
make a list of the worst things
that could possibly happen,

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.690
and if you're OK with
those things happening

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:10.710
at the expense of creating
an amazing business, yeah,

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:11.895
just try it out.

00:35:11.895 --> 00:35:14.020
It won't definitely work,
but at least you'll know.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.687
You'll know what's to come.

00:35:15.687 --> 00:35:17.770
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: Part of
that worst case scenario

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:18.720
is not doing it at all.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.761
KANE GROGAN: That's true.

00:35:19.761 --> 00:35:24.040
Part of what we kind of omitted
from this rags to riches story

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.210
is Mike had a career.

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:26.770
He had his master's
in accounting,

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:29.320
he was an accountant for the
state, worked for the state.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.189
Had seen all these
people that do this thing

00:35:31.189 --> 00:35:33.730
where they show up every day to
work, and they're just like--

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:34.870
No one's really happy.

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:36.370
There's nothing
really driving them.

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:38.770
They're just kind of robotic.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.747
They just get up, and
they drink their coffee,

00:35:41.747 --> 00:35:43.580
and then they go to
work and do their thing.

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.163
Then they go home,
and they go to bed.

00:35:45.163 --> 00:35:46.330
And he's like, I hate this.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.075
I want to do
something that I like.

00:35:48.075 --> 00:35:49.450
And I like being
in coffee shops.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:51.783
I don't know much about coffee,
but I can figure it out.

00:35:51.783 --> 00:35:53.950
And then a lot of us were
at crossroads in life

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:57.790
when we joined the
team, and I would

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:01.011
say that the most important
thing is just never settling.

00:36:01.011 --> 00:36:01.510
I know that.

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:03.040
So he had a career.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.240
He didn't like it.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.684
He tried something else, and it
took five or six years before.

00:36:07.684 --> 00:36:09.100
Everyone told him
it was the worst

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.730
decision he was going to make.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.560
I, personally, I dropped out of
community college three times.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.340
I was a banker.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.930
I had the whole
career in banking

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:18.920
when I was in my early 20s.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.060
I hated it.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:20.590
I quit.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.930
My family and friends told
me it was the worst decision.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:24.970
I moved back to
upstate New York,

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:28.656
and I ended up basically
homeless for a while.

00:36:28.656 --> 00:36:29.530
JEFF AYERS: My couch.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:31.240
KANE GROGAN: His
couch, Eric's couch--

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.550
I spent a lot of time with
Matt and his beautiful wife.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:38.474
And it was a very, very dark
time, but I found Death Wish,

00:36:38.474 --> 00:36:39.890
and I just seized
the opportunity.

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.500
I know Teah's got
similar stories.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.090
Alyssa worked for "Teen Vogue,"
I think for a little while.

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:44.970
She still does.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:46.460
And we've all done things.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:47.540
You worked for a kitchen.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:49.070
You worked for a kitchen.

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:52.610
It was a lot of different
times where we just

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:55.291
weren't happy with our current
situation, and a lot of people

00:36:55.291 --> 00:36:55.790
settle.

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:57.620
And I think that's the
biggest mistake you can make.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.330
And just dealing with it,
because you think that's all

00:36:59.330 --> 00:36:59.830
you got.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:03.890
Just looking for opportunities,
and when they're there,

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:04.790
doors will open.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.982
You just have to know
to walk through them.

00:37:06.982 --> 00:37:08.690
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Very good, very good.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.606
I do want to leave plenty
of time for you guys

00:37:10.606 --> 00:37:11.660
to ask questions as well.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.160
There are microphones
in the aisles,

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.972
so I encourage you to make
your way to the microphones

00:37:15.972 --> 00:37:17.180
with your questions prepared.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:18.610
While people are
getting ready, I

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:20.026
want you guys to
go down the line,

00:37:20.026 --> 00:37:23.510
and I want you to tell me
how you take your coffee.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:26.390
MIKE BROWN: Yes, I take
my coffee out of a Chemex,

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:29.150
typically black,
no sugar, no cream,

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:30.350
strong as you can make it.

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:33.069
But I only drink
it in the morning.

00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:35.110
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: I get
a little weirder with it.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:36.980
I make something
called Death Proof

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:42.100
Coffee, which is mixed with
butter, MCT oil, blended.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.740
I stick a few other
things in there.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.130
But yeah, that's
my morning ritual.

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.297
One cup in the morning,
I'm good to go all day.

00:37:50.297 --> 00:37:52.130
TEAH TERIELE: Typically--
I actually came in

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:53.900
as a coffee connoisseur.

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.060
And I was such a brat.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.500
I still love that third wave
coffee, but typically black.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.640
But you'll catch me
going to the Keurig

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.900
a lot more than I'll admit.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.220
So here I am.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.710
KANE GROGAN: I have my
two different kinds,

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:08.660
where I have my
hangover on Sunday

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.630
where I just like really
just terrible diner

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:13.770
coffee with a bunch
of cream and sugar.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.086
I've also figured out
through this job--

00:38:16.086 --> 00:38:17.460
I didn't know much
about coffee--

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.064
ways to use it as
a literal utility

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.230
to get you through your day.

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:23.521
A lot of people will drink
an energy drink or something

00:38:23.521 --> 00:38:24.180
like that.

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:24.770
And Teah would
always be like, dude,

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:27.367
there's more caffeine in
coffee than there is in that.

00:38:27.367 --> 00:38:28.200
You don't need that.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.480
It's terrible for you.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:33.640
So I usually have three
cups between 8:00 and 11:00,

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:38.429
and it'll get me till about
3:00, where I start that crash.

00:38:38.429 --> 00:38:40.220
And then I'll have one
more cup, because it

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:43.010
allows me to go home and
get stuff done after work.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:45.450
JEFF AYERS: I used to be
cream and sugar all the time,

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:47.150
and then I got really
lazy in college.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.610
So it's black, and it's a lot.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:50.440
I drink probably--

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:50.760
KANE GROGAN: He drinks a lot.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.301
JEFF AYERS: --five
or six cups a day.

00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:54.770
My desk is directly next to
all of our coffee machines,

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:56.750
and I'm bouncing off
the walls by 5:00.

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:57.860
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: And
he never shuts up.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.790
KANE GROGAN: He never
shuts up, and he

00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:59.830
started having panic attacks.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:00.670
So he's had to calm down.

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:02.556
Have you ever seen
that Dave Grohl video

00:39:02.556 --> 00:39:03.800
where it's like, fresh pots.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.070
His wife was like,
are you all right?

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:05.450
What happened?

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:05.640
It's where he was like--

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.090
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: That's
maybe not a shining endorsement.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:07.995
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:07.995 --> 00:39:10.078
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: It's
just an occupational hazard

00:39:10.078 --> 00:39:11.300
when you work with coffee.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.140
JEFF AYERS: It's
just how it works.

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:12.770
KANE GROGAN: Especially
when you don't

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:15.310
pay for it where we work, and
we have really strong coffee.

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:16.860
DUSTIN ALEXANDER:
[INAUDIBLE] stages.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:17.300
KANE GROGAN: But
one of the things

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.830
I do want to say real
quick is we always

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:20.538
look for alternative
methods, and we just

00:39:20.538 --> 00:39:22.100
released a nitro
cold brew, which

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.620
is very concentrated
Death Wish coffee.

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.960
And Jeff would get home
and have a panic attack

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:27.870
and not know why.

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.270
And it's because he
would have one of those

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:30.475
too late in the afternoons.

00:39:30.475 --> 00:39:31.600
JEFF AYERS: Three of those.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.114
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:32.114 --> 00:39:33.530
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
How about you?

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.670
ALYSSA HARDY: I wake
up very, very early,

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.220
so I start with the Chemex.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.200
And I put a little bit
of almond milk in it.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.616
And then I get to
work, and I make

00:39:40.616 --> 00:39:45.137
one the second I get to work
in french press typically.

00:39:45.137 --> 00:39:46.970
AUDIENCE: I feel like
we haven't heard a lot

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:48.495
about the coffee itself yet.

00:39:48.495 --> 00:39:51.950
So I'm very curious about
things like sourcing,

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.350
roasting, how you blend it.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:56.000
And also, I guess
most importantly,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.830
it's very unusual to have a good
higher end coffee bean made out

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.360
of robusta, and what it's like
using that rather than arabica,

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:05.180
which every other single
company I'm aware of uses.

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.690
KANE GROGAN: We use
arabica as well.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:08.440
AUDIENCE: OK, so it's
art pf of the blend.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.350
KANE GROGAN: I think Mike's--

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:11.465
MIKE BROWN: Yeah, our
roasters not here today.

00:40:11.465 --> 00:40:13.240
That's probably why we
haven't talked about it much.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.816
JEFF AYERS: If we told
you, we'd have to kill you.

00:40:14.816 --> 00:40:16.649
KANE GROGAN: We're going
to kill you anyway.

00:40:16.649 --> 00:40:18.575
MIKE BROWN: It's an
Indian Peruvian blend.

00:40:18.575 --> 00:40:20.200
So we get the robusta
beans from India.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.710
They're organic and fair trade.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.040
We're actually one of the
few companies out there

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.990
that have an organic
source for robusta.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:31.760
Most robusta you find,
it doesn't have the USDA

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.190
organic certification on it.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.450
But we have a very
good supplier.

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:40.140
We work with importers, actually
in New York here and New Jersey

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.810
and on the West
Coast, and they're

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:44.570
able to source that for us.

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:47.210
The Peruvian is also
organic fair trade.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:50.120
Our coffee is
blended post-roast,

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.330
so we don't blend the
beans and then roast them.

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:54.891
We roast them separately.

00:40:54.891 --> 00:40:56.640
So you'll see, if you
actually open a bag,

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.820
you'll see two different
shades in there because we

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:04.160
found that if you
blend it post-roast,

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.520
you'll get a fuller flavor.

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:10.760
We use Loring roasters.

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:15.350
It's almost like a giant
popcorn popper I like to say.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:17.120
There's no direct
flame on the beans

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.700
ever, so there's no scorching.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.500
If you crack our beans
open, they're roasted

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.350
uniformly straight through.

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:26.990
It's the most efficient
roaster on the market

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:29.810
right now because it
circulates the hot air,

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:32.770
so we don't waste a lot of gas.

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:36.230
There's not a lot
of exhaust either.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:39.200
It also provides
the benefit of us

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.040
not having to have
an afterburner, which

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:46.140
a lot of companies will
have, which will reduce

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.270
the environmental impact.

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:49.260
So it's the most environmentally
friendly roaster.

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:50.135
We have two of those.

00:41:50.135 --> 00:41:54.950
We have a 35 kilo and
a 70 kilo at this time.

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:57.870
TEAH TERIELE: I want to speak a
little bit on especially coffee

00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:59.010
and robusta a little bit.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:02.940
Definitely when we first
entered the coffee industry,

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.541
robusta was not highly regarded.

00:42:05.541 --> 00:42:07.290
I wouldn't say it's
highly regarded still.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:08.706
KANE GROGAN: It's
still not, yeah.

00:42:08.706 --> 00:42:11.790
TEAH TERIELE: But the SCAA,
which is the Specialty Coffee

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:14.880
Association of
America, they actually

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.970
have set up something
at all of their events

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:21.390
to compete with robusta,
and that's something

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:23.891
that I'm actually really
proud of at this point.

00:42:23.891 --> 00:42:26.140
It's cool you get to taste
robusta against each other.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:28.950
So even though it's not
necessarily like the third wave

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:34.620
light roast choice, it
definitely is its own beast

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.090
that people do love and enjoy.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:39.690
And I think it's 60%
of coffee enjoyed

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.720
is a lot of times
mixed with robusta.

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.320
MIKE BROWN: Right now, yeah,
especially because there's been

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.560
a problem with coffee rust.

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.460
And because of this,
the coffee industry

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:57.720
is starting to
make hybrid plants

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.491
with arabica and robusta,
because robusta is much more

00:43:01.491 --> 00:43:01.990
hardy.

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:03.031
TEAH TERIELE: Supposedly.

00:43:03.031 --> 00:43:05.220
MIKE BROWN: It can defend
against this coffee rust

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.980
that they were initially
thinking was going

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.080
to really raise coffee prices.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:15.710
But because they're able to
blend the two plants together,

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:16.530
it's resistant.

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:18.863
So actually, a lot of coffee
you're probably getting now

00:43:18.863 --> 00:43:21.907
that you thinks arabica
probably has some robusta in it.

00:43:21.907 --> 00:43:23.490
JEFF AYERS: There
actually are studies

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:26.160
that were just done where
scientists just cracked

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.590
the genome on robusta coffee.

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:30.730
And arabica has been out
there for about a year,

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:33.314
and so both genomes are
now completely mappable.

00:43:33.314 --> 00:43:35.730
And that's why we're getting
a lot of these hybrid plants,

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.563
which is very interesting,
because now we're

00:43:37.563 --> 00:43:41.914
going to be able to
get a new type of bean

00:43:41.914 --> 00:43:43.080
that the world's never seen.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.250
And the possibilities of
coffee are endless again.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:47.380
So it's pretty exciting.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.213
ALYSSA HARDY: I think
a lot of people just--

00:43:49.213 --> 00:43:51.570
you hear like, oh, single
origin arabica beans, you just

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:52.710
hear that from different people.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:54.630
And you think, oh, yeah,
that's the best one, right?

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:55.340
That's what I thought.

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:56.680
I was like, yeah,
that's the best.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.060
You don't know.

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.260
You just don't know
until you try it.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.780
So a lot of people just
haven't even tasted it.

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.904
TEAH TERIELE: The blind
taste tests are very funny.

00:44:01.904 --> 00:44:05.070
Especially coming from me, I
would criticize everyone's way

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:08.940
of brewing coffee,
and I was that person

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.727
until someone stuck a blind
taste test in front of me.

00:44:11.727 --> 00:44:12.810
And then who was the jerk?

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:13.840
It was me.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:14.910
KANE GROGAN: Yeah,
but the good thing--

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:16.070
MIKE BROWN: All
personal preference,

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.150
all personal preference, I
tell people that all the time.

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:19.150
KANE GROGAN: We try to--

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.050
we're like the
gateway coffee drug.

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:24.690
And I think having someone
like Teah that has really

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:26.790
been around coffee
for a long time,

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:30.127
people will buy it because
it has a gimmicky approach.

00:44:30.127 --> 00:44:32.460
It's a skull and crossbones,
"world's strongest coffee."

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.626
People are like, screw that.

00:44:33.626 --> 00:44:34.310
That's stupid.

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:37.680
The third wave coffee people
really didn't respect that.

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.560
But the modern person
and most people

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.230
don't have that palette yet.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:44.970
They don't know
what good coffee is.

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.892
So we have this thing
where-- you know,

00:44:46.892 --> 00:44:48.100
Mike worked at a coffee shop.

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.490
He was able to test every
kind of coffee he wanted.

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:53.080
Strong coffee, but he also
wanted it to taste good.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.720
And we charge a
premium price for it.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.520
It is a premium blend.

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.170
And we always try to educate.

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:01.260
And Alyssa is an amazing writer,
and she writes a lot of blogs.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.000
And Teah kind of
started that where

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.830
we educate our
customers who might

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:07.650
be Dunkin' Donuts, or
Folgers, or the Starbucks,

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:08.610
whatever is convenient.

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:10.230
And then we show them.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:12.690
This is good coffee, and
here's how you can brew it.

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:13.320
Here's Chemex.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.153
Here's French press.

00:45:14.153 --> 00:45:16.710
Here's alternative ways
to enjoy your coffee.

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:18.720
And now, a lot of our
fans that never ever

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.370
would have gotten into
that, you see them

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:23.942
with a whole station
set up and their kettles

00:45:23.942 --> 00:45:24.900
and they're doing that.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:29.670
So awesome question, but yeah,
we try to blend the two worlds.

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:30.570
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:31.600
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Who else?

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.018
I think we have
another question.

00:45:33.018 --> 00:45:34.650
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:35.970
You alluded to it earlier.

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:38.040
When you started selling
online, all of a sudden,

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.705
there were a lot of
orders coming in,

00:45:39.705 --> 00:45:41.180
and you were falling behind.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.346
I was wondering if you could
go a little bit further

00:45:43.346 --> 00:45:45.390
into how you scaled
during that process

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:47.730
in terms of vendors,
sources, and also staff.

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:49.710
How quickly did that
scale up and get you

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:51.270
back to where you needed to be?

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:54.100
MIKE BROWN: Yeah, I was
very green back then,

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.030
and I was using, I
think, ShipStation--

00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:00.090
no, I was using PayPal.

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:03.250
I had to print out
every single order,

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:08.275
and basically, I was
throwing the fire.

00:46:08.275 --> 00:46:09.150
You know what I mean?

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.810
Throwing the fire when "Good
Morning America" happened

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:17.790
where we had to produce
thousands of pounds of orders

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:18.789
all at once.

00:46:18.789 --> 00:46:20.080
And I didn't know how to do it.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:24.480
And I was operating at a level
where I could probably do maybe

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.240
50 pounds a day comfortably.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:30.810
So how quickly did that happen?

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:34.809
Two months, two
months, we starting

00:46:34.809 --> 00:46:35.850
working with ShipStation.

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:37.800
We were bulk printing
orders after that.

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.440
We bought another
computer so it wasn't just

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.810
one guy printing out the orders.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.062
Kane came on probably
three weeks into it.

00:46:48.062 --> 00:46:49.520
KANE GROGAN: Right
around the time.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:53.180
MIKE BROWN: Teah came along
a little bit afterwards.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.284
And there was five of us.

00:46:55.284 --> 00:46:56.450
KANE GROGAN: There was five.

00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:58.247
MIKE BROWN: And at the time--

00:46:58.247 --> 00:47:00.080
KANE GROGAN: This was
2013, just to give you

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.140
some reference of time.

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.070
Mike had the idea in 2011.

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:06.800
2012 we started selling.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:10.310
In March of 2013, "Good
Morning America" happened.

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:13.550
And as I said before, none
of us really had jobs.

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:17.180
We didn't know if it was going
to be a sustainable company.

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:19.640
Around June, after we got
through that whole thing,

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.700
and we realized that the
sales were still coming,

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:24.170
and maybe we're on
to something here,

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:27.440
we spent the next year making
sure that what had happened

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.710
would never happen again.

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.817
So we had flown up
to the roof, but we

00:47:30.817 --> 00:47:32.025
didn't have a foundation yet.

00:47:32.025 --> 00:47:35.150
So Mike was like, OK, let's
outsource all the stuff

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:38.170
that we can't or don't
want to do in-house.

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:40.330
And then let's start
slowly after that.

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:41.390
Start taking it back in.

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:44.785
So we immediately
made lists on paper.

00:47:44.785 --> 00:47:46.160
OK, this is what
we're doing now.

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.660
This is the process right now.

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.550
How do we either get
rid of the process,

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:53.450
have someone else do it, or how
can we do it more efficiently?

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:55.550
And so one of the
things was, OK,

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:57.790
we can outsource to a
distribution center.

00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:58.640
So we went around.

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.200
And Teah and Eric,
who's not here,

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.450
went around and just interviewed
distribution centers.

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:03.270
And that was a huge thing.

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:05.180
Now we don't have to
actually package coffee.

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:08.290
At that time, I spent anywhere
between 8 to 12 hours a day

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:10.060
packaging coffee.

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.477
And then once we figured out
how to make it sustainable,

00:48:12.477 --> 00:48:14.060
we started taking
all that stuff back.

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:16.460
And we're still
taking stuff back

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:18.830
to be able to do
everything in-house.

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:19.850
But it was a process.

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:21.590
TEAH TERIELE: Scaling is
probably one of the tougher

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:22.580
things that we've done.

00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:24.590
Mike was doing our
accounting for years.

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:26.630
I'm pretty sure he still
has his hands in it.

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:29.810
And I'm the same way with
posting on Instagram.

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:31.710
I shouldn't be
doing that anymore,

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:33.920
but we're all kind of doing it.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.980
Hiring, we did use some temp
services in the beginning,

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:40.210
and we ended up keeping
a few of those people on.

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:42.510
But yeah, scaling is impossible.

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:45.740
It's not like you can look
that up on the internet.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.074
JEFF AYERS: We're still scaling.

00:48:47.074 --> 00:48:48.781
KANE GROGAN: I think
the coolest thing is

00:48:48.781 --> 00:48:50.210
being able to attract talent.

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:51.430
That's what I was
most excited about.

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:53.138
It took a long time,
because at first, we

00:48:53.138 --> 00:48:56.122
would put a Craigslist ad
up, like we know this person.

00:48:56.122 --> 00:48:58.580
We're looking for this, but we
don't have money to pay you,

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.050
so here's a small money.

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:02.510
But it's like, it
might be bigger later.

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:04.490
And I think the
most exciting thing

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:08.420
for us right now is where we've
done multi millions of dollars

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.640
in sales, and
we're still growing

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.020
and growing and growing.

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:14.420
Being able to bring
on a Dustin, who

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.940
is an absolute beast
in everything he does,

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:18.630
and like, OK, here's a problem.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:19.310
Figure it out.

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:21.680
So he builds our entire
warehouse inventory.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.265
And then Jeff, you know
so much about broadcasting

00:49:24.265 --> 00:49:26.150
and all this, and your voice.

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:27.800
Alyssa, you're a content writer.

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.281
Do you want to come over
here and work for us?

00:49:30.281 --> 00:49:32.780
And we've been able to do that,
and we're still doing that--

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:33.855
super exciting.

00:49:33.855 --> 00:49:35.780
ALYSSA HARDY: Yeah, it's like
working for a small business.

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:37.730
Like I'm somebody that went
from working in a corporation,

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:39.635
and then was very
attracted to this.

00:49:39.635 --> 00:49:42.260
What is this small business that
seems to be doing really well?

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:43.350
What's going on over here?

00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:44.760
How can I get my
hands into that?

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.550
And I think that
as far as scaling

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:49.630
with people, as people
start to see that

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:51.892
and as we had jobs start
opening, people were like,

00:49:51.892 --> 00:49:53.600
wait, how can I get
involved in something

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.546
that's cool and small
and different than what

00:49:55.546 --> 00:49:56.420
working at the state?

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:59.650
We're in upstate New York,
so that kind of thing.

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:02.060
JEFF AYERS: And I don't think
we've even touched on this.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.680
At that point, "Good
Morning America"

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.360
you said it was a team 5.

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.524
And then that blew up,
and obviously, scaling up.

00:50:08.524 --> 00:50:10.190
And like I said, we're
still scaling up.

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:13.220
We have the largest
employee base right now,

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:14.205
and we're at 25?

00:50:14.205 --> 00:50:15.080
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: 23.

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.120
JEFF AYERS: 23, and
that's the company.

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:24.380
So doing what we do, it's still
how do we maintain that base,

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:27.530
but reach that ceiling
and not go nuts doing it?

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:29.750
So it's a journey.

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:30.470
It really is.

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:32.261
KANE GROGAN: I think
the coolest think also

00:50:32.261 --> 00:50:35.265
is being able to do what
we're passionate about.

00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:38.480
Matt, when we were having lunch,
he alluded to the 20% time,

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.030
and people being
able to have time

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:41.980
to do projects they're
passionate about.

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:44.300
And we're obviously on
a much smaller scale,

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.830
but we have a lot of things.

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:47.390
Like for instance,
Alyssa, you might

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:48.860
want to talk about the
Grind It Out campaign,

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:50.720
our first real
marketing campaign where

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.760
they had these ideas.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.740
I'll let you talk a
little more about that.

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:54.640
ALYSSA HARDY:
Yeah, so basically,

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.306
like we were talking
about our fan base,

00:50:56.306 --> 00:50:58.850
we have a lot of
nurses and firefighters

00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:01.344
and things like that that really
use the coffee to get them

00:51:01.344 --> 00:51:02.010
through the day.

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:05.300
So what we decided to do was
put together a content campaign

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:08.210
where we highlighted
those people, because we

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:12.230
felt like so many companies are
highlighting that cool athlete,

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.210
or highlighting this
super famous person.

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:16.812
But who we want to
champion is the people

00:51:16.812 --> 00:51:18.020
that are drinking our coffee.

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.730
And that might be
the nurse that's

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:24.170
in the hospital or the EMT
or all of those people.

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:27.824
So basically, it was something
where the marketing team, me,

00:51:27.824 --> 00:51:29.990
Teah, and our art director,
Thomas, were like, yeah,

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:31.740
wouldn't it be really
cool to put together

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:34.160
some videos of these people,
and blogs, and playlists,

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.480
and all this kind of stuff?

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:37.610
And Mike was like, do it.

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:40.370
So it's been able to
give us the freedom

00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:43.070
to just make creative
projects and things like that.

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:46.760
JEFF AYERS: We wanted to
showcase the greatest tagline

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.260
that you guys came up with.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:50.660
We want to showcase
how our coffee lives.

00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:54.440
And it's not just about whose
hands we can put coffee into,

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.392
it's about, like we said, it's
like you get up every morning.

00:51:57.392 --> 00:51:58.850
And you might have
a cup of coffee,

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:00.080
and then you're going
to go do something.

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:00.700
Awesome.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.440
Usually, and it's
like, OK, let's

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.592
see you do that awesome thing,
and why are you doing that?

00:52:06.592 --> 00:52:08.800
And that's where that whole
marketing idea came from.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.352
KANE GROGAN: Grind
it out, hashtag.

00:52:10.352 --> 00:52:10.890
ALYSSA HARDY: Yeah,
it's #grinditout.

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:11.500
KANE GROGAN: #grinditout.

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:12.220
DUSTIN ALEXANDER:
Yeah, grind it out.

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.420
KANE GROGAN: Everyone
can [INAUDIBLE] for after

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:13.920
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.961
ALYSSA HARDY: Yeah,
it's like we want

00:52:15.961 --> 00:52:17.960
to see everybody's grind,
because like you said,

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.170
it's how our coffee lives.

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:21.680
AUDIENCE: Well, thank you.

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:25.420
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: It really
is a powerful and amazing story

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:28.370
of the passion for
a product leading

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:30.980
to the creation of
a family, leading

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.440
to the creation of a community.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:36.800
And it's interesting
that the product itself

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.020
is sort of secondary to
all of that for you guys,

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:40.847
that really, it's
about you being

00:52:40.847 --> 00:52:42.680
able to work together,
follow your passions,

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:45.190
and continue to grow
this community out there.

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:47.480
To that respect,
please let people know

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.140
how they can find all of this.

00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.930
Where do you go to
hear the podcast?

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:52.820
Where can you check
out the coffee?

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.670
MIKE BROWN: Yeah, go
to deathwishcoffee.com.

00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:55.850
That's the easiest place.

00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:58.910
That's our content
hub for everything.

00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:01.220
You can find us on Twitter,
Instagram, and Facebook,

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:04.350
obviously, under
Death Wish Coffee.

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:06.880
The podcast lives right
off our home page.

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:11.900
So go to
deathwishcoffee.com/deathcast.

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:13.730
We're the top selling
coffee on Amazon.

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:15.710
So if you go over there
and type in "coffee,"

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:20.540
we should be under the
headline Best Seller.

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:22.515
You can buy it there,
or you can also get it

00:53:22.515 --> 00:53:23.830
on Jet.com and Walmart.com.

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:25.920
KANE GROGAN: But if you
get it on our web site,

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.530
we actually have a--

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:30.590
we're going to be in your
guys' employee discounts.

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:31.820
I think in the next quarter.

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:32.903
I worked a deal out with--

00:53:32.903 --> 00:53:34.490
I forget who was
the head of that.

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:37.180
But if you do use
discount Google,

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:41.780
you will get 20% off
whatever is on the website.

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.310
So you can share
that internally.

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:44.893
It hasn't been
announced yet, but that

00:53:44.893 --> 00:53:46.019
should be coming very soon.

00:53:46.019 --> 00:53:47.851
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
It's been announced now.

00:53:47.851 --> 00:53:48.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.640
KANE GROGAN: Was I not
supposed to say that?

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.560
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: You'll be able
to find it on the first day.

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:52.230
KANE GROGAN: He
said he was going

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:53.750
to share it around the office,
and it wasn't a big deal.

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:55.490
It just hasn't been
in the newsletter yet,

00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:56.948
so I don't think
I broke any rules.

00:53:56.948 --> 00:53:58.040
But surprise!

00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:58.610
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: We'll see.

00:53:58.610 --> 00:53:59.720
TEAH TERIELE: Also,
get off that newsletter

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.280
and get on our newsletter.

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.060
JEFF AYERS: Yeah.

00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:03.518
DUSTIN ALEXANDER:
And just to touch

00:54:03.518 --> 00:54:08.084
on the podcast location,
any Podbean, iTunes,

00:54:08.084 --> 00:54:08.750
it's everywhere.

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:12.150
JEFF AYERS: Stitcher, Google
Music, we're up there too.

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:14.420
So you can pretty
much find us anywhere.

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:16.336
And like I said, we're
getting into video too.

00:54:16.336 --> 00:54:17.720
So YouTube, we're all over that.

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:18.440
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: Facebook Live.

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.920
JEFF AYERS: All
over Facebook Live.

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.250
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Excellent.

00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:21.916
Well, thank you guys
for taking the time

00:54:21.916 --> 00:54:24.330
to come and join us and share
your amazing story with us.

00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:24.650

MIKE BROWN: Thanks

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.430
ALYSSA HARDY: Thank you.

00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:27.090
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Thanks, guys.

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:27.380
DUSTIN ALEXANDER: Thanks.

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:28.338
KANE GROGAN: Thank you.

00:54:28.338 --> 00:54:30.010
[APPLAUSE]
