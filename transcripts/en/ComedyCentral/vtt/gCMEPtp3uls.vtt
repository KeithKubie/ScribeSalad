This haircut is a disaster.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.979
You'll be hearing from
my lawyer, okay.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.814
I'm gonna shut this
entire operation down.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.250
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:17.751

I've ever seen
in my life.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.810
What would you even
call a shape like that?

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.879
Oh, I...
a circle?

I have this perm.
