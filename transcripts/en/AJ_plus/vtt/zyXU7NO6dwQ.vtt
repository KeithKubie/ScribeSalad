00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.360
Poverty has forced more than 5.7 million 
children across Latin America into child labor.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.280
And it’s causing many of them to 
drop out of school.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.000
In many major cities all across the region, 
these children often

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.760
end up working on the streets.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.520
But the streets can be dangerous and 
children are left vulnerable

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.680
to abuse, alcohol, drugs and gangs.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.600
In Peru, more than 13,000 children 
are gang members.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.760
But there is one school in Lima offering 
kids an alternative to street life –

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.240
through dance.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.200
And so far, they’ve reached 
over 100,000 children.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.800
The D1 Cultural Association was founded by 
former ballerina Vania Masías in 2005.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.400
Diego Ortega is a hip-hop instructor and 
dancer for the program.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.520
He now teaches and trains at 
their studio in Chorrillos,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.960
an upscale part of downtown Lima.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.280
But his journey with dance began 
on the streets at 16,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.240
when he started performing acrobatics 
at traffic stops.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.800
Today, D1 is divided into two parts.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.320
On one side, there is a
dance school and company.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.560
On the other, a nonprofit 
organization that offers

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.000
free dance workshops for at-risk youth.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.440
But back in 2005, it all started with 
street performers like Diego.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.800
Diego used the money he earned on the streets 
to support himself and his younger brother

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.600
after they were abandoned by their parents.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.800
But he quickly realized it was an 
unsustainable lifestyle.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.120
That’s when he decided to 
join the D1 dance program

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.880
that had recently opened a studio 
in his hometown, Pachacutec.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.520
He eventually joined D1’s professional 
dance company

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.320
and went on to win competitions 
across the country.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.520
Today, he regularly teaches free 
outreach workshops

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.280
at the same studio where he got his start.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.160
The goal of the workshops is to provide 
students with an alternative

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.840
to street gangs, featuring role models 
from their own communities.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.880
Like Diego, students who attend the workshops 
have the opportunity

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.880
to audition for the D1 dance company.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.160
But the focus isn’t just teaching dance.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.160
The D1 program wants to empower students 
and give them an artistic outlet.
