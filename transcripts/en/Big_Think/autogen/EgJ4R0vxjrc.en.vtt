so game theory is as the science of
 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.350
so game theory is as the science of
strategic thinking the idea here is that

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360
strategic thinking the idea here is that
 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.120
strategic thinking the idea here is that
anytime that you're interacting with

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.130
anytime that you're interacting with
 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.280
anytime that you're interacting with
another person who has their own

trying to do the best you can given what
 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.330
trying to do the best you can given what
you want and so you're interacting in a

you want and so you're interacting in a
 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.910
you want and so you're interacting in a
strategic situation one of you is trying

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920
strategic situation one of you is trying
 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.800

you can break up that interaction into a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080
you can break up that interaction into a
 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.620
you can break up that interaction into a
bunch of little small interactions where

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630
bunch of little small interactions where
 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.230
bunch of little small interactions where
you can cooperate with the other one but

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240
you can cooperate with the other one but
 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.120
you can cooperate with the other one but
just on condition that the other one

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130
just on condition that the other one
 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.910
just on condition that the other one
cooperated with you before you can

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920
cooperated with you before you can
 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.610
cooperated with you before you can
change a bad social dilemma into a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620
change a bad social dilemma into a
 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.819
change a bad social dilemma into a
positive interaction this was put to its

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829
positive interaction this was put to its
 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:15.309
positive interaction this was put to its
biggest

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319
biggest
 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.949

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.849
and Gorbachev negotiated the START
treaty with one another and one of the

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:21.859
treaty with one another and one of the
 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.949
treaty with one another and one of the
big problems that they had is how can

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959
big problems that they had is how can
 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.690
big problems that they had is how can
you be sure that while you're

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700
you be sure that while you're
 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.429
you be sure that while you're
eliminating nuclear weapons your

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439
eliminating nuclear weapons your
 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.470
eliminating nuclear weapons your
adversary is also eliminating nuclear

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480
adversary is also eliminating nuclear
 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.929
adversary is also eliminating nuclear
weapons so rather than saying we're just

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939
weapons so rather than saying we're just
 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.099
weapons so rather than saying we're just
going to get rid of some large

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109
going to get rid of some large
 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.720
going to get rid of some large
percentage of our nuclear weapons and

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730
percentage of our nuclear weapons and
 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.300
percentage of our nuclear weapons and
hope that that the USSR would do so as

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310
hope that that the USSR would do so as
 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.970
hope that that the USSR would do so as
well they broke up the interaction into

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980
well they broke up the interaction into
 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.679
well they broke up the interaction into
a bunch of little tiny ones

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689
a bunch of little tiny ones
 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.199
a bunch of little tiny ones
so the USSR would eliminate just a few

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209
so the USSR would eliminate just a few
 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.819
so the USSR would eliminate just a few
nuclear weapons then the US would

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829
nuclear weapons then the US would
 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.440
nuclear weapons then the US would
eliminate just a few nuclear weapons

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450
eliminate just a few nuclear weapons
 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.539
eliminate just a few nuclear weapons
they would check and then they would go

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549
they would check and then they would go
 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.490
they would check and then they would go
on to the next stage and then each would

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500
on to the next stage and then each would
 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.470
on to the next stage and then each would
eliminate a few more and they'd go on to

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480
eliminate a few more and they'd go on to
 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.920
eliminate a few more and they'd go on to
the next stage this process of taking a

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930
the next stage this process of taking a
 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.539
the next stage this process of taking a
big interaction and breaking it down

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549
big interaction and breaking it down
 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.640
big interaction and breaking it down
into little small parts is one that we

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650
into little small parts is one that we
 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.189
into little small parts is one that we
can use all over our lives including in

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:03.199
can use all over our lives including in
 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.819
can use all over our lives including in
parenting

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829
parenting
 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.670
parenting
so rather than mom or dad coming into

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680
so rather than mom or dad coming into
 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.369
so rather than mom or dad coming into
the room and saying to the kids clean up

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379
the room and saying to the kids clean up
 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.890
the room and saying to the kids clean up
the room and then leaving mom and dad

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900
the room and then leaving mom and dad
 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.839
the room and then leaving mom and dad
can come up and say here's the deal each

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849
can come up and say here's the deal each
 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.059
can come up and say here's the deal each
of you take turns putting away one toy

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069
of you take turns putting away one toy
 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.159
of you take turns putting away one toy
and you make a deal with one another if

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169
and you make a deal with one another if
 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.559
and you make a deal with one another if
you put away your toy I'll put away mine

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569
you put away your toy I'll put away mine
 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.899
you put away your toy I'll put away mine
and by taking the big interaction

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909
and by taking the big interaction
 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.030
and by taking the big interaction
cleaning up the room and breaking it

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040
cleaning up the room and breaking it
 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.219
cleaning up the room and breaking it
into a series of small interactions you

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:27.229
into a series of small interactions you
 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:28.990
into a series of small interactions you
make it feasible for the kids to

offshore the danger here is that if we

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709
offshore the danger here is that if we
 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.559
offshore the danger here is that if we
lower our corporate tax rate then

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569
lower our corporate tax rate then
 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:03.999
lower our corporate tax rate then
another country might lower their

another country might lower their
