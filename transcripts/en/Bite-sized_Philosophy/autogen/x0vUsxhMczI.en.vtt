00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.080
 The best way to teach people how to think critically 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.580
 Is by teaching them to write 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.420
 I have written an article on the method of writing online 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.920
 And I raised it in the name of Rubrik to write articles "rubric for essay writing" 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.460
 "Students are asked whether they are in a location or not" 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.420
 This article takes you through the steps of writing 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.260
 Because what is happening now is that it is difficult to teach people how to write 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.840
 Because that is time-consuming 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.260
 The correction of the excellent article is very easy to put the mark right next to the full mark 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.700
 But correct the bad article, my God wrong words, wrong phrases and wrong sentences are not properly arranged in the piece 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.940
 The pieces are unconnected and the whole article has no meaning 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.080
 So trying to tell the owner of the article errors is like you are telling him the whole article is wrong 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.200
 This article was previously published under Q210586 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.440
 But saying this will never help 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.500
 But you have to find the few things they wrote correctly and then teach them to write it wrong 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.540
 This is very expensive and expensive 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.720
 So I have done in this article "Rubrik" 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.780
 This article has been written by the production process rather than by the ratings and grades 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.680
 The best thing you can do is teach people to write 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.340
 Because there is no difference between them and thinking 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.800
 And one of the things that kill me and do the universities 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.920
 Is that no one tells students why they have to write something 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.100
 But only say: You must do this duty. Why are you writing ? Because you need it to get a degree 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.340
 This is wrong because you need to teach you to think 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.780
 Thinking makes you active and effective in the world 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.300
 Thinking makes you win in the debates you are having and which may be in favor of good things 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.820
 If you can think, speak and write 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.020
 You are definitely dead and nothing can stand in your way 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.140
 That's why you learn to write 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.040
 Writing is the most powerful weapon that can be supplied to one 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.180
 I know a lot of people who were amazingly successful and watched them throughout my life 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.280
 These people did not want to have any discussion against them 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900
 Because they will cut you to pieces 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.180
 But not in a malicious way 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.380
 But when they show their point while you are viewing your point 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.780
 It is best to display your points regularly 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.100
 Otherwise it will appear stupid and you really are 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.240
 It will not reach anywhere 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.820
 If you can formulate your argument in a coherent way then make an offer if you can then talk to people 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.320
 Then if you can write a thesis, my God, people will give you money and opportunities 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.240
 Will possess the ability to influence 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.900
 This is why you are at university 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.040
 You are in the English section is not it 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.900
 Yes you teach people how to speak clearly 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.380
 This is the most dangerous thing you can have 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.640
 This is a catalyst if people know about it 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.600
 When they say why you learn to write, you will say: 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.900
 Here's your sword and here's your M16 and here's your bulletproof jacket 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.980
 And you learn how to use them 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.340
 But I have an unending mystery which is why I do not think of writing in this way automatically 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.400
 This can lead you to madness when you try to find out why 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.420
 It is as if there is a conspiracy to bring people into an education system to make them weaker 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.740
 Thus reducing the number of competitors 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.980
 Perhaps this is one way to think about why, when your students are idiots and idiots they will not challenge you
