00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.150
 
I think in terms of today's China that

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160
I think in terms of today's China that
 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.510
I think in terms of today's China that
the Cultural Revolution was both a

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520
the Cultural Revolution was both a
 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.939
the Cultural Revolution was both a
terrible time for a lot of the people

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949
terrible time for a lot of the people
 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.589
terrible time for a lot of the people
who experienced it but I think it has

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599
who experienced it but I think it has
 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.929
who experienced it but I think it has
set the stage for China to really be

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939
set the stage for China to really be
 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.840
set the stage for China to really be
able to change in such a quick fashion

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850
able to change in such a quick fashion
 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:42.800
able to change in such a quick fashion
that by this desire to create a new kind

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:42.810
that by this desire to create a new kind
 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.950
that by this desire to create a new kind
of modern-day china by getting rid of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960
of modern-day china by getting rid of
 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.500
of modern-day china by getting rid of
the feudal system I think what it did

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
the feudal system I think what it did
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.480
the feudal system I think what it did
was it freed up chinese society to be

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490
was it freed up chinese society to be
 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.780
was it freed up chinese society to be
able to adapt so much quicker to the

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790
able to adapt so much quicker to the
 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.990
able to adapt so much quicker to the
demands of today and so i would say that

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
demands of today and so i would say that
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.640
demands of today and so i would say that
if we were to look at the chinese

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650
if we were to look at the chinese
 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.800
if we were to look at the chinese
situation that it would really be the

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810
situation that it would really be the
 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.630
situation that it would really be the
Cultural Revolution at ten year period

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
Cultural Revolution at ten year period
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.390
Cultural Revolution at ten year period
from 66 to 76 as the major catalyst for

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
from 66 to 76 as the major catalyst for
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.130
from 66 to 76 as the major catalyst for
what we see as being success in China's

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140
what we see as being success in China's
 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.899
what we see as being success in China's
kind of post-industrial inflation

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909
 
 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.120
 
mainland China has always been a very

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
mainland China has always been a very
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.149
mainland China has always been a very
strong attachment to being Chinese but I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159
strong attachment to being Chinese but I
 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.140
strong attachment to being Chinese but I
think it's almost an irony that the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150
think it's almost an irony that the
 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.350
think it's almost an irony that the
societies that we might call a belonging

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
societies that we might call a belonging
 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.110
societies that we might call a belonging
or belong that belonged to greater china

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120
or belong that belonged to greater china
 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.660
or belong that belonged to greater china
like Taiwan and Hong Kong and even

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
like Taiwan and Hong Kong and even
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.600
like Taiwan and Hong Kong and even
Singapore I think that they have an even

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
Singapore I think that they have an even
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.350
Singapore I think that they have an even
stronger attachment to being Chinese and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
stronger attachment to being Chinese and
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.300
stronger attachment to being Chinese and
in that way have often replicated or

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310
in that way have often replicated or
 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.039
in that way have often replicated or
created the circumstances for the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049
created the circumstances for the
 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.260
created the circumstances for the
continuation of traditions in a way that

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270
continuation of traditions in a way that
 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.830
continuation of traditions in a way that
we don't see today in mainland China so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
we don't see today in mainland China so
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.590
we don't see today in mainland China so
being Chinese i think has many different

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600
being Chinese i think has many different
 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.320
being Chinese i think has many different
layers to it depending on whether you're

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
layers to it depending on whether you're
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.839
layers to it depending on whether you're
in mainland china or whether you're even

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849
in mainland china or whether you're even
 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.390
in mainland china or whether you're even
here in New York it's a very complex

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400
here in New York it's a very complex
 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.230
here in New York it's a very complex
thing but there is a sense

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240
thing but there is a sense
 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.500
thing but there is a sense
ever of being Chinese as belonging or

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
ever of being Chinese as belonging or
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.930
ever of being Chinese as belonging or
having a kind of strong attachment to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940
having a kind of strong attachment to
 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.270
having a kind of strong attachment to
mainland China as a place even if it's

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280
mainland China as a place even if it's
 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:35.070
mainland China as a place even if it's
an imaginary place I think that the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080
an imaginary place I think that the
 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.490
an imaginary place I think that the
world doesn't understand that most

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500
world doesn't understand that most
 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.050
world doesn't understand that most
Chinese people feel that the last 200

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060
Chinese people feel that the last 200
 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.710
Chinese people feel that the last 200
years of Chinese history have been a

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720
years of Chinese history have been a
 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.650
years of Chinese history have been a
terrible kind of moment in Chinese

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660
terrible kind of moment in Chinese
 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.330
terrible kind of moment in Chinese
history that Chinese people have a long

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340
history that Chinese people have a long
 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.070
history that Chinese people have a long
have a strong understanding of their

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080
have a strong understanding of their
 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.620
have a strong understanding of their
five thousand year history and in fact

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630
five thousand year history and in fact
 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.670
five thousand year history and in fact
if anything many young people talk about

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680
if anything many young people talk about
 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.160
if anything many young people talk about
today's China now and the future as

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170
today's China now and the future as
 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.780
today's China now and the future as
being a renaissance of Chinese culture

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790
being a renaissance of Chinese culture
 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.060
being a renaissance of Chinese culture
and Chinese history that this might in

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070
and Chinese history that this might in
 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.250
and Chinese history that this might in
fact the 21st century might be the new

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260
fact the 21st century might be the new
 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.410
fact the 21st century might be the new
tongue dynasty and the tang dynasty was

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420
tongue dynasty and the tang dynasty was
 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.320
tongue dynasty and the tang dynasty was
when most people think of as the height

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330
when most people think of as the height
 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.900
when most people think of as the height
of Chinese civilization so I think that

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910
of Chinese civilization so I think that
 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.560
of Chinese civilization so I think that
that's really what people maybe don't

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570
that's really what people maybe don't
 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.680
that's really what people maybe don't
quite understand is that it's not just

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690
quite understand is that it's not just
 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.610
quite understand is that it's not just
about economy and getting wealthy for

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620
about economy and getting wealthy for
 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.160
about economy and getting wealthy for
Chinese people it's also about this huge

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170
Chinese people it's also about this huge
 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.410
Chinese people it's also about this huge
kind of sense of cultural pride that

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420
kind of sense of cultural pride that
 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.800
kind of sense of cultural pride that
they want China to succeed

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810
 
 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:55.120
 
I think that China has recognized that

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130
I think that China has recognized that
 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.580
I think that China has recognized that
the United States is very important to

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590
the United States is very important to
 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.059
the United States is very important to
their future and I think that they

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069
their future and I think that they
 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.059
their future and I think that they
acknowledged it in all sorts of ways but

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069
acknowledged it in all sorts of ways but
 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.690
acknowledged it in all sorts of ways but
I think that we also i'm in china

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700
I think that we also i'm in china
 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.080
I think that we also i'm in china
sailfin the leadership in china has to

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090
sailfin the leadership in china has to
 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.559
sailfin the leadership in china has to
also recognize the importance of the

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569
also recognize the importance of the
 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.629
also recognize the importance of the
environment in its policies and you know

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639
environment in its policies and you know
 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.790
environment in its policies and you know
I often hear advocates of Chinese the

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800
I often hear advocates of Chinese the
 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.860
I often hear advocates of Chinese the
Chinese government say when they talk

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870
Chinese government say when they talk
 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.440
Chinese government say when they talk
about the environment that they use the

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450
about the environment that they use the
 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.540
about the environment that they use the
analogy that you know all the first

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550
analogy that you know all the first
 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.960
analogy that you know all the first
world nations have developed and ruined

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970
world nations have developed and ruined
 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.120
world nations have developed and ruined
their environment and it's almost like a

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130
their environment and it's almost like a
 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.600
their environment and it's almost like a
room of smokers where the China comes in

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610
room of smokers where the China comes in
 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.240
room of smokers where the China comes in
and they all say you can't smoke meaning

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250
and they all say you can't smoke meaning
 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.790
and they all say you can't smoke meaning
the analogy being that of course all of

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800
the analogy being that of course all of
 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.140
the analogy being that of course all of
the first world nations have already

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150
the first world nations have already
 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.090
the first world nations have already
developed and they don't they want to

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100
developed and they don't they want to
 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.870
developed and they don't they want to
somehow hinder China from smoking or if

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880
somehow hinder China from smoking or if
 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.969
somehow hinder China from smoking or if
the if you push the analogy further in

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979
the if you push the analogy further in
 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.850
the if you push the analogy further in
terms of in terms of actually developing

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860
terms of in terms of actually developing
 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.380
terms of in terms of actually developing
and I think that that and some in the

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390
and I think that that and some in the
 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.730
and I think that that and some in the
Chinese government recognized this

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740
Chinese government recognized this
 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.250
Chinese government recognized this
already but I think that this will be

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260
already but I think that this will be
 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.290
already but I think that this will be
really something that will affect the

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300
really something that will affect the
 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.880
really something that will affect the
future of not just China of course

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890
future of not just China of course
 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.910
future of not just China of course
because of its size
