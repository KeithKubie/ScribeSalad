00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
I’ve invited you all here today because
I wanted to talk to you about some

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.000
ugly stereotypes that are going around.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.749
I’ve been hearing a lot of unfair, unseemly, and
unscientific generalizations being made lately.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.040
And they mostly have to do with sex. And your hormones.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.020
People have a nasty habit of equating “hormones”
with a particular set of behaviors and conditions,

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.000
most of which have to do with reproduction,
or sexual development, or acts that include

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.700
what my brother John has referred to as “skoodilypooping.”

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.859
For example, people will say that “hormones”
are why Kevin has zits, and is being all moody,

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.909
or why Hannah, who’s three months pregnant,
just cried watching a commercial for car insurance

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:33.300
-- which, let’s be honest, I do that too.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.040
Now, I’m not saying that hormones aren’t
at the root of sexual attraction, or zits,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.040
or occasional bouts of extreme emotion, because
they are. That’s just not all that they do.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.020
Not even close.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.260
When people talk about “hormones” in
the contexts that I just mentioned,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.140
what really they mean is "sex hormones."

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.300
But sex hormones are just one kind of hormone
that you have coursing through your body right now.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.250
In fact, there are at least 50 different types
of these chemical messengers at work in your

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.750
body at this very minute, but only a very few
of them have anything at all to do with sex.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.680
The truth is, from birth to death, just about
every cell and function in your body is under

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.770
your hormones’ constant influence.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.220
They’re floating through your blood, regulating
your metabolism, your sleep cycle, your response

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.640
to stress, and the general and incredibly important
overall homeostasis that keeps you not dead.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.200
Some hormones are just there to make other
hormones trigger even more hormones -- in

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.390
a kind of chemical relay race that biologists
refer to, rather elegantly, as “cascades.”

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.230
These hormones run through you no matter what
your mood is, or whether you have zits.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.310
So the reality is: We’re all hormonal ... all
of the time.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.620
OK, to begin to understand our hormones -- and
the endocrine system that produces, releases,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.240
and re-absorbs them -- we have to step back
and take a broad view.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.640
Not just by emphasizing that sex hormones aren’t
the only hormones you have -- but also by

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.240
looking at how your hormones interact with
your other organ systems.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.610
Because, if anything, your body has two bosses
-- two complementary systems that are constantly

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.570
shouting instructions over each other, to
all of your bits and pieces.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.280
Both your endocrine system and your nervous
system are constantly trafficking information

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.140
around your corpus, gathering intel, making
demands, controlling your every move. They

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.460
just have totally different ways of doing
it.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.000
Your nervous system uses lightning-fast
electrochemical action potentials,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.060
delivered by an expressway made of
neurons to specific cells and organs.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.140
But your endocrine system prefers a slower,
wider stream of data.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.920
It secretes hormones that travel through your
blood -- NOT through neurons -- so they move more

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.160
slowly, but they also produce widespread effects
that last a whole lot longer than an action potential.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.990
Now, compared to your heart or brain or other,
arguably more glamorous organs, your endocrine

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.980
system’s organs and glands are kinda small
and lumpy.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.160
They’re also rogues -- instead of being all
nestled together like in your other organ systems,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.980
these guys are scattered all over the place, from your
brain to your throat, to your kidneys, to your genitals.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.720
A gland is a just any structure that makes
and secretes a hormone. And the master gland

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.810
in your body is the pituitary, which produces
many hormones that signal other glands -- like

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.430
the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal
glands -- to make their own hormones.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.680
The endocrine system also includes a few organs
-- like the gonads, the pancreas, and the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.290
placenta in pregnant women -- all of which
have some other non-hormonal functions and

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.900
are made up of multiple tissue types.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.970
And technically the hypothalamus in your brain
is in the endocrine club too, since in addition

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.630
to all of its busy brain duties, it does produce
and release hormones.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.660
So, thanks to these glands and organs, you’ve got
all these hormones diffusing through your blood,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.620
doing all sorts of different things, but the thing to
remember about them is that a hormone can only

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.819
trigger a reaction in specific cells -- their so-called
target cells -- that have the right receptors for it.

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.870
So, just like some keys can open many locks,
while others only work with one, so too can

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.720
the hormone-target-cell relationship either
be widespread or localized.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.920
You’re probably gonna want an example of
that. So, your thyroid -- at the bottom of

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.240
your throat -- produces the hormone thyroxine,
which stimulates metabolism and binds to receptors

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.069
in most of the cells in your body.

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.469
But your pituitary -- which is nestled all
comfy under your brain -- produces follicle-stimulating

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:13.089
hormone, which helps regulate growth and triggers
sexual maturity, and it only targets specific

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:14.969
cells in the ovaries and testes.

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.069
So how do hormones bind to their target cells?

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.660
Well, chemically, most hormones are either
made of amino acids -- including their more

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.080
complex structures like peptides or proteins
-- or they’re derived from lipids, like cholesterol.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.220
And this is key, because a hormone’s chemical
structure determines if it’s water soluble,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.780
like most amino acid-based ones are, or lipid
soluble, like steroids are.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.850
Solubility is important because your cell
membranes are made of lipids.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.800
That means that water soluble ones can’t
get across them. So target cells for those

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.400
kinds of hormones have receptors for them
on the outside of their membranes.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.980
Lipid-soluble hormones, on the other hand,
can just basically glide right through that

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.400
cell membrane, so their receptor sites are
inside their target cells.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.520
Either way, when a target cell is activated,
the hormone alters its activity, by either

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.720
increasing or decreasing some of its functions
-- usually with the goal of maintaining your

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.820
body’s homeostasis in one way or another.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.600
So, if hormones are keeping your body IN balance,
what’s putting your body out of balance?

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.100
I don’t know -- could I interest you in
some pie?

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.100
If you have a couple of nice, generous helpings
of strawberry-rhubarb pie -- and just to make

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.660
things interesting, let’s say they’re a la mode --
your blood glucose level is gonna go through the roof.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.220
And the pancreas regulates your blood sugar by
releasing two different hormones -- insulin and

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.840
glucagon. Once you have a belly full of that pie,
beta cells in your pancreas release insulin, which

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.169
helps lower your blood sugar by increasing
the rate at which your cells store the sugar

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.820
either as glycogen or as fat for later use.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.760
Now, let’s say you’ve done the opposite:
You’ve eaten no pie -- you’re pie-less

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.960
-- in fact, you’ve eaten nothing for hours.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.760
If your blood sugar drops too low, then alpha
cells in the pancreas will instead send out

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.240
glucagon, which helps raise your blood sugar
levels, in part by decreasing the storage

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.950
of sugar in your cells, and triggering their
release of glucose back into the blood.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.240
Lots of different endocrine-related illnesses
-- like diabetes or hyperthyroidism -- tend

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.880
to be the result of either hyper (too much)
or hypo (too little) secretion of certain

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.780
hormones, which throw your homeostasis off
balance.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.660
But there are lots of more common -- and less
obvious -- ways your hormones can get out

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.580
of balance, not because of some disorder,
but because these signaling chemicals are

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.000
just caught up in a chain reaction, which
can take a while to subside.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.780
Some hormones just exist to control other
hormones, which in turn control still more hormones.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.139
So as soon as one starts to trickle out, you can
pretty quickly wind up with a cascade on your hands.

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:28.300
You’ve got a few different hormone cascades
going on at any given moment, but one of the

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.360
big ones -- one that’s really worth understanding
-- is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.500
or the HPA axis, because you don’t want
to have to say that every time.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.180
This is a complex series of interactions between
three glands that ultimately regulates lots

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:47.040
of your body’s daily processes, like digestion, sexuality,
immune response, and how you handle stress.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.130
And it’s complex not just because of all
the glands involved -- it’s also one of

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.320
the more crucial instances of your endocrine
system coordinating with your nervous system.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.270
Specifically, it’s behind that fight-or-flight
response that everybody keeps talking about.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.500
The HPA Axis is essentially the endocrine system’s
companion to the sympathetic nervous system.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.490
The sympathetic system, in times of high stress,
does things like speed up your heart rate

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.470
and direct blood away from the digestive organs
and to the muscles.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.950
But many of the other effects of the stress
response are carried out by your endocrine

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.160
system. And getting your nervous and endocrine
systems to work together in times of crisis

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.840
is where the hypothalamus comes in.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.240
It’s the hub of where the two systems meet
-- it keeps tabs on what’s going on all

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.250
over your body, analyzing your blood for signs
that something might be off.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:31.300
So, let’s revisit our fight-or-flight scene from a few
lessons ago -- the old Burning House Scenario.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.980
So you’re sleeping, dreaming about petting pandas with
Emma Watson or whatever, when the smoke alarm

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:41.580
goes off. Well, action potentials in your brain trigger
neurons in your hypothalamus to release the peptide

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.539
hormone CRH, or corticotropin releasing hormone.

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:48.659
The CRH makes the very short trip through
the bloodstream to the anterior pituitary

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.660
gland, where, because it’s water soluble, it
binds to receptors on the outside of its target cells.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:59.160
There, it triggers the release of adrenocorticotropic
hormone, or ACTH. The ACTH travels -- again

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.880
through the bloodstream -- to the adrenal cortices
of the adrenal glands on top of your kidneys.

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:08.669
When the ACTH binds to receptors on cells
in an adrenal cortex, it triggers the release

00:08:08.669 --> 00:08:14.140
of a frenzy of different freak-out compounds known
as glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid hormones.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.720
Typically these guys help us deal with day-to-day stress
by keeping our blood sugar and blood pressure

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.300
balanced. But under major stress -- like waking up
in a burning building stress -- these hormones,

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.860
like cortisol, cause the classic fight-or-flight
response: ramping up your blood pressure,

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.910
dumping glucose into your bloodstream, shutting
down non-emergency services like your immune

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.729
system and sperm and egg development.

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:37.029
And guess what? Now that all these stress
hormones are pulsing through your blood, the

00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:39.020
hypothalamus back in the brain senses them.

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:43.839
And because its job is to monitor and maintain
balance whenever possible, it then stops secreting

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:48.579
CRH, which -- eventually -- causes the other
glands to stop secreting their panic hormones.

00:08:48.579 --> 00:08:52.309
Now, because this element of the stress response
is hormonal rather than electrical, it comes

00:08:52.309 --> 00:08:57.110
on more slowly than the nervous system part,
and it takes longer to subside, too, as those

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.650
stress hormones linger in the blood before
being broken down by enzymes.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:05.660
So. We’re a long way from teenage crushes and zits
and crying over commercials at this point, aren’t we?

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.670
As a life-long owner of hormones, I hope you’ll
join me in dispelling the stereotypes that

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:14.750
surround these powerful and important chemicals,
and give them the respect they rightly deserve.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.819
Today we looked at the endocrine system, and
how it uses glands to produce hormones. These

00:09:18.819 --> 00:09:24.129
hormones are either amino-acid based and water
soluble, or steroidal and lipid-soluble, and

00:09:24.129 --> 00:09:28.839
may target many types of cells or just turn
on specific ones. We also touched on hormone

00:09:28.839 --> 00:09:32.239
cascades, and how the HPA axis effects your
stress response.
