LYNNE COX: Hi.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.190
Good afternoon.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.190
I'm Lynne Cox and I'm
really happy to be

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.470
here with you at Google.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.170
As a background for the book
that I've written and you're

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.740
reading or finding out about,
I'm an open water swimmer.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.300
I started my career when I was
14 years old by swimming

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.280
across the Catalina Channel.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.910
When I was 15 years old, I
swam across the English

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.100
Channel and broke all records
for men and women.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.850
My time was broken by a man
named David Hart from

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.710
Massachusetts.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.170
So the following year, I went
back and broke his time and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.140
swam three miles further
than the first time.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.850
So the second time I did
it, I swam 33 miles.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.070
There are many people who swim
across the English Channel and

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.210
they go back again and again.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.700
And sometimes, there are
swimmers that swim 25, or 30,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.220
or 50 times even.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.600
And I decided that I didn't
want to continue to do the

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.060
same thing over and
over again.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.580
So I set the goal of swimming
across Cook Straits in a

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.220
straight line between
the North and South

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.010
Island of New Zealand.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.150
The distance is 10 miles.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.840
And I figured that I would swim
this crossing in five

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.350
hours and try to be the first
woman to do that swim.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.900
Well instead of reaching this
point after five hours, I

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.070
realized from my crew that we'd
been going backwards for

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.920
five hours and that was
kind of discouraging.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.460
But the cool thing is that there
was a radio announcer on

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.030
board the boat who was giving
up-to-date weather information

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.650
and also he was telling
the people throughout

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.070
Christchurch, New Zealand and
Wellington about the swim.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.820
And so people throughout the
country started calling in to

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.050
the boat and wishing me well.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.940
And then Air New Zealand got
involved and started relaying

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.320
weather information to us.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.890
And I kept swimming seven hours
into the swim, eight

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.610
hours into the swim.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.110
And there was a cross-channel
ferry that came out and raised

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.290
the American flag.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.460
And all the people on board
the boat came out

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.970
and cheered me on.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.940
And I realized that
guilt was a really

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.720
big motivating factor.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.590
And I kept swimming for more
hours and had the support of

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.740
the people from all over New
Zealand by the end the swim.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.470
And when the swim was completed
after 12 hours and 2

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.120
and 1/2 minutes, we went back
by boat to the North Island

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.750
and the boat almost sank a
couple times because the water

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.020
was so rough.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.380
Finally, the next day, as
celebration for the swim,

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.920
church bells were rung
throughout the country.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.020
And I realized then that a swim
that I did could be more

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.900
than just an athletic event.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.220
That it could be something
that might

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.620
bring people together.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.360
So in 1976, I started trying
to get permission to swim

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.180
across the Bering Strait.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.630
And it took 11 years.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.270
I wrote to Brezhnev, Chernenko,
Andropov.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.340
And finally Gorbachev gave
approval for this swim

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.640
basically a day before or a
couple days before this swim.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.440
But they had moved ships from
the South China Sea into the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.650
Bering Strait.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.130
And they spent pretty much a
million dollars on the event

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.780
and opened the border for the
first time in 48 years.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.880
And when Reagan and Gorbachev
were signing the peace treaty,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.850
the INF missile treaty,
Gorbachev stood up and toasted

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.910
the swim and said it showed how
close to each other the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.190
two countries are.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.940
In a straight line, it's only
2.7 miles from Little Diomede

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.040
in the United States to Big
Diomede in the Soviet Union.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.220
And it took me two hours
and six minutes.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.370
And I swam in 42 degree water,
that dropped to 38 degree, in

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.240
a swimsuit, cap, and goggles.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.240
And so when Gorbachev made the
toast, President Reagan

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.870
toasted him back.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.630
And then they signed the INF
missile treaty and basically

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.090
helped to open the border and
diminish tensions between the

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.600
two countries.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.670
After that, I went on to do
other really challenging swims

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.250
and in progressively colder
and colder waters.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.820
There was a group of scientists
at UC Santa Barbara

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.280
who were studying me when I was
there at college, trying

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.430
to figure out how I acclimated
to the cold water.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.350
And then there was a professor
and a medical doctor named Dr.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.740
Liam Keating, who was the
world's expert on hypothermia,

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.710
who started researching me and
asking me if I'd come to

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.690
London to be part of their
research study.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.990
So from these scientists, I was
able to really learn how

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.840
to push further, and acclimate
to the cold, and go into

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.940
colder and colder waters.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.790
In 2002, I swam 1.22 miles in 32
degrees from "Orlova," the

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.080
ship, to the shores
of Antarctica.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.970
And at the end of the swim,
there were flocks of penguins

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.110
that jumped into the water and
swam out to meet us and then

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.210
went into shore with us.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.070
And you could see them just
dolphining through the water.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.720
And then you can see them in
the water because the water

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.780
was so clear, it was like
looking through the sky.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.640
But it was so cold, that it felt
like it was like swimming

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.420
through slush.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.640
I swam for 25 minutes in
32 degree water and

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.500
succeeded on that swim.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.740
And then I've written now--

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.280
this actually is
my fifth book.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.870
My first book was called
"Swimming to Antarctica." And

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.820
it was about a lot of those
swims and a lot more, about

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.320
the adventures, about the
people, about what you learn

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.340
on these different journeys.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.230
And then I went on to write a
book called "Grayson." And

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.930
that was about a baby gray whale
that got lost off the

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.700
coast of Seal Beach while I
was training to swim the

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.890
Catalina Channel the
second time.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.530
And that book was a best seller,
as was "Swimming to

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.430
Antarctica." And "Grayson"
is now

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.680
translated into 20 languages.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.000
My third book was "South with
the Sun." And it's about polar

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.580
exploration and Amundsen, who
was the first man to reach the

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.860
South Pole.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.830
And I wrote about him because
I was so inspired by him.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.820
But I think that as athletes
and as people who read and

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.840
people who have traveled, we're
adventures and we're

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.990
exploring our limits and
we're exploring the

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.250
possibilities of life.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.800
And so I really felt it was
so important to be able to

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.060
incorporate Amundsen's journey
with who mentored him, and who

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.540
he mentored, and then to follow
the course of his

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.310
journey and do certain
swims along the way.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.910
So I swam off of Greenland.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.340
The water temperature there was
28.8 and dropped to 26.6,

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.900
in a swimsuit, cap,
and goggles.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.770
I just swam a quarter
of mile for five

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.750
minutes and 10 seconds.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.800
But that was as far as
I'd ever gone before.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.870
And the idea was that I'd go
back home to train for another

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.370
month and then went back to
swim in Baffin Island.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.950
And it was really wild to go
there because when you land

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.740
there by plane--

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.250
I had a crew member with me.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.060
We landed in July and we had to
wait seven days for the ice

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.400
to break for me to be
able to do the swim.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.980
So we swam between the broken
ice, and the water was

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.660
primarily 28.8 degrees, and I
swam a mile in swimsuit, cap,

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.580
and goggles.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.330
Part of this was still for the
research and to look at how

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.260
you could acclimate to the cold,
but also survival and

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.640
better ways of rewarming
after cold exposure.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.640
I did a number of other
swims after that.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.840
And then decided that I really
needed to write a book for

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.045
open water swimming people,
people that were triathletes,

00:07:19.045 --> 00:07:22.030
or runners, or cyclists, or
paddlers, or people who were

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.950
going into the open water.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.920
Because I felt like through all
these years, now 40 years

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.470
of doing these different swims,
that there was a wealth

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.570
of information that had been
given to me by people who were

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:39.450
elite athletes, from runners,
to swimmers, to astronauts.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.450
And so I decided that I really
needed to write this open

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.670
water swimming manual to be able
to give people access to

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.570
that information.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.130
But in writing the book, I
also realized that it was

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.230
really important to continue
to go out and ask experts

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.770
stuff I didn't know, that
would make the book more

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:57.850
interesting.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.770
And what I also wanted to do
is incorporate anecdotes so

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.490
that the story would be really
readable and that you would

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.880
get lots of information, but you
enjoy it as you read it.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.870
Recently, I think a couple weeks
ago, Michael Bamberger,

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.760
who's a senior editor for
"Sports Illustrated" did a

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.170
review on the book and basically
said it was a great

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.150
summer read, in addition to
being a great book that is

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.780
like Jim Fixx's book, who wrote
about "The Complete Book

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.690
of Running."

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.770
So he sort of sees this
whole era now as the

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:28.920
next running era.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.500
The slimming has taken over in
terms of people wanting to go

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.820
into the open water and swim.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.500
People who are older athletes,
who are sort of beaten up by

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.770
their sport and now want to try
something new or people

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.610
who have done their sport for
a long time and just really

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.820
want the challenge of swimming
in the open water.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.400
One of the things that I was
really, really, really lucky

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.350
about doing was the US Navy
SEALs offered to let me come

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.900
to Coronado Island in San Diego
area to learn from them

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:03.060
and to find out how they were
able to risk manage and make

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.850
the swim safer for the SEAL
trainees and for the more

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:12.500
elite SEAL officers, who train
there to go off on missions

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.400
into far off places.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.970
And so they allowed me to spend
off and on two years

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.370
learning from them and
asking questions.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.450
And I was able to capture a lot
of their anecdotes and put

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.410
them in the book as
a way to say--

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.130
for instance, there was one
officer who told me about his

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.620
experience of going into
hypothermia, where his

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.760
temperature dropped severely and
he was extremely cold and

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.070
he was in a bad state.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.090
And being able to tell that
story, I was able to also

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.870
explain what hypothermia is,
what you look like, or

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.320
somebody looks like when they go
into hypothermia, and what

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.650
to do if somebody is in
a hypothermic state.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.970
And I was able to draw on
the expertise of Gordon

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.160
Giesbrecht, who is the expert
up in Manitoba, Canada, who

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.340
can tell you all about the
physiology behind hypothermia.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.620
In addition, I was able to then
talk about what to do to

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.940
prevent hypothermia and how to
condition for colder waters so

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.590
that you prepare in advance so
you don't experience this.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.450
The other thing that I was
trying to do is explain that

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:22.850
when you're in the open water,
it's this great adventure

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.110
where you get to see things you
would never see on land.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:29.250
A good friend of mine, her
name is Cindy Hunter, and

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.450
she's a marine biologist at
the University of Hawaii.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:37.670
And so she, for instance, gave
me her take on what it is like

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.820
for her to look at coral reefs
and their significance.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.650
And what happens if, for
instance, you knock off an

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.520
inch piece of that coral.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.170
And if you do, and if you get
stung by the coral, then

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.940
there's a whole chapter in there
of what to do if you get

00:10:52.940 --> 00:11:00.320
stung by jellyfish or sting
rays or coral, and how to

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.240
enjoy the water a lot more, and
how to swim more safely.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.860
And really the reason for the
book was to help people have

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.910
fun in the water and to connect
with other people who

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.110
are really out there
and enjoying it.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.130
So instead of just talking on
and on, I just thought maybe I

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:22.630
would open this up to see if you
might have some questions

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.080
about the book, or about open
water swimming, or about

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.896
anything that may pertain
to the subject?

00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:30.146
We'll see.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.770
AUDIENCE: How do you prepare
to go into such cold water?

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.330
LYNNE COX: How do I prepare to
go into such cold water?

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.480
Actually, I started preparing
for cold water when I

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.450
was 14 years old.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.940
That was the first time I swam
across Catalina Channel.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.540
The water temperature there
was about 70 degrees.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:59.330
And my dad suggested that what
we do to prepare for it--

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.510
there were three other
14-year-olds and one other

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.710
12-year-old that were planning
to do the swim.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.170
And so what we did is we only
swam in the ocean so that our

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.980
bodies would start to acclimate
to the colder water

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.160
temperature.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.130
The pool temperature
was 76 degrees.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.810
And we found that if we swam
in the pool, we'd overheat.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.110
We'd start sweating and
turn bright red.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.400
So by swimming only in the
ocean, that started our

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.690
acclimatization process.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.360
But we also did things
like during--

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.590
it was summer and fall.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.630
So I only trained with this
group of swimmers

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.860
for about six weeks.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.670
They had been training
for a year.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.495
But I had been training with
Don Gambril, who was the US

00:12:38.495 --> 00:12:38.950
Olympic coach.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.050
So I was sort of trying to
acclimate very quickly.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:45.100
And my dad suggested that I
sleep with the windows open at

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.910
night, and that I only sleep
with a sheet, and don't wear

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:52.660
heavy pajamas, and wear sandals,
and try to get my

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.770
body used to a colder
temperature.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.520
So that's what I did for the
Catalina Channel swim.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.770
The English Channel swim was
significantly colder.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.050
It was 56 degrees.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.800
And so all winter long, I'd
leave the windows open.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.290
I'd wear very light
clothes in winter.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.110
In Southern California, the air
temperature gets down to

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:12.140
48 degrees.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.340
So that helped a lot.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.750
But I basically, through
the years, did

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.070
colder and longer swims.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:25.310
So the Bering Strait swim was
in 38 degree water for two

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:26.785
hours and six minutes.

00:13:26.785 --> 00:13:29.250
The swim in the Antarctic
was just 25

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.690
minutes and 32 degrees.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:34.350
I really had a hard time
training for that because the

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:38.700
coldest water I could get into
was in Ushuaia, Argentina, at

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.490
the very tip of Argentina, and
the water temperature there

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.320
was 42 degrees.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.670
So what I did is I tried to work
out in a way that I swam

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:52.940
slower to cool my body down
a little bit more.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.700
But I also trained putting
in my face in the water.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.090
So that would cool my body
down a little faster too.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.840
You lose 80% of heat
through your head.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.090
So I thought, OK, during
training I'll get a little bit

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.370
colder than I normally would.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:10.250
And then when I went down to
Antarctica, when I actually

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.500
did the swim from the ship to
the shores of Antarctica, I

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.090
swam head up like a
water polo player.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:20.100
Because you lose 80% of heat
through your head, you lose

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.900
the heat really,
really quickly.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.420
So I thought if I swam head up
for the majority of the swim,

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.050
I'd be able to contain
more heat in my body.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.570
I also did a few weird
things, but whatever.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.610
Because you're doing things that
have never been done and

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:32.850
you don't know how it's
going to work.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.510
So you're going to just try
a variety of things.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.920
I always look at nature to
see what's possible.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.290
And when you look at penguins,
there like this big, like the

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.760
Gentoo penguins.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.450
And they're like kind of rotund
or cylinder shaped.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:51.630
And their body is really amply
coated with body fat and it's

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.230
really well distributed.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.930
And then outside the layer
of body fat are feathers.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:01.400
So there's this air insulation
that exists between the body

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.480
and the feathers.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.560
And that's what really keeps
them warm is the air between

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.520
the two, and their body fat.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.610
So I figured what I'll do before
I swim in Antarctica is

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.790
I'll grow my hair really long.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:16.090
And I'll wind it up and pile it
on top of my head and put

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.030
it under my bathing cap.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.990
And I won't squish
out the air.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.880
And when I swim, I'll swim
head up and maybe I can

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.460
contain my body heat better.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:29.550
There were other things that I
did to try to help me that

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.900
again nobody had ever
done this before.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.900
And I don't think anyone ever
really wanted to do it anyway.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.740
So it was a really big
stretch for me.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.570
So I do know that one of the
side effects of hypothermia is

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.180
that you become dehydrated and
that also helps to contribute

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.960
to becoming hypodermic.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.310
So before my swim in Antarctica,
I decided, OK, you

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.350
need to make your body
like a thermos.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.760
Because you've got basically
your body, your body fat, and

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.410
then your skin.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.460
And your skin will close down
the blood flow really well.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.770
That's what it's been
trained to do.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.960
And it'll close it down and
it'll move it from the

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.280
extremities into the core of
your body to protect your

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.040
brain and vital organs.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.800
But I thought maybe if I can
warm up my core temperature

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.110
before I start swimming, maybe
that will help me on the swim.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:23.760
So what I did is I drank four
8 ounces of really hot water

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.070
to put into the thermos before
I started the swim.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.800
And then because of the research
I've been doing, we

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.540
wound up getting a pre-core
temperature before I swam.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.410
My body temperature was up to
102 before I started the swim.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.730
And then after the swim was
over, we couldn't get an

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.710
immediate core temperature,
but it was down to 97.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.540
And within an hour, it
was back up to 102.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:49.760
So my body has learned how to
get back up to my normal

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.300
temperature very quickly.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.840
But the other thing that it
learned to do too is that

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.850
through time, through all these
years of training and

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.720
acclimating to the colder water,
the researchers found

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.560
that my body temperature learned
how to lower itself.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.670
So that my normal temperature
wasn't 98.7, it

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.369
was more like 97.6.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:14.099
So the way they explained that
acclimatization was that I was

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:18.400
able to lower my thermostat so
my body didn't have to work as

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.640
hard to stay warm.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.390
And then to continue with your
question actually, I think

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:29.550
that the training that I've
done has been really

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.430
progressive through many,
many, many years.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.950
And I've had basically lowered
the temperature that I've been

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.380
swimming in very gradually
and then tried to

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.340
go further in it.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.870
The swim that I did off
Greenland in 28.8, that

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:47.480
dropped to 26.6, I really
couldn't train for that.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.690
That's not a great thing.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.480
But I had done the swim
in Antarctica.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.010
And I really didn't think
there'd be a huge difference

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:58.300
between 32 degree
water and 28.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.580
I didn't realize it
would drop to 26.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.330
And I was really wrong.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.340
There was a huge difference
between 32

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.960
degrees and 26 degrees.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.750
And it made me think of a whole
bunch of things like

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.830
when you get below a certain
degree temperature water, is

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.740
the effect of the cold
exponential?

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.520
Does your body lose heat more
rapidly than if the water was

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.000
56 degrees and it
dropped to 50?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.960
I don't know.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.800
I know though that when you're
training for different swims,

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.770
if you swim in fresh water
that's 70 degrees and if you

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:36.720
swim in 70 degree salt water,
the fresh water will always

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.200
feel cooler than
the salt water.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.670
And I don't know what that is.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.390
And I've asked physicists
and I've asked

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:43.630
all sorts of people.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.160
But there's just a
real difference.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.860
And then I thought well maybe
here more buoyant in the salt

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.760
water so you have less of your
body exposed, so maybe you

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.550
don't feel the water temperature
as much or maybe

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.760
the salt in the water blocks
your perception of it.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.010
And when you swim for so long,
you think about a lot of

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.390
different things.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.150
And I think a lot of it too is
you're always looking for how

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.010
can I do this better, how can
I reach further, what can I

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.460
learn from what I've just done,
what can I learn from

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.560
people around me that have had
similar experiences, and how

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.860
can I integrate that and try
to do something more?

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:22.390
So that's sort of how I
acclimate to the cold.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:23.640
Any more questions?

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:27.600
Yeah?

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.117
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:19:36.117 --> 00:19:37.071
LYNNE COX: Hi.

00:19:37.071 --> 00:19:37.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.270
I was just wondering like in
terms of the whole building

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.165
awareness and social media
didn't exist back then.

00:19:43.165 --> 00:19:45.720
And like I can't just go to my
neighborhood post office and

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.630
write Gorbachev.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:50.100
Like how do you make these
connections, and how do you

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.460
raise the awareness, and get
yourself out there so that

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.980
people actually know this is
what I'm doing, come support

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.370
me, and get the support from I
guess the whole countries from

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.470
the leadership standpoint?

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:03.600
LYNNE COX: What a
great question.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.400
I mean it was incredible.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.150
I didn't have Google back
then in 1987 to be

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.970
able to get the support.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.590
Or I didn't know anything about
it to do these swims.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:18.090
And so I wound up just starting
off with what I knew.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.460
And what I knew was first to
start off by contacting the

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.460
local congressman, who actually
thought that the swim

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.300
across the Bering Strait for
instance might be possible.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.630
So he wound up writing a letter
to the Soviet Embassy.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:34.280
And then I realized that it was
time to contact the State

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:34.740
Department.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.130
But I didn't know
who to contact.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.800
So I started writing letters
to George Shultz.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.850
And I'm talking about the Bering
Strait swim because

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:45.580
that was 11 years of trying to
figure out how to open the

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.850
border between the US and
the Soviet Union.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.840
And the other part of that swim
that was so difficult was

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.570
that nobody believes that the
Soviets would open the border.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.080
That was number one.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.953
Number two, nobody believed that
anyone could swim in a

00:20:58.953 --> 00:21:01.980
bathing suit, cap, and goggles
in 38 degree water.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.900
So when you're trying to get
support for something like

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.630
that and convince people that
this is possible and it can

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:12.020
happen, it's really difficult
to convince them.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:16.000
So I wrote letters to people
every single day.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.290
And I just kept trying.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.170
As I was swimming and working
out, I was thinking about who

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.690
else can I contact?

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.420
Who else do I know who
might know somebody?

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.260
And I had friends who were
mountain climbers, who knew

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.050
Armand Hammer.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.000
So I went to Armand Hammer,
who was the huge

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.070
Occidental Oil guy.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:39.000
And his assistant wound up
writing to the Soviet consul

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.910
general to the US, based
in San Francisco.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.240
So I went up to see him
and met with him.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.770
And he really took this project
on and believed it

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.050
might be possible.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:51.860
But what initially happened was
I wrote to Brezhnev and

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:52.600
never heard back.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.700
He died.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.560
And I wrote to Andropov
and he died.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.990
And I wrote to Chernenko
and he died.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.860
And I wrote to Brezhnev
and I think that he

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.910
decided to answer me.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.920
The other part was I had written
to Bob Walsh, who was

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.130
hired by Ted Turner to put
on the Goodwill Games.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.940
And so through that channel,
I was able to

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.850
reach Gorbachev's assistant.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.950
And through that communication
channel, that's how we got

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.420
Gorbachev's--

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.640
his attention.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.450
In the meantime, the press
started picking up on that I

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.730
was going to go do the swim
and I didn't know if the

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:28.860
commission would come through.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:33.280
So my goal was to go halfway,
to reach as far as I could.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.770
And with the press getting
behind it, and then ABC

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.650
covered it, and then the "LA
Times" covered it, and the

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.270
media made this big deal of
it, we were able to take a

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.950
video and send it through our
contacts to the Kremlin.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:45.790
But that was the other thing.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.740
It's like what's the address
for the Kremlin?

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.630
How do I get a video
to Gorbachev?

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.960
I mean I don't know
any of this stuff.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.260
And I contacted a former Russian
history professor from

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.910
college, who told me who
to talk to at the State

00:22:58.910 --> 00:22:59.420
Department.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.520
And then I found that there
was something called the

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.180
Russian desk.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:06.280
So I contacted the Russian desk
person, who was really

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.550
engaged in this whole thing.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:08.520
His name was Ed Salazar.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.070
He was like this is
the best idea.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.220
After 10 years of working
at it, somebody

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.020
going this is fantastic.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.400
So he jumped on board.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.240
And then because of him,
then the Assistant

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.300
Secretary of State.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.160
And then US Ambassador to
Russia, the Russian Ambassador

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.530
to the US-- oh, Soviet
Ambassador to the US.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:27.070
And I eventually started
building this team.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.430
And then got Senator Frank
McCloskey from Alaska.

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.160
I mean it just continued.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.070
It snowballed.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:38.880
And basically the day before
the swim happened, we got a

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.460
call from Senator McCloskey's
office saying that the

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.710
clearance had come through for
the swim and we could do it.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:50.450
And it was so exciting to have
worked for 11 years and have

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:54.030
this huge dream, and this huge
hope that the border could be

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.670
opened between the two
countries, and to have the

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.280
phone call saying yes,
it's possible.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.660
But in my head, I had been
thinking all this time that

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.490
I'm only going to be
able to go halfway.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:05.920
And suddenly I'm thinking,
oh my gosh, I got to

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.380
go all the way now.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:12.610
And so it sort of like
shifted everything.

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:15.980
And the other part that was
really exciting was that we

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:20.362
had supporters from Little
Diomede Island who were Inuit,

00:24:20.362 --> 00:24:23.710
who had had family on
Big Diomede Island.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.030
But they had all been
moved by the

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:27.520
Soviets to mainland Siberia.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.430
So they had lost contact with
their family for 48 years.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.360
So we were allowed two
cruise boats to go

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.870
across the Bering Strait.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.840
And they didn't have
to have visas.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:43.100
It was agreed in advance by
telex, there weren't faxes

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.210
then, by telex that we'd have
these two umiak boats, which

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:51.100
were two walrus skin boats
that were 30 feet long.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:56.090
And they would accompany me
along the swim, along with AP,

00:24:56.090 --> 00:25:01.680
and "Los Angeles Times," and
ABC, and a bunch of media that

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.150
would be there to document the
swim and to document the

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:05.590
border opening.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:10.080
And the hard thing that happened
was that suddenly all

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.560
of the people in the community
wanted to go across with us.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.210
So they're pulling out
all these umiaks.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:18.880
And many of them that hadn't
been used for a couple years

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.790
and their skins were
stretched out.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:28.780
And the gut that they used to
sew the skins to the frame

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.630
weren't really tight.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.740
So I'm thinking, oh my gosh,
we don't have enough life

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.210
jackets in the boat for them.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:35.910
And what happens if something
goes wrong?

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.740
And there's a point where I
just go, you know, I can't

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.740
take care of all this.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.620
I just have to do the
swim and hope that

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.640
everything will work out.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.230
And I thought well, if something
goes wrong maybe the

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.650
Soviets will come in and
rescue our crew.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:51.440
So it was a really wild and
crazy, but that was the swim.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.730
And it really took forever,
but it opened the border.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:59.350
And that was in August of '87.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:02.500
In December, President Gorbachev
and President Reagan

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.700
were meeting at the White
House to sign

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.290
the IMF missile treaty.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.530
And it was their first summit.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:10.780
And President Gorbachev and
President Reagan stood up.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.710
And President Gorbachev raised
his glass and said, it took a

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.640
daring American girl by the
name of Lynne Cox just two

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.430
hours to swim between
our two countries.

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.030
And it said it showed how close
to each other the two

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.650
countries are and how the
relations between the two

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.410
countries were improving.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:30.830
And it made me feel like wow,
you can have a huge dream.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:34.510
And you can go to a lot of
people who will help you and

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.680
you can make it happen.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.030
And after that, the border
between the two

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.050
countries was opened.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.000
And the people that have lived
on Little Diomede Island that

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.330
hadn't seen their families for
48 years, were able to go back

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:46.670
and forth freely.

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:50.670
And they created an
international park up further

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.530
in the Bering Strait that was
co-administered between the US

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:54.250
and the Soviet Union.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:58.210
And then commercial stuff
opened up, where Alaska

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:01.630
Airlines started to fly from
Alaska directly to the

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.000
Siberian and the Far East.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
And fishing stuff changed.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.960
And there were big changes that
resulted in that tiny,

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.140
little effort.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.110
But it was really fantastic.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.400
It was

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.960
really so cool Any--

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.210
you had, yes?

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:21.300
AUDIENCE: It's on.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.470
OK.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.030
You said the longest swim,
how long was it?

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.810
It was seven hours?

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.330
LYNNE COX: The longest swim
I swam was when I

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:31.650
was 14 years old.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.910
And I swam 12 hours
and 36 minutes

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:35.700
across Catalina Channel.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.520
When I swam the English
Channel the first

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.780
time, I swam 30 miles.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.410
The second time I
swam 33 miles.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:45.930
AUDIENCE: So my question is what
do you do for nutrition

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:49.200
and hydration to keep fueled
throughout that whole time?

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.320
LYNNE COX: Actually,
I'm still learning

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.470
how to do that better.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:57.560
Initially when I swam the
English Channel, water bottles

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.400
hadn't been invented yet.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.990
So my mom came up with the
idea of using old shampoo

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.460
bottles and using that
for our feeding.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:10.160
And we would try all sorts of
things like hot tea with honey

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.070
or hot orange juice, which
is absolutely disgusting.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.060
We tried hot cocoa.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.780
But that was not good with the
salt that you would get in

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.710
your mouth for hours.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:21.660
You'd have like salt in.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.570
So you had to figure out a fluid
that could warm you up,

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:26.650
that would taste good, and that
would give you energy.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:29.090
And I finally came up
with warm apple

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:31.910
cider, warm apple juice.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.920
Because it was something that
would coat my throat.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.800
It with something that was a
simple sugar that moms give

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.650
their kids, babies, as
their first drink.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.380
You know the first fruit
drink that they get

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.620
usually is apple juice.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.030
It's easy to digest.

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:47.250
So I figured I would use
that for my swam.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.950
So I periodically, on
the English Channel

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:51.170
I'd feed every hour.

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:56.870
And I'd have a small,
half glass, or--

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.460
yeah, have a cup of apple
juice or maybe a cup.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.920
And then the other thing I would
have would be oatmeal

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.810
cookies, oatmeal
raisin cookies.

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.660
Because when you swim for long
periods of time, you get

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.960
really hungry.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.750
And I've always wanted
solid food.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.300
I haven't enjoyed drinking
whatever it is that you're

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.430
supposed to drink.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:17.540
So it's really interesting
though because my roommate in

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:18.860
college was Sandy Nielsen.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:22.250
And she was the gold medalist
in the '72 games in the

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.850
100-meter freestyle.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:25.390
And we were talking about
our training.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.400
And we were talking about
what we ate one day.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.180
And I said, Sandy, what did you
eat before you got your

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.990
gold medal in the
100 freestyle?

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:35.595
She said I had big bowl of
oatmeal with raisins.

00:29:35.595 --> 00:29:40.480
I'm like amazing, that you find
the same things coming

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.920
from different sports.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.030
The other thing that I've done
through the years is I've

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:46.250
really gone to other athletes
to learn from them.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:49.900
And a good friend does
ultra-marathon runs.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.330
She's Kathy Kusner.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:56.070
She was a gold medalist in the
'76 games in horse jumping.

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:59.020
And she went on to become
a marathon runner and an

00:29:59.020 --> 00:29:59.980
ultra-marathon runner.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.230
And she's 73 now.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.040
But she was doing 100-mile
runs until she was 70.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.290
And now, she just
does marathons.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.150
That's all she does now,
a real slacker.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:16.720
But she also eats very simply.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.370
And she eats oatmeal.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:21.610
And she doesn't do the
high-tech, high-power,

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:22.560
high-fuel stuff.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.860
Because a lot of that stuff
causes gastric dumping.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.610
It causes gas and makes you
really comfortable.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:32.670
And so she goes more with
water and fruit juice.

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:36.250
And her friend though, and I
haven't tried this out yet,

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:39.630
who does ultra-marathon runs,
she's probably in her 50s.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:43.050
She is now trying to eat
avocados during the runs

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:47.320
because you want a high fat or
she wants a high-fat, energy

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.510
substance to eat.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.270
And she says avocados are
really easy to eat.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:54.290
And I'm thinking, wow, with all
the salt in your throat,

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:56.750
that would be like guacamole.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.500
But I mean the other thing that
I learned from her and

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:04.200
her friends are that on their
long-distance marathon runs,

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.120
they cut up peanut butter and
jelly sandwiches and eat

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.660
pieces of them during
their runs.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.100
And I thought wow,
that's so wild.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.840
Because before my swim across
the Beagle Channel at the very

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.370
tip of South America, I decided
that I needed to try

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:19.050
something new.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:22.170
And I wound up eating bagels
with peanut butter and jelly.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.235
And that gave me energy
and sustained me.

00:31:24.235 --> 00:31:26.890
It sort of just sat there
for the whole swim.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:31.670
So I think though there's no
answer for anyone to say this

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:34.260
is what you need to drink and
this is how you need to feed.

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.800
I think it's really about trying
out what will work for

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.670
you and what you're
happy with.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.950
Just like you might like a
certain food or you might be

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:43.410
allergic to a certain food, what
works for you might not

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:45.580
work for somebody else.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:51.960
I think now that open water
swimmers who are doing five

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.680
and 10 miles swims are feeding
more frequently.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.900
They're feeding every
20 minutes or so.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.220
And they're short feedings.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.950
Because every time you stop to
feed, you start to get cold.

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:05.100
And I learned that when you do
that, you sort of never get

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.390
back to where you were
before you stopped.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.610
You always feel that cold moving
a little bit deeper

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:10.830
into your body.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:13.400
So I don't really like
to stop and feed.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.010
And when I do those really cool
swims, I don't stop for

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:18.860
anything because your
body temperature

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.500
gets lowered so quickly.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.220
And that's the other
thing that happens.

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.930
On these swims, and you might
experience it if you're doing

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:30.760
some of these open water swims
or during triathlons during

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.980
the swimming phase, your
temperature can drop because

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.650
you've been swimming in cooler
water and your skin's exposed

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:39.210
to the colder water.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:42.010
And then you get out
and you vasodilate.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.290
You start to open the blood flow
from the peripheral area

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:45.700
and it goes into your core.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.440
And then you notice
that you're cold.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.155
That's called "afterdrop."

00:32:49.155 --> 00:32:53.570
What I've learned from the swim
in Greenland was that in

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:56.520
the past I had sort of stopped,
and put warm clothes

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.450
on, and drank warm fluids.

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:01.950
Not hot foods because your lips
are cooled down to the

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:02.610
water temperature.

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.840
So the last thing you want to
start drinking is hot fluids

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.270
because you'll just scorch
your lips and mouth.

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:09.250
So you wanted to start
off with warm fluids.

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.980
But what I learned after the
swim in Greenland, or what I

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:15.870
thought about, was instead of
just stopping in shivering,

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:18.960
and then warming my body up that
way, and then drinking

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.380
warm fluids, what I'll do
instead is I'll walk through

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.520
the town of Illulissat, which
is very, very, very hilly.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.040
I'll make sure I have
my sweatsuit on.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.690
And I'll go back to the
hotel that way.

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:33.100
So after half an hour walk, my
core temperature had warmed up

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:34.520
significantly.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.370
And I'd get into a shower
that was just cool.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:40.050
And then within 20 minutes,
I warmed it up to

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:41.070
warmer, then hot.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:42.380
And it was back to normal.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:46.380
Whereas in Antarctica, I
shivered for an hour straight

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.250
and felt really uncomfortable
and exhausted by shivering for

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:50.160
an hour straight.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.880
And then after that took
a warm shower.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.400
One of the things that I wrote
about in this book that's so

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.230
important, that I learned from
the Gordon Giesbrecht, the

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.160
world's expert on hypothermia,
is that if somebody is ever

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.650
hypothermic, never put
them in a hot shower.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.320
Because if you put them in a hot
shower, it causes them to

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.350
vasodilate, dilate open the
blood flow along the surface

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:15.020
of the body, and it will throw
the cold blood into the core.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.610
And it can cause their whole
system to collapse

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:19.010
and they can die.

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:22.000
So there are people that do
these cold swims that say we

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.040
go right into the sauna
afterwards.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.980
And I also hear about those
who go into the sauna

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.400
afterwards often pass out.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:31.340
And it's because of that shift
in blood moving in and out.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.040
So just one of those things
that's really important, that

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.030
I sort of noted in a big
way in the book.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.260
Yeah?

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:46.150
AUDIENCE: So for people who are
just getting started with

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:51.219
open water swimming, what are
the key dangers, watch-outs,

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:54.880
and key skills that you need in
order to be safe doing it?

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.600
LYNNE COX: Well, that's the
big part of the book.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:01.930
Maybe I'll just give it
from my experience.

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:05.110
Before I do any swim
anywhere, I spend--

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:06.920
it depends on the swim--

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.240
but if I was to go swimming off
Brighton Beach right now,

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.600
I would be asking--

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.460
first, I'd try to find out if
there's someplace around here

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:17.210
where they measure water quality
and find out is the

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:17.980
water clean?

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.760
Because I'm swimming because
I want to be healthy.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.570
I don't want to go swimming
and get sick.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.170
That's the last thing
I want to do.

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:25.940
So I'd find out about the water
quality in the area.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:30.060
Then I would contact the captain
of the lifeguards and

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:35.575
find are there problems with
sting rays, jellyfish, sharks?

00:35:35.575 --> 00:35:39.090
Are there certain times of the
year where it's better to swim

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:41.490
and where there aren't
better times to swim?

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.900
What's the prevailing current?

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.990
Is there a big temperature
change from cold to hot?

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:52.300
And then I would continue
through friends who are

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.800
swimmers to gather
information.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.250
And then I compare
that information.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.890
Because one person might tell
you one thing and somebody

00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:59.560
might tell you something else.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.350
And one might be right and
the other might not be.

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:06.440
So I usually sort of
triangulated every answer that

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:11.140
I got to see if I could get that
same answer repetitively.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.810
And then I would use that
as OK, that's what

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:15.360
I'm going to do now.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.220
Actually, I think that it's
a really methodical and

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.550
progressive way of doing
the research.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:23.930
Now, I have Google.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:26.320
And you won't believe
how much I use it to

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.630
be able to ask questions.

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.310
And Google Scholar,
it's like oh, my

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:31.280
gosh, this is so fantastic.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.150
And then to access people and to
be able to track them down

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.540
and ask individuals who
know stuff about the

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.670
environment or the water.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:39.620
And I do all that first.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:43.870
And then I will go to the beach
and I'll talk to the

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:46.960
lifeguard or a number of
lifeguards on the beach.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:50.120
And ask them about the current,
how fast it flows,

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.495
which way it goes, are
their rip tides?

00:36:52.495 --> 00:36:54.810
Are there things that I
need to be concerned

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:56.000
about in the water?

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.570
I remember training for Cook
Strait in an area called

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:01.890
Island Bay, New Zealand.

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:04.890
And it was this beautiful
bay that

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:06.250
was really well protected.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:09.590
It was just like lapis
blue water, so clear.

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:11.460
And I get in there and
started swimming.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.710
And I was doing a really
good work out.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:16.360
And I decided I need
to pick up my pace.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.020
And I hadn't even thought, I
mean this was when I was 17

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.410
years old, so I hadn't even
thought of asking is there

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:23.410
anything I should know
about this waterway

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.380
before I get in it?

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:28.130
And I had worked with the
local lifeguards.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:29.700
But I still didn't ask
that question.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.670
So I was swimming along and I
ran head first into a piling.

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:37.200
And I came out afterwards and
said did you guys know there

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.460
was a piling over there?

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.790
It's like, oh yeah, that used
to be part of the old pier.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.170
I'm like, ah.

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:44.930
So honestly, you don't want
to get injured while

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:45.830
you're doing your swim.

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:48.950
So that was the other thing is
are there other questions that

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:52.310
I haven't asked you, but that
I should know about?

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:55.550
Because I really am not from
this area and I'm just trying

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:57.170
to learn before I get in.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.530
And so that sort of endears you
to the local people too.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:02.100
And they can't help
you enough.

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.550
And that's what's so cool
about this open water,

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:07.390
triathlon, athlete community.

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:09.500
People will really
help you out.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.620
But that's really what makes it
fun too, to be able to swim

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.810
with somebody and share that
experience afterwards.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:20.190
I think though I spent a lot
of time, maybe an hour.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:23.380
And then the other thing that
I do, because of doing the

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:27.510
research for this book, I met a
man named Shawn Collins, who

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:28.340
started Surfline.com.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:33.490
And it's the premier place for
surfers to go online to find

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:36.050
out what's going on with the
surf around the world.

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:40.520
And he was so cool because he
could look at weather systems

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:44.550
around the world and figure out
where a storm was being

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:48.060
generated off Fiji, and the
speed of the storm, and the

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:51.060
height of the waves that would
occur from that storm.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.760
And he could do that looking at
all the charts and find--

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.620
I mean the weather information
and weather maps.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.810
And he could also do that
with the Pacific

00:38:58.810 --> 00:38:59.630
Northwest or whatever.

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:02.320
And I was at his home one day
in Seal Beach, California.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.950
And we were sitting there,
looking out at the water.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:06.690
And he was watching the
waves coming in

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:07.630
and breaking on shore.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:10.690
And he says oh, that's from
the storm off Hawaii.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.430
That's from the storm off
Washington state.

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.370
That's from the storm
off Fiji.

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:17.890
And he could tell by looking
at the waves.

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.480
He said each one has
a fingerprint.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.470
And I'm like wow.

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:23.760
I spent my life in the ocean
and I didn't know that.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.350
And he gave me this new,
beautiful way and awareness of

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:28.130
looking at the waves.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:31.290
But I would also check
Surfline.com to find out about

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:33.280
what the wave situations
are before I go.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:37.460
Yeah?

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:40.550
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering if you
ever had any close encounters

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:42.325
with marine life--

00:39:42.325 --> 00:39:42.880
LYNNE COX: Oh, I've had--

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.600
AUDIENCE: --or interesting
stories?

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.100
LYNNE COX: I've had
lots of close

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:47.010
encounters with marine life.

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:49.860
Sometimes its been really
wonderful and exciting.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.270
And sometimes it's been
really not so great.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:56.270
The wonderful one was my second
book, where I had a

00:39:56.270 --> 00:40:00.390
baby gray whale, who was
swimming underneath me in the

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:01.190
early morning.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.960
I was training.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.400
I would never train
this way now.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.560
But when I was 17 years old, I
was training just outside the

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.230
wave break before the
Sun has risen.

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:11.150
And I felt something very big
swimming underneath me.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:13.490
And I kept swimming the
half mile to the

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:14.610
jetty and turned around.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:16.740
And I started swimming
back faster.

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.210
And I kept thinking,
is it's a seal?

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:20.370
It's like no, it's
big for a seal.

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:21.060
Is it a dolphin?

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.480
No, it's not a dolphin.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.180
And I couldn't see what
was below me.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.510
So I just swam faster.

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:28.940
And then got to the pier and
decided to get out of the

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:32.040
water and saw an old
fishermen, named

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.000
Steve, who I knew.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.750
And he was waving to
me to come out to

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:35.770
the end of the pair.

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:36.380
So I did.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.120
And he explained that I had a
baby great whale, who had lost

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.140
his mom, who had been
following me.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.090
And that I needed to stay
in the water and help

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:44.550
him find his mom.

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:48.460
So if was like how
do you do that?

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:52.270
But I just thought
OK, I'll do that.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:56.020
And so for the next five
hours, we swam

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.710
all over that area.

00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:00.540
And eventually mom showed up.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.620
So that was like one of
the most wonderful

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.030
experiences in swimming.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:07.910
There was a swim that I did,
that I wrote in the book

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:08.930
"Swimming to Antarctica.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:12.590
And I was trying to become the
first person to swim around

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:14.640
the Cape of Good Hope from
the Indian Ocean--

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.110
I mean, sorry-- from the
Atlantic Ocean around into the

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.280
Indian Ocean.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:23.000
And where those two oceans meet,
there is huge current

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.210
and lots of upwelling.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:25.850
And it's very difficult
to swim there.

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.300
But because of the upwelling
and the current,

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.620
there's a lot to fish.

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:30.930
And because there's
lots of fish,

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:32.010
there's lots of sea lions.

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:33.260
And because there's
lots of sea lions,

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.980
there's mega sharks.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:38.940
And so in preparation for that
swim, there were four guys who

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:43.230
were from the Special Forces
team, South African Special

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:47.050
Forces team, who agreed to be in
the water spotting for me.

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:48.830
So they were taking turns.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:51.600
Every 20 minutes, one guy would
jump in and hold onto a

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.770
rope and have a spear gun in
his hand, with a mask and

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:56.370
snorkel on, and watch
for sharks.

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:59.490
And then after 20 minutes, the
other guy would jump in.

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:03.595
Well, I was about 400 meters
from finishing the swim and

00:42:03.595 --> 00:42:07.100
Doug, the diver who was next to
me, suddenly disappeared.

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.460
And I had a Zodiac boat
off to my right

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.230
for additional support.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:12.740
So I was yelling at the crew.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:13.890
They were saying,
where's Doug?

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:16.020
And they were looking and they
couldn't see anything because

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.480
the water was so rough.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.520
So I yelled to the people in the
other boat where Doug was

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.100
supposed to be attached
to, the 40-foot boat.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.840
And they couldn't
see him either.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.450
So the crew started yelling
at me just to swim faster.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:32.500
And two South Africa swimmers,
who were on board the boat,

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.100
jumped in the water to swim with
me, to make me go faster.

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.140
And I'm thinking, I don't need
anyone to make me go faster.

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:40.470
I know that there's something
going on here.

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:41.700
And wow, you're swimming
with me.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.620
So we sprinted to shore.

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:48.370
And then when we landed on
shore, Doug came ashore in the

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:49.240
Zodiac boat.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.490
And he was stretching out the
spear from a spear gun, which

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:56.790
is about that long and it was
about half a inch in diameter.

00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:00.520
And he said that he shot a
bronze Whaler shark, which is

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.560
a migratory shark that
only comes there in

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.050
December and January.

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:06.120
He shot the shark in
the dorsal fin.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.640
And the shark just turned and
bit the spear, and bent it in

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.290
half, and pulled it out of
its fin, and swam away.

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:15.600
So he said that he was concerned
that the blood in

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.790
the water would attract
more sharks.

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:21.470
And I said I was too.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:25.920
And that there was no problem
because we sprinted to shore.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.350
But we had prepared for it.

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:30.560
The other option for that swim
would have been to swim in a

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.690
shark cage.

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:33.370
The problem with swimming
in a shark cage is

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:35.510
that you get 30% drag.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:37.890
So you're not making it
under your own power.

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:40.270
But the other thing about the
Cape of Good Hope is because

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:46.150
it's at the tip of Africa, it
encounters lots of storms by

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:47.910
just sitting there
the way it is.

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:51.160
And so there are waves that come
up from Antarctica, that

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:53.810
in the winter, are between 80
and 90 feet, that break on

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:54.740
shore there.

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.295
In summer time, they're
a lot smaller.

00:43:56.295 --> 00:43:58.050
They're between 20
and 30 feet.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:43:59.450
There are rogue waves
that just suddenly

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:01.010
appear out of nowhere.

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:03.830
So we figured out though that
if I was swimming in a cage,

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:06.160
the wave could take the cage
down with me in it

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.360
and the boat too.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.700
So we figured that in setting up
that swim, the idea to have

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.780
the Special Forces guys with
me was much better than to

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:15.010
swim in a cage.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:17.800
And I didn't want to swim in the
cage because I felt like

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.050
that was cheating.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.860
AUDIENCE: You shared a lot about
the external elements,

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.040
like physical endurance.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.890
I'm very curious about
the inner element.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:37.900
And has this transformed you
as a person, and have you

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.750
looked at other aspects
outside of swimming

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:43.340
differently because of your
journey, and if you could

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.820
share a few anecdotes on that?

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.540
LYNNE COX: I hope I can remember
all your questions.

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:50.940
There is a real inner journey
when you're doing these swims

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.620
because you're in your
own little world.

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:54.460
It's your think tank.

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:58.300
And so you do spend a lot of
time talking to yourself and

00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:59.740
convincing yourself.

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:02.470
Like the Cook Strait swim, when
you've gone backwards for

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:06.150
five hours and you expected to
have finished after five

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:09.390
hours, it's a big letdown,
a huge letdown.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:13.250
So I learned through that swim
that you just keep going until

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:14.430
you get there.

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:17.650
And I think that I learned that
to apply that to life.

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:20.450
With my first book, "Swimming
to Antarctica," it took 21

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:22.370
years to get it published.

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:24.240
But it became a best seller
on the "New York Times"

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.140
bestseller list.

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.510
And then "Grayson" took a year
to write and then I think a

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:29.420
year to get published.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.210
And that was another
best seller.

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:33.900
So I realize that there's this
transference that you can make

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:39.100
from what you do in your time
that you just are spending and

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:42.770
enjoying life to what you
take in to the bigger

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:44.440
part of your life.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.750
I think that for me--

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:50.010
actually I was invited
to speak in India.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:53.920
And I brought to Mumbai to speak
to 700 eminent people.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.260
And one family had brought
two of their sons.

00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.720
And there was one boy
there who was maybe

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.440
9 or 10 years old.

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:05.540
And he said to me, what you
do must be 90% mental.

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:09.400
That so much of it must be just
in your mind, of your

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.950
ability or nonability
to do it.

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:13.320
And I thought about
that for a minute.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.290
And I said actually you
know I could think

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:17.250
that I could do it.

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:19.540
And that's a great way
to help prepare.

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:23.100
But if I don't physically train
to do it, then mentally

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:25.680
I'm not prepared to do it and
physically and mentally I

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.780
can't do it.

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.990
So it involves all of that.

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:31.460
And I think the other part too
is there is a spiritual part

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:35.070
of it where that whole sense
of extending yourself, of

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:39.260
seeing what you can do, of
trying to create more

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:43.720
challenges and then realize
them and be able to grow

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.760
through that challenge, that's
part of what drives me to do

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.010
these things.

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:52.840
I think that life would be
really boring and not as

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.050
fulfilling as--

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:56.540
I mean just right now, going
across the country and doing

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:59.480
the book tour, the people that
I meet, the questions that

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.400
they have, the exchanges
we have, are

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.840
really rich and enriching.

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.500
And I feel so fortunate to have
written books and to be

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.530
able to communicate ideas.

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:11.900
And then to have people come
back with better ideas than

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.850
what I've had or embellish
them and come up with

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:16.100
something more.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.980
And I think that's one
of the most rewarding

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:21.770
parts of this journey.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:22.940
Did I get all the questions?

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:23.740
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.100
LYNNE COX: OK.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:26.550
Thank you.

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:27.360
Any more?

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.830
Yeah?

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:32.120
AUDIENCE: So I've been lucky
enough to jump into the Hudson

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.210
River two years in a
row as part of the

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:35.900
New York City triathlon.

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:38.720
The first year, I didn't know
what to expect so I sort of

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:42.610
had that moment of panic and
said OK, pull it together.

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:47.556
This year I'm like well, you
know what's ahead of you.

00:47:47.556 --> 00:47:51.090
But do you have any tips or
advice for like that moment of

00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:55.670
jumping in and keeping
yourself together and

00:47:55.670 --> 00:48:00.075
completing what your goal is?

00:48:00.075 --> 00:48:01.365
LYNNE COX: I totally
understand that.

00:48:01.365 --> 00:48:04.050
I was just talking to a friend
of mine who played on the

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:06.420
national team and who was an
amazing water polo player.

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:10.200
And he said he did his first
triathlon with 1,200 people,

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.680
maybe five years ago.

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.750
And he said he had that moment
where 1,200 people were being

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:15.890
released all at once.

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:18.010
And he said, I was so anxious.

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:20.150
And he played water
polo and that's a

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:21.290
really physical sport.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:23.500
So we discussed that.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:28.170
And I think that for me the
way to not be as anxious--

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:30.660
because like when I was going
to jump into 32 degree water

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:34.160
off Antarctica there was a
moment I'm walking down the

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.900
steps and they feel like
ice cube trays.

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:38.680
And then I'm sitting on
it, waiting to sort of

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.380
slide into the water.

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:45.136
And I'm thinking, wow, this is
going to be really difficult,

00:48:45.136 --> 00:48:48.410
and it's going to be cold,
and am I going to be OK?

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:52.880
So I go back to I
train for it.

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.360
I'm prepared for it.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.980
I've done what I needed to do
and now this is the moment I

00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:59.130
get to do it.

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:02.860
And that's really a great way
to start off, like finally I

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.410
get to do it.

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:06.250
Instead of like, oh, my gosh,
what's going to go wrong?

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:07.830
It's like what's going
to go right?

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:10.990
And all the stuff I've learned
through all this time, how can

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:12.960
I now apply it for
this moment?

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.170
Because no matter how hard you
train, there will be stuff

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:18.160
that comes up and it will
be something new.

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.850
It was so cool, the last of
couple years I got a chance to

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:23.030
work with the SEALs,
Navy SEALs.

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:25.300
And what I learned from them
was that they prepare, and

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.940
prepare, and train, and train,
and train, and train.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.590
And they do things so that it
becomes part of muscle memory.

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.400
And so that when something weird
happens, they've already

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.690
covered all those other bases
and then they can deal with

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:36.860
whatever is new.

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:39.730
And I thought that was so
helpful to be able to have

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:42.560
that mindset of you've done
everything you can.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.130
But now, you're the athlete and
you can find the balance

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:47.770
you need to do what you need to
do and shift the thinking

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:53.900
from oh, my god, now what,
to oh, I get to go now.

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:55.460
I hope that helps.

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:00.110
AUDIENCE: Did you
ever flatline?

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:00.860
LYNNE COX: Did I ever flatline,

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:01.530
what a great question?

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:04.310
Yeah, actually I-- ugh.

00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:04.760
OK.

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:08.550
I once was invited to swim
in a race in Nile River.

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:10.010
And we were supposed
to swim around two

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:11.830
islands in the Nile.

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:14.900
And one of my mentors was a man
named Fami Attala, who had

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:17.420
attempted the English Channel
five times and never made it.

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:20.220
But he had done an 80-mile swim
in the Mediterranean.

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:21.120
He grew up in Egypt.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:24.080
And he told me that you'll
have like the best swim.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:24.890
It'll be the best thing.

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:25.890
It'll be the best experience.

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:29.690
Because in Egypt, open water
swimming there is such a big

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:32.530
thing that they name streets
after their heroes.

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:34.530
Abouheif was one of their
swimmers that

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:35.220
swam the English Channel.

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:38.060
So he has a street named
after him in Cairo.

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.850
And it's part of their
mythology.

00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:43.580
It's bigger than being
an NFL quarterback is

00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:44.920
in the United States.

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:50.510
So Fami got me all excited and
set up to do the swim.

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:55.150
And I got dysentery the week
before I swam, but decided I

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:56.880
was the only American there

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.010
representing the United States.

00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:59.830
So I had to do my best.

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:03.700
So I jumped into the water and
swam 15 of the 20 miles and

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:06.300
pretty much passed
out in the water.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:10.820
And wound up in the ER room
in Egypt, in Cairo, Egypt.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:14.140
Which was really kind of
fortunate because the doctor

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:17.060
who was attending to me had
studied in Britain and spoke

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:18.600
English fluently.

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:22.090
And I was so upset because
I had failed.

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:24.680
I mean I had really failed.

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:27.370
And he couldn't understand
why I was so upset.

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:30.035
And I kept saying well, but I
didn't complete the swim.

00:51:30.035 --> 00:51:32.100
And he saying, but
you don't get it.

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:32.880
You could have died.

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.760
You were severely dehydrated.

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.280
Your muscles were cramping.

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.650
And you could have died.

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:42.550
Like, yeah, but I didn't
finish the swim.

00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:44.130
I mean I was 17 years old.

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:45.000
I'm like aah.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.460
And so it took me years
to figure out oh, I

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:50.980
pushed it too far.

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:52.800
I was really dehydrated.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.450
I really could have died.

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:57.430
And no swim is ever
worth that.

00:51:57.430 --> 00:52:01.240
So it put everything from
then on in perspective.

00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.850
But for a while, that
failure haunted me.

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:08.910
Because with the Cook Strait
swim that came after that, I

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:11.730
almost quit on that swim after
swimming for five hours and

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:12.910
not getting anywhere.

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:16.160
But then the support
crew continued to

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:16.920
say you can do it.

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:17.490
You can keep going.

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:20.200
And so I just thought OK,
I can keep going.

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.850
So 12 hours later, I made it.

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:25.730
But that swim in the Nile
was really awful.

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:27.350
Because it was also extremely
polluted.

00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:30.990
And I was swimming through areas
of dead rats that were

00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:32.990
floating around and dead dogs.

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:35.710
And it was really bad.

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:36.255
Yeah.

00:52:36.255 --> 00:52:37.290
I wouldn't recommend it.

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:39.990
Don't swim in the Nile?

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.840
A happier question?

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:42.990
AUDIENCE: I was curious.

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:45.680
Whenever I hit a certain
mileage,

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:46.970
my foot always cramps.

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:50.720
So what do you do?

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.670
What do you do when
you have cramps?

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:54.400
LYNNE COX: Actually,
I just grab my foot

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.610
and stretch it out.

00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:59.370
And that helps to
ease the cramp.

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:01.680
AUDIENCE: So are you always
just treading water?

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.403
You have your support crew.

00:53:02.403 --> 00:53:03.670
Do you hold onto your--

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:04.580
LYNNE COX: You never
hold onto the boat.

00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:07.880
But I don't know if this is in
training or if this is during

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:08.740
an actual race.

00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:11.280
If it's during training, I would
just hold on to whatever

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.390
and do that.

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:15.780
But usually what happens with
cramps is that somebody has

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:19.620
either their electrolytes are
out of balance and so maybe

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.820
you're aren't having enough
calcium, or sodium chloride,

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:23.570
or anything.

00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:27.180
Maybe you need to talk to your
doctor or whatever and find

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:30.700
out if you should have
something more, more

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.540
electrolyte replacement.

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:35.260
The other thing that happens
though is your muscles fatigue

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:36.460
at a certain point.

00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:40.230
And so maybe you're not training
hard enough, those

00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:43.360
muscles in your feet, to prepare
you for the swim.

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.990
Maybe they're fatiguing and
that's causing the cramping.

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:49.830
Or the other thing is you
may be kicking too hard.

00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:53.830
A lot of swimmers don't realize
that 80% of their

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:55.380
propulsion comes from
their arms.

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.000
And their legs are
more for balance.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.330
And so if you're kicking really
hard, you're using all

00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:01.960
the energy that could
be pulling you

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.390
forward with your arms.

00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:06.560
So if you look at me swim, and I
did the long distance stuff,

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.710
you'll see my stoke
is really arms.

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:10.420
And my legs are just balance.

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:13.200
So you might try backing off
on you kick a little bit.

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.850
So then you can use your oxygen
for your arms and pull

00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:17.580
more strongly with your
arms and see if that

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:19.240
increases your speed.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:22.100
And then you don't get the
cramps in your feet.

00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:26.160
You know, like a variety of
things you might try.

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:26.980
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:28.010
LYNNE COX: Oh, sure.

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:30.610
AUDIENCE: So swimming for such
a long distance, how do you

00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:31.860
keep straight?

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.826
LYNNE COX: When I'm swimming for
such a long distance, how

00:54:35.826 --> 00:54:36.740
do I keep straight?

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:39.810
I always have boats with me that
are supporting me during

00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:41.260
the actual swim.

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:44.280
So on board the boat will
be usually a doctor.

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.160
And there will be lifeguards
and sometimes a paramedic.

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:50.290
But on the big, really cold
swims, I've actually had three

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:52.900
doctors there just in case
something goes wrong.

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:55.740
Because again, I'm going to
places nobody's been and I've

00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:56.300
never been.

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.100
So I want to make sure
there's back up.

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:01.630
And they also go through this
rehearsal ahead of the swim to

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:03.750
make sure they can
take care of me.

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:07.060
When I'm training offshore,
I swim just

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:08.800
outside the wave break.

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:13.200
And I swim usually in an area,
either it's roped off, so I

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:17.270
know I can follow the
rope along the way.

00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:18.930
Or I swim outside
the wave break.

00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:22.810
And there's a pier in Seal Beach
where put-- there's a

00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:25.150
tower and I put it on my back.

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:28.440
And then in the distance, there
are three Oil Islands,

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:30.530
White, Chaffee, and Grissom,
that were named after the

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:34.560
Apollo 11 astronauts that were
killed in the Apollo mission.

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.550
And they have lights on them.

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:39.500
So if it's late afternoon or
early evening, I can use those

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:40.670
lights as my guide.

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:42.750
So I'll swim along
and I'll look up.

00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:46.200
But the other thing that I do
that really helps you swim in

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:49.090
the open water is to be able
to breathe on both sides.

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:51.480
Because if you can breathe on
both sides, then you can see

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.420
on both sides.

00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:55.170
And you can swim in a
more balanced way.

00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:59.710
But you also can see what's
around you for safety.

00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:03.460
And so there might be a jet
skier coming off this side.

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.820
And if you don't breathe
on that side, you

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:05.530
might not see him.

00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:08.280
Or a wind surfer on this side--
and if you only breath

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.110
on this side, then you won't
see the wind surfer and you

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:11.340
might not hear him.

00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:14.520
So it's just really important
to be able to see, and look,

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:15.900
and use your eyes.

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:19.690
That will help your
body balance.

00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:21.150
AUDIENCE: And a quick
question.

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:25.340
Did you wear the thermal suit
or the normal bathing suit?

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:26.710
LYNNE COX: Normal
bathing suit.

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:28.880
Usually it's a TYR
bathing suit.

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:32.970
It's just a Lycra swimsuit,
like the Lycra shorts that

00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:33.710
cyclists wear.

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:36.600
So I'll wear the Lycra swimsuit
because it doesn't

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:37.200
chafe as much.

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.380
If you wear a nylon or a
polyester swim suit, that, if

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:42.900
you're swimming a long way, even
if it's a short way, it

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.340
can start chaffing.

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:45.700
So I wrote all about that.

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:51.440
So it's all in there about
how to prepare.

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:51.670
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:52.920
LYNNE COX: Thank
you very much.

00:56:55.352 --> 00:56:56.630
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
all we have time for.

00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:58.330
Thank you for joining
us today.

00:56:58.330 --> 00:56:58.980
LYNNE COX: Thank
you very much.

00:56:58.980 --> 00:56:59.750
It was great.

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:00.100
Thank you.

00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:01.350
Thank you.
