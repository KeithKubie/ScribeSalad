00:00:00.726 --> 00:00:03.620
BEN FRIED: We're here today to
talk to Angela Duckworth, whose

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.445
book, "Grit: The Power of
Passion and Perseverance"--

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:10.320
today is the official
publication day, right?

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.270
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Today is
the official publication day.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.270
BEN FRIED: Congratulations.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.436
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Thank you.

00:00:14.436 --> 00:00:15.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.115
Thank you.

00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:19.850
BEN FRIED: And incredibly
gracious of her

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.030
to fit time in at Google with
a really, really busy publicity

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.300
tour, which I was getting
exhausted just hearing about it

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.720
a few minutes ago.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.210
So for those of you who
aren't familiar with Angela

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.060
Duckworth's work, I'll try
to briefly read a biography.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.100
Angela Duckworth is
professor of psychology

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.567
at the University
of Pennsylvania

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:43.900
and the founder and scientific
director of the Character

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.790
Lab, a nonprofit
whose mission is

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.800
to advance the science
and practice of character

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.890
development.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.980
In 2013 Angela was named a
MacArthur Fellow in recognition

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.410
of her research on
grit, self-control,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.450
and other non-IQ competencies
that predict success in life.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.975
It's a very impressive resume.

00:01:00.975 --> 00:01:02.600
Prior to her career
in research, Angela

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.558
founded a summer school
for low income children

00:01:04.558 --> 00:01:07.875
that was profiled as a Harvard
Kennedy School case study.

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:10.500
She's been a McKinsey management
consultant, a math and science

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.250
teacher in the public schools
of New York City, San Francisco,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.620
and Philadelphia.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.264
She has degrees from
Harvard, Oxford,

00:01:17.264 --> 00:01:18.680
and the University
of Pennsylvania

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.160
in neuroscience
and in psychology.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.360
Did I mention she's a MacArthur
Fellow, 2013 MacArthur Fellow?

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.550
All right, I'll stop there.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.950
And "Grit" is her
first book, it says.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.040
So welcome again, Angela.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.780
Thank you for coming.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.090
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
Thank you, Ben.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.090
Thank you for having me.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.880
I'm delighted.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.380
Thanks.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.030
BEN FRIED: So let's
get right into it.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.380
If you're not with her work--
the TED talk, the book--

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.060
I guess, hopefully it's fair
for me to summarize the thesis

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.900
as that the power,
as you put it,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.780
the power of passion
and perseverance

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.050
are at least as strong
indicators and contributors

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.260
to success or achievement
as things like IQ

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.940
and talent, which are
what societally at least

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.340
we've traditionally focused on.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.990
And that resonated
enormously for me,

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.550
because I think
at Google we spend

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.810
a lot of time thinking about
talent, IQ, raw talent.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.090
It's kind of baked into
this crazy hiring process

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.000
that we have.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.050
And which brought me to the
first question I had for you,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.871
which was, do you
think that-- I mean,

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:28.120
from what you know about
Google-- do you think that we

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.390
or do you think that
organizations in general

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.010
select for the wrong things
in the hiring process?

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.270
And would organizations
be better off

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.310
if they looked
for grit plus fit,

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.132
as opposed to attempting
to measure innate talent?

00:02:42.132 --> 00:02:46.270
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: You know, I
think the interests that we all

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.260
have in talent-- and it's
not just Google, it's me too.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.660
I wish I were more talented.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.120
Talent's great.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.190
And if you could give me five
more IQ points, I'd take them.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.910
So I don't think it's wrong
to think about talent.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.370
I don't think it's wrong
to think about potential.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.780
I do think it's useful to
think about what we really mean

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.866
when we say the word talent.

00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:08.490
And if you force
yourself to write down

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.090
on a piece of paper
in a sentence that

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.517
ends with a period, talent
is, it's really hard

00:03:13.517 --> 00:03:14.350
to actually fill in.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.550
What do I mean?

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.140
Potential?

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.940
I mean, we start
to use metaphors.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.530
Here's my definition
of talent, and I

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.760
think it reveals that I
do think it's important.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.450
Talent is the rate at which
you increase in your skill

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.510
with effort.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.890
Some people are going to
increase their skills faster

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:31.470
than others.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.400
And I think it's
legitimate to say

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.640
those are the quick studies.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.090
Those are the talented people.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.890
I think it's legitimate for
Google to look for them.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.530
Why not?

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.990
Why not try to hire the
more talented people?

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.890
But in my data I
find two things.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.960
One is that more talented
individuals don't always

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.450
keep showing up.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.130
Woody Allen famously once said,
"Eighty percent of success

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.270
in life is just showing up."

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.350
He was later asked by William
Safire of "The New York Times"

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.200
how he got to the number 80.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.430
And Woody Allen, who is
not exactly a scientist,

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.504
said, "Well, you know,
I was going to say 70,

00:04:04.504 --> 00:04:05.795
but it had one extra syllable."

00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:06.740
BEN FRIED: [LAUGHS]

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.980
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
Nevertheless, 70, 80.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.290
I think his point was is that
his experience as a writer,

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.570
which was the context
of the quote, there

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.640
are many people who
could write a great book

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.624
or who are talented in the
sense that when they write,

00:04:20.624 --> 00:04:22.290
they get better faster,
but they'd never

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.650
finish what they begin.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.830
And so what I find in
my data is that talent

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.470
is no guarantee of actually
showing up and finishing

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.890
the things that you start.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.750
The second thing
is, characteristic

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.580
of high achievers
really in any domain,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.760
whether it's Google
or outside Google,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.160
is this kind of daily discipline
of trying to get better.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.785
BEN FRIED: Yes.

00:04:39.785 --> 00:04:42.870
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: In
sometimes microscopic,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.090
infinitesimally trivial ways.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.844
All those little details
add up to excellence.

00:04:47.844 --> 00:04:49.260
And it's not always
the people who

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.093
are the quick studies
who are willing to put

00:04:51.093 --> 00:04:53.730
in those hours and hours of
behind the scenes unglamorous

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.360
work.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.580
So sure, Google should
hire talented people.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.400
But I do believe
that you want people

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.610
who are going to stick with
things when they're hard

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.450
and who are going to
daily submit themselves

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.320
to the Japanese principal of
kaizen, continuous improvement.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.750
BEN FRIED: So on that subject,
continuous improvement,

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.750
you talk in the
book about practice

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.280
and the difference
between-- I think

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.820
you use the words
directed practice

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.431
versus regular
undirected practice.

00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:19.680
And it reminded me of in
running there's a phrase junk

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.360
miles, which maybe indicate--
I've never actually

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.260
been a runner, so I can only
hypothesize what it means.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.910
But I guess it means kind of
running that doesn't really

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.690
contribute to your
improved conditioning.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.160
And what is the difference
between direct practice

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.440
and undirected practice
in this spirit of kaizen

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.396
and self-improvement?

00:05:36.396 --> 00:05:38.520
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: So let's
keep running as actually

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.940
the perfect example.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.210
So when I started
to try to understand

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.090
the science of achievement
beyond bumper sticker

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.110
wisdom-- what do we really
know as a science about experts

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.000
and how they got
that way-- I quickly

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.360
found myself at the doorstep
of Anders Ericsson, who's

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.165
the world expert
on world experts.

00:05:56.165 --> 00:05:58.160
He studies what experts
do that make them

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.410
different from the rest of us.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.220
It's a great job.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.340
He goes to the
sudoku tournaments

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.900
and he studies World
Cup soccer players.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.692
And he refers to it actually
as deliberate practice.

00:06:09.692 --> 00:06:10.400
BEN FRIED: Right.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.850
Deliberate practice, yeah.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:11.065
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
And he would like

00:06:11.065 --> 00:06:14.010
to say that deliberate practice
is different from anything else

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.664
that we do in four
important ways.

00:06:16.664 --> 00:06:18.830
And I'm going to come back
to running as an example.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.455
But the first thing when you're
doing truly deliberate practice

00:06:21.455 --> 00:06:23.490
is that it's
extremely intentional.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.217
It's problem solving
something in particular.

00:06:26.217 --> 00:06:27.800
Not like I'm going
to come into Google

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.450
and be a better
CEO, whatever it is.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.089
It's like I'm going to
say that the first 15

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:36.630
seconds of my presentations are
going to be a little sharper.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.577
I mean, it's extremely,
extremely precise.

00:06:38.577 --> 00:06:40.410
That's the first thing,
a very specific goal

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.368
that you're working on.

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:43.740
And often it's a
weakness, not a strength.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.090
Second is 100% focus.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.910
Or as some coaches would
say-- like Pete Carroll

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.820
at the Seahawks-- practicing
with great effort.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.640
Third is feedback.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.490
Ideally, right away and
ideally information rich.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.350
And fourth, the kind of
refinement that you reflect on

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.330
and you try the whole
thing over again.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.950
In fact, these four things are
incredibly straightforward.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.800
And you might wonder why only
world class experts do it.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.290
But let's come back to running.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.450
So when I heard about this
research on deliberate

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.470
practice, I asked
Anders, why is it

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:23.710
that I have gone running
pretty much every day for years

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.630
and I'm not a second
faster than I ever was?

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.362
Isn't that evidence
that you're wrong,

00:07:28.362 --> 00:07:30.820
that it's not thousands and
thousands of hours of practice?

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.950
He started asking me
questions like, well,

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.055
when you go out for a
run, do you have a goal,

00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:36.860
like a certain time?

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.200
Or are you trying to run hills?

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.900
No, no.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.977
I'm taking the same
route every time

00:07:41.977 --> 00:07:43.310
I go out around my neighborhood.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.768
And he said, OK
well, that's great.

00:07:44.768 --> 00:07:46.360
What do you do when
you're running?

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.517
I was like, well I listen to
NPR and any other podcasts

00:07:50.517 --> 00:07:52.100
because I'm trying
to distract myself.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.190
And he said well,
that's interesting.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.856
Because people who
are trying to improve

00:07:54.856 --> 00:07:57.440
their running are
actually concentrating

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.410
on their running and their
strides and their breathing.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:00.910
All right.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.994
And he said, so how are
you getting feedback

00:08:02.994 --> 00:08:03.660
on your running?

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.118
I mean, are you
keeping your times?

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:06.550
Are you measuring
your heart rate?

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.380
Do you have a coach who's
looking at your form?

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.350
No.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:10.870
No.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:11.899
And no.

00:08:11.899 --> 00:08:12.690
BEN FRIED: [LAUGHS]

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:13.410
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: And
then he said, are you

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.260
going back every
time when you run

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.700
and thinking to yourself,
what can I refine here?

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.940
Before this next
repetition what is there

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.471
that I can do differently?

00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:21.970
No.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.178
And he said, well, then I
can tell you why you're not

00:08:24.178 --> 00:08:26.090
getting any better at running.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.300
And that is, those
thousands of hours

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.890
are not thousands of hours
of deliberate practice.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.640
So I think this idea that
we should be getting better

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.580
at things, we can
unpack that a little.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.470
It's not just going
out and trying hard.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:41.240
It's actually trying hard in
those four very specific ways.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.720
BEN FRIED: So on the subject
of deliberate practice

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.180
and coaching, I thought it's
an interesting question.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.440
In the organization,
do you have theories

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.570
about what roles managers
can play in helping

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.810
people develop in the same way?

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.580
Or do you have opinions on how
professional development works

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.372
in organizations versus
how it should work?

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.830
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
One of the things

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.250
that's really important
to know about human beings

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.820
is that it's not that we stop
growing up when we're 18.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.850
And if you look at the
etymology of the word parent,

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.610
the word parent really
means to bring forth.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.600
So after we leave our
own parents who've

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.680
tried to bring
forth our-- we leap

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.130
into other situations
which frankly,

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.650
are parenting situations.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.920
I mean, I had teachers,
I had professors.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.010
I still do, you know, mentors
who, in a very authentic way,

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.724
are parenting me.

00:09:30.724 --> 00:09:32.390
All right, now what
does it really mean?

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.490
What does it look like?

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.970
I think that really,
really great leaders

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.120
do a couple of things.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.120
One is they model the
character that they

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.260
want other people to emulate.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.660
And there are two schools
of thought about leadership.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.940
Some people say the leader
doesn't really matter.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.190
Swap out one, put
in the next one.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.142
Really culture's going
to happen without them.

00:09:51.142 --> 00:09:52.600
I'm in the other
school of thought.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.110
I think that's absolutely wrong.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.600
Everybody watches the leader.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.700
The leader sets the pace
for the entire organization.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.640
And when the leader is
nice to other people--

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.520
You know, when I go and
visit famous people like you,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.430
I watch them and I watch how
they talk to the people who

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.370
aren't famous.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.330
I watch them when
they order their food.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.830
Do they look the
person in the eye?

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.080
And all those little things are
being watched by all the people

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.990
who work for you.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.120
No pressure.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.530
And they're emulating you and
especially if they respect you.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.920
And that brings me to the
next thing that leaders do.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.620
I mean, a leader
is respected when

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.450
they provide both the kind
of demanding, challenging,

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.910
it's not good enough, it's
still not good enough,

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.830
I need you to do this
differently, bring it

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:35.950
back to me again.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.160
It's that in combination
with support.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.890
And it brings me all the way
back to the parenting metaphor

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.270
because that's what
great parents do.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.067
They're demanding.

00:10:45.067 --> 00:10:45.900
They're challenging.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.820
It's not good enough.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.530
I'm occasionally
disappointed in you.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.200
But at the same time,
genuinely care about you.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.417
I want you to be successful,
and I respect you.

00:10:56.417 --> 00:10:58.750
BEN FRIED: So on the subject
of mentoring and parenting,

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.470
I thought it was-- I don't
know where I read it--

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.680
but that you share
your peer review.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.240
When you submit papers, you
share the negative peer reviews

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.840
and grant proposal
rejections with the people

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.410
in your lab and your students.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.135
Is that true?

00:11:12.135 --> 00:11:13.510
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
It is all true.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.000
And here's the thing about it.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.530
When you interview someone
whose-- whatever, they

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:21.110
win an award, or you just you
read off someone's resume,

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.430
and by the way, you only
usually read the good parts.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.320
Like how about the time that you
completely screwed up and made

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.153
this wrong decision?

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:29.550
I didn't put that on my resume,
so you couldn't read it.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.450
But I think a lot of my work
is about demystifying things

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.590
like excellence.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.330
People who succeed
fail all the time.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.539
In fact, I think they fail
more than anyone else.

00:11:40.539 --> 00:11:42.080
That's what makes
them so successful,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.490
because failure provides an
opportunity for information.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.130
In academia when you
submit an article,

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.770
even when you're very good, odds
are it's going to get rejected.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.960
And in my world, rejection
comes with a 13 page

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.030
single spaced review letter
about exactly how you suck.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.370
Like, I can't believe how
badly written this is.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.410
Like, oh my god,
does this person not

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.339
know the meta-analysis
done in 2000?

00:12:05.339 --> 00:12:06.130
BEN FRIED: [LAUGHS]

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.740
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: And I
send those letters out as

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.900
soon as I get them to everybody
who's working in my lab,

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.290
so that they can see all the
imperfection that eventually

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.350
will lead to some
kind of achievement.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.550
I want them to know
the truth as opposed

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:25.425
to the shiny, polished myth that
I think is easy to fall into.

00:12:25.425 --> 00:12:27.670
BEN FRIED: Which feeds
into the myth of talent.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.430
There's some people
who are just so good,

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:30.970
they appear on
stage one day never

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.230
having thought about what
they might say and perform

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.440
"King Lear" flawlessly or
whatever the case may be.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.930
Whereas in reality, it was
direct practice and failure

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.180
and so on that got them there.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.846
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: And
again, that person

00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:46.750
may have been-- so take your
favorite actor, Judi Dench, I

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.250
mean, take whoever
you want to think

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:52.680
of as somebody who's a paragon
of masterful performance.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.864
It's not that I'm
saying that anybody

00:12:54.864 --> 00:12:56.030
could have been that person.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.360
I'm not saying that we all
could have been Einstein.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.100
But even Einstein wasn't born
knowing anything about physics.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.650
Even Judi Dench had to
learn how to be an actress.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.480
Skills, because we are
human and we are not

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.670
horses or other lower
order animals who

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.800
are born with a lot of stuff
hardwired-- horses don't really

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.860
have to learn how to run.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.450
Hours after they're
born, they run.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.790
Human beings are
born knowing nothing.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.730
The only thing that we're
born knowing is how to learn.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.800
And so skills are
acquired over a lifetime.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.630
Sure, the talented progress
faster if they stay with things

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.810
and if they continue
to work at it.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:36.130
BEN FRIED: On the
subject of learning,

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:41.800
do you think that the
educational system is set up

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.960
to support and recognize
grit, perseverance?

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.790
It seems like the
academic cycle is

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.680
short with immediate feedback.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.460
And it's easy, for
example, to move on

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.240
from one subject to
another after three or six

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.275
months of study if
things don't go well.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.000
Are the standards we've
set for academic success

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.417
hurting our ability to develop
grit in people, obviously

00:14:06.417 --> 00:14:07.500
all of whom could benefit?

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.999
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
Well, if you think

00:14:08.999 --> 00:14:12.430
about younger kids, the kids who
are still in elementary school

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.910
or middle school
and high school,

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.310
one way in which
our system doesn't

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.290
do a great job of
encouraging grit

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.270
is there's a kind of a narrowing
of the focus on what it means

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.690
to be successful
to essentially mean

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.480
what are your scores on the
annual standardized tests

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.400
of math and reading?

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.580
That's incredibly narrow.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.500
It not only leaves
out a lot of things

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.780
that I care about-- grit,
for example-- for something

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.010
you find meaningful.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.760
And I haven't yet
met the 16 year-old

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.540
who finds their
standardized test scores

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.790
a meaningful life goal.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.370
It also leaves out
the kind of interest

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.600
where a lot of us
probably in this room

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.253
would say that that's what
they really did care about.

00:14:48.253 --> 00:14:51.440
Their sports team, being
on the baseball team,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.240
writing for the school paper.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.970
The things that kids do
outside of the classroom that

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.102
are unmeasured, that
policymakers-- not only are

00:14:59.102 --> 00:15:00.810
they not measuring
and caring about them,

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:05.190
these things are getting cut
from schools left and right.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.460
Then we talk about
university education.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.420
Well, you do have to have
a major in most schools.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.150
So that's gritty in
the sense that grit

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.590
means doing something
in-depth, as opposed

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.570
to being scattershot.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:18.660
But I'll tell you a story.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.340
I was once on a
committee to decide

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.870
who was going to be
elected to Phi Beta Kappa.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:26.250
And as you may recall,
this is the honor society

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.720
that there are people
like me, faculty

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.280
who say OK well,
this kid's really

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.560
extraordinary as a
budding academic,

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.810
and this kid maybe not so.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.970
So the first kid gets on Phi
Beta Kappa, the second kid--

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.290
So I remember looking at
this one kid's record.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.560
And it was very clear
to me that it was grit

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.180
and the passion for this
kid was biochemistry.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.640
You could see in his transcript
that all of his classes

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.302
were taken in biochem
at the med school.

00:15:52.302 --> 00:15:53.885
Every summer he was
doing internships.

00:15:53.885 --> 00:15:55.800
And even before he
was going to graduate,

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.960
he was going to be a
published author, which

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.800
is a very hard thing
to do for any kind

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.500
of scientific publication.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.720
Committee gets to discussion,
and people are like,

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.380
oh you know, I don't really
see much humanities here.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.290
Oh you know, this
isn't a very good grade

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:10.600
in his writing class.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.430
I was like, look, this kid's
going to win the Nobel Prize.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.400
OK, I exaggerate.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.850
But this kid has a passion.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:17.990
Let's reward that.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.950
And I argued hard enough that
he did get Phi Beta Kappa.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.830
But I think that there is
this kind of averaging.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.940
People don't care about
the average ability

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.520
that you have across all things.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.330
Most of us in life
are going to become,

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.660
if we're lucky,
good at something.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.210
And it's that one
thing that actually

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:38.220
matters and not the other things
that you didn't invest in.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.780
BEN FRIED: Do you have
a favorite grit story?

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.740
I mean, your book is
full of great stories

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:48.220
of people who demonstrated
so many facets of passion

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.900
and perseverance and interest
and commitment over time.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.960
Is there a favorite one?

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.660
Is there a--

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.035
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: You know,
it's a great job that I have.

00:16:56.035 --> 00:16:58.670
So like Anders Ericsson, I
go around studying experts.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.260
And you see it
everywhere, by the way.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.370
It's not just that you
have to go to the Olympics

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.032
or to a chess tournament.

00:17:05.032 --> 00:17:06.740
You go into a great
restaurant-- and this

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.920
is a very trivial
example, but I think

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.069
it resonates for me--
you go into a restaurant,

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:13.349
you ever had a great
waiter or waitress?

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:15.700
I mean, they're
just considerate.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.380
And I was like, that is a pro.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.930
That is somebody who
loves what they do

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.819
and who seems to be trying
to get better at it,

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:26.670
and that is grit just as
much as a famous story.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.450
I do have a story that I've
recently been re-reading,

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:33.190
and that is Julia Child
and her autobiography.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.910
And you may or may not
know that Julia Child took

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.000
until her late 30s
to really figure out

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.010
that she wanted to do anything
at all related to food.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.250
She grew up in a wealthy
family that had a cook.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:48.620
She said she had, and I quote,
"Zero interest in the kitchen."

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.160
When she was a young
woman going to college,

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.950
she thought she might want
to be a writer, a novelist.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.800
Then World War II happened,
so she went to-- I mean,

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.250
this is not a story
of grit so far.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.120
She marries Paul Child, and
for his job, not for hers,

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.450
they go to France.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.330
And she has a really
memorable meal.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:09.650
It was sole meuniere in a little
restaurant outside of Paris.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.770
And that was the
beginning of a journey.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.544
Not by the way, an
epiphany that she

00:18:15.544 --> 00:18:17.960
knew that she was going to
revolutionize the way Americans

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.240
cook and introduce
them to French cuisine.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.140
But one step in a journey
where, in the next meal,

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.620
she noticed that was also
different than anything she'd

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.279
ever eaten.

00:18:27.279 --> 00:18:28.820
Then there was a
bistro they went to.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.750
She started wandering
around Paris

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.330
and looking at this beautiful
produce and this bread

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.790
that she had never
tasted before.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.050
She got more interested.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.970
Somebody gave her a cookbook.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.950
Her husband gave her her
second French cookbook.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.660
She found out that
there were classes

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.960
that she could walk to
and learn French cooking.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.370
What I want to say about
these stories of grit

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.260
is that one, that is accessible.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.260
When you actually dig down
into the details of how people

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.760
became great, suddenly
it becomes something

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.360
that you might
actually aspire to.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.520
And it's never
really a snapshot.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.650
It's always a movie.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.766
And it's a long movie.

00:19:02.766 --> 00:19:04.140
And you might not
want to see all

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.900
of the scenes that could be
edited out to make more drama.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.410
But in a very real
sense, I think

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:14.880
excellence is a long story
that has parts that are not

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.674
suspenseful, parts are mundane.

00:19:17.674 --> 00:19:18.340
BEN FRIED: Yeah.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.420
It's like practice.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.580
It happens every day.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.420
You do it all the
time, it gets better.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:27.570
So how measurable is grit?

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:29.760
I mean, you actually did
a bunch of pioneering work

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.870
to measure it in
West Point cadets.

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.190
But I mean, when we
think about talent and IQ

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.060
and so on, there's
a rich, if somewhat

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.380
colored history in the
measurement of intelligence.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.860
Is grit equally measurable
in your opinion?

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.360
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
I think scientists

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.540
have a much better grip on
how to measure intelligence

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.780
than they do how to
measure grit or so many

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.790
other things that you could say
are under this broad umbrella

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.090
called character.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:56.430
And we've had these IQ tests
really for over a century

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.340
continually being refined.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.420
And in 45 minutes, I can
give you your IQ score.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.450
Well, in two minutes, I can
give you your grit scale score.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.560
So what's the difference?

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.330
The difference is
that my questionnaire

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.110
is completely fakeable.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.550
My questionnaire--
I mean really.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.585
Like, I'm a hard worker?

00:20:12.585 --> 00:20:13.870
BEN FRIED: [LAUGHS]

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.740
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
It's not hard to think

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.640
about what the answer is to
that if you want a higher score.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.530
In an IQ test, you
can't really fake it.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.640
I mean, you can't say, I'm
going to guess C 'cause

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.810
I know it's the right answer.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.476
But I don't really
know, but I'm faking.

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:28.000
You know, that doesn't work.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.590
Second thing is when
you're taking an IQ test,

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:31.960
there's no subjectivity.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.080
There's no judgment.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.240
You take the test,
you get a score.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.620
With the grit scale,
if I gave it to you

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.800
and you said to yourself,
hmm, am I hard worker,

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.410
I can only imagine
the people that you

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.340
would be comparing yourself to.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.820
When I talk about finishing
whatever I begin on the scale,

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.460
you're going to compare yourself
to your peers, who are all

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.440
probably extremely gritty.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.980
So in addition to
faking, there's

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.394
what in science is called
the frame of reference bias.

00:20:56.394 --> 00:20:57.060
BEN FRIED: Yeah.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.851
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: And
that is your standard

00:20:58.851 --> 00:21:00.200
for comparison can vary.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.960
And here's one concrete example.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.550
In high performing charter
schools like KIPP--

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.250
these are schools
that are in New York,

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:10.130
but all over the
country-- kids are,

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:13.500
like in many other schools,
brought to a very high standard

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.300
of excellence.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.590
When kids rate themselves on
items like I just read you,

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.710
their mental frame is
different from kids

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:22.740
who could be just down the
block at a different school that

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.200
doesn't have those standards.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.240
So that distorts the
scores to some extent.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.100
As a researcher,
I know about that.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.380
I know how to adjust for
that when I run statistics

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.490
and so forth.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.540
I also know that there's error.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.760
I know that there's the
possibility of faking.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.860
What I worry about is
employers or schools

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:45.690
or government agencies who
make the mistake of thinking

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.180
that you can take
a grit scale score

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.500
and make those high stakes
decisions that the grit

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.560
scale was never designed for.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.240
Don't hire with the grit scale.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:54.900
BEN FRIED: No, I'm
not proposing--

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.010
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Yeah.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.340
OK, good.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.500
BEN FRIED: I'm not
proposing that we--

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.940
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Didn't
want that to be the headline.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.273
Didn't think it was going to be.

00:21:59.273 --> 00:22:01.850
BEN FRIED: But I do wonder.

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.950
I mean, it seems
to me like we've

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.335
perfected a lot of ways of
measuring a bunch of talent

00:22:07.335 --> 00:22:07.660
in computer science.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.380
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Do you want me
to tell you my best ideas that

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.990
haven't been tested yet?

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.360
BEN FRIED: Well, please.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:11.535
Please.

00:22:11.535 --> 00:22:11.710
Yes.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.710
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: OK, so I have
one idea that has been tested.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.293
When you look at the
resumes of people

00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:17.504
who want to be Googlers--
which I can also tell you

00:22:17.504 --> 00:22:19.920
I think that's interesting
that you use that term Googler,

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.679
and I think I know why you do.

00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:23.220
But that can be for
another question.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.190
BEN FRIED: I would love to
know why we do [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.830
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: I'm
going to tell you.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:26.746
I'm going to tell you.

00:22:26.746 --> 00:22:28.670
I think it's
actually not trivial.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:29.379
So I'll tell you.

00:22:29.379 --> 00:22:31.336
But when you look at the
resume of somebody who

00:22:31.336 --> 00:22:33.240
wants to get in here,
what I would look for

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.210
is evidence of grit.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.650
I'm not saying that it has
to be in exactly this domain

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.380
or even for the job that
that person-- ideally, yes.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.000
But sometimes it
can be like wow,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.640
this kid was on the tennis
team for three or four

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.085
years in college and went from
A to B in their accomplishments.

00:22:48.085 --> 00:22:49.460
Whoo, this kid
worked-- you know,

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.550
I'll tell you about
my own husband.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.760
This kid worked for Domino's
Pizza as a delivery--

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.520
but they got promoted.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.120
That there's progression
and there's continuity

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.810
in a high grit resume.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.280
Conversely, don't
hire the people

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.110
who have these dilettante
resumes of sort of a little bit

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.520
here, a little bit there.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.400
You know, where is the evidence
of passion and perseverance

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.790
applied to something before
they got to my doorstep?

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:16.990
So I think you can look for the
residue of grit, as it were,

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:18.539
in people's resumes.

00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:20.830
What I don't think you should
do is use the grit scale.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.690
And also I don't think you
can rely on interviews.

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:28.210
I am of the opinion that you
can interview for charisma.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:31.060
You can interview for
social intelligence.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.070
You can interview
for confidence.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.670
You can interview
even for chemistry.

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.753
Like am I going to like
to sit next to this person

00:23:36.753 --> 00:23:37.780
and work with them?

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.280
But how are you
going to interview

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.330
for that quality
of a person where

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:42.880
the next day they're
going to get up

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.921
and they're going to be
the first into the office

00:23:44.921 --> 00:23:47.510
or the last-- you know, when
you give them the feedback that

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.270
says this isn't good enough, is
that person going to genuinely

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.390
reflect on that
and try to improve?

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:56.510
That's really hard to get out of
any kind of short interaction.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:59.400
And my best idea, which
hasn't been tested,

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.370
is if there is
something that people

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:02.770
are going to have
to do at Google

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:07.020
and its particular obvious
to their job, that is really

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:11.140
hard, where you can set
up a mini grit experiment

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:15.930
where you're going to let
them perform and learn,

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.780
get feedback, see whether
they take that feedback,

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.719
see whether they come
back for a second try,

00:24:21.719 --> 00:24:23.510
see whether they come
back for a third try,

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.580
I think that would
be fascinating.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.305
BEN FRIED: So assessment
as opposed to interview.

00:24:26.305 --> 00:24:27.388
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Exactly.

00:24:27.388 --> 00:24:29.530
But you know, it's like
you're piloting the person.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.560
I mean, give them a chance
to display their grit,

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.930
as opposed to trying
to guess at it.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.590
Do you want me to tell you why I
think you use the word Googler?

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.780
BEN FRIED: Yeah.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.700
I would love to know
why we use Googler.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.140
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
So my dad worked

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.560
for DuPont his whole life.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.710
He actually retired
with a gold watch.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:46.690
I thought that was
just a metaphor.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.830
He got one, and it said,
"DuPont, better things

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.890
for better living" on it.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.480
He spent his entire
adult life there

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.180
in automotive refinishing
products, which

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.630
was his passion, by the way.

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:01.290
And you know, my dad did not
talk about working at DuPont.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:03.100
He talked about
being a DuPonter.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:03.850
BEN FRIED: Really?

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:04.808
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Yeah.

00:25:04.808 --> 00:25:08.110
And people who go to West
Point, graduate from West Point,

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.340
they call themselves
West Pointers.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:14.590
Kids who go to KIPP, they're
not students, they're Kippsters.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:17.780
At the Seattle Seahawks, you're
not just a football player,

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.280
you're a Seahawk.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.072
These are nouns.

00:25:20.072 --> 00:25:21.030
They're not adjectives.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:21.485
BEN FRIED: Right, right.

00:25:21.485 --> 00:25:21.940
Yeah.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.356
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: And when
people have an extremely strong

00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:26.700
cultural identity,
they're usually

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.700
able to express that as a noun.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.280
You know, I'm a Googler.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.910
I'm not working for
any other company.

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:34.870
There's a way that
we do things here.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.880
There's a language
that we use here.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.100
You probably don't
use it where you are

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.589
'cause you're not a Googler.

00:25:40.589 --> 00:25:43.172
BEN FRIED: 'Cause you know, we
also have an adjective, Googly.

00:25:43.172 --> 00:25:44.610
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Oh,
what does that mean?

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:46.080
Just in the spirit
of Googleness?

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:46.470
BEN FRIED: Well,
I've been spending

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.340
eight years trying to figure
out what it means, personally.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:48.690
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.700
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: [LAUGHS] Yeah!

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.600
I think you should
stick with Googler.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.840
Googly sounds like those
little eyeballs that go--

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.500
BEN FRIED: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.060
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:55.440
I mean, that's not--

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.814
BEN FRIED: Conan O'Brien on
stage once made that comment.

00:25:57.814 --> 00:25:59.040
"Oh, he's so Googly."

00:25:59.040 --> 00:25:59.450
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Right?

00:25:59.450 --> 00:25:59.680
Googly!

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.150
Yeah, I don't think that's
the-- look, let the marketing

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:03.000
department decide.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.833
But I don't think that's
what you're going for.

00:26:04.833 --> 00:26:05.306
BEN FRIED: Yeah.

00:26:05.306 --> 00:26:06.264
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Yeah.

00:26:06.264 --> 00:26:08.949
BEN FRIED: So sadly, Googly
is pretty baked in already.

00:26:08.949 --> 00:26:10.490
But I'm still not
sure what it means.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:11.850
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Well, that
does happen with culture too.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:12.260
BEN FRIED: Yeah.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:12.900
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
But it probably--

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.325
but really, these
words that you--

00:26:14.325 --> 00:26:15.700
I don't know how
many vocabulary,

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.870
'cause I'm not a Googler,
so I wouldn't know.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:19.600
But at West Point they
have this entire glossary.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.240
BEN FRIED: Really?

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.210
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: And
there are all these words

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:23.334
that you wouldn't know
unless you go to West Point.

00:26:23.334 --> 00:26:24.160
So a plebe, right?

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.500
A plebe, you know, a plebe
and a firstie and a yearling.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.170
What are those?

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.400
And booyah.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.767
So at West Point
they exclaim booyah,

00:26:31.767 --> 00:26:33.350
which doesn't have
an easy translation

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.683
but you say it when somebody
does something really good.

00:26:35.683 --> 00:26:36.530
It's like, booyah.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.370
And then the whole crowd
of cadets that you're in

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:42.200
will erupt in these
words that you've never

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.470
heard in the English language.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.960
And that's very important,
because that's what

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.910
it means to be a West Pointer.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.740
Every company has a culture.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.830
And when that culture
is really strong,

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.790
people identify with
it in a noun form.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.050
They speak the language.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.350
They often wear the colors.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:01.990
They follow the rituals.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.060
It becomes part
of your identity.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.230
And when I heard
about Googlers, I

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:09.720
thought immediately of all these
other very strong cultures that

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.220
are very-- I'm not saying
intentional in that one

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.800
person's writing the
handbook-- but it really

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.050
is part of what makes
the company great.

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.990
BEN FRIED: Now is there is there
a connection between that kind

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.300
of cultural identity and grit?

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.530
Or non-IQ correlates
with success?

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.470
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: I
absolutely think so.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.920
So you can identify with an
organization or a culture

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.920
that itself is gritty.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.420
I'll give you a
national example.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:39.790
Country of Finland has actually
fewer citizens than New York

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.290
City has inhabitants.

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.790
It's small, it's cold.

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:47.330
What is there to know
about Finland that

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:48.640
could be of interest to us?

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.990
There is a word in Finnish
called sisu, which very roughly

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:53.240
translates to grit.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.649
But quite literally translates
to your insides, to your guts.

00:27:56.649 --> 00:27:58.940
And if you're Finnish, you
have the identity of someone

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.540
who when things are
really hard and you've

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:06.120
given all you can and you
still are falling short,

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.570
you reach down inside
and you use your sisu

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.410
and you do it anyway.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.850
Now it's anatomically
impossible that the Finns

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:18.010
are walking around with this
extra battery pack in them.

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:21.700
And if they did have that, why
don't the Swedes have that?

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.862
'Cause it's not that far
and it's Scandinavia.

00:28:23.862 --> 00:28:25.820
BEN FRIED: The Swedes
invaded Finland, I think.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:25.990
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Yeah.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.702
They had this little bit of
rivalry there going back.

00:28:28.702 --> 00:28:30.660
But you know, I think
what's important to learn

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.270
there is that you have an
identity as a Finnish person,

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:35.090
and Finnish people do
things that are hard.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.990
And we have sisu and we prevail.

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:40.690
And I think that
when you are part

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:42.190
of an organization
like West Point

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:45.577
or on a team like the
Seahawks or the Celtics--

00:28:45.577 --> 00:28:47.660
they're another very gritty
team with another very

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.460
gritty leader-- or you work
at a company like Google,

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:54.560
that identity is very much
part of why you often struggle

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.180
through when in a
different context

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.960
with a different cultural
identity, you might not.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.690
BEN FRIED: Now I mean, expanding
it to national identities

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:05.750
and national cultures is
fascinating in itself.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:09.620
Are there particular
cultures or immigrant groups

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.875
that are grittier than others?

00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:13.520
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
I'm sure there are.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.410
I'm sure there are.

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:16.550
There are lots of countries
and cultures in the world.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.610
BEN FRIED: I'm not
trying to race bait, you

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:18.610
by the way, or
anything like that.

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:19.290
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
Yeah, no, no, no.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.760
Well, I haven't looked
at the question directly.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.865
But let me tell you why.

00:29:21.865 --> 00:29:23.240
First, let me just
acknowledge, I

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.660
mean anybody who wants to
say that all cultures are

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.810
the same, that's naive.

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.210
I don't have any
impulse to say that.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:33.210
But it's really hard to ask
the question are the Americans

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:34.340
grittier than the French?

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.020
And are the French less
gritty than the Japanese?

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.040
And here's why.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.790
When I give my
grit scale to you,

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.450
you're going to answer it as
you would with your comparison

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:42.987
group.

00:29:42.987 --> 00:29:44.570
When I give it in
Japan, they're going

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:46.480
to answer it with those
cultural standards,

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.750
not only of their
company and their family

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.809
and their neighborhood,
but the whole country.

00:29:50.809 --> 00:29:52.350
I want to tell you
about a study that

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:55.340
was done of over 60 countries
where they asked people to fill

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.754
out personality questionnaires.

00:29:56.754 --> 00:29:58.670
They didn't give the
grit scale, but they gave

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:00.220
a scale of conscientiousness.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.720
Related, it's in the family.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.590
Dependability, orderliness,
I'm punctual, et cetera.

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:10.410
So now you have data on dozens
of countries around the world.

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:12.830
And you can ask the
question, which countries

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.740
are the most conscientious
and which ones are the least?

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.740
Well, I'll tell you
what the findings are.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.570
The three least gritty
areas in the world

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:24.160
were Japan-- this is
conscientiousness,

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:29.450
by the data-- Japan,
Korea, and China.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:31.100
Really?

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:31.880
Really?

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.690
They're messy people.

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:34.780
They're not dependable.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.536
They don't work hard.

00:30:36.536 --> 00:30:37.035
Really?

00:30:37.035 --> 00:30:37.710
BEN FRIED: Yeah.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:39.590
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
So the researchers

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:43.500
in that study concluded that
perhaps these data were being

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.707
influenced by the very
high standard that

00:30:45.707 --> 00:30:46.790
exists in those countries.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:47.340
BEN FRIED: Right, right.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.320
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
That's why it's so, so

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.350
hard to make these comparisons.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:54.120
Because two things go into
your score-- what you really

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.170
are and then the
frame of reference,

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.327
the standard to which
you're holding yourself.

00:30:58.327 --> 00:31:00.160
BEN FRIED: We should
probably try to open up

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.030
to questions in the room.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:04.090
And on the Dory.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:05.590
I think it's given time.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.250
We have about 15,
20 minutes left.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.170
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
Yeah, I'd love that.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:08.660
BEN FRIED: Does that make sense?

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:09.445
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Yeah.

00:31:09.445 --> 00:31:10.986
BEN FRIED: Do we
have live questions?

00:31:13.476 --> 00:31:15.100
AUDIENCE: Can you
use peer assessments,

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.260
especially cross cultural
or ethnic boundaries

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.664
to then get a more
baseline grit comparison?

00:31:19.664 --> 00:31:22.080
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: So the problem
with the peer assessments

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.250
when you're talking about
the cross-cultural work

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:26.420
in particular, is that
who are your peers?

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:29.510
Other people who also
live in the same culture.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:32.070
So I don't think peer
ratings get you out of that.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.080
But I do think
that-- and you know,

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.840
I know Google is always trying
to hire better-- you know,

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.230
triangulation is
a great strategy.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:42.100
In psychology we call it the
principle of aggregation.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.929
Whenever you have imperfect data
from one source and imperfect

00:31:44.929 --> 00:31:46.470
data from another
source, what you do

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.980
is you put more and more
imperfect data together.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.150
The error cancels out, or
the unsystematic variance,

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:52.650
the error.

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:54.190
And you get a stronger signal.

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:56.650
So yeah, get a peer
rating and a teacher

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:59.870
rating and a performance task
and look at their resumes.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:01.340
You could even
throw the grit scale

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.970
in if it's only one
thing among many.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.080
And when you get a
consistent signal

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.131
that everybody thinks
this person is gritty,

00:32:08.131 --> 00:32:10.130
then you actually have a
good bet that they are.

00:32:13.371 --> 00:32:15.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
coming, first of all.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.920
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Thank you.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.112
AUDIENCE: Also, I saw you have
an audio book, so props to you.

00:32:18.112 --> 00:32:18.560
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: I do.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.435
AUDIENCE: And also guys,
she read it herself.

00:32:20.435 --> 00:32:21.480
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: I did.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.516
AUDIENCE: Which is
really sweet, yeah.

00:32:22.516 --> 00:32:23.330
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
It was really fun.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:25.400
AUDIENCE: I'm going to listen
to it like sped up anyway, but--

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.649
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: [LAUGHS] OK!

00:32:26.649 --> 00:32:27.172
Oh really?

00:32:27.172 --> 00:32:27.755
Like chipmunk?

00:32:27.755 --> 00:32:28.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:28.949
Yeah.

00:32:28.949 --> 00:32:29.680
Three times.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.044
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: OK, good.

00:32:31.044 --> 00:32:32.910
AUDIENCE: No, but
so my question is,

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:36.090
you talk about this
example of the biochem

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:39.210
kid who is really, really,
really deep into biochem.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.870
I would call him
pointy, so to speak.

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:44.120
He dug into that
thing really hard.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.400
And you're talking about how
you can use grit-- the grit

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.240
property gets you to do that.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.670
So people who can do that.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.410
So I had a question
that maybe it's

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:57.430
outside of the scope of the
grit, but my friends and I,

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:59.600
we're actually
very gritty people.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.490
We dig into things
very, very deeply.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:05.820
But recently particularly
after graduating college,

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.555
we had trouble figuring out
what to actually be gritty into.

00:33:09.555 --> 00:33:10.680
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Mm, yeah.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:10.990
AUDIENCE: Right?

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.410
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: What
to be gritty about, yeah.

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:12.760
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:13.980
In college it's very easy.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.790
Or even in school, because
you know, the metric is there.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.020
You get good grades.

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.770
Maybe you pick a major,
you do well in it, fine.

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.310
But then in the
real world, I find

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:26.680
that my friends in particular,
they have trouble being gritty.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.890
Not because they
can't be gritty,

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:30.736
but because they
want to be pointy

00:33:30.736 --> 00:33:32.110
but they don't
know what to pick.

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:35.226
And then you can be really
pointy in Russian literature

00:33:35.226 --> 00:33:37.642
and then it turns out you need
to make money or something.

00:33:37.642 --> 00:33:39.109
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:33:39.109 --> 00:33:40.400
AUDIENCE: You know, no offense.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.066
I'm just joking.

00:33:41.066 --> 00:33:43.296
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: No offense
to Russian lit majors.

00:33:43.296 --> 00:33:43.762
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:43.762 --> 00:33:45.270
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: If
there are any here.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:45.380
AUDIENCE: But yeah.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.046
So how do you actually
go about deciding

00:33:47.046 --> 00:33:50.041
what to be pointy in, especially
when the cost of picking

00:33:50.041 --> 00:33:52.084
incorrectly can be high?

00:33:52.084 --> 00:33:53.500
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
I think that one

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.170
of the things that
makes it so hard

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.240
is that we know
the cost is high.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.680
It can make us freeze
up a little bit.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.730
I was at McKinsey, and there
are a lot of people at McKinsey

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:06.350
who like me, had basically
spent their entire life opening

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.640
doors of opportunity.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.199
If I do this internship,
I can do anything.

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:12.520
And then if I go to McKinsey,
anybody will hire me.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.416
Well, you get to a
certain point in life

00:34:14.416 --> 00:34:16.540
where you realize that
that's not the game anymore.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.139
It's not opening
doors of opportunity,

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.810
it's actually walking through.

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:23.030
And it's walking through
and hearing the other doors

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:24.250
slam shut.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.679
Now that's even more
paralyzing in terms

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:28.409
of the anxiety
that would produce

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:30.750
when you don't have this
really strong inner compass.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:32.850
You're like OK,
follow my passion?

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:34.389
Where do I get one?

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:37.480
And here's my advice about that.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.330
I do think that really really
gritty, passionate people have

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:43.120
two sources of motivation.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.614
And these are two
questions to ask yourself

00:34:45.614 --> 00:34:46.989
when you're going
to ask yourself

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:48.440
what to do the
rest of your life.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.870
One is what are
my real interests?

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:52.670
And they're still emerging.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:54.255
You know, they
develop over years.

00:34:54.255 --> 00:34:56.880
But for many of you, there were
things that you were interested

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.960
and things that you were
less interested in that

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.460
were kind of boring
for you around the time

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.250
that you were
hitting adolescence.

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:05.750
So many gritty
people will remember

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:09.760
that they started liking to
do something at 12 or 13.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.310
There are exceptions,
like Julia Child.

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.440
But interestingly, her interest
at that early adolescent stage

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.350
was writing.

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:19.310
Now if you think about who Julia
Child really grew up to be,

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.160
it was not just a chef, but
equally, if not more so,

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.380
a writer of cookbooks.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.609
So first to think
back down memory lane

00:35:27.609 --> 00:35:29.025
to when you were
a young teenager.

00:35:29.025 --> 00:35:31.391
What are the things that
you absolutely hated doing?

00:35:31.391 --> 00:35:33.390
But what are the things
that you kind of started

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.220
wanting to do spontaneously?

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.340
That's a clue.

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.360
That's a thread.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.020
The second major motivational
drive of passion is purpose.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.220
You know, importance.

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.180
It really is almost
moral for some people.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:50.280
It's like what is the greater
mission that my work serves?

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.530
And if you think
about your values,

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:55.580
it can be I really want to
help people become their best

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.100
selves.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.180
Or I really care
about the environment.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:01.360
I mean, whatever it is
that is for you of value

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.760
that you think is
deeply meaningful

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.160
and isn't going to change.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.730
If you can follow that
and figure out where

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.920
it overlaps with interest.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.640
You finally mentioned
not becoming

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:17.196
an impoverished professional
Russian literature critic.

00:36:17.196 --> 00:36:19.570
You know, I don't know how
many jobs there are like that.

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:22.500
You probably do need a third
circle, which is reality

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.000
and trying to make a living.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.410
But at least starting with
the first two-- my interests

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:29.700
and my purpose or my values.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.146
I think that's more
helpful than just

00:36:32.146 --> 00:36:34.020
saying like oh, well,
go follow your passion.

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.970
Because most of
us don't know what

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:40.362
that even means until
we actually find one.

00:36:40.362 --> 00:36:41.320
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.992
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Thank you.

00:36:43.992 --> 00:36:46.047
BEN FRIED: All right,
why don't we go--

00:36:46.047 --> 00:36:46.880
AUDIENCE: OK, great.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:47.000
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Hi.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.541
AUDIENCE: I certainly enjoyed
the topic and the presentation.

00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:52.640
Clearly grit has a lot of
value both in professional life

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.912
and personal life.

00:36:53.912 --> 00:36:56.370
A different podcast I've been
listening to recently-- maybe

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:57.786
you heard it on
one of your runs--

00:36:57.786 --> 00:37:00.290
by the "Freakonomics"
authors was

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:02.480
about the power of
quitting, and failing fast

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.980
we might say in
engineering circles.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.345
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: I think
I was on that podcast.

00:37:05.345 --> 00:37:05.890
AUDIENCE: Oh!

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:06.380
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
I can't remember.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:06.990
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:08.540
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
I don't remember.

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:09.090
Maybe.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.650
I don't really listen
to them afterwards.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:11.150
But go on.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.649
Yeah.

00:37:11.649 --> 00:37:12.690
And I love that podcast.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:13.260
It's a great one.

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:13.710
Yeah, yeah.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.760
AUDIENCE: So I was trying to
figure out how to combine them.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.120
Like from a personal life,
taking off that last question,

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.370
you could try a lot of things
until you find something

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:21.435
you choose as a passion.

00:37:21.435 --> 00:37:23.310
Do you have any advice
in the corporate world

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:24.965
of how to combine
choosing when to fail

00:37:24.965 --> 00:37:26.590
and when to stick to it?

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:29.190
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: You know, let
me use the metaphor of dating.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:32.050
Because I am personally really
happy that I did not end up

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.400
marrying my first boyfriend.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.777
And so I quit on him.

00:37:35.777 --> 00:37:38.360
I mean, every time you break up
with someone, you're quitting.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.010
And you know, is
that a good thing?

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.410
Is it a bad thing?

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:45.790
I think that for
me anyway, I was

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:47.661
dating to find my life partner.

00:37:47.661 --> 00:37:49.410
I guess people can
date for other reasons.

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:52.580
But I was like, oh we're not
going to get married, over.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:57.110
And it took a few dates and
guys to kind of find the guy

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:59.162
that I'm with,
that's my husband.

00:37:59.162 --> 00:38:00.870
But I think it's
actually exactly what we

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:01.810
do in our careers too.

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:03.570
I mean, you're exploring.

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:06.880
But there are some people who
are exploring with intention.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.770
And I was dating to get married.

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:13.080
I mean, I wasn't really
ever intending to stay

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.347
dating forever.

00:38:14.347 --> 00:38:15.930
I think that makes
all the difference.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:16.730
So sure, quit.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:19.560
But for me quitting the
White House speech writing

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.950
gig and McKinsey
and being a teacher,

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:25.390
it was sort of a
groping toward something

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:27.580
that I wanted to stick with.

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:29.610
I was only quitting
those things so

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:32.230
that I could find something
that I would never want to quit.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:37.010
And when I was 32, finally
after much exploration,

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:40.210
I figured that out, and it
was to have the career I have.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:45.620
But it's not a predictable,
efficient process.

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:48.670
So quitting in the service
of not quitting is, I guess,

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.180
my answer.

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.407
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Thank you.

00:38:53.407 --> 00:38:55.240
AUDIENCE: Thanks Angela,
so much for coming.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.406
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Thank you.

00:38:56.406 --> 00:38:57.740
AUDIENCE: This is really great.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.115
There's something
about grit that

00:38:59.115 --> 00:39:02.710
seems very intrinsic or
natural, almost unlearnable.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.780
Do you have any
recommendations for how people

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:06.237
can increase their grittiness?

00:39:06.237 --> 00:39:08.320
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: So I
want everybody in this room

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.890
to watch their own
language in the next day

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:13.560
or so for the word just.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.350
Whenever we say, oh,
they just have it.

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:18.600
Oh, they just are a natural.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.970
Or he's just extroverted.

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:22.290
How does he do that?

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:24.290
He's just kind of a math guy.

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:26.625
We use that language,
I think, when

00:39:26.625 --> 00:39:28.092
we can't explain something.

00:39:28.092 --> 00:39:29.800
I mean, that's when
we use the word just.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.820
Actually, when Nancy Reagan
said "Just don't do it,"

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.220
or when Nike says
"Just Do It," I always

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.220
find that deeply unhelpful.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.710
Could you please tell me how?

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.290
Or are you just going to--

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:47.220
So this idea that when we see
someone do something fluently,

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.772
particularly when we
can't do it-- I mean,

00:39:49.772 --> 00:39:52.230
somebody who dances really well
if we can't dance, or plays

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:55.110
music really well-- we start
to use words like just,

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.270
and we say things like
they're a natural.

00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:59.030
And I was actually
giving a talk.

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.832
It was the pre-book tour.

00:40:00.832 --> 00:40:02.290
Today's the first
day of book tour.

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:03.700
But you know, I gave a talk.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.960
And I give talks all the time.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.240
I'm sure you do too.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.780
And you get practice,
you get feedback,

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.350
you make these little
refinements, tiny little ones.

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:13.260
Like oh, that fourth
slide, I totally

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.760
have to change the
background color.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.650
I mean, it's really
that trivial.

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:20.010
I get off the stage and I'm
talking to the person who's

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:20.570
handling it.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.660
She's like, you
are just a natural.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.730
And I thought about
the irony that I just

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:29.529
wrote a book about-- I
should say I recently wrote

00:40:29.529 --> 00:40:30.820
a book instead of I just wrote.

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.910
I recently wrote a
book about the fact

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:36.780
that that is such
an attractive myth.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.290
That's like a seductive myth.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:41.060
And I think the answer is this.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.855
We can say that
people-- you know,

00:40:42.855 --> 00:40:44.730
Jerry Seinfeld would
say that some people are

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:47.650
born to be comedians
and some people are not.

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:49.990
I think there is a
sense in which people

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:51.960
are born with different
inclinations, things

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:56.080
that they find fun to do,
things that hold their interest.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.600
But if you ask the question
of how they eventually

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.160
became Jerry Seinfeld, if they
eventually wrote a book that's

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.540
halfway decent or they gave a
talk that's reasonably fluent,

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.530
it's not just anything.

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.620
Except if you want to say
it is just hours and hours

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:14.130
and hours of iteration
with feedback

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:16.750
to get better at something
which maybe I did just

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.440
like when I was a little kid.

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:28.400
AUDIENCE: My question is
what conditions do you--

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.435
for a child, you're
talking about kids--

00:41:30.435 --> 00:41:34.130
do you set in order
to breed grittiness?

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.865
So to give an example--

00:41:35.865 --> 00:41:37.432
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
Do you have kids?

00:41:37.432 --> 00:41:38.600
AUDIENCE: I don't have kids.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:38.970
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Yeah.

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:39.976
AUDIENCE: Thinking
about them though.

00:41:39.976 --> 00:41:41.852
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
[LAUGHS] OK, good.

00:41:41.852 --> 00:41:42.560
I recommend them.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.350
AUDIENCE: So I'm a Colombian
immigrant to the United States.

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:45.933
I came here when I
was five years old.

00:41:45.933 --> 00:41:47.860
Eventually graduated West Point.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.130
Low income household
in New York City-- four

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:52.250
of us living in one bedroom.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:54.100
Mom, Dad, sister, et cetera.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:58.320
So I still don't
know what conditions

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.816
were set for me to persevere.

00:41:59.816 --> 00:42:01.940
'Cause I could have been
easily in that demographic

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.127
of Hispanics that end up
in jail or whatever it is.

00:42:04.127 --> 00:42:05.085
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Yeah.

00:42:05.085 --> 00:42:06.501
AUDIENCE: Especially
in this city.

00:42:06.501 --> 00:42:09.040
So what conditions,
what makes me different,

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.910
or people like me
different than my peers

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:14.119
that I went to high school
with that perhaps did not?

00:42:14.119 --> 00:42:15.993
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Do
you have any hypotheses?

00:42:15.993 --> 00:42:17.230
Do you have any guesses?

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:20.040
AUDIENCE: I mean, I think
parenting definitely

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.740
had a lot to do with
it as an example

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.460
of the hard working
immigrant parents, et cetera.

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:28.640
But then outside of
that, in the classroom,

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.040
it may have been teachers.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.290
But at the end of the day,
I still had to do the work.

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:35.010
And I just-- I don't know.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:36.426
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
And you probably

00:42:36.426 --> 00:42:39.270
see people who grew up in maybe
not identical, but such similar

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:42.280
circumstances, and they
didn't end up anywhere

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.580
close to where you are.

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:48.100
That is itself I
think my life's work,

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.850
is to answer your question.

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:52.367
And I only have an
incomplete answer.

00:42:52.367 --> 00:42:53.200
But I will say this.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.850
First of all, you did inherit
DNA from your mom and dad,

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:58.630
and so when you see
gritty little kids who

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:01.900
have gritty parents, you
have to at least pause

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:05.600
and acknowledge the fact that
half their genes came from mom,

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.390
half came from dad,
they got shuffled up,

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:09.560
and in part, we are
like our parents because

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.200
of our shared genetic heritage.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.030
At the same time, it's
absolutely unequivocal

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:17.590
that parents model
certain behaviors.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.862
It's usually the case-- not
always, there are exceptions--

00:43:20.862 --> 00:43:22.320
but it's usually
the case that kids

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.884
are modeling the work ethic and
the passion of their parents.

00:43:26.884 --> 00:43:28.550
If it's not their
parents, often there's

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:31.140
another strong role model
like a particular teacher who

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:33.620
had a big effect, or
a coach and so forth.

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.920
So that's maybe part
of the equation.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:39.010
I also think that a
lot of grit comes down

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:41.170
to these virtuous cycles.

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:45.210
You start to find that you have
a thing for a certain sport.

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:48.790
That becomes a source
of pride and success.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:50.460
People begin encouraging you.

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:54.800
It's an upward feedback
cycle of motivation, effort,

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.040
and achievement,
and it feeds itself.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.620
I think there are
people who then

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:00.290
are on the opposite
spiral, which

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.250
is they get a little down about
themselves, they stop trying,

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:05.720
they prove themselves right
because things don't go well,

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.060
and they kind of spiral
in the opposite direction.

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:11.240
And Einstein is quoted-- and I
am not sure I can verify this,

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.050
but somebody at
Google can-- as saying

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.147
that compound interest is
what we all really need

00:44:15.147 --> 00:44:15.730
to understand.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:17.910
It's like, that is the
mystery of the universe.

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:21.570
And I think this compounding
of a little bit of grit,

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:24.440
a little bit of effort,
a little bit of success,

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.950
a little more grit, a
little more effort, a little

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:30.160
more success, if we could
understand that compounding,

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.800
then maybe we could
understand why kids like

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.970
you ended up where you are.

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:36.970
But we could also maybe
understand why so many other

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:38.825
don't.

00:44:38.825 --> 00:44:41.450
And I would like Google to help
me figure that out, by the way.

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:42.620
So it would be, yeah.

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:43.380
AUDIENCE: Do you
need a volunteer?

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.155
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
[LAUGHS] Great.

00:44:44.155 --> 00:44:44.780
Thank you.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:45.620
BEN FRIED: How are
we doing for time?

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.405
I think we only have
til 1:00, right?

00:44:47.405 --> 00:44:47.880
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Five more minutes.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.380
BEN FRIED: Five more minutes.

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:51.125
And is Angela expected to
sign books at the end too?

00:44:51.125 --> 00:44:51.877
Oh, at the end?

00:44:51.877 --> 00:44:52.460
OK, all right.

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.980
So we have five more minutes.

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:55.460
Shall we do a
question on the Dory?

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:56.450
This is somewhat
confrontational.

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:56.740
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Oh yes.

00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:57.630
BEN FRIED: I don't
mean to be rude.

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:58.522
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Oh, that's OK.

00:44:58.522 --> 00:44:58.968
Yeah, yeah.

00:44:58.968 --> 00:44:59.414
No, it's good.

00:44:59.414 --> 00:44:59.860
BEN FRIED: I'll go back.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:00.080
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Wait!

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:00.480
BEN FRIED: I'll read it.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:00.680
I'll read it.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.760
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
Let's do the hard one.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:01.990
Yeah.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.540
BEN FRIED: Yeah.
"There was a study--"

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:04.230
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: I think
there was a study, yeah.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:05.920
BEN FRIED: "Of 4,000 UK students
published back in February

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.195
in "The Journal of Personality
and Social Psychology"

00:45:08.195 --> 00:45:10.330
in which grit was not
shown to be that predictive

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:11.685
of academic success."

00:45:11.685 --> 00:45:14.500
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
"Instead intelligence

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.990
and conscientiousness were key.

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:19.460
Do you do any thoughts
on that study?"

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:22.450
Yes, I do have
thoughts on that study.

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:24.700
Actually one of the
co-authors of that study

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.960
sent me the report
before it was published.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.620
And here's what I said to him.

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.120
So I'll tell you the full study.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.970
So there are thousands
of British kids,

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:38.070
about 16 years old,
I think, who are

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:39.740
going through the
British school system.

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:42.110
And there are grit
scores on these kids

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:44.530
and there are also their
standardized math and reading

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:45.779
scores on the UK test.

00:45:45.779 --> 00:45:47.320
BEN FRIED: The
A-levels or something?

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.500
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: It's
something like that, I guess.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:50.010
Yeah.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.390
Not British enough to know.

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:53.098
But it's a standardized
achievement test,

00:45:53.098 --> 00:45:55.340
and we've all taken them
so we know what they are.

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:56.710
The finding is this.

00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:59.510
Grit does predict their
standardized test scores,

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:02.420
but not quite as well as a
measure of conscientiousness,

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:03.920
which we were already
talking about.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.560
Dependability, being able
to control your impulses,

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.620
that sort of thing.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.850
So yes, grit predicted but
maybe not quite as much.

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:15.960
And also intelligence was a
better predictor in that study.

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.650
I don't find that
all that surprising.

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:21.890
I also don't question those
findings for one moment.

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:24.160
I think they're very real.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.500
For me, my complaint
is that if you're

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:28.620
going to equate your
standardized test scores when

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:32.480
you're 16 and things that,
frankly most 16 year-olds

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:36.010
are not invested in-- it's not
a meaningful personal goal--

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:38.270
if you're going to equate
that with success or even

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:40.940
with academic achievement,
grades for example

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:44.230
do not send all the same
signal as your test scores.

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:46.502
Grades are a better predictor
of college persistence

00:46:46.502 --> 00:46:47.960
than your standardized
test scores.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.600
So they're not interchangeable.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.940
There's information that's
carried by grades that's

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.520
not carried by test scores.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.650
There's information carried by
your extracurricular activities

00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:58.770
that's not embedded
in your test scores.

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:02.500
My complaint is not with the
finding itself, but the idea

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.750
that that is everything
that we would need to know

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:06.920
about success for those kids.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.730
So I guess that's
the major thing

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:10.370
that I'll say about that study.

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:12.180
And I think that
it's very important

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:14.000
to recognize that
grit isn't the only

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.650
important thing in the world.

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:18.750
I study high achievement in
challenging circumstances.

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:21.800
It's in those circumstances
where the goal also

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.310
matters to you that
I think re-emerges

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:27.230
as the most reliable
predictor and not just

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:30.725
a moderately predictive one.

00:47:30.725 --> 00:47:33.446
BEN FRIED: Shall we go
back to a live question?

00:47:33.446 --> 00:47:34.320
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Hi.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:34.760
Yeah.

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.820
AUDIENCE: I got a live question.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:36.560
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Yeah.

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.685
AUDIENCE: What if you're
applying your amazing grit

00:47:38.685 --> 00:47:39.680
to the wrong thing?

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.180
Let's say I wanted
to be a film star

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.096
but I have no grasp of
what the world actually

00:47:43.096 --> 00:47:44.470
wants from a film star.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.190
When should I just
say I should probably

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:49.100
stop trying to do that and
apply my grit to something else

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:50.965
where I might actually
be more successful?

00:47:50.965 --> 00:47:51.640
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Yeah.

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.931
So for example, what if you're
trying to be a film star

00:47:53.931 --> 00:47:55.960
and you're just
disastrously untalented?

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.450
There's nothing that you could
do that you would ever be--

00:47:58.450 --> 00:47:58.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.025
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Right.

00:47:59.025 --> 00:48:00.791
So that's one way that
you could be wrong.

00:48:00.791 --> 00:48:02.540
The other thing that
you could be wrong in

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.539
is that you're picking
an industry that is going

00:48:04.539 --> 00:48:07.260
to melt like the polar icecaps.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:08.880
The whole industry's
going to go away.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.490
And you know, that
happens these days,

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:13.820
in ways that are
faster than before.

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.760
So there's lots of ways that
grit can get you into trouble.

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.980
I think the question is this.

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:20.700
You gotta take risks in life.

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.440
There's no getting away really.

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.740
Even if you do nothing,
you're taking a risk.

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.210
What grit means is
to put your left foot

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:29.664
in front of your right foot
and then your left foot again

00:48:29.664 --> 00:48:31.330
and keep heading in
a certain direction.

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:32.830
And you're absolutely
right that you

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:35.590
might end up somewhere
that you didn't want to be.

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:39.330
But you can guarantee yourself
that you'll never get anywhere

00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:42.150
by switching direction
every few paces,

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:43.670
or not walking forward at all.

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:47.180
So yeah, there's absolutely
risk in being a paragon of grit.

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.300
But I'd say there's a
guarantee of failure

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.540
at not being passionate
and persevering.

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:54.250
BEN FRIED: So a related
question to the one

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:57.960
he just asked is is grit in
a continuum with obsession?

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.640
Is there a bright line
between grit and obsession?

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:01.742
Or are they unrelated?

00:49:01.742 --> 00:49:03.700
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: No, I
think there is actually

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.900
a strong family resemblance
between grit and obsession.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.670
One of the individuals
that I interviewed

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:10.380
but I didn't put
her into the book,

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:13.790
partly because I forgot to push
record when I was interviewing

00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:14.930
her, was Temple Grandin.

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:15.850
And I don't know if
you know her work--

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:16.250
BEN FRIED: Yeah, of course.

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:16.420
Yeah.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.336
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: But
she's famously autistic.

00:49:18.336 --> 00:49:20.350
And she writes about her autism.

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:22.830
And in her words, "A
little bit of obsession

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:24.310
gets a hell of a
lot of work done."

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:25.010
BEN FRIED: [LAUGHS]

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:27.130
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: And you know,
this idea that you wake up--I

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:28.290
mean, I'm obsessive.

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:30.900
If you woke me up at 3:00 in the
morning, which sometimes just

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:32.929
happens to me, like
you wake up and you

00:49:32.929 --> 00:49:35.470
have to go to the bathroom, you
know what I'm thinking about?

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:36.742
I'm thinking about grit.

00:49:36.742 --> 00:49:38.700
I'm thinking about why
did that person do that?

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:39.740
It's so interesting.

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:41.160
Like where did they get the--

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.410
I think about it all the time.

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:43.701
I think about it in the shower.

00:49:43.701 --> 00:49:45.080
I think about it
in yoga when I'm

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.871
supposed to not be
thinking about anything,

00:49:46.871 --> 00:49:48.090
but I'm thinking about grit.

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:50.640
Like Savasana pose, you're
supposed to be doing nothing

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.430
and I'm like, I wonder where
that, you know, is gonna--

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:55.310
It is an obsession.

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:57.870
The difference maybe between
the way most people think

00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:59.870
about obsessions and the
way gritty people think

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:04.250
about obsessions is when
they say, I love what I do,

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:06.270
they love that they
love what they do.

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:08.520
There's no sense
in which they would

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.550
trade that life for any other.

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:12.730
And that's how I feel
about my own work.

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:14.980
BEN FRIED: Yeah.

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:18.190
I think we have time
for one more question.

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:19.042
Should we?

00:50:19.042 --> 00:50:20.000
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Yeah.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:20.190
Hi.

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:20.731
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:20.731 --> 00:50:23.060
So a lot of your
examples of people

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.870
that have shown great grit, like
Julia Child, she starts at 30

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:27.600
and then becomes
this great success,

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.190
they all seem to be
underdogs that then succeed.

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:31.310
Do they have to be?

00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:33.851
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: You know, you
don't have to be an underdog.

00:50:33.851 --> 00:50:36.320
But I am fascinated by
underdog psychology.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.490
And I'll say these
words to you and I

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:39.860
wonder if they'll resonate.

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:43.290
There is characteristic of
many, many grit paragons

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:48.057
that I've studied a sort of
I'll show you rebel-- you know,

00:50:48.057 --> 00:50:48.640
you know what?

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.175
I don't think you're really
cut out to be a programmer.

00:50:50.175 --> 00:50:51.300
[GROWLS]

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.930
Just this fear.

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:54.610
It's an aggression almost.

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:58.280
And I felt that when I was
failing my neurobiology class

00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.960
my freshman year of college.

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:03.010
And my very well-meaning
teaching assistant, my TA

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:05.760
said, you really should
withdraw from this course

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.620
because you're going to get
an F on your transcript.

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:11.510
And you don't know this yet
because you're 18, that's

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:13.520
not a good thing to have.

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:17.070
And I felt a kind
of a hot anger.

00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:19.030
I mean, I marched
out of that office

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:21.890
to the registrar's
office and I not only

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:24.520
didn't drop the course,
I declared my major

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.070
in neurobiology that very day.

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:28.370
What the hell is that?

00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:31.100
The I'll show you response
I think is fascinating.

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.910
I don't fully understand it.

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:35.870
But it's fascinating that
the same exact experience

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:39.590
can either lead people to feel
like I'm a loser, I give up,

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:42.950
or the precisely opposite
psychological reaction.

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:46.510
And I think it's not necessary,
but it's very, very common

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:47.712
to paragons of grit.

00:51:50.544 --> 00:51:52.523
BEN FRIED: I think
we're out of time.

00:51:52.523 --> 00:51:54.130
Hey Angela, thank you so much.

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:54.140
ANGELA DUCKWORTH:
Thank you, Ben.

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.490
BEN FRIED: That was
fascinating and phenomenal.

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:56.490
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: [INAUDIBLE]
I really enjoyed it.

00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:57.090
BEN FRIED: Thank you.

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:58.256
ANGELA DUCKWORTH: Thank you.

00:51:58.256 --> 00:51:58.940
