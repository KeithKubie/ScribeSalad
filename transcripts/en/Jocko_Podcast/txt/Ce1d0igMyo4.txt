Speaker 1:          00:00          Jocko, I've just finished about face the book. Amazing book, interested how you modeled your style on Hackworth though hack was a renegade and always bending the rules to break into the breaking point. But in extreme ownership, you talk about, for example, not pushing back on higher command when it came to Iraqi troops have listened to podcasts too, but was hoping you could go into it a bit more. Yeah. So I guess that's a good question. Hack. He was kind of considered a renegade, but, but also he was also a total company. Man. You gotta realize that there's that dichotomy there. There's a guy that hack, loved the army, he loved the army. He wanted his uniform would look super squared away. He followed all the rules and regulations that, and he supported the leadership all the time when the leadership was right. And that's what makes him a good renegade, in my opinion.

Speaker 1:          00:59          And I was very much the same way. I was all about the navy. You know, I was all about the games as a matter of fact, tone. You know what Tony used to say? Uh, it was a little thing. We got going into you bruiser that spread around. But of course it came from Tony First, which was all navy all the time. We'd just be joking about, you know, I think, I don't know what originally caused it, but like guys would make fun of me because I would wear like jungle boots or Dan or boots out too on liberty with a clear of like old jeans. Yeah. Cause when you're, when you're like that kind of old just raised in the teams, you don't even know any different and you're like, oh well I'm going out and I need to wear shoes. Cool. Where's my jungle boots?

Speaker 1:          01:42          That's what you end up like and you're into it. You're not like, you think it's good. You think it's normal. Like this is the way things are. And so I supported the teams and hacks supported the army of course. But this is the thing, if the leadership was wrong or there was something being passed down that was wrong and it was a big wrong, like if it was a little, I wouldn't be like, Oh man, this is crap. They're making us wear different parish shorts now. Cause like that would happen, like some new commanding officer would come in and change some thing. Right. And some we go to do that where it's like, dude, be quiet, you know, just be quiet. Do you know they're giving you new shorts where the new shorts, you know, oh they're telling us we can't wear baseball hats anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:25          Cool. Don't worry. Baseball hats. And some guys would go up there. It's who cares? It's like they don't care what I'm wearing on my head. You know, like oh you want to issue a different ball caps are find whatever. But then if it was a larger issue then or obviously if it was something that was like actually wrong, like criminally wrong or morally wrong or something like that, then yeah, I'd be like, no, we can't do that. So the reason that I didn't push back on Iraqi troops in working with Iraqi troops when we got to Ramadi was because as I looked at it, I realized that it was the right thing to do. And yes, it was going to be more dangerous. And yes, a definitely took us out of our comfort zone. But as I explained in extreme ownership, if we didn't train those people up, if we didn't train the Iraqi soldiers and take them out and get them fighting and get them squared away on the battlefield, then Americans would have been doing it forever.

Speaker 1:          03:25          So it was the correct call was to do that. Now I've, I've talked about the same, same thing. When they told us our ratio, they gave us a ratio of how many Iraqis we had to have for every one Iraqi we had to have, I don't know what their, I forget what the number was, seven or, or for every one seal we had to have seven Iraqi soldiers. They said that something like that. I forget what the numbers were and I said, no, that doesn't make sense to us because sometimes we only have 10 guys to go out and there's no way I'm sending only one seal with 10 Iraqi soldiers not doing it. Need a corpsman, need to radiomen need machine gunner need a leader like that. That's what I need. So, and when I pushed back because I didn't push back against ball caps and because I didn't push back against some stupid uniform change, they were like, oh yeah, well that actually makes sense Jocko.

Speaker 1:          04:19          We don't want you to go on the field with only one seal. So I would clearly push back if it was something that didn't make sense. Same thing with like the martial arts training that they had us doing in the, in the late nineties and early two thousands. It was not good. And I was told everyone, hey, this is not smart. This is not good. This training is dumb. We need to do other training that's better. Uh, and, and same thing, you know, things go, oh, like here's another like stupid example, they wouldn't want to issue a platoon. The radio was you were going to take on deployment because they didn't want you to break them or whatever. And so the issue, not enough radios for everyone. And so now everyone doesn't know how to operate the radios and you're basically operationally testing the radios while you're going through your workup.

Speaker 1:          05:06          So I said, hey, this is garbage issue, everyone radios, if that's how we operate, that's how we need to train. Gotcha. So in the training they wouldn't issue the radios. Yeah, there was a time period where we low on radio and they said, we're going to keep these radios for deployment. It's, that doesn't make sense. I got a good idea by more radios. Uh, so, you know, those were things I pushed back on it. And you are always pushing back on the type of training that was going to happen and who was going to be, how you're going to run the training. So, um, when something, when it made sense to push back, I pushed back just like Hackworth did. Now Hackworth did it on a massive scale because he eventually pushed back on the way the war in Vietnam was being run. And had I been smart enough and the war didn't take the shift that it took and we didn't move towards counter insurgency and we didn't make those adjustments that the, that Colonel Mcfarland implemented in Ramadi.

Speaker 1:          05:59          Maybe. Maybe. I doubt it. Maybe I would have been smarter to say, Hey, we're not running this war, right. We need to do something different and run up the chain of command. But, but at the time, you know, Colonel Mcfarland made great decisions. He led, he had a great plan, a great strategy, so I was a hundred percent onboard. Um, but if you don't Hackworth, that didn't happen. They were not fighting correctly against the Vietnamese and, and they were taking massive casualties for a hill that two days later they'd give back. And so he was saying, what are you doing? And, and the other thing, you know, when he took over the hardcore battalion, they were fighting for months and they had, they literally killed almost no editing. I think it was zero. I think it was actually zero enemy. And yet they had taken all kinds of casualties themselves.

Speaker 1:          06:45          And so he's saying, this is wrong, this is wrong. So I think that's, that's what being a leader is. You support the stuff, you support the command. Yes, of course you support the command when it makes sense and as long as it makes sense. And normally it's gonna make sense. You know what I mean? Normally it's to make sense, not like the, the admirals and the generals are saying, hey, how can we lose this war? Let's come up with a stupid strategy. No, they're doing the best they can. So it's not like it's a regular occurrence. I mean, like I said, when I was working for Carter, Colonel Mcfarland, he was a smart guy. He was a brilliant guy that had a great strategy of I'm like, okay, awesome. I'm here to support. Um, and, and I'll tell you when I did, and this is, I think this is important, is that even though I was kind of a renegade and hours more rebellious when I was a kid, obviously I was, uh, I was young when I got the seal teams then.

Speaker 1:          07:32          So, you know, we would push the, all those things that I said, oh, we gotta do this. That was me when I was at e four in the seal teams. You know, where do we go do that? We should just be able to do whatever we want. We were just stupid. But as I got older, I realized that you need to, you know, come across as a renegade quote unquote, to come across as a big rebel. That doesn't, well, immediately when you go and push back on something, everyone just dismisses you. Oh yeah, Jocko. He's just a loud mouth. He just, he just pushed back against everything he doesn't want. He's wanting to do everything his way. No. You want them to say, Oh wow, hold on a second. If Jocko is pushing back against this, then this, this must be something wrong here because he doesn't push back against stuff.

Speaker 1:          08:11          He tells the line all the time, so we should listen to them. That's what you want to build. That's what I did my best to build and that's how I think it would be comparable to the way Hackworth led and the way that I try to, obviously I know Hackworth, but I stole as much as I could from him. And the weird thing is, I'll tell you this, I always say I stole from him, but it wasn't like I was sitting there reading the book and go, I'm going to do what he did here. I think it was just absorbed. And even even the naming of task unit bruiser like when I did it, I wasn't thinking this is what Hackworth did, but it was real obvious that that's where I got it from. Like I didn't think I'm going to rename this and you were going to turn this thing around based order would not turn it around, but we're gonna build this based on no, I was like, you know what, we're not going to be Task Unit Bravo cause that sounds lame.

Speaker 1:          09:02          Or It'd be tasking bruiser because that sounds awesome. You and, and then later, you know, as I look back I'm like, Oh God, that's what, that's exactly what Hackworth did. I obviously stole it from him. Yeah. So appreciate it hack. But that's what I'd say be a renegade. But that's should be, that should be in the background. That should be in the back of your mind, in the front of your mind. Should be, hey, I'm a, I'm a supporter of what's happening. Yeah. Kind of like the willingness to be a rent or any gate if you have to. Yeah. Yeah. If you have to, and believe me, I've known all kinds of good seals that were to renegade. Yeah. Just like I'm rns. Yeah. They're just straight up, hey, I'm a renegade. And, and you know that just, it the only guys that could get away with that.

Speaker 1:          09:45          Well guys that were so ultimately operationally squared away. Yeah. That people go, yeah, you know, he's kind of a maniac, but dude, he's really, really good and really tactically sound and all that. And they could, they make that happen. Now as you get more and more senior, the homie don't play like that before or after a certain point, it's done and you got to get, you've got to play the game. That's what you gotta do. As you get more senior, you gotta play the game. And from like your subordinates viewpoint, if if they looked at me and go, oh, jock was just playing the game. He's just doing, yes, I am. Yes I am. Because this way it gives me more ability to control everything that's going to impact you. People that work for me. So yes, I'm going to play the game so you don't have to. You're welcome.
