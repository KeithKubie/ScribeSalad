00:00:01.106 --> 00:00:04.193
- [Instructor] What we have
here is a molecular equation

00:00:04.193 --> 00:00:08.110
describing the reaction
of some sodium chloride

00:00:09.057 --> 00:00:12.362
dissolved in water plus
some silver nitrate,

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:13.523
also dissolved in the water.

00:00:13.523 --> 00:00:16.764
They're going to react
to form sodium nitrate,

00:00:16.764 --> 00:00:20.931
still dissolved in water,
plus solid silver chloride

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.255
and if you were to look
at each of these compounds

00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:29.129
in their crystalline or solid
form before they're dissolved

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:32.310
in water, they each look like this.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.893
But once you get dissolved in
water, and that's what this

00:00:34.893 --> 00:00:37.771
aqueous form tells us, it
tells us that each of these

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.042
compounds are going to
get dissolved in water,

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:43.252
they're no longer going to
be in that crystalline form,

00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:44.913
crystalline form.

00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:48.098
Instead, you're going to
have the individual ions

00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:49.584
disassociating.

00:00:49.584 --> 00:00:52.532
So for example, in the
case of sodium chloride,

00:00:52.532 --> 00:00:55.400
the sodium is going to
disassociate in the water.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.059
Sodium is a positive ion,
or cation, and so it's going

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.275
to be attracted to the
partially negative oxygen end.

00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:05.819
Remember, water is a polar molecule.

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:09.055
That's what makes it such a good solvent.

00:01:09.055 --> 00:01:12.266
Now, the chloride anions,
similarly, are going to dissolve

00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.000
in water 'cause they're
going to be attracted

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.606
to the partially positive
hydrogen ends of the water

00:01:17.606 --> 00:01:20.187
molecules and the same
thing is gonna be true

00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:21.936
of the silver nitrate.

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:22.962
Silver ...

00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:26.362
The silver ion, once it's
disassociated, is going to be

00:01:26.362 --> 00:01:29.748
positive and the nitrate is a negative.

00:01:29.748 --> 00:01:30.998
It is an anion.

00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:36.748
Now, in order to appreciate
this and write an equation

00:01:36.748 --> 00:01:40.915
that better conveys the
disassociation of the ions,

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:47.395
we could instead write
the equation like this.

00:01:48.317 --> 00:01:50.656
This makes it a little
bit clearer that look,

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:53.113
the sodium and the chloride
aren't going to be necessarily

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.082
together anymore.

00:01:54.082 --> 00:01:56.344
The sodium is going to
dissolve in the water,

00:01:56.344 --> 00:01:57.177
like we have here.

00:01:57.177 --> 00:01:59.127
The chloride is gonna
dissolve in the water.

00:01:59.127 --> 00:02:01.651
The silver ions are going
to dissolve in the water

00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:03.984
and so are the nitrate ions.

00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:07.857
So this makes it a little
bit clearer and similarly

00:02:07.857 --> 00:02:11.630
on this end with the sodium
nitrate stays dissolved

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.293
so we can write it like this
with the individual ions

00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:15.589
disassociated.

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:17.839
But the silver chloride is in solid form.

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:21.005
You can think of it as
precipitating out of the solution.

00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:21.981
This is not ...

00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:25.079
This does not have a high
solubility, so it's not going to

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.174
get dissolved in the water
and so we still have it

00:02:28.174 --> 00:02:30.063
in solid form.

00:02:30.063 --> 00:02:31.660
Now you might say, well
which of these is better?

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.700
Well it just depends what
you are trying to go for.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.992
This form up here, which
we see more typically,

00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:42.103
this is just a standard
molecular equation.

00:02:42.103 --> 00:02:43.186
Molecular ...

00:02:44.451 --> 00:02:46.034
Molecular equation.

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.260
It's in balanced form.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.799
We always wanna have
our equations balanced.

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.671
This right over here is known
as a complete ionic equation.

00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:59.835
The complete's there because
we've put in all of the ions

00:02:59.835 --> 00:03:02.493
and we're going to compare
it to a net ionic equation

00:03:02.493 --> 00:03:03.326
in a second.

00:03:03.326 --> 00:03:07.076
Complete ionic equation,
sometimes just known

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.133
as an ionic equation.

00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:10.966
Now why is it called that?

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:13.540
Well, 'cause we're showing
the individual ions

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.935
as they're disassociated in water.

00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:19.252
Now, what would a net ionic equation be?

00:03:19.252 --> 00:03:20.907
Well let's think about that a little bit.

00:03:20.907 --> 00:03:23.074
Let me free up some space.

00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:29.365
So one thing that you notice,
on both sides of this complete

00:03:29.365 --> 00:03:32.812
ionic equation, you have the same ions

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:34.728
that are disassociated in water.

00:03:34.728 --> 00:03:38.374
So for example, on the left-hand
side you have the sodium

00:03:38.374 --> 00:03:40.394
that is dissolved in
water and you also have

00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:43.987
on the right-hand side sodium
dissolved in the water.

00:03:43.987 --> 00:03:47.261
It's not, if you think about
the silver chloride being

00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:50.140
the thing that's being
produced, this thing is in ionic

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.865
form and dissolved form on
both sides of this reaction

00:03:53.865 --> 00:03:56.207
and so you can view it as a
spectator, and that's actually

00:03:56.207 --> 00:03:57.040
what it's called.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.648
It's called a spectator ion.

00:03:59.648 --> 00:04:00.815
Spectator ion.

00:04:04.971 --> 00:04:06.308
If you wanna think of it in human terms,

00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:10.168
it's kind of out there and
watching the reaction happen.

00:04:10.168 --> 00:04:12.837
Its value in this reaction
is, well it was part of the

00:04:12.837 --> 00:04:14.702
sodium chloride and its providing ...

00:04:14.702 --> 00:04:17.546
So the sodium chloride
is providing the chloride

00:04:17.546 --> 00:04:19.912
that eventually forms the silver chloride,

00:04:19.912 --> 00:04:22.962
but the sodium is just kind of watching.

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:26.344
Similarly, you have the nitrate.

00:04:26.344 --> 00:04:30.036
The nitrate is dissolved
on the left and the nitrate

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:31.373
is dissolved on the right.

00:04:31.373 --> 00:04:35.170
So the nitrate is also a spectator ion.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.991
So if you wanna go from
a complete ionic equation

00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:41.594
to a net ionic equation, which
really deals with the things

00:04:41.594 --> 00:04:46.338
that aren't spectators,
well you just get rid of

00:04:46.338 --> 00:04:47.842
the spectator ions.

00:04:47.842 --> 00:04:48.675
You get rid of that.

00:04:48.675 --> 00:04:49.508
You get rid of that.

00:04:49.508 --> 00:04:50.341
You get rid of that.

00:04:50.341 --> 00:04:52.880
You get rid of that, and then
you see what is left over.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.801
Well what we have leftover is we have some

00:04:55.801 --> 00:04:59.875
dissolved chloride, and
we write aqueous to show

00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:03.984
that it is dissolved, plus
some dissolved silver,

00:05:03.984 --> 00:05:06.853
plus some dissolved silver.

00:05:06.853 --> 00:05:10.787
Once again, to show that it's
dissolved we write aqueous

00:05:10.787 --> 00:05:13.929
and if you put those two
together, you are going to get

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:15.679
some solid silver ...

00:05:16.761 --> 00:05:18.594
Solid silver chloride.

00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:26.068
And what's useful about this
form, one it's more compact

00:05:26.068 --> 00:05:29.243
and it's very clear what
is actually reacting,

00:05:29.243 --> 00:05:31.734
what is being used to
build, and you can say hey,

00:05:31.734 --> 00:05:35.111
however you get your
chloride into the solution,

00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:38.408
however you get your
silver into the solution,

00:05:38.408 --> 00:05:40.153
these are the things that
are going to react to form

00:05:40.153 --> 00:05:41.233
the solid.

00:05:41.233 --> 00:05:43.346
Instead of using sodium
chloride, maybe you use

00:05:43.346 --> 00:05:46.353
potassium chloride and
the potassium in that case

00:05:46.353 --> 00:05:49.035
would be a spectator ion.

00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:51.989
But either way your net
ionic equation would be what

00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:53.072
we have here.
