00:00:06.808 --> 00:00:08.557
Each time you take a step,

00:00:08.557 --> 00:00:12.219
200 muscles work in unison
to lift your foot,

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.918
propel it forward,

00:00:13.918 --> 00:00:15.693
and set it down.

00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:20.703
It's just one of the many thousands
of tasks performed by the muscular system.

00:00:20.703 --> 00:00:24.550
This network of over 650 muscles
covers the body

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.400
and is the reason we can blink,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.650
smile,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.010
run,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.450
jump,

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.909
and stand upright.

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:35.741
It's even responsible for 
the heart's dependable thump.

00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:39.720
First, what exactly 
is the muscular system?

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.218
It's made up of three main muscle types:

00:00:42.218 --> 00:00:46.470
skeletal muscle, which attaches
via tendons to our bones,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.260
cardiac muscle, which is only
found in the heart,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.562
and smooth muscle, which lines
the blood vessels and certain organs,

00:00:54.562 --> 00:00:57.510
like the intestine and uterus.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.942
All three types are 
made up of muscle cells,

00:00:59.942 --> 00:01:03.772
also known as fibers,
bundled tightly together.

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:06.361
These bundles receive signals from
the nervous system

00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:11.720
that contract the fibers, which in turn
generates force and motion.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.382
This produces almost all
the movements we make.

00:01:14.382 --> 00:01:16.142
Some of the only parts of the body

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:18.834
whose motions aren't governed 
by the muscular system

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:20.992
are sperm cells,

00:01:20.992 --> 00:01:23.344
the hair-like cilia in our airways,

00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:25.491
and certain white blood cells.

00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:29.044
Muscle contraction can be split
into three main types.

00:01:29.044 --> 00:01:32.552
The first two, shortening muscle fibers
and lengthening them,

00:01:32.552 --> 00:01:34.989
generate opposing forces.

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:38.974
So the biceps will shorten
while the triceps will lengthen or relax,

00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:42.781
pulling up the arm and making it 
bend at the elbow.

00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:45.349
This allows us to, say, pick up a book,

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:49.449
or if the muscle relationship 
is reversed, put it down.

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:53.714
This complementary partnership
exists throughout the muscular system.

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:57.945
The third type of contraction
creates a stabilizing force.

00:01:57.945 --> 00:02:01.525
In these cases, the muscle fibers
don't change in length,

00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:04.165
but instead keep the muscles rigid.

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:08.274
This allows us to grip a mug of coffee
or lean against a wall.

00:02:08.274 --> 00:02:13.386
It also maintains our posture
by holding us upright.

00:02:13.386 --> 00:02:16.526
Skeletal muscles form the bulk
of the muscular system,

00:02:16.526 --> 00:02:19.705
make up about 30-40% of the body's weight,

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:22.286
and generate most of its motion.

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:26.242
Some muscles are familiar to us,
like the pectorals and the biceps.

00:02:26.242 --> 00:02:29.362
Others may be less so,
like the buccinator,

00:02:29.362 --> 00:02:32.493
a muscle that attaches your cheek
to your teeth,

00:02:32.493 --> 00:02:34.532
or the body's tiniest skeletal muscle,

00:02:34.532 --> 00:02:38.143
a one-millimeter-long tissue fragment
called the stapedius

00:02:38.143 --> 00:02:41.125
that's nestled deep inside the ear.

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:45.733
Wherever they occur, skeletal muscles are
connected to the somatic nervous system,

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:49.504
which gives us almost complete control
over their movements.

00:02:49.504 --> 00:02:52.833
This muscle group also contains
two types of muscle fibers

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:58.764
to refine our motions even further,
slow-twitch and fast-twitch.

00:02:58.764 --> 00:03:01.783
Fast-twitch fibers react instantly
when triggered

00:03:01.783 --> 00:03:04.805
but quickly use up their energy
and tire out.

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:07.956
Slow-twitch fibers, on the other hand,
are endurance cells.

00:03:07.956 --> 00:03:12.315
They react and use energy slowly
so they can work for longer periods.

00:03:12.315 --> 00:03:15.586
A sprinter will accumulate more
fast-twitch muscles in her legs

00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:17.255
through continuous practice,

00:03:17.255 --> 00:03:21.425
enabling her to quickly, if briefly,
pick up the pace,

00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:24.156
whereas back muscles contain 
more slow-twitch muscles

00:03:24.156 --> 00:03:27.685
to maintain your posture all day.

00:03:27.685 --> 00:03:31.116
Unlike the skeletal muscles, the body's
cardiac and smooth muscles

00:03:31.116 --> 00:03:33.605
are managed by 
the autonomic nervous system

00:03:33.605 --> 00:03:35.616
beyond our direct control.

00:03:35.616 --> 00:03:38.686
That makes your heart thump
roughly 3 billion times

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:40.427
over the course of your life,

00:03:40.427 --> 00:03:43.347
which supplies the body 
with blood and oxygen.

00:03:43.347 --> 00:03:46.666
Autonomic control also contracts
and relaxes smooth muscle

00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:48.549
in a rhythmic cycle.

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.106
That pumps blood through the smooth
internal walls of blood vessels,

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:56.367
enables the intestine to constrict and
push food through the digestive system,

00:03:56.367 --> 00:04:01.708
and allows the uterus to contract
when a person is giving birth.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:06.828
As muscles work, they also use energy
and produce an important byproduct, heat.

00:04:06.828 --> 00:04:10.896
In fact, muscle provides 
about 85% of your warmth,

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:14.616
which the heart and blood vessels
then spread evenly across the body

00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:15.928
via the blood.

00:04:15.928 --> 00:04:18.755
Without that, we couldn't maintain
the temperature necessary

00:04:18.755 --> 00:04:20.495
for our survival.

00:04:20.495 --> 00:04:23.670
The muscular system 
may be largely invisible to us,

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.619
but it leaves its mark on almost
everything we do,

00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:30.077
whether it's the blink of an eye
or a race to the finish line.
