00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.833
Like all organs in the human body, 

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:07.666
the brain receives oxygen and nutrition from blood flowing through small vascular vessels.

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:12.666
The blood vessels that supply the brain form a special structure called the blood-brain barrier,

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:16.166
which is composed of endothelial cells that line the vessels, 

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:22.000
and astrocytes and pericytes on the outside that interface with neuronal cells in the brain.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.166
This barrier is highly selective, 

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:29.000
and prevents toxins and other large molecules, such as antibodies, from entering the brain tissue, 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
while allowing certain small substances, such as glucose, to pass through.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.833
Nutrients and oxygen diffuse from the blood into the brain to feed the neurons and their supporting astrocytes, 

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.666
helping them function normally.

00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:49.500
Then, hormones and metabolic products released from the brain cells diffuse back across the blood-brain barrier

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.000
and into the blood, where they are transported away.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
To learn how the cells of the blood-brain barrier interact with brain cells, 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.333
researchers at the Wyss Institute and Harvard SEAS have developed a linked Blood-Brain Barrier Chip and Brain Chip system. 

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:09.666
The two Blood-Brain Barrier Chips each contain a vascular channel lined with human endothelial cells

00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:16.500
separated by a porous membrane from a parallel, perivascular channel containing cultured brain astrocytes and pericytes.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.333
The Brain Chip contains various types of neurons in one channel

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:25.500
separated from another perivascular channel by a semipermeable membrane.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.000
The perivascular channel of the Brain Chip is microfluidically linked to the two Blood-Brain Barrier Chips, 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.500
allowing scientists to monitor the flow of molecules between the brain and its blood vessels. 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.500
Just like in a living brain, small molecules, such as glucose, flow into the system through the vascular channel and pass into the perivascular channel, 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.166
which leads them to neurons in the Brain Chip.

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:52.666
At the same time, small molecules released from neurons flow out through the same perivascular channel 

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:58.666
and into the second Blood-Brain Barrier Chip, where they pass through the endothelial cells and back into the vascular channel. 

00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:03.833
Large molecules, such as antibodies, flowing through the vascular channel of the Blood-Brain Barrier Chip

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:09.833
do not enter the perivascular channel or reach the neurons in the Brain Chip, again mimicking a living brain. 

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:17.333
Using this system, researchers discovered that the vascular and neuronal cells in chips that are fluidically linked 

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:22.833
produced proteins that are more similar to those naturally found in the human brain and its blood vessels

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:26.000
than the proteins produced by cells on unlinked chips.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.166
In addition, by tracing the paths of labeled glucose molecules,

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:34.833
the researchers found that glucose metabolites produced by the endothelial cells cross the blood-brain barrier and enter brain neurons,

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:40.666
and enter brain neurons, where they are used to manufacture neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and GABA.

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:47.500
This intriguing finding suggests that the health of our brainâ€™s blood vessels could have a direct impact on the way our mind functions.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.000
Researchers are continuing to use this type of fluidically linked Multi-Organ Chip system

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to uncover more about how the brain and other tissues and organs work at the molecular level.
