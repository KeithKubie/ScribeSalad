00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.459
We keep finding planets HUNDREDS of them!

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:08.680
But once we find a planet... then what do
we do with it?

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.090
Hey everybody, Trace here with your Weekly
DNews Space Update.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.750
The first exoplanet was discovered in 1992,
and since then we've confirmed 1800 more.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.551
But discerning anything about these planets
is pretty difficult, because they're so far

00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:26.551
away.

00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:30.380
To simplify the discovery of these exoplanets
NASA launched a planet-hunting telescope named

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.130
after the famous 17th century astronomer Johannes
Kepler.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.820
This week, scientists at NASA announced Kepler's
namesake, in spite of being broken, discovered

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.450
715 new planets!

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.300
To date, they've found indications of over
3,500 planets, but what do we KNOW about these

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.490
alien worlds?

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.220
Well, not a lot.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.120
It's really difficult to FIND planets orbiting
far away stars and we've never seen one up

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.120
close.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.670
The farthest camera from our sun is Voyager
1 -- and it's barely passed out of our solar

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.670
system.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.750
What we can usually determine is the number
of planets orbiting a star, the masses of

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.999
those planets and their relative sizes.

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:12.730
The research depends on excellent observation
and timing paired with state of the art equipment.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.880
Armed with all of these, researchers at CalTech
discovered water on a planet 51 light-years

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.880
from Earth.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.450
It's called Tau Boötis b.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.069
Though scientists have found water vapor on
planets before, the method these researchers

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:26.189
used is new!

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.320
Tau Boötis b is what's called a "hot Jupiter"
because it is close to its sun, and about

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.920
the size of our Jupiter.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.460
Prior to this new method, we had to be watching
at the moment one of these gas giants passed

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.990
in front of its star in order to perceive
evidence of water.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.990
If we missed it, or were at the wrong angle
-- no dice.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.329
But now, astronomers at the Keck Observatory
in Hawaii are using the Near Infrared Echelle

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.810
Spectrograph to determine the glow of a planet's
atmosphere to discern the light wavelengths

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.259
emitted by different molecules.

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.659
In other words, they can now look at a planet's
glow to determine if a planet has WATER.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.829
Spectrographs are used by chemists; you've
probably seen them on CSI and other forensics

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:07.829
shows.

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.980
They use thing learned in 20th century chemistry
to analyze the chemical fingerprint molecules.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.239
For example: atoms of oxygen, sodium or carbon
absorb or reflect specific wavelengths of

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:26.120
light -- so every molecule has its own fingerprint
of colors and hues, and by using infrared,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.500
this spectrograph reveals even MORE information.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.870
Using this new technique, astronomers can
determine which elements are in the atmosphere

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.650
of a planet light-years away just by pointing
their telescope at it..

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.650
MIND.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.650
BLOWN.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.690
I mean, this equipment is pretty standard
science fare, but for astronomers looking

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.530
at exoplanets, it's pretty cool.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.540
Using this new method we can point telescopes
at planets all over the visible universe and

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.299
determine what KIND of planet that is.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.019
If we point it at those in green-zones -- or
a human habitable planet zone -- and find

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.150
water, nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere,
we'll be able to make a map of planets likely

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.170
to support Earth-like life!

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.920
Astronomy is fantastic, old school science.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.670
I looked through a telescope for the first
time when I was a kid and it was breathtaking...

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.670
Have you ever tried it?

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.799
Tell us below in the comments and thanks for
watching!

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.719
See you next week for another Space Friday.
