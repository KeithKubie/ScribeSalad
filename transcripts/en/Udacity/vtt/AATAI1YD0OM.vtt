00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.398
I decided to add some onion power to the recipe, so I

00:00:03.398 --> 00:00:08.109
need to add onion powder to the ingredients list and then also add it down here.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.346
And this line is a little long now, so I'll break it into two lines.

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:16.533
Now I'll use git diff to double-check what changes I've just made and

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.854
I can see the addition of onion powder.

00:00:18.854 --> 00:00:22.360
Add the chili recipe to the staging area and commit.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.590
Now when I run git status, I can see that my branch is ahead by one commit and

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.780
that's the commit I just made.
