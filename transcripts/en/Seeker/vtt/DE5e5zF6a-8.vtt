00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.710
Someday our bodies are going to break down
and we’ll die.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.550
Our brain will decay and disappear forever.But,
what if it didn’t have to?

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.110
Right now there are scientists around the
world working on technology that could one

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.640
day take your brain, and possibly your consciousness,
and upload it onto a computer.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.320
This would be a game changer in neuroscience
and some believe could lead to immortality.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.070
So, how close are we to downloading our brains?

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.449
Okay first off, what do we mean when we say
“downloading the brain?”

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.719
It’s not plugging a cable into your head
and syncing it with your phone.

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.609
It is much more complicated than that because,
well, the brain is really, really complicated.

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:53.940
The information in a brain is encoded in the
synaptic connections between neurons.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.869
This is the major theory of how not only episodic
memories are encoded in the brain, but essentially

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:07.640
all learned knowledge, // Now, there's on
the order of 100 billion neurons in a human

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.260
brain and each of those neurons has tens of
thousands of connections.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.689
You are looking at hundreds of trillions of
those synaptic connections, each of which

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.450
have been tuned by your life's experience.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.080
So in order to download your brain, each one
of those trillions of connections would have

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.810
to be precisely scanned, mapped and digitally
reconstructed on a computer as an emulated

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.810
brain.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.971
The idea would be, that this simulation would
not only behave like a biological brain, but

00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:44.320
could retain the thoughts and memories of
the person whose brain was scanned.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.979
Now, all this is great to think about and
makes for interesting dinner conversation,

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.960
but we have yet to scan a complete human brain
let alone test the theory of consciousness.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.810
That’s not to say some progress hasn’t
been made though.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.159
There are projects all over the world working
on scanning and simulating brains in the name

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.200
of healthcare and medicine.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.670
This is more about unlocking mysteries of
our brain and less about unlocking the key

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.670
to immortality.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.720
...we don’t really understand a system until
we can build it ourselves and manipulate it

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.379
in a computer, and really understand all the
pieces and parts.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.459
In 2014, researchers scanned a roundworm brain
and made a simulation that they installed

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.550
into a simple Lego robot.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.000
And, the simulated brain moved the robot freely
without any human direction.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.769
There have been other projects trying to recreate
the brain through reverse engineering, experiments

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.940
reading and implanting memories and one group
created an algorithm for large scale human

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.450
brain simulations.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.670
But one of the biggest projects involving
actual brain scanning is taking place at the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.680
Allen Institute in Seattle.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.810
They have scanned and digitally reconstructed
a cubic millimeter of a mouse brain.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.939
Yes, this may not seem like a big deal due
to the small scale, but this is the largest

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.310
roadmap of connections of a mammalian brain
ever.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.940
Now, a cubic millimeter is about the size
of a single grain of sand and is home to 100,000

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.370
neurons and over a billion synapses.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:16.260
In order to scan this tiny segment, it first
had to be sectioned 25,000 with each slice being about a fifth the thickness

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.480
of  a human hair. 
were taken. Then 10s of millions of images were taken. This gives you an idea of what

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.709
would need to happen to scan an entire human
brain.

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:32.590
That means that mapping a human brain, a million
times larger, would take a fleet of electron

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.750
microscopes decades in order to image.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.200
Obviously the technology is going to have
to change.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.439
Perhaps not radically but at least in scale
to make something like this happen.

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:49.530
We just don’t have powerful enough microscopes
to be able to accurately and efficiently image

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.650
entire human brain.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.320
And even if we could, the question would still
remain; if we could copy our brain, would

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.349
that also copy our consciousness?

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:02.430
Most neuroscientists would say yes, it's exactly
the same person if it's exactly the same thing,

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.769
but we really don't know if there's some other
issue that we're missing.

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.439
// Still the question is, is the simulation
at a resolution that is sufficient to capture

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.440
who you are?

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.360
The idea is that our thoughts and memories
are basically data, and in theory we should

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.570
be able to copy that data over to a computer
and you’d still be you.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.420
But, what kind of you?

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.800
...if we made a replication of your brain,
there's no reason that you'd be living in

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.580
silence and darkness inside Dropbox.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.350
We'd be giving you fake input.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.530
In theory, if somebody were a computer simulation
// what it would be like is exactly what this

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.730
is like for us.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.190
You'd look around, you'd say, "Here I am,
I can feel my body, I can taste this drink,

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.550
I can eat this pizza," and it in theory wouldn't
be any different.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.750
Or if you want to still experience the real
world, your brain could be installed into

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.980
a robot.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:03.090
The person opens up their robotic eyes, and
they say, "Wow, I'm still here."

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.380
If it works, that's how it should feel.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.970
It should feel like you are coming out of
a surgery and you should be able to call up

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.390
memories from your past, you should be able
to still remember how to do certain things,

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.770
you should have the same likes and dislikes...

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.600
However, advancements in connectomics won’t
come from scientists looking for the fountain

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.190
of youth.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.890
Researchers want to understand the brain better
in order to combat disease and mental disorders.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:35.000
We’d be able to better treat tumors, epilepsy,
addiction and learn more about how we evolved.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.420
This is why people are looking to digitally
map the brain.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.690
In the end, if we are ever able to upload
someone’s consciousness, it may just be

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.850
a bonus to these studies.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.090
Mind uploading is a very long-term project
of humanity.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.900
It's so long-term that I think most of the
people today that are working on it would

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.580
not recognize that they're working on it.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.000
The desire is there to scan and map an
entire human brain.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.910
That process may lay the groundwork for a
brave volunteer to have their brain removed

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.820
and digitized which might lead to the first
immortal being.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.750
We just have to wait for technology to catch
up with our ambition.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.850
So, how close are we to downloading the human
brain?

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:15.900
We're nowhere close.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.500
We can't even download a fruit fly....

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.070
We can image small pieces of brain tissue,
or small organisms brains.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:30.320
But, we don't know enough about how the nervous
system works in order to interpret those images

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.210
and create a simulation of that.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.620
With the technology the we have right now,
we're nowhere close.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.850
But the road seems clear enough to get there,
unless there's some giant surprise that we

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:40.970
run into.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.370
It seems like each year as technology gets
better and better, we get higher and higher

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.110
resolution on what's going on.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.910
It's a clear path to get there.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.620
I mean, unless we already are there and you
are currently watching this in a computer

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.280
simulated world where nothing around you really
exists.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.680
