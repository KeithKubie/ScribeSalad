00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.900
MALE SPEAKER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.608
How are we today?

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:09.890
Give me a cheer.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:10.390
Excellent.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.220
I'm very pleased to welcome
Charles Spence to Talks

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.090
at Google.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.180
Charles Spence is a professor
of experimental psychology

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.890
at Oxford University,
and a gastrophysicist,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.960
working at the
interface between chefs,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.495
food companies, and technology.

00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:24.370
I've seen the slides.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.310
They look incredible.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.660
Please join me in
welcoming Charles

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.701
with a round of applause.

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:32.299
CHARLES SPENCE: OK.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.612
So it's a pleasure to be with
you here this lunch time,

00:00:34.612 --> 00:00:36.570
and tell you a little
bit about the research we

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.220
do in Oxford, but also with
food companies and chefs

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.370
around the world.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.790
It's sort of this interface
of psychology, neuroscience,

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.341
technology, and
fine dining, it has

00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:47.590
some of the insights that
are emerging from the latest

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.200
kind of research at
this kind of interface,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.520
are starting to work their
way out to home dining,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.600
to a variety of real
world situations,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.030
to hopefully allow us
all to eat a little more

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.840
healthfully in the future.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.630
And it's all kind of premised on
this idea of the perfect meal,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.875
the title of the book.

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:06.000
Just feel the weight in
your hands and you'll know,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.160
there's quality there.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.820
And the opening quote from
the book, from MFK Fisher,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.580
is one that kind of inspires
a lot of our thinking.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.750
"That once at least, in
the life of every human,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.050
whether he be brute
or trembling daffodil,

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.280
comes a moment of complete
gastronomic satisfaction.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.927
It is, I am sure, as much a
matter of spirit as of body.

00:01:23.927 --> 00:01:24.760
Everything is right.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.900
Nothing jars.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.830
There's a kind of harmony
with every sensation

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.930
and emotion melted into
one chord of well-being."

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.680
If we all think back in our
past over the last few years,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.289
we've all had that kind of
perfect meal experience.

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:38.830
My colleagues sort
of think, well, we

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.862
can't study it, because it's
kind of different for each

00:01:40.862 --> 00:01:41.460
and every one of you.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.835
Maybe for some of you, it's
going for your gastro tourism

00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:45.890
to some fancy Michelin
starred restaurant

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.200
on the other side of the world.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.033
For others, it might
be nothing more complex

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:51.520
than a picnic on a summer's
day in the English countryside.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.259
Different for each
and every one of us,

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.800
but I think that we can sort of
study that perfect meal, what

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.880
makes it great, try and
extract some generalizations

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.880
can be used in everyday life
to kind of nudge our meal

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.460
experiences in the
right direction

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.830
to be more stimulating,
more engaging, more

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.871
memorable, and perhaps
more healthy as well.

00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:14.370
I'm certainly not the first to
think about the perfect meal.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.370
It is a topic that goes
back at least a century.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.050
You find some the first
sort of mentions from 1894

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.085
from French chemist, Berthelot,
talking about the perfect meal

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:24.650
and what it would be like
sometime around about today.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.500
And for all of the chemists,
for the feminist writers,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.340
and also for the sort
of serious scientists,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.930
it was this, the meal in a pill.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.750
So he was imagining in
1894, thereabouts, what

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.730
it would be like in a century.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.450
And the idea of
sitting down to eat

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.980
and wasting an hour of your
day with a multi-course meal

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.260
seems bizarre.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.510
Surely in the future, we'll
have a pill, we'll pop it.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.580
And that will sustain
us through the day

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.660
and we'll need nothing else.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.350
Just take this quote
from-- where has he gone?

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.680
"Looking Forward: A Dream
of the United States

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.450
of the Americas in 1999,"
written in 1899 by Arthur Bird.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.160
"In order to save
time, people in 1999,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.000
often dined on a pill, a
small pellet which contained

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.545
highly nutritious food.

00:03:09.545 --> 00:03:11.830
They had little inclination
to stretch their legs

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.330
under a table for
an hour at a time

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.040
while masticating on
an eight course dinner.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.270
The busy man of 1999 took a
soup pill or a concentrated meat

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.670
pill for his noon day lunch.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.800
He dispatched these while
working at his desk."

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.550
So he could be more
efficient as a result.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.758
That's what they thought
was going to happen in 1999,

00:03:26.758 --> 00:03:28.770
but it has not come
to pass obviously.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.270
And why not?

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.310
Because I think food is
so much more than just

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.710
about nutrition and sustenance.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.390
There's a whole
sort of psychology

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.005
behind our experience
of food, the way we eat

00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:40.710
and what we enjoy eating.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.450
And that is the theme for
the book, "The Perfect Meal."

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.800
Myself, I worked together
with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.465
my co-author, working in
a psychology department

00:03:48.465 --> 00:03:51.530
at Oxford, trying to
understand the factors that

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.420
make one meal experience
better than another

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.485
or that it can ruin a
great evening simply

00:03:56.485 --> 00:04:00.345
by just getting one sensory
cue or trigger wrong.

00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:02.830
And this is what we can
think of as gastrophysics,

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.640
the new sciences of the table,
which means since 1984, when

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.782
Harold McGee came out with
his "On Food and Cooking,"

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:11.490
that was a whole three
decades we've had,

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.820
a little over, of sort of
science in the back of house,

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.800
science in the kitchen, science
of new techniques of food

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.060
preparation, a rotovaps and sous
vide and all sorts of stuff,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.070
changing the way that
food is prepared,

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.731
at least in the
hands of some chefs.

00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:27.230
We've also had the
kind of emergence

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.950
of all sorts of new
ingredients as well

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.170
to deliver textures
and spumes and foams

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.340
and all kinds of stuff
we had never had before.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.780
Three decades, that's
taken us a long way,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.000
and it's certainly
changed the way

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.530
that we eat, at least
sometimes, but it's

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.700
all science in the kitchen.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.360
Where I think it's
changing now, and that's

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.800
kind of the idea
of gastrophysics,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.727
is it's science moving
to the front of house,

00:04:45.727 --> 00:04:47.435
to the dining tables,
in the restaurants,

00:04:47.435 --> 00:04:50.420
because they're easy to study,
or can be, through to the home

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.830
dining, anywhere where we eat.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.417
It's a science of the diner.

00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:54.375
And it's gastrophysics.

00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:58.270
So it's gastronomy, we're
interested in high end

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.860
food in the first instance.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.600
But also physics
from psychophysics,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.600
which is the kind of
psychology, the measurement

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.640
of the human-- what
different inputs lead

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.332
to different kind of outputs.

00:05:08.332 --> 00:05:10.040
Normally it's done
with lights and sounds

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.050
in front of a computer screen,
but we want the gastrophysics

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.380
of real food experiences.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.360
Study what matters, what doesn't
matter, and how to create

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.420
insights that are actionable
in the matter where or who

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.477
you might be serving food to.

00:05:25.477 --> 00:05:27.060
I keep coming back
this sort of thing,

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.550
that food is so much more
than just about food.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.490
So, imagine yourself
as the chef,

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.406
and you've learned
all the techniques.

00:05:33.406 --> 00:05:35.280
And until recently you'd
kind of think, well,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.530
if I know I source my
ingredients locally.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.926
I prepare them beautifully.

00:05:38.926 --> 00:05:40.300
Perhaps I give a
little attention

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.160
to how the food
appears on the plate.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.300
If I do all that,
it'll be enough.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.070
I can deliver great
meal experiences.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.140
But in fact, I think,
you need to know

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.430
about the mind of the
diner as well in order

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.660
to change people's
behavior for the better

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.540
to deliver great
meal experiences.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.210
What I'm seeing now,
kind of inspired

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.960
by the likes of Ferran Adria
in Spain and Heston Blumenthal,

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.950
just up the road in Bray, is a
whole generation of young chefs

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.280
who are popping up, starting
up, opening gastropubs,

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.675
culinary artistry
events in the UK

00:06:11.675 --> 00:06:13.800
and elsewhere, who for the
first time are thinking,

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.024
I need to know how to
make great tasting food.

00:06:16.024 --> 00:06:17.440
But on top of that,
I want to know

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.880
what's going in the head
of my diner or order

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.100
to really meet
their expectations

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.310
or completely confound
their expectations.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.020
But I need to know
what's in here.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.270
So a couple of examples of why
you need to know more than just

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.350
about how to prepare food well.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.440
First one is this
kind of ugly beast

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.760
of the deep, the Patagonian
toothfish that has been

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.970
on restaurant menus for years.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.490
It just was never very popular.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.740
Would you order it yourself
on a menu in a restaurant?

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.790
Probably not.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.060
If you saw the picture,
definitely not.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.840
But simply a little
bit of rebranding

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.750
calling this Chilean sea
bass, exactly the same fish,

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.740
looks still as ugly.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.530
But suddenly sales increased
by 1,300% in Australia,

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.370
North America, in the UK
simply by change of name,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.330
completely changes
our food behavior,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.829
what we choose to eat
and what we don't.

00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:06.370
Sure, great food,
but on top of that,

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.670
you need to know
what to call it.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.370
Another kind of classic example
of why the chef, I think,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.610
needs to know about what's
going on in the diner's mind.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.950
Here we have a dish, and
within the blink of an eye,

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.770
your brain has
decided what it is.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.922
Your brain is a
prediction engine,

00:07:21.922 --> 00:07:23.630
trying to figure out
where the nutritious

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.370
food is in the environment.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.130
So you see that and
within 150 milliseconds,

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.390
your brain's decided, yeah,
that's probably ice cream,

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.380
probably cold, probably sweet.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.310
I'll probably like it.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.559
Maybe I'll have a scoop later.

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:34.910
But I'd have to go to the gym.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.762
And probably the
flavor is a red fruit,

00:07:36.762 --> 00:07:38.720
a raspberry or strawberry,
something like that.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.928
All went through your mind
without you thinking, just

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:42.242
in the blink of an eye or less.

00:07:42.242 --> 00:07:43.700
But the only problem
is, that's not

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.460
the flavor of this ice cream.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:50.120
So this is actually a frozen
savory ice, popular in the UK

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.500
a century ago.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.830
And this comes from
the Fat Duck Kitchens.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.520
So it could be a smoked salmon
ice cream or a frozen crab

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.569
bisque ice cream.

00:08:00.569 --> 00:08:01.985
So the chef makes
this dish, maybe

00:08:01.985 --> 00:08:03.840
is the world's top
chef at the time.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.030
He thinks it's
seasoned perfectly.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.330
It fits into sort of the
theme of historic dining.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.871
He brings it out and gives it
to some of his preferred guests

00:08:10.871 --> 00:08:12.921
who are regulars at the
Fat Duck restaurant.

00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:15.170
But when they put it in their
mouth and they taste it,

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.352
they're going to go, ugh.

00:08:16.352 --> 00:08:17.060
I didn't like it.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.000
It's too salty.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.327
But the problem was, the
chef thought it was perfect.

00:08:21.327 --> 00:08:22.410
He's the world's top chef.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.910
But the diner said, no, it's
too salty, pulls a funny face,

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.620
does not like at the
time and does not

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.130
like it when they come back
two or three weeks later.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.270
It will remain salty
in their experience.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.289
The problem here is a
matter of expectations.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:34.664
Because the diner
was thinking it

00:08:34.664 --> 00:08:37.460
was going to be a sweet-tasting
strawberry or raspberry ice

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.039
cream.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.850
In fact, it was
savory and salty.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.909
Their expectations
were disconfirmed.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.099
They didn't like it.

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:44.640
Whereas if I just
tell you before you

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.240
put a spoonful of
this to your lips,

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.670
that this is food 386, a
term that means nothing

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.030
to any of us, kind of
vaguely scientific sounding.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.961
But that title for
the dish is enough

00:08:55.961 --> 00:08:58.210
that when I give you, here,
a spoonful of my new dish,

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.642
food 386, suddenly
when you taste it,

00:09:00.642 --> 00:09:02.350
you'll kind of withhold
your expectations

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:06.080
and it will taste seasoned
just right, the way the chef

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.184
experiences it.

00:09:07.184 --> 00:09:08.850
So no matter what you
do in the kitchen,

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.891
if you don't know the
expectations of your diner,

00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:12.870
you can't really
predict how they're

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.650
going to respond or optimize
the meal experience.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.519
And if vision is
so important, we

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:21.060
might think about
the future of food.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.340
Here we've got original sushi
on the left, augmented reality

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.410
sushi on the right.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.030
This, we were working with
Katsu Kojima over in Japan.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.010
There was about 70
vision scientists

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.800
thinking about a time, sometime
in the future, when maybe we've

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.500
fished the seas to extinction
of all our favorite sushi fish.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.230
Could we, with our
headset, like the one

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.730
you see there on the
bottom right here.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:42.850
Maybe you've been
watching your movies.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.724
Then you have your dinner
and we can give you

00:09:44.724 --> 00:09:47.450
the visual impression through
the headset, of your best

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.170
tasting, now extinct
fish on your sushi,

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.630
feed you the other
one, and maybe

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.820
for what you eat, but
eye is so important,

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.630
you have as good an
experience as you

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.610
would have done if you
could somehow still find

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:58.910
that now extinct fish.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:59.450
Possibly.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.220
Possibly not.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.276
But again, it's this
idea of using technology

00:10:02.276 --> 00:10:03.650
and our knowledge
of neuroscience

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.220
to deliver new, different
food experiences.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.872
Sometimes just more stimulating
than anything we've had before.

00:10:08.872 --> 00:10:10.580
At other times, trying
to think about how

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.610
to nudge people towards
healthier eating behaviors.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.541
OK.

00:10:16.541 --> 00:10:18.790
And food, as I say, it's so
much more than about food.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.920
It's about the naming
and about expectations.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.264
But it's also about mood
and those we dine with.

00:10:25.264 --> 00:10:26.680
It's kind of social,
fundamentally

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.170
a social activity.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.530
So I see chefs
who think, as they

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.577
have done for decades,
about palate cleansers.

00:10:34.577 --> 00:10:35.660
We're in for a fancy meal.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.360
We should have a palate
cleanser to clear up palette

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.074
before the first of the
chef's real dishes comes out.

00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:41.990
And what will that be?

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.220
That will be maybe
a lime sorbet,

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.250
something acidic to cut
through something, apparently,

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.680
on your tongue.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.260
But I think maybe the tongue
is the least interesting bit

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.900
of our experience of flavor.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.060
We experience flavors
here in the brain.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.330
So if I want to clean your
palette, what I really

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.640
want to do is clean your
mind, a mental palate cleanser

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.890
to get you into the right mood.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.681
Because I know if you're
in the right mood,

00:11:02.681 --> 00:11:04.994
you'll enjoy the
food that much more.

00:11:04.994 --> 00:11:06.410
And this is the
intuitive solution

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.190
of the Chef Denis Martin,
who has a two Michelin star

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.060
restaurant in Vevey
in Switzerland

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.880
between Charlie Chaplin's
final resting house and Nestle

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.614
headquarters.

00:11:15.614 --> 00:11:16.780
He's got two Michelin stars.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.071
He kind of wants the third one.

00:11:18.071 --> 00:11:19.590
Hasn't quite come yet.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.815
Has a single sitting
dining experience,

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:24.440
based in a knitting
museum, which might

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.910
be part of the problem there.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:26.580
But it's very inventive.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.079
It's smoke and
mirrors and all sorts

00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:31.795
of great, molecular or
modernist culinary practises.

00:11:31.795 --> 00:11:33.920
When you go for that single
sitting dinner service,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.492
you all arrive,
you're there at 7:00.

00:11:36.492 --> 00:11:38.950
And you think well, we're all
here now and you look around.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.190
And there's nothing on the
tables, no knives, no forks,

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.440
no glassware, nothing, just
this sitting on the middle

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.300
of each and every table.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.050
And people would wait
and think, well, I'm

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.425
sure the first course is going
to come out sometime soon.

00:11:49.425 --> 00:11:50.100
But it won't.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.070
Nothing will happen until some
curious diner picks that thing

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:55.000
up off the table,
wondering whether it's

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.760
the salt or the pepper
shaker with a kind

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.220
of peculiar Swiss twist.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.970
When they do that, when they
pick that little device up,

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:06.760
look underneath, it's
a silly, one euro toy.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.040
It'll make a mooing sound.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.860
The diner will
laugh in surprise.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.890
And then within a few
moments, every table

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.430
in that two Michelin
star restaurant

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.230
will have their moo
cows in the air,

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.290
a chorus of mooing cows in a
restaurant full of laughing

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.260
diners.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.180
The mood has been
elevated, enhanced,

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.710
and that is the
moment when Denis

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.200
brings out the first dish,
the mental palate cleanser.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.710
Very simple, very easy.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.790
I see other chefs in
culinary institutes

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.730
trying to think about
how to elevate the mood.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.374
Do you put joke
cards on the table?

00:12:32.374 --> 00:12:34.290
Or do you play some sort
of musical video clip

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.498
that makes everyone laugh
like the laughing policeman

00:12:36.498 --> 00:12:39.690
or that video you see it
on YouTube of those four

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:40.717
quintuplets of babies.

00:12:40.717 --> 00:12:42.800
One starts laughing and
that's starts the next one

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.250
and that starts the next one.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:44.300
And they just cannot stop.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.210
You can't watch that video
without yourself laughing,

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:46.710
I think.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.220
And that could be a nice
mental palate cleanser.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.150
Because food is always so much
more than just about the food.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.940
It's all happening up here
in your mind, rather than,

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.417
I think, on your tongue
or in your mouth.

00:12:59.417 --> 00:13:01.000
So we're looking how
to work sometimes

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.050
with some of the top chefs to
see how they have delivered

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.880
brilliant dining
experiences and trying

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.480
to turn that into research or
science and then kind of export

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.950
it out to whoever else.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.110
But very often, we sort
of work more these days

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.900
with younger chefs,
those who have,

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.610
for the first time
started to think

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.540
about the minds of their diners.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.490
And think about some
of the simple tricks

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.767
that they could
utilize to enhance

00:13:22.767 --> 00:13:23.850
the quality of their food.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.650
And it's not about using
these tricks to serve

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.480
bad food that will seem good.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.740
It's about using the best
of your culinary skills

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.010
together with the
best of gastrophysics

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.820
to deliver something
better yet again.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.290
And here we have the results
from a restaurant study

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.380
done in Scotland last year.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:46.090
We have 140 diners in a Scottish
hotel in a fancy restaurant.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.650
Half of those diners are served
this dish of Scottish fish

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.290
for their main course, but
they're given a heavy knife

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.430
and fork in their hands.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.590
The other half of
the diners are eating

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.000
the same food on the same
day in the same restaurant

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.186
have been given the light
canteen knife and fork instead.

00:13:59.186 --> 00:14:00.560
They're all eating
the same food.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.080
We asked them, how much
do you like the food?

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.216
How artistic does it
seemed to be plated to you?

00:14:04.216 --> 00:14:05.840
And in this context,
how much would you

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.310
be willing to pay for that dish
in a place like you are today?

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:12.060
And what we find, with the
heavy knife and fork in hand,

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.370
is people think the
food looks more artistic

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.710
and they're willing to
pay significantly more

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.480
for exactly the same
output from the kitchen.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.760
A trend towards increased
liking didn't quite

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.294
reach significance here.

00:14:24.294 --> 00:14:25.960
So when I go to those
kind of gastropubs

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.270
and these young chefs popping up
in the Oxfordshire countryside,

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.980
near the Oxford
department, I see

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.820
them so passionate
about the food

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.550
that they're trying to create.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.190
But sometimes, they think well,
we can't afford heavy cutlery.

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.775
It's an expensive investment.

00:14:38.775 --> 00:14:40.930
But you see results
like this and say, no,

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.830
the way to the knife
and fork should not

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.664
matter to a tasting
experience, but it does.

00:14:45.664 --> 00:14:47.830
And if you go, and you think
carefully next time you

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.560
go to the Fat Duck
Restaurant, and you finally

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.460
get the cutlery, on course
three, four, or five,

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.760
you realize how heavy it is, and
realize, intuitively perhaps,

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.680
the culinary team have worked
that into the experience.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.630
So heavier cup, heavier
glass, heavy can,

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.320
seems to-- heavier
book I think as well,

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.950
seems to make the
thing even better.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.257
I say, the other chefs, they
care so much about the food.

00:15:11.257 --> 00:15:13.090
And you go to an Indian
restaurant in Oxford

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:16.680
with an up and coming chef and
he's passionate about the food.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.570
But he doesn't think
about the music.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.270
And you're there in
the middle of July,

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.620
eating this Indian food, and the
restaurant manager got his iPad

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.460
on, blaring out Christmas
carols or something else that's

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.140
completely incongruent with the
food, with the time of year,

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.830
and it does spoil, to some
degree, the experience.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.264
You cannot just concentrate
on the food all the time.

00:15:34.264 --> 00:15:35.680
Out brain is picking
up this stuff

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.500
about the lighting, the smells,
and music, the chair we're

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.340
sitting on, even the
table we're sitting at

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.950
as well as the
waiter, that cutlery,

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.970
and integrating it
into a final judgment

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.340
about how much we like
that food and how much we

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.729
enjoyed the experience.

00:15:48.729 --> 00:15:51.270
I also want stress, while some
of the underlying neuroscience

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.380
is kind of complicated, some
of the insights, I think,

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.880
are very actionable
and quite simple

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.311
for any chef, wherever in the
world they might be working.

00:15:58.311 --> 00:15:59.852
And here's another
sort of simple one

00:15:59.852 --> 00:16:02.690
that's come out of our work with
the Alicia Foundation, Ferran

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.120
Adria's kind of test
research kitchens,

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.020
just outside Barcelona.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.350
And here we have a
dessert that looks again,

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.270
suspiciously like a
strawberry ice cream.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.410
And in this case it is.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:12.960
You're safe.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.020
Your eyes did not mislead you.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.170
But in this study, we
served exactly the same chef

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.572
prepared strawberry dessert,
either on a black plate

00:16:21.572 --> 00:16:22.280
or a white plate.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.710
About 30 or 40 people
eating the desert

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.820
from each plate on the
same day in the same sort

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.451
of a restaurant-like
environment.

00:16:28.451 --> 00:16:30.200
We asked them how sweet
was the ice cream.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.200
How much do you like it?

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.520
How fruity, and so on.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.240
And what we find is that one
of those plates tastes sweeter.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.340
Same batch of ice cream,
but one of those plates

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.962
tastes 10% sweeter.

00:16:41.962 --> 00:16:43.420
Specifically, those
who were eating

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.440
from the round,
white plate, say this

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.220
tastes 10% sweeter,
about 15% more flavorful

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.550
than exactly the same dish
served on a black plate.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:55.020
If that black plate was angular,
it would taste even less.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.890
So round and white
seems to be very sweet.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.640
Black and angular
is not at all sweet.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.260
And we've done this research
with the Alicia Foundation

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:01.769
in Spain.

00:17:01.769 --> 00:17:03.310
We've been to the
Paul Bocuse Cookery

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.700
School, the heart of
traditional French cuisine,

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.170
sustaining those French values.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.837
They've been sort of
interested in this.

00:17:09.837 --> 00:17:12.045
Now we know the plate matters,
even though we know it

00:17:12.045 --> 00:17:12.560
shouldn't.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.205
We want to know how it impacts
performance and experience.

00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:18.359
And with diners paying in their
restaurant in the Paul Bocuse

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:21.329
Chateau just outside Lyon,
the same sort of result

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:22.510
holds up again.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.660
Things that shouldn't
matter, but they really do.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.369
Food is so much more
than just the food.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.540
OK.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.950
Really, that first
impression we get of food,

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.520
be it the color of
the red dessert.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.970
Is it frozen salmon,
smoked salmon,

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.350
or is it really strawberry,
plays a key part

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.841
in sitting our expectations.

00:17:42.841 --> 00:17:44.340
Then when we come
to taste the food,

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.990
those expectations
anchor our experience.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.040
And maybe very
often, we really live

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.064
in a world of our expectations.

00:17:51.064 --> 00:17:53.230
We occasionally test the
world and see, is it like I

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.110
expected it to be?

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.010
And if it is, more
or less, we carry

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.990
on living in our predicted
worlds as it were.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.510
So that first visual
impression is important.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.570
With that in mind, we
see, and especially

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.880
with all those diners these
days who are increasingly--

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.810
their experience of
fine dining restaurants

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:11.800
is all about the pictures
that they take and share

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.600
with their friends, that are
almost distracting some diners

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.870
now from their meal.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.060
The chef brings the dish
out to the table, served

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.030
at just the right
temperature and the diner

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.101
wants to orient it and
then change the lighting,

00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:25.600
stand up, take a picture, share
with their friends, by which

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.430
time the food is cold.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.956
But really, we cannot ignore
the eye appeal of a dish now,

00:18:29.956 --> 00:18:32.330
both the expectations it sets
for the diner when they are

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:36.710
there, but also how it's
perceived online, on TV,

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.902
via social networks or
an Instagram of plating.

00:18:40.902 --> 00:18:42.110
Does it really matter though?

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.460
Does it matter how the
food looks to its taste?

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.690
That was a question
that young chef Charles

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.700
Michelle, working in the
lab in Oxford came up with.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.940
He was in the Museum of
Modern Art in New York

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.550
staring at this
painting, Kandinsky 201.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.680
It actually hangs
the other way up,

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.889
if anyone's familiar with it.

00:19:01.889 --> 00:19:03.721
But he saw a mushroom
up there and mushrooms

00:19:03.721 --> 00:19:05.810
ought to be kind of up
right and not upside down,

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.500
do he inverted the painting.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.900
But when he read the
panel beside the painting.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.610
Kandinsky-- it was
meant to be trying

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.660
to convey emotion directly,
the artist talking

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.840
through color and form.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.370
And the chef is thinking,
well, aren't I an artist too?

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.260
I can create visually
stunning stuff.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.200
Why can't I communicate
through my food, emotion

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.080
directly through color and form?

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.120
And so this is Charles
Michelle's interpretation

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.690
of Kandinsky's 201.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.360
The Kandinsky on a plate.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.610
Or in this case served on a
canvas, a painting canvas,

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.955
about a 31 element salad.

00:19:39.955 --> 00:19:41.580
You might even eat
it with a paintbrush

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.590
if we're feeling
a bit adventurous.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.799
So you're eating the
painting with a paintbrush.

00:19:45.799 --> 00:19:48.090
The paintbrush may be scented
with the some truffle oil

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:48.780
or something.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.590
And as you eat the
dish, this canvas

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.763
will stain with the
colors of those purees

00:19:52.763 --> 00:19:54.512
and you have your own
modernist bit of art

00:19:54.512 --> 00:19:57.205
to take home and hang on the
wall, should you so desire.

00:19:57.205 --> 00:19:57.830
Does it matter?

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:58.670
Yes, it does.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.065
People enjoy the food more
when it's plated artistically.

00:20:01.065 --> 00:20:02.610
They're willing to pay more.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.580
And they may eat more.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.460
Well, in this case it's kind of
a healthy thing to be eating.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.710
What do the numbers look like?

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:08.585
Here you've got them.

00:20:08.585 --> 00:20:12.130
From 160 diners served at
Somerville College in Oxford,

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.170
where I teach, there's
a parent's day.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:15.961
We have all the parents
coming in for lunch

00:20:15.961 --> 00:20:17.700
to see their
nearest and dearest.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.930
Half of the diners served
a regular tossed salad,

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:23.310
half of them on the left,
served a Kandinsky inspired.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:24.962
You've got 80 plates to make.

00:20:24.962 --> 00:20:26.670
You can't do the full
work, but something

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.510
in the right direction
Kandinksy inspired dish,

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.510
and you see how much
people are willing to pay,

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.550
a more than doubling
of price for exactly

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:37.360
the same ingredients served to
exactly the same people, simply

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.730
by getting the eye
appeal, jut right.

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:42.266
Making it look visually as
stunning as it could be.

00:20:42.266 --> 00:20:44.390
And we're seeing this with
fancy sellers like this.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:45.680
We've seen it in home dining.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.720
Simple garden salads,
the same sorts of effect

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.690
seem to hold true, that
getting the eye appeal right

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.240
is important for the chef.

00:20:56.571 --> 00:20:58.070
But what can we do
to help the chef?

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.861
Maybe the chefs, you
know, intuitively they

00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:01.350
get it all right.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.990
So here's a dish we saw
from Albert Landgraf.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.750
He's a Brazilian
chef, works out of Sao

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.040
Paulo, one of South
top 50 restaurants.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.415
Saw that on the internet one
day and thought, wow, that's

00:21:10.415 --> 00:21:12.170
a visually stunning dish.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.540
It's kind of onions
with tapioca, vinegar,

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.360
and sugar, and spume and stuff.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.070
It's all those pink onions
oriented away from the diner,

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.917
towards 12:00.

00:21:21.917 --> 00:21:23.500
I asked the chef,
why did you do that?

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.291
Can we borrow your
plate for an experiment?

00:21:25.291 --> 00:21:26.070
He says, yes.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.100
I'll just play around
with the plating.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.760
That just seemed to
feel right to me.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.636
But is it right?

00:21:32.636 --> 00:21:35.010
Are we happy to let the chefs
just go on their intuitions

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.240
or can we use the
power of the internet

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.990
to evaluate, crowdsource,
the plating of our cuisine?

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.940
So take that plate of food,
stick it on the internet,

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:49.000
allow people to rotate
the plate, and say,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.450
do you care how this dish
would be served to you if you

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:52.710
were coming to the restaurant?

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.072
What orientation would you like?

00:21:55.072 --> 00:21:58.420
And they'll pick some
orientation for this dish.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.780
Here, from about 200
people tested online.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:05.500
Here, from 2000 people tested
at London's Science Museum.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.297
And for any of you
interested in this,

00:22:07.297 --> 00:22:09.630
currently for the whole year,
there's a cravings exhibit

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.713
and you can take part in
some of these experiments

00:22:11.713 --> 00:22:15.370
on rotating famous chef's plates
online or in the Science Museum

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:15.870
itself.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.750
Here, about 2000 people.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.920
And in fact, when we
average their preferences,

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.740
they do care.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.216
Each dot here is a
person, potential diner.

00:22:23.216 --> 00:22:25.749
And those dots are not equally
spread around the circle.

00:22:25.749 --> 00:22:27.290
The majority of
diners like something

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.950
with the onions
pointing away from them.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.290
In fact, they like it
at about 3.4 degrees

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.295
to the right of 12:00.

00:22:34.295 --> 00:22:35.920
Close enough for the
chef not to worry.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.019
His intuition did bear
out with 2000 people.

00:22:39.019 --> 00:22:40.560
But it's an interesting
idea of space

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.220
here, because the chef can
think about a new dish,

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.220
take a picture of it one
evening, we put online,

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.930
and by the next morning, ready
for that evening service,

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.080
we'll quite often have
500 or 1,000 people

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.240
saying whether they care.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.860
And if they do care,
what is the orientation

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.269
or their preference.

00:22:56.269 --> 00:22:58.560
And that preference may
convert into higher willingness

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.242
to pay or more enjoyment.

00:23:01.242 --> 00:23:02.700
Now what we can do
is say, OK, that

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.930
was a dish as the
chef prepared it.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:05.820
What more can we do?

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.220
Well, we can hack the plate now.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.930
We can take some of those
dishes from famous chefs,

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.080
take out the elements, say,
is three the right number?

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.890
And chefs are often told odds
better than even numbers.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:19.264
Would you like it if all the
onions pointed to the right,

00:23:19.264 --> 00:23:21.920
to the up, to the inside,
all in different directions?

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.460
We can hack the plate.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.390
Put it online and next morning,
have hundreds or possibly

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:29.232
thousands of people saying,
what is the ideal orientation.

00:23:29.232 --> 00:23:31.190
And maybe there's something
in the design space

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.760
of that plate that is better
than what the chef has

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.300
intuitively come up with.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.090
That's the idea of
hacking the plate

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:41.580
and designing culinary
experiences for virtually using

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.324
the power of the internet.

00:23:44.324 --> 00:23:46.240
Well, I'll just give you
this one example here

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.080
of why it's not always the case
that what the chef intuits,

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:51.859
people like.

00:23:51.859 --> 00:23:54.150
So if you go to many a
modernist restaurant these days,

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:56.820
you'll find lots of this
kind of asymmetric plating.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.230
All the food is layered
down one side of the plate.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.730
The other part is just
left like a blank canvas.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.390
That doesn't seem to work
from the visual aesthetics

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.890
literature.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:05.240
We like balance and harmony.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.870
This is very unbalanced,
kind of unharmonious.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:10.210
And when we show these
plates on the internet,

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.750
when we serve them in
cafeterias or restaurants,

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.350
people do not like
them and they're

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:17.790
willing to pay less than for a
harmonious, central, balanced

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:18.375
plating.

00:24:18.375 --> 00:24:20.250
Does that mean that the
chef shouldn't do it?

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.040
No, but at least
they know they're

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.140
going against what the
majority of people like,

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.650
so their objective
for doing this,

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.614
maybe it's to be remembered
five years hence.

00:24:27.614 --> 00:24:30.030
As yeah, he was the chef that
did that really weird stuff,

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.530
put it all on the
side of the plate.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.410
You could become
iconic in that way.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:35.140
But if what you're
aiming for is kind

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.150
of the greatest
enjoyment of at the time,

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:41.600
that certainly is not it.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.680
OK.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.266
So think, leave plating
aside and think a bit

00:24:46.266 --> 00:24:48.520
about technology, and how
that could be integrated

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.200
into the dining experiences.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.852
And here's one dish that's
served at the Fat Duck in Bray.

00:24:55.852 --> 00:24:57.810
Fat Duck currently in
Melbourne, but we're back

00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.930
in the UK about 10 days
and this dish, I believe,

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:01.980
will still be on the menu.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.720
It comes out of research we
did with a chef in Oxford

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.360
in Science Oxford,
about six years ago,

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.150
where we served people oysters.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.550
Asked them how much they
liked the oysters, how salty

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:12.590
they tasted.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.940
And found that when we
play the sounds of the sea,

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.060
people say the oysters taste
better, but no more salty

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:22.040
with seaside sounds with sea
gulls swarming over head than

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.990
if we play modern jazz.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.650
If we play restaurant cutlery
noises or farm yard chickens,

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.200
or all sort of sounds,
but the kind of congruent

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.030
sounds of the sea, make
that food taste better.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.030
The Fat Duck research kitchen
could then take that insight

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.157
and turn it into this dish
that looks like the sea.

00:25:37.157 --> 00:25:39.626
But also when the waiter
comes to the table,

00:25:39.626 --> 00:25:41.500
they'll have a conch
shell in the other hand,

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.520
out of which dribbles some
earbuds from a little mini

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.330
iPod.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:47.935
You'll hear the sounds of the
sea before you taste the food.

00:25:47.935 --> 00:25:49.560
And if you see diners
in the restaurant

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.320
with this dish, which has been
the signature dish since 2008,

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.027
up until the present time, when
they come in, they're talking,

00:25:57.027 --> 00:25:58.360
they're chatting, it's exciting.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.680
It's that once in a
lifetime meal experience,

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.026
they put the earbuds
in, and they're silent.

00:26:03.026 --> 00:26:04.400
For five minutes,
their attention

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.110
is focused on the
food, and we know

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:09.689
it tastes better than
it otherwise would.

00:26:09.689 --> 00:26:11.480
Silence for a whole
meal, I don't think so.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.876
But for one course,
it certainly works.

00:26:13.876 --> 00:26:16.000
And from the first examples,
I think of technology,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.680
not at the back of
house, but technology

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.350
at the front of house, being
used, not to distract diners,

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:23.100
but somehow to enhance
their experience of food.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.570
That's a real passion for us,
how to take the technology

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:27.749
and enhance the meal experience.

00:26:27.749 --> 00:26:30.040
Here's something that not
only we are passionate about,

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.590
but also a great number
of those modernist chefs,

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.150
if you look in the newspapers,
at new restaurant openings,

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:36.525
there's a lot of
stuff like this.

00:26:36.525 --> 00:26:42.220
We're in Sublimotion in
Shanghai, Ultraviolet, sorry,

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.047
in Shanghai.

00:26:44.047 --> 00:26:45.880
And here we have Paul
Pairet, a French chef,

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.170
serving kind of a fish
and chips inspired dish

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:50.330
to a single sitting
of 12 diners.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.980
We're in Shanghai,
a French chef,

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:55.040
serving kind of an English dish,
fish and chips, or thereabouts.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:55.950
So what does he do?

00:26:55.950 --> 00:27:00.330
He plays the sounds of the sea
again, followed up by the sound

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.340
the Beatles, a
quintessentially English band.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.332
He projects a British
flag on the table.

00:27:04.332 --> 00:27:05.790
And of course,
because we're trying

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.400
to simulate England
with this dish,

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.370
we put the rain-spattered
windows on the backdrop.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.210
Each backdrop changing
with each dish,

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:15.040
but it is technology
kind of creating

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.980
this immersive, experiential,
theatrical, magical even,

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.910
tasting experience that is
so much more than the food.

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:27.280
That's at high end,
maybe $1200 a person,

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.220
if you're lucky
enough to get a shot.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.800
But maybe it could be
something as simple as this.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:31.841
You go to the restaurant.

00:27:31.841 --> 00:27:34.190
You read about the
sound of the sea dish.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.600
And you think, well, why
couldn't your tablet,

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.144
why can't that be plate wear?

00:27:38.144 --> 00:27:40.060
It's like there's
technology and there's food.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.310
We keep them separate
because one might get

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.700
into the keyboard of the other.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.500
But now there are
waterproof tablets.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.831
You can stick them in
the dishwasher, I guess.

00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:48.580
Steak and chips I don't
suppose would work

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.871
from that kind of hard surface.

00:27:49.871 --> 00:27:51.000
But other finger foods.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.400
Maybe the sound of the sea.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.530
If we actually ate what
looked like the kind of sea

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.429
underneath, how you could
tell stories about a dish,

00:27:58.429 --> 00:27:59.970
about the origins
of the ingredients.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:03.557
And again, use the technology
to enhance the experience.

00:28:03.557 --> 00:28:04.390
Are people doing it?

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.380
There are few chefs
out there who are now

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.570
serving at least one course from
a tablet, in Spain, in the UK,

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:11.520
and in Switzerland.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.510
I think we're going to see
more or it as they push to see,

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:14.801
what are you trying to do here?

00:28:14.801 --> 00:28:16.407
Why is it worthwhile?

00:28:16.407 --> 00:28:18.240
How much better can you
make the experience,

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.420
dining through a tablet,
bringing technology

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.870
to the table in a way
that takes us away

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:26.210
from this, from the distracted
diners who are fiddling

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.770
with their mobile device, not
concentrating on the food,

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.020
not sharing the moment
of dining with those

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.964
who are physically present.

00:28:33.964 --> 00:28:35.630
This kind technology
that at the moment,

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.010
we see some chefs around
the world, who banned--

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:40.810
said you cannot take pictures
of the food in my restaurant.

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:42.050
Put those mobiles away.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:43.020
Just eat the food.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.300
Enjoy the moment.

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.745
Leave the technology aside.

00:28:45.745 --> 00:28:47.329
That's an extreme reaction.

00:28:47.329 --> 00:28:49.120
We think there is a
way to bring technology

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:54.730
in to augment, to enhance, and
to make memorable experiences.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:57.170
Here's the way it happens.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:00.050
We go from the sound
of the sea, which

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.710
is the chef at the
three Michelin star

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:03.690
restaurant bringing
the technology for you

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:05.500
for once in a
lifetime experience.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.500
What we want to do is
take the technology that's

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.250
in everybody's pockets
and incorporate it

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.500
into the experience.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.210
We're still in a world of sound
and sort of digital seasoning.

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:17.136
And here we are 2013,
with our culinary artist,

00:29:17.136 --> 00:29:18.760
Caroline Hobkinson
at the House of Wolf

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.690
restaurant in
Islington, North London,

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:23.690
with our sensory tasting menu.

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:26.840
But the key course here
is the sonic cake pop.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.770
And on the menu, you can sort of
see here, take out your phone,

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:34.950
if you want to make your dessert
sweeter, dial 08456802419.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.030
If you want to make your
dessert more bitter,

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:39.760
take your mobile out,
dial a different number.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.060
What's going on there?

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.900
Well, here we have a
diner in the restaurant,

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.731
listening to some music perhaps.

00:29:47.731 --> 00:29:48.230
Perhaps not.

00:29:50.842 --> 00:29:51.675
Play that one again.

00:29:55.417 --> 00:29:58.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:59.584
CHARLES SPENCE: Sorry?

00:29:59.584 --> 00:30:01.399
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:01.399 --> 00:30:02.732
CHARLES SPENCE: What did he say?

00:30:02.732 --> 00:30:03.854
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:03.854 --> 00:30:05.020
CHARLES SPENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.470
So, what this man is
hearing on his headphone,

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.072
is like a [BUZZING].

00:30:22.072 --> 00:30:23.780
It's not really a very
nice sound at all.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:29.730
It's kind of a distorted
traffic noise from an underpass,

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.060
very low in pitch.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.220
Or if they dial a
different telephone number,

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.890
what their hearing is this.

00:30:37.736 --> 00:30:40.110
And the question is, which of
those two sounds is bitter.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:43.309
[BUZZING] Or this
tinkling sound.

00:30:43.309 --> 00:30:45.850
The majority of people, when we
asked them in the restaurant,

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.290
when we ask them online, when
we asked them in the lab,

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:51.710
say the second sound feels--
[TINKLING] There we go.

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:53.190
--sweeter somehow.

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:55.190
It's not literally sweeter
because tastes do not

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.850
have a sound.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:58.090
And yet, people will
say this is sweet,

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:01.130
whereas [BUZZING],
that is bitter.

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:03.304
If you've got a coffee
or a dark chocolate,

00:31:03.304 --> 00:31:05.470
and you have that in your
mouth, when you hear that,

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:08.335
it brings out the bitter
notes by about 5% or 10%.

00:31:08.335 --> 00:31:10.210
So this is a whole new
world using technology

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:13.030
that's in your pocket to deliver
digital seasoning, 10% more

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:15.170
sweetness without any calories.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:18.924
Who wouldn't be
potentially interested?

00:31:18.924 --> 00:31:20.590
We trial it in the
modernist restaurants

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.107
because the chefs are
innovative, creative,

00:31:23.107 --> 00:31:23.940
will try things out.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.550
They are their own boss.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.940
But the hope is what starts
there, the proof of principle

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.850
can then be extended
to the mass market

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:32.260
to make all our lives better.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.000
Two examples of how that's
kind of extending out.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.717
On the one hand, we have a
Haagen-Dazs Concerto app.

00:31:37.717 --> 00:31:39.550
You go to the store,
you buy your ice cream.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:42.310
You scan the QR code on
the lid, and then you

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:45.050
see some musicians playing
on top of your ice cream tub

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:46.269
through your mobile device.

00:31:46.269 --> 00:31:48.060
Different musicians
playing different music

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.100
for different
flavors of ice cream.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.870
When they wrap up after
about two minutes,

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:53.244
then your ice
cream is supposedly

00:31:53.244 --> 00:31:54.804
soft enough to scoop.

00:31:54.804 --> 00:31:56.345
Those aren't the
best substantiations

00:31:56.345 --> 00:31:58.470
but there are a number
things like this from Krug

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:00.420
has also its sensory
app that will give you

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.270
music to play to match the
taste of each of its champagnes.

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.510
This is I think the future
of technology and food.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.200
Prove a principal in the
modernist restaurant,

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.240
and then to the mass
market and the supermarket.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.610
Or in airlines with
British Airways, last year

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:15.772
for its long haul flights,
delivering this kind

00:32:15.772 --> 00:32:17.030
of digital seasoning menu.

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:20.047
You choose something to eat from
the trolley when it comes down.

00:32:20.047 --> 00:32:21.630
And then you can
plug into the headset

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.800
and hear music that has
been designed to enhance

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.190
the experience of the food.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:27.042
Maybe it's sweet music
like you just heard.

00:32:27.042 --> 00:32:28.500
Or maybe you've
ordered the lasagna

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.333
and you want some Italian
music to bring out

00:32:30.333 --> 00:32:31.480
the ethnicity of the dish.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.900
Various ways of doing
it, but it's technology

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.872
being used to enhance food.

00:32:36.872 --> 00:32:38.580
So when I saw this
coming out last month,

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.150
you kind of think, this is
kind of what's going to happen

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:41.370
and the way of the future.

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.520
Munchery and Google
Play Music team up

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.560
to turn a simple meal
into a dining experience.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:45.970
You go online.

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:47.136
I guess you order your food.

00:32:47.136 --> 00:32:47.725
It arrives.

00:32:47.725 --> 00:32:50.740
And then what are you going to
listen to on the hi-fi in home?

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.480
Why not offer people a
range of music designed

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.180
to enhance the
experience, based on what

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.370
you know about their
music preferences that

00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:59.700
built on the neuroscience?

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.180
Do you want to make
things sweeter,

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:04.520
is a little bit more savory,
a little sourer, more bitter?

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.562
Whatever it is, there will
be a musical parameter

00:33:06.562 --> 00:33:08.311
that can be matched
to your musical tastes

00:33:08.311 --> 00:33:09.700
and delivered
along with the food

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:11.560
to enhance the home
dining experience,

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.760
just like you had in one
of those fancy modernist

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.210
restaurants.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:20.180
And I'll leave with a final
example, which will sort

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:21.821
of bring everything together.

00:33:21.821 --> 00:33:23.820
We've got the sounds that
change the experience.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.180
And when we do these experiments
in restaurants or culinary

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:26.730
artistry.

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:29.727
And I'd really like to test
in somewhere like this.

00:33:29.727 --> 00:33:31.560
May be a bit like your
dining facility here.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.970
You might think is
it a restaurant?

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:35.970
Are they experimenting
on me or am I just having

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:37.095
a great tasting experience.

00:33:37.095 --> 00:33:38.810
And there's kind of
an interesting world

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:39.685
where you don't know.

00:33:39.685 --> 00:33:42.110
Is this a science
lab or a dining room?

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.860
It's kind of both.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.710
They can change the temperature,
the lighting, the music,

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:45.999
they can vibrate the table.

00:33:45.999 --> 00:33:47.290
They can do all sorts of stuff.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.409
They may measure your responses.

00:33:49.409 --> 00:33:50.950
But you might have
a great experience

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:52.270
of eating at the same time.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.530
We want to test in
these great restaurants,

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:57.790
but if you're paying
$1,200 a shot,

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.880
my department is not going
to pay for 100 subjects

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.050
to go and have dinner
at one of these.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:03.660
So we can't literally test very
often in this very high end

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.630
experience restaurants.

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:09.600
So what we have to do instead
is create experiential events

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.100
that capture the idea.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.330
And this is the idea of
the Singleton Sensorium.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:18.350
It was in London, November,
2013, I think now.

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:19.330
[BIRDS CHIRPING]

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:22.630
You come to a building in Soho,
a [INAUDIBLE] maker's studio.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:23.924
You're given a glass of whisky.

00:34:23.924 --> 00:34:26.440
You're taken into
the green room.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.820
We have grass on the floor,
deck chairs, croquet hoops.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.199
We have the sounds of
the English summer.

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:36.550
You tell me how grassy
that whisky tastes, smells

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.570
on the nose, how
sweet on the palate,

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.960
and how woody the
texture of the aftertaste

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.150
once you've swallowed.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.462
OK, had your whisky,
made your rating.

00:34:44.462 --> 00:34:46.170
We then take you
downstairs to this room.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:46.469
[TINKLING SOUND]

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:48.590
Same whisky in hand,
score card in the other.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.647
500 people over three nights.

00:34:50.647 --> 00:34:52.230
Suddenly, there's
that tinkling sound.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:54.021
It's coming from the
ceiling, because these

00:34:54.021 --> 00:34:55.540
are the sounds of sweetness.

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.230
The room itself is red, because
red is the color of sweetness.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:01.050
Everything in this room is
round, because round is sweet.

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:02.370
Angular is bitter.

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:05.450
Round window frames, round
floor plan, round, poof,

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:06.360
round everything.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.040
Trying to connote sweetness.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.620
And finally take your
whisky, your score card,

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.947
to the woody room.

00:35:11.947 --> 00:35:14.280
We've got the sound of wood,
everything we can think of,

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.510
the sound of a wood fire,
creaking wood doors.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.176
[CRACKLING, CREAKING DOOR, BASS
 FIDDLE]

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.810
Double bass wooden instruments,
a walk through the woods.

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.560
We've got wood on the
floor, stressed wood

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.930
on the floor, a dead tree behind
me this picture was taken.

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:34.940
Rate your whisky again.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.420
You know it's the same whisky
in all three environments.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:39.320
And yet, when you look
at your score card

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.800
after 15 minutes going through
these three environments,

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:45.160
you find that the whisky
tasted a lot woodier

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.030
in the woody room.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:48.560
Tasted about 10% sweeter
in the sweet room

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.950
and the grassiness was
brought out in the green room.

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:51.465
And some people
went through this

00:35:51.465 --> 00:35:53.440
and said, well, I knew
what you were trying to do.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.856
Of course, you
wanted me to say it

00:35:54.856 --> 00:35:57.247
was more grassy in the green
room, so I did the opposite.

00:35:57.247 --> 00:35:59.080
They were still affected
by the environment.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.288
They couldn't just give a
straight rating every time.

00:36:01.288 --> 00:36:03.400
And if you roll up the
300 or 3,000 people

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.070
we've tested in these kind of
multi-sensory, experiential

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:09.020
events, you can demonstrate that
exactly the same food or drink

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.030
tastes dramatically
different as a function

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.250
of the lighting,
the music, and all

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:16.800
the other environmental cues.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.102
So I'll wrap up there.

00:36:19.102 --> 00:36:20.810
But just leave you
with a couple of areas

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:22.180
that we're working on now.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.760
I think the modernist
restaurant is a great place

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.400
to work because the
chef is their own boss,

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.600
they're creative,
they're innovative.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.183
They can put stuff
on the menu if they

00:36:28.183 --> 00:36:29.986
believe in neuroscience story.

00:36:29.986 --> 00:36:30.860
Some of it will work.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.410
Some of it will
work brilliantly.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:34.605
Others may fail.

00:36:34.605 --> 00:36:36.980
But of course that Michelin
starred restaurant experience

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.030
is very exclusive.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.154
Most of us can't afford to
go there, especially not

00:36:40.154 --> 00:36:41.840
us academics working in Oxford.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.820
Maybe it's a once
in a lifetime thing.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.310
So the question is how to
take the insights from there

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:49.445
to the real world to affect
all of our dining experiences.

00:36:49.445 --> 00:36:51.070
And we're currently
trying to translate

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:53.900
some of those insights about
plate color, cutlery weight,

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:58.676
lighting, music, and so on,
into the world of hospital food.

00:36:58.676 --> 00:37:01.309
You have all these patients in
hospitals whose hospital stays

00:37:01.309 --> 00:37:03.850
are prolonged because they're
underfed, under nutritionalized

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:05.670
because the food looks so
horrible, tastes so horrible.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:08.640
And there's a business case to
have enhanced sensory designer

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.050
food to improve nutrition
and reduce bed nights.

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:13.880
We're thinking about
foods of the future.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.240
So we're working with Ben
Reade, who was formerly

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.980
head of the Nordic
Food Lab and Jozef

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.490
Youssef, a chef in
London, thinking

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:20.460
about how to make these little
critters more appealing.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.209
The food of the future,
highly nutritious,

00:37:22.209 --> 00:37:24.140
highly proteinaceous,
very good for you.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.841
You think, uck, disgusting.

00:37:25.841 --> 00:37:27.340
But you know, there
are other things

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.820
that you think were disgusting,
like ripe French cheeses,

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.760
and yet somehow, you've
come to love them.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.610
So how to make you
love these guys?

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:35.360
Through kind of the
graying silver palate,

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.776
all those people
are over 70 years

00:37:36.776 --> 00:37:38.610
of age, the age
at which you start

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:40.480
to lose your ability
to taste and to smell,

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.680
two senses for which there are
no prostheses to bring it back.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.740
What can you do to improve
their dining experiences

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:50.030
through finally
kind of the nudging?

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:52.440
What we do for the obese
populations in terms

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.830
of plate color, plate size, and
other kind of tricks or rules

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:59.710
of mind that might be used
to make people satisfied

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.250
with a little bit less?

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:03.480
All very big challenges,
all very important,

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.970
but I think the
best insights here

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.280
may well come from that
interface between design

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:10.340
technology, the high end
chef, and the measurement

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.434
scientists such as myself.

00:38:12.434 --> 00:38:14.100
So I shall leave it
there, but hopefully

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.920
convinced you why this
is an exciting area

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.270
and why I think technology
and food will in the future

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:22.713
be merged seamlessly in
our day-to-day experience.

00:38:22.713 --> 00:38:25.460
And it's a very exciting time to
be here with all the technology

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:26.990
that's coming out
it;s [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:28.010
You know, you go
back to the 1930s

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.544
and you find FT Marinetto,
one of the Italian futurists,

00:38:30.544 --> 00:38:32.460
they were thinking about
multi-sensory dining.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.330
They were spraying
atomizers over the food.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:37.530
They were serving
you frog's legs

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:39.869
while listening to the
sound of croaking frogs.

00:38:39.869 --> 00:38:41.660
They were having you
rub textured materials

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:42.740
while you dined.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.865
They were miscoloring food.

00:38:43.865 --> 00:38:45.406
They were dining in the dark.

00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:46.780
They were doing
all that in 1930.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.779
They had the ideas, the
inspiration, the desire,

00:38:48.779 --> 00:38:52.190
but what they did not have is
the technology to bring it off

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:53.100
in the [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.620
But we do have the
technology now.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:55.280
We have the interest.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.300
We have the chefs and
we have the scientists

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:56.970
working together.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:59.250
And I'm very excited about
what the perfect meal might

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:00.520
be a few years hence.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.090
Thank you.

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:06.442
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:06.442 --> 00:39:08.650
MALE SPEAKER: We have time
for a couple of questions.

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:09.340
Questions.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:09.840
Right.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.530
We're going to
use the throw box,

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.280
so you can throw it
and catch it, and then

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.480
speak into the black circle.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.550
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:17.230
You can hear me?

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.332
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:39:19.332 --> 00:39:20.790
AUDIENCE: During
these experiments,

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:22.206
do you get the
different responses

00:39:22.206 --> 00:39:24.882
based on where the person
is from, like culture?

00:39:27.894 --> 00:39:29.310
CHARLES SPENCE:
So sometimes, yes.

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:31.690
Sometimes, I believe that
that sweet and bitter sound

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:33.505
will be sweet and
bitter across the world.

00:39:33.505 --> 00:39:35.880
It will be sweet and bitter
to a chimpanzee and to a rat.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:36.762
Why so?

00:39:36.762 --> 00:39:38.970
Because at birth, we're all
born sticking our tongues

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:39.860
out and down.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.910
If you put a bitter
taste on a newborn chimp,

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:44.710
rat, human's tongue, bleck,
because bitterness is poisonous

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:45.560
probably.

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.710
We learn to eject it.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.510
Put a sweet taste on
a newborn's tongue,

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.990
the tongue will go [SLURPING]
licking, ingesting calories,

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.750
growth, that's what we need.

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:53.874
So we're all born sticking
our tongues out and down

00:39:53.874 --> 00:39:55.989
to bitter tastes, out
and up to sweet tastes.

00:39:55.989 --> 00:39:58.280
And maybe we just captured
something of that difference

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.920
in there or there.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.920
It's there in all of us.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.320
Our brains pick up the
statistics of the environment.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.795
This is a useful
statistic to know about.

00:40:06.795 --> 00:40:08.170
Nevertheless our
brain can't tell

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.169
the difference between
an incorporated in sound.

00:40:10.169 --> 00:40:12.380
That should be, I think,
predictionally universal.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.505
Maybe I'll be proved wrong.

00:40:13.505 --> 00:40:16.704
When it comes to what
instrument is sweetness,

00:40:16.704 --> 00:40:18.370
we find in Western
populations, it maybe

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:20.710
a tinkling piano or wind chime.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:23.760
Would it be the same instrument
that Chinese or South Americans

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.960
would match to sweetness?

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.360
We don't know for sure yet.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.770
But we are currently starting to
go around the world in person.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:31.949
So we've been testing them
Himba tribe of Kaokoland

00:40:31.949 --> 00:40:33.490
in Namibia, with no
written language,

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:34.810
no schooling, no supermarkets.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.059
What do they think about the
shape of taste and sound?

00:40:37.059 --> 00:40:40.060
And we're also using
kind the online testing

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.850
that is now allowing us to
run studies in seven or eight

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:44.405
countries simultaneously.

00:40:44.405 --> 00:40:46.530
Currently, we're looking
both at the color of food.

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.825
Is red sweet everywhere
in the world or not?

00:40:48.825 --> 00:40:50.920
And we're also
looking at plateware.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.910
So if you go to China,
they may serve noodles

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:56.045
in what looks like my dog's
bowl, kind of bashed up metal.

00:40:56.045 --> 00:40:58.170
Looks terrible to me, but
they think it looks fine.

00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.820
Whereas, some of the
Western plate ware

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:01.200
might look just a bit odd.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.376
So we are presenting images
of food, plateware, glassware,

00:41:05.376 --> 00:41:07.750
arrangements, odd and even
numbers on the plate in the UK

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.666
and in many other countries
to try and pick up

00:41:09.666 --> 00:41:11.379
those similarities
and differences.

00:41:11.379 --> 00:41:13.170
And it's going to be
a bit of both I think.

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.804
There will be some universals.

00:41:14.804 --> 00:41:17.220
Probably maybe sweet will be
round, more or less the world

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:18.530
over, I think too.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:20.590
But also kind of the
culture-specific ones,

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:21.810
that's something that
then maybe the chef

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:22.440
would want to know about.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.648
Because if they see, as they
increasingly try and get

00:41:24.648 --> 00:41:26.900
kind of personalized
meals for their diners,

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.420
if you know you've
got a big booking

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.795
of a sort of Chinese delegation
coming to your restaurant

00:41:30.795 --> 00:41:32.990
tonight, maybe they
don't like odd numbers

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.440
in the plate in the way
that a Western diner does.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.860
Maybe they like even
numbers instead.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.568
And if you have that
information in hand,

00:41:37.568 --> 00:41:39.852
you kind of personalize
the experience a bit.

00:41:39.852 --> 00:41:40.560
It's a rich area.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.560
Takes a long time to do.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.570
But we are interested
in making little steps.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:46.400
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:50.840
AUDIENCE: I have the mic, so
I'm going to ask the question.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.010
Fascinating topic,
amazing speech.

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:54.927
Thank you for coming.

00:41:54.927 --> 00:41:56.760
Along the last comment
you made, my question

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.250
is along those lines.

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:00.180
I think a lot of the
examples you showed

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.910
were focused on creating a
kind of a similar experience

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:06.760
for the whole restaurant
or the whole table.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:10.202
Can you push that to like maybe
send a survey before coming

00:42:10.202 --> 00:42:12.410
to the restaurant, to say,
how are you feeling today?

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.670
CHARLES SPENCE: Yes.

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:12.930
AUDIENCE: Was it a good day?

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:14.070
Was it a bad day?

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:14.903
CHARLES SPENCE: Yep.

00:42:14.903 --> 00:42:16.910
AUDIENCE: Or tracking
your customers over time,

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:19.850
to say, hey, that guy
actually prefers this.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.150
And then let's cater
to that individual.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:24.050
Like push it to it's limits.

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:25.180
CHARLES SPENCE: So there's
kind of two questions in there.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.010
On the one hand, it's
about is this one

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:28.840
of these experiences as a
whole environmental experience?

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.686
And that's true.

00:42:29.686 --> 00:42:31.060
Unless we're
working with them we

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:31.940
can't really build
stuff exactly,

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.910
but are working with
the lab in Bristol

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:37.390
to try and make augmented,
sort of digital glassware

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:40.310
that will only play sweet music
when you pick the glass up

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:41.520
and tilt it to your lips.

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.380
And it's personalized to you.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.535
It happens you only hear
the sound when you taste.

00:42:44.535 --> 00:42:46.660
And it's kind of directed
or hyper-directionalized.

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:48.950
Because we are trying to
personalize where we can.

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:51.735
But it is sometimes a challenge.

00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:53.860
And then the other part of
the question, about sort

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.760
of the personalisation.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:59.569
We work closely with Chef
Jozef Youssef up in Maida Vale.

00:42:59.569 --> 00:43:01.860
I'm always trying to convince
him about the next dining

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.385
concept to get his
creative juices working.

00:43:04.385 --> 00:43:06.510
And what I want to do is
like personalized for you,

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:11.200
which involves you book a table
and then you get a plastic bag.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.191
It's says, please spit in
the bag and send it off.

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:16.690
And you've got about two months
between booking and actually

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:17.410
arrival.

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:18.980
And that bag is off
to our colleagues

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:22.070
in Monell Chemical Senses and
they can analyze your spittle

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:23.630
and then personalize
a meal for you.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:26.390
They can say, you'll be
a super taster or not.

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:28.410
You'll be anosmic,
will be unable to smell

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.920
this cork taint, like myself.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.690
Coriander will
taste soapy to you,

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:33.940
so don't put that in the dish.

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.410
And you can get
eight or 10 perhaps

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:36.750
predictions that could
be used by a chef

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:38.000
to personalize the thing.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.100
That'll be part of it.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.590
But then also it would be I
think the whole personalization

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:43.254
is a real interesting one.

00:43:43.254 --> 00:43:44.670
So what you could
also do, you see

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:48.047
the success of Coca Cola
putting your name on the bottle.

00:43:48.047 --> 00:43:48.880
That's personalized.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.600
It's kind of meaningless
personalization, but it works.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.170
You see Starbucks writing
your name on the cup.

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:52.670
Why?

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:54.514
Because it makes the
coffee taste better.

00:43:54.514 --> 00:43:56.430
Kind of personalization
from the genetic level

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:59.052
to these other kind of
more [INAUDIBLE] ones.

00:43:59.052 --> 00:44:00.510
You can just wrap
all that together

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:02.530
and it's a personalized
experience.

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:04.330
Which could be nice,
but I think I've

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:07.495
seen there was press coverage
last week in The Times,

00:44:07.495 --> 00:44:10.730
I think The Guardian about
the reopening of the Fat Duck

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:11.646
restaurant.

00:44:11.646 --> 00:44:14.270
And there it was announced that,
like some US restaurants, when

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:17.980
you book a table two months in
advance of your reservation,

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:20.490
they'll start Googling you.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.001
What do we know
about this person?

00:44:22.001 --> 00:44:22.750
What do they like?

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:23.850
When were they born?

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:26.120
Maybe they'll deliver a
dish from your childhood.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.302
and some of the response to
that, I heard that about 100

00:44:29.302 --> 00:44:31.010
diners, as soon as
that article came out,

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:32.969
kind of canceled
the reservation.

00:44:32.969 --> 00:44:34.510
I like personalized,
but I don't want

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:38.640
you to be probing into
my darkest secrets.

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.682
So you can make it and
you can do an obvious way.

00:44:40.682 --> 00:44:43.015
But maybe one of the nicest
examples of personalization,

00:44:43.015 --> 00:44:44.737
I think, is from
the Fat Duck, where

00:44:44.737 --> 00:44:47.070
for the first few courses,
as in many other restaurants,

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:48.620
they give you finger food.

00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:50.430
And part of the purpose
of that finger food

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:52.763
is to see how you interact,
to figure out whether you're

00:44:52.763 --> 00:44:54.277
a left or right hander.

00:44:54.277 --> 00:44:55.860
And then without
telling you anything,

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.550
if they figure out
you're a lefty,

00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:59.390
your food and the cutlery
will be arranged slightly

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:00.473
differently, just for you.

00:45:00.473 --> 00:45:01.550
No one says a word.

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:03.550
But somehow, hopefully
it just feels just right.

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:04.410
The evening flows.

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:06.618
It's personalized for you
without you ever realizing,

00:45:06.618 --> 00:45:08.760
but hopefully it delivers
a better experience.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.990
Whether you make people wear
it or not, probably not.

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:13.395
There is a lot you can do.

00:45:13.395 --> 00:45:15.160
The chef says no.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.140
He doesn't like the
idea of spit in a bag.

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:19.741
We need a better name but--

00:45:19.741 --> 00:45:21.240
MALE SPEAKER:
Question in the front.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:21.865
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:21.865 --> 00:45:23.680
I had a question
about the experiment

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.860
you did with the white
plate and the black plate

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:28.610
and the sense of sweetness.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:31.180
Do you think that it was the
white that was associated

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:35.220
specifically with sweetness
or if the question had been,

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.470
is this a saltier
food, would they also

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:40.007
have experienced a heightened
sense of salt as well?

00:45:40.007 --> 00:45:41.320
CHARLES SPENCE: OK.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.323
So I think it is sweetness.

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:48.757
So we've repeated the
experiment in Paul Bocuse, where

00:45:48.757 --> 00:45:50.590
each week the chefs
make a different dessert

00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:51.756
as a part of their training.

00:45:51.756 --> 00:45:54.806
And then that dessert is served
on a white or a black plate.

00:45:54.806 --> 00:45:57.360
So I think, from a few, we're
talking about five or six

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:01.340
experiments now, as some
other groups have, it's true,

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.134
you're mostly asked
about sweetness.

00:46:03.134 --> 00:46:04.550
but I think somewhere
in that mix,

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:06.342
we have asked about
other taste sensations.

00:46:06.342 --> 00:46:07.633
But it seems to be about sweet.

00:46:07.633 --> 00:46:09.490
Whether enhanced
sweetness is a good thing,

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:10.910
whether that means you
like the food more,

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:12.590
really depends on how it
came from the kitchen.

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:14.390
So we've done one version of
this in a Scottish hotel, where

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:16.515
the dessert, a sticky toffee
pudding, was, I think,

00:46:16.515 --> 00:46:17.570
too sweet.

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.930
And then when you added
sweetness from the white plate,

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:22.346
you thought, yeah, it's really
sweet, but I don't like it.

00:46:22.346 --> 00:46:25.240
It's gone a bit too far.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:25.990
It's hard to know.

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:27.570
We don't really the reason why.

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:28.910
We just know it happens.

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:32.010
It could be that that dessert--
we know if we actually

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:34.510
change the color of a food,
it will change the taste.

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:35.968
You never see colors
by themselves.

00:46:35.968 --> 00:46:38.890
You always see them set against
a contrasting background.

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:40.800
So maybe the color
of the plate serves

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.550
to change the apparent
color of the food.

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:43.910
And that's part of
how things work.

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:45.450
Or maybe it's just
from your lifetime.

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.491
You never think about it,
but in fact, your brain

00:46:47.491 --> 00:46:50.095
is kind of making records
of wherever you've

00:46:50.095 --> 00:46:51.470
eaten, what you've eaten off.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:55.891
Maybe there's black slates
normally presaged the cheese

00:46:55.891 --> 00:46:56.890
board or something else.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.430
So maybe savory food is
more normally associated

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:01.570
with those angular,
black plateware.

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:03.220
And you've just learned the
statistics of the environment

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.300
and play them back here.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:05.746
I'm not sure.

00:47:05.746 --> 00:47:08.315
AUDIENCE: I guess I'm asking,
if there something about white

00:47:08.315 --> 00:47:09.800
that is generally [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.275
Like could it be
that purple could

00:47:12.275 --> 00:47:14.760
be chilly and yellow
could be [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:17.200
CHARLES SPENCE: Yep.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.431
So what we do sort of with Chef
Youssef and his synesthesia

00:47:20.431 --> 00:47:20.930
dinner.

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:24.030
Just closed last month
or two months ago.

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:26.220
We served the first
course-- He served

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:30.320
the first course of the menu was
four verified spoons of taste.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.090
Sweet, bitter, salty, sour.

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:36.840
One green, one red, one
white, and one browney-black.

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:39.180
And the task for the diner
was, the waitress would just

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.340
randomly put these four
spoons on the table.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.010
And she says, well,
the chef recommend

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:46.570
you start with the salty, then
have the bitter, then sour,

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:48.195
and end on a sweet note.

00:47:48.195 --> 00:47:48.820
And disappears.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:50.550
And you're left
wondering, well, how

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:51.740
do I know which one's which?

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:53.760
Well, you do know,
and you're challenged

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.640
to arrange the spoons
in the right order,

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.094
sour, bitter, salt, then sweet.

00:47:57.094 --> 00:47:58.510
Then you can look
around the table

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:00.990
and see how many other people
agreed that those tastes do

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:01.890
have specific colors.

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:05.610
And from that we find, that a
pinky-red is most definitely

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:08.590
kind of sweet in
the food itself.

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:11.907
White tends to be
salty, white and blue.

00:48:11.907 --> 00:48:12.990
Yellow and green are sour.

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.430
And browney-black
and purple tends

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:19.140
to be bitter in many situations.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.950
Probably more work to be done.

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:24.700
Certainly I know we're often
asked about what could you

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.470
do to reduce salt in food?

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:28.952
Because that's a big health
concern, not just sugar.

00:48:28.952 --> 00:48:30.910
It certainly is the most
challenging one for us

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:32.820
in terms of sound.

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.280
I always play the salty sound,
sweet, bitter, salty, sour

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.280
sounds. and I always play
the salty sound lasts.

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.490
Because it's hardest one
to capture sonically.

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:40.595
Not quite sure why.

00:48:40.595 --> 00:48:43.300
And in terms of color, if I
change the color of a food,

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:44.970
it's also-- I can
make it sweeter

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:46.340
or I can make it more sour.

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.550
But I find it very difficult
to make it more salty.

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:49.590
Perhaps because in
the environment,

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:51.256
salty foods come in
all sorts of colors.

00:48:51.256 --> 00:48:53.125
So there isn't something
very clear there.

00:48:53.125 --> 00:48:55.550
And perhaps also, our
response to saltiness,

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:57.110
we're not born
liking or disliking

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:59.242
salt. It comes online
after some months.

00:48:59.242 --> 00:49:01.075
Whereas, we're born
liking sweet and bitter.

00:49:01.075 --> 00:49:03.116
And perhaps those other
tastes have a head start.

00:49:05.805 --> 00:49:06.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:09.950
I'm curious to know how much
you extend this from restaurant

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:12.930
environment to the home,
and whether you actually

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:15.950
would apply some of this when
you prepare a meal at home?

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:16.989
CHARLES SPENCE: Yeah.

00:49:16.989 --> 00:49:19.280
So certainly there are some
things that are easy to do,

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.320
some things that are harder.

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.847
And you haven't met my wife.

00:49:22.847 --> 00:49:25.180
So there's a challenge there
between the neuroscientist,

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:27.820
the gastrophysicist says,
and what Mrs. Spence says.

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.799
And she wins in the
home environment.

00:49:29.799 --> 00:49:31.840
So I have lots of angular
black plates, very good

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.820
for certain foods.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:37.467
But I have to keep them in the
lab, because she won't let me.

00:49:37.467 --> 00:49:38.300
The cutlery's heavy.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.450
I've got that one through.

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:41.780
And when it comes to the music
that we play when we're eating,

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:42.779
that's certainly a part.

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:44.470
And we quite often
have these kind

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:47.200
of dinner parties with the chef
in the lab and all the students

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:47.930
together.

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:49.638
I'm cooking and doing
some experimenting.

00:49:49.638 --> 00:49:51.620
You can buy the cheap
one euro light bulbs now,

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:54.260
remote control, change the
color as we eat the food.

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.720
You've got the tone generator
to find the music that

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.200
matches the taste of the beer.

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.010
And we do lots of
experimentation, things

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:01.010
like the Kandinsky on a plate.

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:03.490
That was served kind of in a
home environment to see a bit

00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:05.610
about how things
work before going

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:08.380
to the live, big experiment.

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:11.930
So that's the best place to do
it, in the lab dinners at home.

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:16.320
And then the battle
with um, yeah.

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.270
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:20.302
You know, there's a saying that
says, the way to a man's heart

00:50:20.302 --> 00:50:21.640
is through his stomach.

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:24.140
And I saw a TV program
with Heston Blumenthal,

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:26.070
cooking Valentines
Day meals for couples.

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:28.720
And afterwards, they reported
feeling more in love.

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:30.990
So is there a connection
between science and food?

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.570
CHARLES SPENCE: Yes, so I
advised some of the courses

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:42.390
on the Heston the TV lunch.

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:44.930
My trip, it was a
hot chili, which

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:46.970
I've used for
years, decades now,

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:50.510
that kind of releases a
flustering and arousal

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:51.570
and pupil dilation.

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:53.028
And the person
sitting opposite you

00:50:53.028 --> 00:50:56.584
might confuse that
for signs of love.

00:50:56.584 --> 00:50:57.750
It works very well, I think.

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:04.740
I think there's a great book by
Bunny Crumpacker, a great name,

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.900
"The Sex Life Of Food."

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:08.930
And she-- kind of from
2006, and she sort

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:10.910
of brings these two
things together.

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:12.368
And that maybe in
a way, you think,

00:51:12.368 --> 00:51:14.680
well, our brains are
designed for the three

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:17.760
Fs, sort of feeding,
foraging, and something else.

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:21.890
So two of those three are,
because of what the brain does,

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:27.240
so there's food and love or sex
should be intimately linked.

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.527
And I know there are some
companies starting up

00:51:29.527 --> 00:51:31.360
who are trying to bring
these things closer,

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.430
so for a certain
sort of audience,

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:36.930
when you go to a hotel, maybe
you're thinking about romance.

00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:39.840
And they might deliver
a multi-sensory edible.

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.430
But, how shall I put it?

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:44.680
Enhancing the romantic
moment as well.

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.867
That border, say, is
an interesting one.

00:51:46.867 --> 00:51:48.950
Probably you've seen, if
you do the brain scanner,

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:50.658
you'll see many of
the sort of same areas

00:51:50.658 --> 00:51:55.050
in the brain lighting up with
great food and other things.

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:56.570
MALE SPEAKER: Final question.

00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:57.740
AUDIENCE: Hi, Charles.

00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.470
I love the evidence
that you put forward

00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:04.160
to show how there's a real
connection between being

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.660
thoughtful and creative about
multi-sensory approaches

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:10.720
and how people enjoy the
experience in a restaurant.

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:16.660
I'm curious what you think
about what opportunities there

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:20.380
are for creating really great
multi-sensory environments

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:24.360
in either a business context
or in other contexts.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.224
So for us, when we
meeting each other,

00:52:26.224 --> 00:52:27.640
we want to have a
great experience

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:29.200
so we can be more productive.

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.110
Similarly with clients.

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:35.157
So any tips or do we just need
to take them to the Fat Duck?

00:52:35.157 --> 00:52:37.240
CHARLES SPENCE: I think
the multi-sensory approach

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.840
could be applied anywhere.

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:42.590
And we have done work about
a decade ago with ICI Paints

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:45.010
and Qwest's looking at
fragrance and paint color

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:48.010
for productive
working environments.

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:51.340
Maybe that was more
for spotting typos

00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:53.180
than it was for any
real, genuine kind

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.760
of innovative, creative thought.

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.660
But we have worked there
for a number of years.

00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:00.160
It certainly does
work-- there's evidence

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.570
that the use of
fragrance can-- so,

00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:04.450
if you're stuck in
a certain mindset,

00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:07.430
then if you change any aspect
of the sensory environment,

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:09.680
it can almost refresh or
restart your mental processes

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.700
so you're more likely to
have the good thoughts.

00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:14.200
If you're in one
environment, you're

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:15.990
stressed, that stress
gets associated

00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.840
with the smell of
that environment.

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.006
Go somewhere else, different
color, different scent,

00:53:19.006 --> 00:53:19.740
it helps.

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:22.760
I see also a lot on touch.

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:25.860
So some of the companies that
we have worked with-- I mean,

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:28.530
touch is like,
it's not necessary.

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:31.842
It's kind of a luxury rather
than a necessity one feels.

00:53:31.842 --> 00:53:33.800
And yet from the emerging
body of neuroscience,

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.117
our skin is our biggest sense.

00:53:35.117 --> 00:53:37.450
And it's full of these receptors
that love to be stroked

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:38.720
or to be groomed.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.970
And if you do give people
a lunch time massage,

00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:44.240
say, that leads to significant
improvement in performance

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:48.211
afterwards, to lowering
tension and it can lead

00:53:48.211 --> 00:53:49.970
to many other sort of benefits.

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:53.430
So I think certainly through
touch, through smell,

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:57.640
certainly color, illumination
levels, can change,

00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.760
can make us more
alert, more relaxed,

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.110
can just serve to
completely change the scene.

00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:04.170
And I also really
worry about two things.

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:07.510
One is sometimes, with
some of the companies,

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:10.910
they have sort of innovation
workshop or science workshops,

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:13.985
and too often they're in the
bottom of some terrible hotel

00:54:13.985 --> 00:54:14.860
in a windowless room.

00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:17.300
That you're stuck
there for 48 hours.

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:21.510
And you think that is not the
environment for creativity.

00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:23.640
And also from Charles
Michelle, the guy

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.570
who made the Kandinsky
on a plate dish,

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:27.653
he comes from Colombia,
as do many of my students.

00:54:27.653 --> 00:54:31.450
And there it's kind of a
country with 50 years of turmoil

00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:32.444
and war.

00:54:32.444 --> 00:54:34.860
And you think of sort of the
multi-sensory approach there.

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.680
It's kind of a
peacemaking process.

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.510
And so, this whole idea of
kind of gastro diplomacy

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:41.410
becomes kind of an
interesting one.

00:54:41.410 --> 00:54:43.240
How many meetings
where they don't

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:46.210
think about deciding the
fate of a nation and no one

00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:49.570
serves any food or it's
dreadful food or-- would

00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:52.510
things have gone differently
if somebody had paid attention

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:53.135
to that?

00:54:53.135 --> 00:54:54.510
For my students
who've been here,

00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:55.926
they say, they
were very impressed

00:54:55.926 --> 00:54:58.307
about the gustatory element
to some of the things

00:54:58.307 --> 00:54:59.140
that you were doing.

00:55:01.694 --> 00:55:03.110
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much.

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:04.568
Please join me in
thanking Charles.

00:55:04.568 --> 00:55:06.090
[APPLAUSE]
