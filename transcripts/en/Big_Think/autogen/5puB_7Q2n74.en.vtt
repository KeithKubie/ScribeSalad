to stock it and at which store when I
mean this whole incredible system and as

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
mean this whole incredible system and as
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.690
mean this whole incredible system and as
the result of that it was able to look

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700
the result of that it was able to look
 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.359
the result of that it was able to look
to offer lower prices to its customers

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369

digital networking yeah it kind of took

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
digital networking yeah it kind of took
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.260
digital networking yeah it kind of took
over the world and changed its own

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270
over the world and changed its own
 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.170
over the world and changed its own

now it's kind of dug itself into this

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709
now it's kind of dug itself into this
 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.410

and everything yeah it's free but then
 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.559
and everything yeah it's free but then
the problem with that is that the job

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569
the problem with that is that the job
