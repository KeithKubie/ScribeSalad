00:00:00.761 --> 00:00:02.360
(drum beats)

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.220
- Hey everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.053
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:05.053 --> 00:00:09.030
I'm in Lahore, which is the
Punjab province of Pakistan.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.240
This is an amazingly
vibrant and energetic city.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.550
Today we're gonna go on a food tour

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.380
of the old city of Lahore.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.550
We're gonna go to Gawalmandi, Lakshmi,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.070
Chowk, and Shao... Shao Alami, thank you.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.470
We're gonna eat some street food.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.070
We're gonna eat at some
of the best restaurants.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.110
I'm gonna be hanging
out with my friend, Ali,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.640
and some of his friends.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.426
And we're gonna show you
all the food in this video.

00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:35.343
(percussion music)

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.490
We're starting off this morning

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.280
at a place called Sadiq Halwa Puri,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.160
which is known to serve
some of the best halwa puri

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.820
and chana in Lahore,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.500
which is a very common Lahori breakfast.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.400
So, it's gonna be a chickpea stew

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.400
along with the fried dough.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.030
And what he does, he really
slaps that dough out.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.120
He kinda twirls it on his finger,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.930
right onto the oil and that
just plops into the oil.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.110
The spin move is amazing.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.214
It fries for only about,
probably only 30 seconds or so

00:01:04.214 --> 00:01:07.380
in that oil and then they take it out.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.827
Okay, we're gonna go eat now.

00:01:08.827 --> 00:01:12.077
(funky mystical music)

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.030
Awesome.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.380
They do have a dining room,
but it's quite dark back there,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.550
so we've decided to take the food

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.303
and sit on the street by the car and eat.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.710
Or maybe on the car and eat.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.860
Be careful of the wire.

00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:31.974
Hello.

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:36.180
So, the owner mentioned
that we gotta eat the puris

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.050
right now while they're hot and fresh.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.630
Immediately, as I feel that puri,

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.359
it's just so soft, yet so like,

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.390
delicately crispy, at the same time.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.880
And I'm gonna scoop into the chana,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.143
which is, it's like a chickpea stew.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.903
What's amazing to me is the puri.

00:01:53.903 --> 00:01:56.710
It's has such delicate textures to it.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.180
The way he slaps that dough.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.390
Some parts of the puri are gummy,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.790
other parts are kinda elasticy.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.133
Really rich, really, really hearty.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.890
Try the potato curry there,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.310
you can that butter on top,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.863
you can see the potatoes
floating around, the spices.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.630
There's an herb flavor to that.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.450
Oh yeah, that's delicious.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.853
Again, so rich.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.840
What's up, man?

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.730
- Hey, it's good to see you.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.310
I'm a big fan

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.633
- Thank you so much.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.450
The next thing we also tried here

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.260
that they're famous for is the katlama.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.430
This one is with meat inside.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.170
I think there's a couple
of different varieties.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.440
But it's the same dough,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.390
then you can see the
minced meat filled into it.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.680
And then that's just,
such a, almost like crumbs

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.063
because it's so deep fried.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.360
(car honking)

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.260
Oh, that's like a next level meat pie.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.380
Yeah, that' really like,
dangerously, oily good.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.620
Let me just introduce to you too,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.290
who we're eating with today.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.438
We've got Ali from
Landmark Communications.

00:03:03.438 --> 00:03:06.130
He was in charge of
setting up our entire trip,

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.523
so a huge thank you to Ali.

00:03:08.523 --> 00:03:10.083
- Thank you so much to you, Mark.

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:12.293
It took us two years to
finally have you here.

00:03:12.293 --> 00:03:14.810
- Yes, yes, Ali has bee
inviting me to Pakistan

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.270
for over two years, and then,

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.250
finally to have a chance to meet Ali,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.480
to be hanging out in Lahore, it's amazing.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.550
And we're gonna have a lot
of good food on this trip.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.340
Another important part of
this dish is the halwa puris.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.240
It's the sweet component
that is often eaten

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.193
along with this whole meal's spread.

00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:36.814
Mm, mm.

00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:42.350
It is sweet, but it's
almost like porridge like.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.150
Okay, now I remember, it's semolina.

00:03:44.995 --> 00:03:46.970
And it has that kind of
grainy texture to it.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.950
And then it has a very
floral, sweet taste to it.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.820
That was an amazing first stop.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.760
Breakfast, Lahori breakfast.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.800
We're jumping in the car now
and moving to the next spot.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.883
(happy upbeat music)

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.920
We're on our way to an
area called Gawalmundi,

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.090
which is a famous area for food in Lahore.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.070
And, as Ali was just explaining to me,

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.410
Gawal means "milk man"
and mundi means "market".

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.910
So, it used to be the milk man market,

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.230
but now it's just, it's a market,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.600
but it's full of food, known for food.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.800
That's where we're going next.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.730
The traffic is just kinda flows,

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.470
and you just kinda weave your way around,

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.850
and others weave their way around you.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.330
The colors, the buses, it's just,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.920
I'm still just loving
everything, and just, wow.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.850
(funky mystical music)

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.160
We've got a short little
walk to get to the next place

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.373
where they're very well
known, legendary for lassi.

00:04:46.373 --> 00:04:48.623
(sloshing)

00:04:55.932 --> 00:04:57.280
First, he takes in the metal cup,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.470
he adds in some buffalo butter.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.940
That's like creamy butter,
straight up butter.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.640
You can smell the animal,
buffalo-iness of it.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.370
He takes this wooden propeller,
he really whips it up.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.500
And then, he adds in the
lassi, that liquidy goodness.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.690
And then, finally on top, he
adds on one more ingredient,

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.910
which is a, it's the purest form

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.870
of sweetened buffalo butter.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.310
Feeka lassi cha,

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.580
this is of the most famous,

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.580
one of the most legendary
lassi shops in all of Lahore.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.390
Oh man, that's look like
just creamy sensation.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.373
- You don't know whether you
have to eat it or drink it.

00:05:30.373 --> 00:05:31.663
(Mark laughs)

00:05:31.663 --> 00:05:32.950
- Yes, that is a masterpiece.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.110
It looks like a trophy

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.600
They're saying what I should do

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.700
is take a few sips of the liquid first,

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.250
before digging into the butter.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.063
Wow.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.430
Oh, that's amazing.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.500
It's sweet, but not overly sweet.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.480
It's not rich yet.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.160
The liquid is not rich, it's watery.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.063
Very refreshing, it's very icy.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.283
Okay, Joel's gonna try it.

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:03.340
- Whoa, the creation of it is beautiful.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.500
I can't wait.

00:06:11.672 --> 00:06:12.505
Wow, yeah.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.660
It's not that creamy and
it's so gently sweet.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.597
- Next up, to try the richness of it.

00:06:19.597 --> 00:06:21.500
The butter, the pure butter.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.193
And you can just see that's just thick.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.773
Oh, wow.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.190
That is like whipped
cream, but times five.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.830
And then you've got this sour component.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.970
It's kinda fluffy at the same time.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.290
That's like the most pure whipped cream

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.390
I think I've ever had.

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:48.940
(Joel laughing)

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.464
That's like the greatest whipped
cream you've ever tasted.

00:06:51.464 --> 00:06:53.350
- (laughs) Dude.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.747
- [Mark] Like nuggets of fluffy butter.

00:06:55.747 --> 00:06:56.580
- [Joel] That's crazy

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.888
- [Mark] Nuggets of fluffy butter.

00:06:57.888 --> 00:07:00.435
(Joel laughs)

00:07:00.435 --> 00:07:02.430
- I mean (laughs)

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.000
- So unbelievably creamy
- Yeah

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.610
- [Mark] Now he mentioned
to mix it all up,

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.680
so you've got that butter mixed

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.550
into the milk and the wateriness

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.393
and then it's more like a
actual hand-mixed milkshake.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.830
Wow, then you've got those chunks,

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.160
curdled chunks of butter, it's amazing.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.650
- Big fan of you

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:26.830
- [Mark] Thank you so much.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.554
What is your name?

00:07:28.554 --> 00:07:30.330
- Thank you, thank you.
- Awesome, man.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.330
Thank you very much.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.305
- Thank you

00:07:33.305 --> 00:07:34.524
- [Mark] Thank you very much.

00:07:34.524 --> 00:07:36.100
(bright pop music)

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.340
That is, for sure, the richest, thickest,

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.800
most unbelievably delicious
milkshake I've ever had,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.990
butter milkshake I've ever had in my life.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.770
We're stepping down this alley here

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:47.700
just to take a look.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.380
Birds flying overhead and you can, yeah,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.210
definitely see the
building kinda tilting in.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.030
This is a muhala, which is like a,

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:53.863
it's a neighborhood?

00:07:53.863 --> 00:07:54.800
- It's a neighborhood.
- A community

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.760
- Exactly
- A community

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.880
And it opens up into a courtyard here.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.020
So many families and a lot
of families live together

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.650
- [Ali] And they lived here for centuries.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.549
Their parents and grandparents
all used to live together.

00:08:05.549 --> 00:08:06.661
- You see the birds
- These courtyards

00:08:06.661 --> 00:08:08.915
are the common combined
for all the families.

00:08:08.915 --> 00:08:09.946
- Okay
- This is the shared area.

00:08:09.946 --> 00:08:11.610
- Ah
- They all share together.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.080
- [Mark] And it's amazing how on the road,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.660
it's loud and you hear the honking,

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.020
but then you come back in the alley,

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.990
you come back into the courtyard,

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.171
and it's peaceful, it's so peaceful.

00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:24.088
(percussion music)

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.280
We stepped outside of the alleyway,

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.890
and immediately outside, he has corn,

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.750
he has chickpeas, he has
a charcoal stove going,

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.120
he has a rounded pan, which
is filled with black salt.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.180
And you can feel the heat

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.110
just radiating off that black salt,

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.690
and as soon as you order the snack,

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.490
he tosses in a handful of corn,

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.870
which is already peeled off from the cob.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.900
And he tosses in a handful of chickpeas.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.500
And then he whooshes that around

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.290
in the hot black salt until it cooks.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.280
And you can feel the
heat of that roasting.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.480
You can really smell the
aroma of that corn coming out.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.730
He makes a little cone
out of a piece of paper

00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.830
and puts that snack in there.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.310
And that's freshly
roasted, that's beautiful.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.763
What an amazing way to roast.

00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:07.780
Mm

00:09:08.637 --> 00:09:09.703
Oh, it's wonderful.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.340
It's kinda dry, but it that attractive,

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.380
kinda dry kinda taste, like very starchy.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.800
It has a wonderful saltiness to it,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.909
which I believe just comes from the flavor

00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:22.500
of that heated black salt.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.610
You can taste the salt
all the way through it,

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.780
instead of just being on the surface.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.468
Yeah, that's amazing.

00:09:28.468 --> 00:09:32.370
(happy upbeat music)

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.473
It's huge, almost the size of a small cow.

00:09:35.426 --> 00:09:38.610
(happy upbeat music)

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.090
Yeah, the streets are just starting

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.840
to come alive in Lahore now.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.780
It's buzzing and bustling.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.680
There are donkey carts, motorbikes,

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.140
everywhere little tuk
tuks and cars and buses.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.170
Oh man, the liveliness, the
energy, the street food,

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.000
it is amazing here.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.993
I'm loving it.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.628
Okay, we're gonna cross this street.

00:09:59.628 --> 00:10:02.981
(motors revving)

00:10:02.981 --> 00:10:05.898
(percussion music)

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.950
Walking down the street again,

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.370
and we came across a man
selling sweet potatoes,

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.970
but his display of sweet
potatoes is beautiful.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.180
It's just like a giant
bouquet of sweet potatoes

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.750
arranged in a spoke formation.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.270
We ordered, he slices
open the sweet potato,

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.070
he takes it out of the skin,

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.040
he cuts it into pieces,

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.080
and then he sprinkles
on some masala powder,

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.380
a mixture of spices.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.710
And then, the interesting part is where

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.270
he sprinkles on, he squeezes on,

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:51.033
it looks like a mandarin
orange juice all over it.

00:10:55.251 --> 00:10:56.084
Mm

00:10:57.774 --> 00:10:58.690
- It's good.
- Oh, it's nice.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.690
- [Ali] Even the masala is very optimum.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.023
- [Mark] Uh huh

00:11:02.023 --> 00:11:03.301
- Not very much, not very low

00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:04.134
- Mm hmm

00:11:04.134 --> 00:11:05.575
- The right quantity of masala.

00:11:05.575 --> 00:11:06.460
Very nice

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.640
- And then, rather than being lime juice,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.050
where it's more sharp, it's more mellow

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.423
with that mandarin juice.

00:11:13.184 --> 00:11:14.017
Mm, yeah.

00:11:14.017 --> 00:11:16.353
That's a really healthy
tasting, delicious snack.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.323
(happy upbeat music)

00:11:26.968 --> 00:11:28.270
We just arrived to the next area

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.620
which is called Shah Alami,

00:11:30.647 --> 00:11:32.290
and we're gonna jump in the back.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.881
This is a motorbike connected to a cart.

00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:39.120
We're gonna jump in and go down the road

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.433
to go to the next spot.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.556
Okay

00:11:44.556 --> 00:11:46.726
- This is awesome.

00:11:46.726 --> 00:11:49.643
(bright pop music)

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.880
- Oh, this is the spot right here.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.814
- 45 years ago

00:12:01.814 --> 00:12:02.938
- [Mark] 45 years ago?

00:12:02.938 --> 00:12:04.215
- This is the Baba ji.

00:12:04.215 --> 00:12:05.048
- [Mark] Ah, okay.

00:12:05.048 --> 00:12:07.610
Again, as soon as we got
out of that motorbike,

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.240
we came to the corner of the street,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.630
and immediately, you can see
people just standing around

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.110
or sitting on motorbikes, eating.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.143
It's like a popsicle, but it's kulfi.

00:12:16.143 --> 00:12:17.823
It's a type of ice cream.

00:12:19.201 --> 00:12:21.860
But this place is called Baba ji Kulfi,

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.520
which literally translates to

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.660
older, respected man ice cream.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.480
And you can see the old, respected man,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.210
he's on the pillar of the wall.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.110
It's made from milk and khoya,

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.270
and we were just talking to the owners.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:39.030
Khoya is milk that has been
cooked down and reduced

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.020
into a really condensed cream.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.370
- I couldn't control myself.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.286
I already had a bite.

00:12:43.286 --> 00:12:44.510
(Mark laughing)

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.140
- Oh, and they've been here
for 45 years, as well, right?

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.860
- Yeah, a lot of history behind it.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.693
- Yeah

00:12:51.436 --> 00:12:53.520
Oh, it's cold on my front teeth.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.860
It has this kinda grainy texture to it.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.693
Really good though.

00:12:57.693 --> 00:13:00.830
You can taste the sweetened
condensed milk kinda taste

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:05.200
to it because of the
khoya, that roasted cream.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.033
Oh, this is your first time...

00:13:06.033 --> 00:13:07.180
- This is my first time
- to have this?

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.013
- Yeah
- Awesome

00:13:08.013 --> 00:13:09.243
- It's amazing, it's really nice.

00:13:09.243 --> 00:13:10.080
- [Mark] It is, it's really good.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.267
- [Ali] But it's the
finest and best kulfis

00:13:11.267 --> 00:13:14.017
that I've had in Pakistan so far.

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.842
- Oh

00:13:18.495 --> 00:13:21.886
That kinda sticks to the stick.

00:13:21.886 --> 00:13:23.536
But that went down really easily.

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:27.860
(traffic and cars honking)

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:28.910
Look at those skills.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.653
It looks more like a meat
grinder than a fruit press.

00:13:41.352 --> 00:13:43.941
(car honks)

00:13:43.941 --> 00:13:46.691
(engine roaring)

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.510
Oh yeah, you can just
see that froth on top,

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.180
that is fresh, just ground.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.023
He just smashed that orange.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.170
You can just taste the freshness,

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.800
and actually, it's more
salty than it is sweet

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.270
because he added in like a
whole teaspoon of salt in here.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.570
To me, it's more like an energy drink.

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.920
Not like an energy
drink, but like Gatorade,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.933
a natural Gatorade because
of that salty taste to it.

00:14:18.933 --> 00:14:21.850
(percussion music)

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.670
It's just amazing how everything

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.103
is able to function and flow together.

00:14:28.103 --> 00:14:32.263
I mean, there's motorbikes,
just seas of motorbikes.

00:14:32.263 --> 00:14:34.270
And there are literally like,

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.670
there's milk men going
opposite directions,

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:41.653
there's horse carriages and
donkey carts, and pull carts.

00:14:43.972 --> 00:14:45.020
And then there's just,

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:50.020
I mean you can be looking
out at the street as you go

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.547
and just see fascinating thing
and fascinating circumstance.

00:14:56.606 --> 00:14:59.523
(percussion music)

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.710
We did a little loop.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.350
We passed by the jewelry market.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.010
There's so much action
and energy and colors.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.620
We saw another snack on
the side of the road.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:17.300
He's making chana chaat, which
is chickpea snack mixture,

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.577
but it's so complex,
it's so amazing looking.

00:15:20.577 --> 00:15:22.470
You know, we had to stop.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:23.303
Yes, sure.

00:15:24.168 --> 00:15:25.001
- Yes

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.972
because I have seen you in so
many countries interviewing

00:15:31.972 --> 00:15:33.560
- Thank you very much

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.931
- Ghana, Kenya, and so many countries.

00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:37.638
- Thank you, thank you.

00:15:37.638 --> 00:15:39.250
Thank you very much, nice to meet you.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:43.430
I've literally been in
Lahore just for 12 hours now,

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.690
and we have met so many amazing people.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.690
The people, the food has been amazing,

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.170
the people have been the highlight.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:51.003
- [Ali] Yogurt and menthol

00:15:51.003 --> 00:15:52.090
- [Mark] Yogurt and menthol

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.540
- [Ali] Dried apricot chutney

00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:57.938
(cars honking)

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:07.303
(speaking Urdu)

00:16:07.303 --> 00:16:08.613
- [Mark] It's just amazing

00:16:08.613 --> 00:16:11.210
(speaking Urdu)

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.790
- And the uncle who's making it,

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.770
he has, again, so much incredible skill.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:20.070
He's in his fifties and
they started selling here,

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.960
he started making this with
his father when he was a kid,

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.880
right in this exact same position.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.070
They've been selling it here for 40 years,

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.300
so when he was around 10 years old

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.547
is when he first starting
learn how to make this.

00:16:31.547 --> 00:16:35.620
So, 40 years of perfecting this snack.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.453
Alright

00:16:36.453 --> 00:16:38.910
- [Joel] Proper street
food cart here, so...

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:40.520
- Chana, chana chaat

00:16:43.007 --> 00:16:43.840
Oh

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.673
- Mm

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.740
- Oh, that's amazing.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:47.962
- [Ali] Is it?

00:16:47.962 --> 00:16:49.912
- Oh, the chutney, the apricot chutney.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.350
- Amazing

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.949
- Yeah, that one is incredible.

00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:55.860
- So incredible, really nice.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.510
- Yeah, well, what really stands out to me

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:58.773
is the apricot chutney.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.050
It has that sweet fruitiness to it,

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.940
and then you taste the onions in there.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.010
You taste the coolness of the yogurt.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.040
Then you've got the
creaminess of the chana,

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.420
those chickpeas.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.370
Man, what a refreshingly
starchy, just delicious

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:14.563
whipped up snack.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.520
And then at the front of his cart,

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.190
he just has a pile of vegetables.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:20.490
I think it's self service.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.610
Oh yeah, oh those aren't even pickled.

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:25.230
They're actually just fresh.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.010
He does have a bag of fresh chilies.

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:30.050
A quick chile in between
bites of the chaat.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:30.883
Cheers
- Cheers

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:37.200
- Chew that up nicely

00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:41.860
Oh
- Mm

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.055
- It's not that spicy, actually.

00:17:44.055 --> 00:17:44.888
(speaking Urdu)

00:17:44.888 --> 00:17:46.700
- [Ali] Now he's not taking the money

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.084
- [Mark] Even after everything
that we've eaten today,

00:17:49.084 --> 00:17:52.592
that has given me a sense of like,

00:17:52.592 --> 00:17:57.240
overdose of heightened,
just excitement and energy.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.960
That was unbelievably good.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.510
We tried to pay, he would
not even accept payment.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.980
He is an amazing man.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.320
When you are in Lahore,

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.777
Mohammed Illias, Mohammed Illias.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.513
Shukriyah, man.

00:18:10.513 --> 00:18:12.883
It was unbelievably amazing.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.510
And if you look around, oh, funny enough,

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:19.010
Thai center is right there.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.990
So, he's right in front of Thai center.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.823
Come here when you're in Lahore.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.367
He's amazing.

00:18:26.367 --> 00:18:29.450
(happy upbeat music)

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:37.747
Thank you very much, thank you.

00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:41.470
Oh yeah, the kulfi.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:45.180
Well, that was a fantastic mini side trip.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.930
We're back to the car now.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:51.338
- What a trip and this
is one hour of two weeks.

00:18:51.338 --> 00:18:54.380
My mind is blown, I'm so excited.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.890
This is awesome.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.330
- Everything that we've eaten so far today

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.220
has just been morning snacks.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.044
We're now on our way for the real lunch.

00:19:02.044 --> 00:19:05.127
(happy upbeat music)

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.770
Immediately, you can smell
the meat and the spices.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.800
And we're at a restaurant,
it's called Butt Karahi.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.580
This is one of the most
famous restaurants in Lahore

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:18.600
for a dish called karahi,
but specifically, the mutton,

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.500
Which mutton is goat in Pakistan.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.988
The mutton karahi, as well
as, the chicken karahi,

00:19:24.988 --> 00:19:25.970
that's what we're gonna eat here.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.320
And he just brought in a
fresh batch of chickens.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.070
You can actually choose your
own live chicken, they said,

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.680
and then they'll cook it immediately.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.061
It does not get fresher than that.

00:19:36.061 --> 00:19:38.480
(chickens clucking)

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.690
They're giving me the honor
of choosing the chicken,

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:41.860
so I have the pressure.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.363
I have no idea how to
choose a good chicken.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.733
Which one do you think?

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.660
And in five minutes, the
chicken is completely skinned.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.500
He just kinda yanked off
the skin and feathers,

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.950
and now he's just slicing it up,

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.073
using that foot knife technique,

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.120
into bite-sized pieces.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.513
Oh man, that is gonna be a fresh curry.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:08.700
We've chosen our chicken,

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.760
now we're choosing a piece of the goat,

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.950
and I think we've getting
some of the leg here.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.440
Oh, he just split those legs in half,

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.300
but I'm taking peek.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:20.300
This is almost like a
little meat hut in here,

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.627
and he's wearing the full scrub outfit.

00:20:23.627 --> 00:20:25.977
Oh, I just got hit with
a little chunk of meat.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:32.610
That is knife skills.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.270
So, the butchery and where
they prepared the meat

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.610
is over on this side,

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.370
but then they have a main dining room,

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.590
which is actually very
nice and quite luxurious,

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.060
which is on this side right there.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.070
We're gonna get a quick look
at how they cook the karahi,

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.180
and karahi is actually the metal pan

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.220
that the dish is cooked in.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.370
So, it's a curry, but cooked in a karahi,

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:53.420
which is that metal pan.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.820
And he adds in literally
like a half a block,

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.960
a brick of butter into every pan.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.330
They add in tomatoes, which
he chops up, stewed tomatoes.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.960
Then he adds in scoops of cream,

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.120
so it's gonna be hearty,
it's gonna be rich.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.510
But before they serve it,

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:12.870
they sizzle it and boil
out most of the liquid.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.730
So, it's still saucy, but it's more thick.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.520
It's not like a runny sauce.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.530
It's a very thickened, spicious blend

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.550
with the meat tender,
just falling apart in it.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.836
That is gonna be amazing.

00:21:24.836 --> 00:21:26.828
(sizzling)

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:29.495
(speaking Urdu)

00:21:32.448 --> 00:21:34.450
This is a really nice place up here,

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.210
and it's really filled up now.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.350
There's a lot of people here.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:40.050
It was an hour long wait, but I, for sure,

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:40.990
know it was worth it.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.400
The moment has arrived.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.610
They put them on our
table and immediately,

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.620
you can smell the butter,
you can smell the spices.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.790
The only thing better than
one karahi, is two karahis.

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.700
So, we got both of them.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.790
One is the mutton, which is goat.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:58.517
And the other is the chicken,
which I chose the chicken.

00:21:58.517 --> 00:22:02.220
(percussion music)

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.380
And that's all sliced
ginger on top of there, too?

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.631
- [Man] Yeah
- [Mark] Ginger, right?

00:22:06.631 --> 00:22:07.464
- [Man] Ho, ho, ho.

00:22:07.464 --> 00:22:08.780
- [Mark] But yeah, they simmer it down.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.707
They boil it down until it's
more of a thick, rich sauce.

00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:15.310
And you can see the butter.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.257
They literally added in
like a block of butter

00:22:18.257 --> 00:22:19.680
into every pan.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.570
They finish it off with strips of ginger,

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.683
as well as, coriander,
fresh chopped coriander.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.920
Wow, it is unbelievable.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.670
Okay, I gotta try the mutton first.

00:22:36.447 --> 00:22:41.447
(laughs) yeah.

00:22:41.451 --> 00:22:42.780
That is insane.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.500
The richness of the butter,

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.106
and you can taste all of those,

00:22:46.106 --> 00:22:48.380
the blend of spices in
there, the dried spices.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.630
But then you've got the freshness

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.130
of the freshly chopped ginger.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.850
That is a beautiful, beautiful thing.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.060
And the mutton is so tender.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.805
Next is for the chicken,

00:22:57.805 --> 00:22:58.800
and kind of break off
some of that chicken.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.457
You can again see all the
slices of fresh ginger in there.

00:23:02.457 --> 00:23:05.374
(percussion music)

00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:07.969
Whoa, mm.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.354
And I taste the fresh chilies
in the chicken, as well.

00:23:11.354 --> 00:23:14.271
(percussion music)

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:20.860
The chicken is absolutely stunning,

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.403
but I think the mutton, I
think the mutton is the winner.

00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:26.110
- It's amazing and I
would say the same thing.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.580
Mutton is the winner of today.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.213
It's amazing, full marks to the mutton.

00:23:32.213 --> 00:23:34.340
- [Mark] What about you, Joel?

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.140
- I couldn't actually
believe how soft that was

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.590
when the first bite hit my mouth.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:39.793
I just started laughing.

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:41.613
- Which one do you like better,

00:23:41.613 --> 00:23:42.964
the chicken or the mutton?

00:23:42.964 --> 00:23:44.241
- Mutton.
- [Mark] Mutton, okay.

00:23:44.241 --> 00:23:45.670
- Delicious, really good.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:48.733
- [Mark] Just every single
bite is a total excitement.

00:23:48.733 --> 00:23:51.030
I'm gonna get a bite, kinda
scooping up some of the spice

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:55.930
from around the rim, the rim of the pan.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.731
Oh, with a piece of the,

00:23:57.731 --> 00:23:59.653
the last piece of that mutton.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:01.923
Scoop er up.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.973
That spice, that ginger, that tender meat.

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.693
(laughs)

00:24:14.897 --> 00:24:17.165
And that completes the karahi.

00:24:17.165 --> 00:24:20.082
(percussion music)

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.420
Lahore is really a night city,

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.430
and so, there's so many
restaurants that open up at night.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:30.630
It's almost 8 p.m. now.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.660
We have quite a lot
more food to eat today.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.340
I've gotta admit, I'm getting
a little bit sleepy though.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.460
Joel, how are you doing?

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.760
- Yeah, I'm excited for this fish,

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.427
but oh man, this has been a long day.

00:24:42.427 --> 00:24:45.581
Awesome, but it's been a long one.

00:24:45.581 --> 00:24:46.828
(sizzling)

00:24:46.828 --> 00:24:48.240
(Mark laughing)

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.920
- [Mark] So, the restaurant is
called Saddique Fish Corner.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.320
And yeah, this is fried fish restaurant.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.990
They have not one, not two, not three,

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.840
there's four vats, pans of oil,

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.230
which are bubbling away all
at the same time, frying fish.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:05.930
And the oil is dark and murky,

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.310
but that's because it's pure mustard oil

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.910
that the fish is frying in.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.730
But it's just a beautiful scene.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:15.960
It almost looks like it's like
tide pools of frying fish.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.813
Okay, thank you.

00:25:17.709 --> 00:25:19.280
- [Man] Hot, hot.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.683
- [Mark] The chef is giving
me a taste test right now.

00:25:20.683 --> 00:25:22.593
This is right out of the oil.

00:25:25.929 --> 00:25:26.762
Oh.

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:29.391
Oh, man.

00:25:29.391 --> 00:25:31.180
(Mark laughing)

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.540
Very nice

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.543
Oh, that's so good.

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.170
You taste the spice in there.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:41.170
I can taste the coriander seed, I think.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:43.950
And then there's seeds of cumin in there.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.650
And then, yeah, you've got
that mustard oil aroma.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.313
Oh man, that is just
greasy delightfulness.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.660
There frying the fish in
the first shop down there,

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.860
but then they have about three,

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.410
one, two, three, is that four?

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.130
Four, like, shop houses,
which are all dining rooms,

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.680
and they're all packed to film.

00:26:05.182 --> 00:26:08.765
(traffic and cars honking)

00:26:10.159 --> 00:26:11.779
Yeah, get your bite.

00:26:11.779 --> 00:26:13.673
- Awesome

00:26:13.673 --> 00:26:15.700
- It's still smoke, it's still coming out.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.220
- [Mark] It come with a
sauce on the side, as well.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.280
But that crust, you can see
that golden crust of spice

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.723
and from the mustard
oil, how yellow it is.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.630
Really incredibly good.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:33.755
And even the fish has
this silky texture to it.

00:26:33.755 --> 00:26:37.510
And then you've got,
you can really actually

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.210
taste the mustardy taste of it.

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.213
And then you've got
definitely cumin seeds.

00:26:45.285 --> 00:26:46.118
Mm

00:26:47.304 --> 00:26:49.640
The sauce is just kinda mellow tasting.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.810
The sauce is more, almost citrusy tasting,

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.090
almost fruity, like almost apricoty.

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.480
That complements without
taking away the flavor

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.980
of the marinade of the fish.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.360
We devoured the fish,
but we did figure out

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.810
that this is actually apricot.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:02.720
It's an apricot sauce.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.830
It's almost like a light,
refreshing apricot jam.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:07.330
And you can actually drink it.

00:27:11.672 --> 00:27:14.290
(cars beeping)

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.317
Hello, how are you?

00:27:16.904 --> 00:27:19.444
(motorbikes engines purring)

00:27:19.444 --> 00:27:21.440
(cars honking)

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.120
What's the name of the chicken dish?

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.320
- It's called chicken sajji.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.300
- Chicken sajji.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.450
And that's also a very
common dish in Lahore.

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.590
- In fact, all over Pakistan.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:30.423
- All over Pakistan

00:27:30.423 --> 00:27:31.256
- Yeah

00:27:31.256 --> 00:27:34.030
- And there's a very well
known place for chicken sadji

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:37.560
just up ahead in this same
area in this same market,

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.920
which we are navigating our way

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.973
through the motorbikes
and the traffic to get to.

00:27:44.278 --> 00:27:45.348
Whoa

00:27:45.348 --> 00:27:46.900
- If you see the smoke is rising

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:47.860
- That's coming from them?

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.380
- Yeah, that coming from the...

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.213
- Oh ho ho, wow.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.093
Hello

00:27:53.105 --> 00:27:55.040
(speaking Urdu)

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.353
(motorbikes purring)

00:27:58.353 --> 00:28:00.860
(fire crackling)

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.150
We made it to Khalifa chicken sajji.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:05.790
They have some chickens on the
skewers which are vertical,

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:07.010
which are getting ready to go,

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.510
but then they're roasting the chickens.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:11.650
It's almost like, almost
looks like a slow roast,

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.100
like a manual style style rotisserie.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.230
So, he just monitors the
chickens continuously,

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:20.230
rotating as they need to be rotated,

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:25.150
and then, just perfectly, so
the skin is perfectly roasted.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:25.983
Very good.

00:28:26.863 --> 00:28:28.820
(laughing)

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.063
Oh man, that is just, that is amazing.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:34.123
- Delicious

00:28:34.123 --> 00:28:35.680
- [Mark] Chicken sajji, delicious.

00:28:37.271 --> 00:28:39.670
(clanging)

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:42.170
That is a fascinating, impressive grill.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.610
It's so huge and just the way

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:47.750
he carefully rotates those chickens

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.150
and moves them down the line.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:50.390
As soon as the chicken is done roasting,

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:52.223
they pull it off the grill,

00:28:52.223 --> 00:28:55.520
and then he slices it perfectly,
in a way, methodically,

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.240
because then he slices open the breast,

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.980
he slices open the leg, and
then he squeezes in lime

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.110
in every slice that he makes.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:04.970
And then, he pours in, he
dumps in some seasoning,

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.050
looks like some salt plus some seasoning.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.643
And then that finishes off your chicken.

00:29:13.302 --> 00:29:16.590
(speaking Urdu)

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.310
They actually brought us out a table

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.060
and we are sitting with the owner now,

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.730
gonna dig in on the side of the street.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.370
They do also have a dining room inside,

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:28.530
but we wanted to enjoy the ambience,

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:29.860
the street side atmosphere,

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:33.805
be bathing in the chicken
smoke as we're eating.

00:29:33.805 --> 00:29:35.503
I can't wait to try the chicken.

00:29:37.337 --> 00:29:39.216
It's so hot and fresh
right off the rotisserie.

00:29:39.216 --> 00:29:40.200
- [Joel] Yeah, look at that.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.360
- [Mark] Yeah, you can
smell that masala seasoning

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.393
that he sprinkled on and the lime.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.123
- This is the coolest street
food I think I've ever tried.

00:29:54.319 --> 00:29:56.986
(both laughing)

00:29:59.062 --> 00:30:00.223
I love the lime.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.347
- [Mark] The lime and the
masala, that's what makes it.

00:30:07.101 --> 00:30:08.353
Oh, with the rice, mm.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.440
And the rice, again, you
can taste that masala.

00:30:16.731 --> 00:30:18.981
- Amazing, very good taste.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.733
- [Mark] And the food just keeps coming.

00:30:29.403 --> 00:30:30.507
How is it?

00:30:30.507 --> 00:30:32.922
- It's amazing, amazing.

00:30:32.922 --> 00:30:36.002
Delicious, yum, lemon, lemon.

00:30:36.002 --> 00:30:38.919
(percussion music)

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.461
- Okay, I do prefer the thigh.

00:30:44.461 --> 00:30:45.730
It's juicier.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.870
The breast is a little dry,
the thigh is nice and juicy.

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:50.760
I'm just leaning back in my chair,

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.050
but we have one more spot to go to,

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:55.450
one more restaurant to
go to for dinner tonight.

00:30:56.695 --> 00:30:58.107
Thank you, shukriya.

00:30:58.107 --> 00:30:59.810
- [Joel] Thank you very much.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.154
(motorbike engines humming)

00:31:01.154 --> 00:31:02.503
- [Mark] Oh, we're
going against the river.

00:31:05.448 --> 00:31:08.531
(happy upbeat music)

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.190
The final restaurant
that we're at going to

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:16.020
is called Khan Baba, and this is Ali,

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.550
he said it's one of his
favorite restaurants,

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.030
but it's kinda a courtyard section.

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:21.570
I know they have a seating area
here, which is the old one.

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:24.040
We're gonna go into the new
seating section, which is here,

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.850
and then you can smell the
different cooking stations

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.370
kinda around the entire courtyard.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:31.100
But one final meal.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.640
This has been a long
day and a lot of food.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.329
- These are the keeman
naan, like the minced meat.

00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:41.590
(happy upbeat music)

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.921
- Goat, goat...

00:31:43.921 --> 00:31:44.754
- [Joel] Goat

00:31:44.754 --> 00:31:47.200
- [Mark] Goat chops, yeah,
goat chops, thank you.

00:31:49.439 --> 00:31:51.689
(laughing)

00:31:54.115 --> 00:31:56.520
Oh, that tenderness
was totally unexpected.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.720
That's just like melt in
your mouth tenderness,

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.473
and like fatty ooziness,

00:32:01.307 --> 00:32:03.887
and then that's just like charred grilled.

00:32:03.887 --> 00:32:06.970
(happy upbeat music)

00:32:08.457 --> 00:32:11.957
That is like supreme, tender roasted meat.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:17.223
- [Ali] It was with minced
meat, minced meat, yes.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.120
- [Mark] Okay, next dish
is the mutton korma,

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.780
and this is a, yeah, you
can see the pieces of meat,

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.220
which just look so tender again.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.713
You can see the slices of ginger
in there, as well, I think.

00:32:32.879 --> 00:32:33.712
Mm

00:32:35.145 --> 00:32:35.978
Oh

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:39.840
Again, just ridiculously tender meat,

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:44.840
and then, that's kind of a
very rich, garlicky, oily,

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.570
just supreme sauce.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:49.730
That is not the first time today

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:54.513
we've eaten a rich, rich,
buttery, buttery meat dish.

00:32:56.810 --> 00:33:01.329
What a way to end this incredible
food tour of Lahore today.

00:33:01.329 --> 00:33:05.650
I have to admit, I'm very
tired, I'm very sleepy,

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:09.430
but just had a couple
bites of those goat chops

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.870
and that korma, and
man, that was delicious.

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:13.703
Hello.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.565
- Hello, how are you?

00:33:16.565 --> 00:33:18.760
- I'm fine, enjoy.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.410
(Mark laughing)

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.133
- And so, I've just come outside,

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.120
and just was gonna
finish off the video here

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.760
because we're heading home from here

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.680
to get a good night's rest.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.160
But what an unbelievable
day in Lahore today.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.250
It has been, the people we met,

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:41.053
and yeah, now more people,
amazing people in Lahore.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.450
And that's been the
story of the entire day,

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.917
not just right now, but the entire day.

00:33:46.917 --> 00:33:47.750
- Sing now

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:48.890
- [Mark] You want to sing,
oh, you want to sing a song?

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:50.179
Okay.

00:33:50.179 --> 00:33:52.157
- Music, classic music.

00:33:52.157 --> 00:33:55.324
(man singing in Urdu)

00:34:12.471 --> 00:34:14.413
(applause)

00:34:14.413 --> 00:34:16.749
- [Mark] Wow, very good, amazing.

00:34:16.749 --> 00:34:17.582
- Thank you.

00:34:17.582 --> 00:34:18.938
- [Mark] Very good, thank you.

00:34:18.938 --> 00:34:20.065
- Thank you so much, Mark, my bro.

00:34:20.065 --> 00:34:20.898
- [Mark] Thank you so much.

00:34:20.898 --> 00:34:22.950
Again, I just want to say
a massive thank you to Ali,

00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:25.130
he's the CEO of Landmark Communications

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:26.470
and Pakistan Travelmart.

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:30.350
He helped us with our visas,
he's made all the plans for us,

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:32.920
and I fully owe it to Ali.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.410
Thank you so much, Ali.

00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:37.530
It's been so much fun to
hang out with you and eat,

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:40.170
and then just, yeah, thank
you for arranging everything.

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:41.200
You are awesome.

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.500
And to Malik for also
helping arrange everything

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.780
