he really made it seem that it was
 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.510
he really made it seem that it was
possible and something that I'll think

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520
possible and something that I'll think
 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.490
possible and something that I'll think
about even more and hopefully one day

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500
about even more and hopefully one day
 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.290
about even more and hopefully one day
could engage in because it clearly has

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300
could engage in because it clearly has
 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.960
could engage in because it clearly has
so much potential for creating wonderful

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970
so much potential for creating wonderful
 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.310

the work that is recognized by a Nobel
 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.109
the work that is recognized by a Nobel
Prize and and I I just urge you all to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
Prize and and I I just urge you all to
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.359
Prize and and I I just urge you all to
think about it I'm glad that you're here

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
think about it I'm glad that you're here
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.210
think about it I'm glad that you're here
because I think that young students and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
because I think that young students and
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.160
because I think that young students and
trainees it's it's really helpful for us

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170
trainees it's it's really helpful for us
 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.800
trainees it's it's really helpful for us
to have role models and I think you know

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
to have role models and I think you know
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.889
to have role models and I think you know
we learn a lot from your story and Joe

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899
we learn a lot from your story and Joe
 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.590
we learn a lot from your story and Joe
story we couldn't have predicted any of

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
story we couldn't have predicted any of
 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.180
story we couldn't have predicted any of
this and I and I have to say that we

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190
this and I and I have to say that we
 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.219
this and I and I have to say that we
didn't go into it with the idea that

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229
didn't go into it with the idea that
 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.550
didn't go into it with the idea that
somehow if we solve this problem we're

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
somehow if we solve this problem we're
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.260
somehow if we solve this problem we're
going to cure a disease we just it was

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
going to cure a disease we just it was
 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.090
going to cure a disease we just it was
just curiosity one of the very important

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
just curiosity one of the very important
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.090
just curiosity one of the very important
lessons that Mike teaches us is that a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100
lessons that Mike teaches us is that a
 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.870
lessons that Mike teaches us is that a
dedication and commitment always win the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880
dedication and commitment always win the
 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.650
dedication and commitment always win the
day michael is a tremendous scientist

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660
day michael is a tremendous scientist
 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.330
day michael is a tremendous scientist
with a great wealth of knowledge and he

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
with a great wealth of knowledge and he
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.999
with a great wealth of knowledge and he
is he shared that knowledge over the the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009
is he shared that knowledge over the the
 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.800
is he shared that knowledge over the the
last two days during the event both at

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810
last two days during the event both at
 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.330

the wall meets the site this is the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
the wall meets the site this is the
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.930
the wall meets the site this is the
feedback mechanism that allows cells to

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940
feedback mechanism that allows cells to
 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.699
feedback mechanism that allows cells to
acquire cholesterol when they need it

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709
acquire cholesterol when they need it
 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.100
acquire cholesterol when they need it
and to turn off the sources of

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110
and to turn off the sources of
 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.440
and to turn off the sources of
cholesterol when they don't need it and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
cholesterol when they don't need it and
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.810
cholesterol when they don't need it and
that's what Joe and I basically shared

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820
that's what Joe and I basically shared
 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.000
that's what Joe and I basically shared
the nobel prize for this is an

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010
the nobel prize for this is an
 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.390
the nobel prize for this is an
opportunity to get people exposed to the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400
opportunity to get people exposed to the
 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.670
opportunity to get people exposed to the
the what and the why it a little bit

more depth to emphasize that this is why
 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.039
more depth to emphasize that this is why
we invest in science this is why we

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049
we invest in science this is why we
 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.590
we invest in science this is why we
invest in research in order to really

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600
invest in research in order to really
 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.400
