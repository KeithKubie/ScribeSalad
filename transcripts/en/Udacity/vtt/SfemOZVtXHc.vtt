00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.420
If cells didn't double their DNA before dividing, then every

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.900
time they divided they would cut their genome in half

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.930
from 46 chromosomes to 23 in each daughter cell. All

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.810
the chromes would line up in pairs and then separate in

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.380
a way that each daughter cell would only get one

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.250
of those chromosomes. Think about how bad this would be

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.950
for trying to keep genetic consistency in all your cells.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.880
You'd have one mother cell here that's heterozygous for lactose metabolism.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.080
We have a dominant and a recessive allele, one

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.760
on each chromosome. There's no duplication of DNA. So, after

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.120
cell division occurs, then each daughter cell would only end

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.850
up with one chromosome. And think about it, because of

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.420
the heterozygous nature of the mother cell, each daughter cell

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.130
is going to have a different genotype, a different genetic makeup.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.640
One will have the dominant allele for lactase persistence, and

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.790
the other will have the recessive allele for lactase non-persistence.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.630
This would mean you'd have cells in your body

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.800
that end up with different genotypes and different phenotypes.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.300
Therefore, before every cell division, the DNA would be

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.940
duplicated. And that way, when cell division occurs, each

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.160
daughter cell ends up with the same amount that

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.700
the mother cell originally had before duplication. So just

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.710
to make sure we're on the same page here.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.890
If DNA duplication does occur, how many chromosomes will

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.380
each daughter cell have? Again, assume equal division,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.870
and put your numerical answer in this box here.
