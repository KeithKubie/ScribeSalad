00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.710
Today I found out that the moon isn’t as
old as the Earth and was formed approximately

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.770
30–50 million years after the Solar System
based on what is called ‘the giant impact

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.770
theory’.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.039
Although no one can say for sure exactly how
our moon came to be, there a few hypothesis

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:24.010
and theories of which the ‘the giant impact
theory’ is the most compelling and widely

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.010
accepted.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.110
In this theory, the Earth had no moon until
it was struck by a rogue planet which instantly

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.110
vaporized.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.149
The impact is said to have created a cloud
that reached roughly 13,700 miles or 22,000

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.100
kilometers high, where it condensed into solid
particles that orbited the Earth.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.969
Over time they aggregated into larger moonlets,
which eventually combined to form the moon

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.059
we know today.

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.899
This theory is supported by quite a bit of
evidence such as: even though the Earth has

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.649
a large iron core and the moon does not, the
moon has exactly the same oxygen isotope composition

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.870
as the Earth, unlike other planets formed
in other parts of the Solar System.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.860
This indicates the moon should have been formed
from material in Earth’s neighborhood.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.280
Another significant piece of evidence comes
from the oldest record of Earth’s ocean

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.720
tides ever found, which were 3.2-billion-year-old
rocks from South Africa.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.580
Pinstriped circular sand-and-silt layers in
the rocks were deposited by daily, fortnightly

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.250
and monthly tidal cycles.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.920
If the moon formed elsewhere, then was captured
intact by Earth’s gravity as some theories

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.880
state, the moon’s orbit would have been
extremely elliptical and tidal rock layers

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.310
would not have shown such normal cycles.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.610
Computer simulations modeling a giant impact
are consistent with measurements of the angular

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.280
momentum of the Earth–Moon system, and the
small size of the lunar core.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.620
They also show that most of the Moon came
from the impactor planet and not from Earth.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.350
The post-impact mixing of the vaporized material
between the forming Earth and Moon could have

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.920
equalized their isotopic compositions, but
this again is just speculation.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.920
Bonus Facts:

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.920
The rotation of the moon (i.e- the time it
takes to spin once around on its own axis)

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.920
takes the same amount of time as the moon
takes to complete one orbit of the Earth,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.920
about 27.3 days.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.920
This means the moon’s rotation is synchronized
in a way that causes the moon to show the

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920
same face to the Earth at all times.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920
One hemisphere always faces us, while the
other always faces away.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920
The lunar far side (aka the dark side) has
been photographed only from spacecraft.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.920
The South African rocks indicating tidal patterns
indicate that 3.2 billion years ago, the moon

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.920
orbited Earth in perhaps a 20-day month and
was 25-percent closer to Earth than it is

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.920
today.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.920
At that time, the Earth would have spun faster,
so there would have been about 550 days in

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.920
a year.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920
Temperature on the moon’s surface is said
to range from 243 degrees Fahrenheit (117

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.920
degrees Celsius) for two weeks at a time (the
lunar day lasts about a month), then, for

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.920
an equal period, the same spot is in the dark
and cools to about -272 degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.920
(-169 degrees Celsius).

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.920
The saying ‘once in a blue moon ‘ refers
to the occurrence of two full moons during

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.920
one calendar month.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920
The Moon is bigger than Pluto.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.920
And at roughly one-fourth the diameter of
Earth, some scientists think the Moon is more

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.920
like a planet.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.920
They refer to the Earth-Moon system as a “double
planet.”

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.920
Pluto and its moon Charon are also called
a double-planet system by some.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.920
Bye-Bye Moon.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.920
The Moon is actually moving away from us.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.920
Each year, the Moon steals some of Earth’s
rotational energy, and uses it to propel itself

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.920
about 3.8 centimeters higher in its orbit.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.920
Researchers say that when it was formed, the
Moon was about 14,000 miles (22,530 kilometers)

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.920
from Earth.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930
It’s now more than 280,000 miles, or 450,000
kilometers away.
