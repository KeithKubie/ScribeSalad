00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.620
The first step in getting your game to
make money is to make your game fun.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.210
Build a game that everyone wants
to play and pay money for.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.400
Of course,
that's easier said than done, and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.470
this is why learning about
engagement is important.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.090
Game engagement is all about
how to design your game

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.900
to have that addictive quality
that keeps players wanting more.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.119
It's really important for monetization
because the more your game is played and

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.998
your users drawn into your game world,
the more money your game will make.

00:00:27.998 --> 00:00:31.283
Take Candy Crush as an example.

00:00:31.283 --> 00:00:34.258
When I play it, I'll play whenever
I have a moment to myself,

00:00:34.258 --> 00:00:37.462
like when I'm on the bus or just
trying to seem busy on my phone, and

00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:39.140
I'll try to get to the next level.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.710
It's really simple to play and there
are always more levels for me to get to.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.680
Just look at this level map.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.970
I have so far to go.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.050
I feel like I have to keep playing, and

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.540
these levels are part of why
Candy Crush is such an addicting game.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.341
I even got my mom hooked, and
now she's a lot better at it than me.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.280
So levels, like in Candy Crush,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.300
are great ways to keep players coming
back, wanting to go further in the game.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.340
But they aren't the only way.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.410
Let's look at what
makes a game engaging.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.240
In this lesson, we'll talk about how
to get the right level of difficulty in

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.560
your game, adding competition in
your games, making your game easy to

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.350
access and play across multiple devices,
and also turning your players into fans.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.810
These are the four components that
we've seen all engaging games include.
