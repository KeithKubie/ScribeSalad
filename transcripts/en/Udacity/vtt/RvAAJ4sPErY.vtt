00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.230
Okay, so at this point we have
designed the experiments and now what?

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.039
And now it actually becomes easy.

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:10.510
Now that you have the experiments, you
need to run the test cases a number of

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.200
times using the [INAUDIBLE] ranges
of the experimental factors.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.060
Compute the metrics,
the averages over of those n times and

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.020
then represent the results.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.820
When it comes to representing
the results, I'm not going to go

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.330
into further discussion in terms of
best practices and how to do that.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.410
But just keep in mind that the visual
representation can really help

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.010
strengthen your arguments.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.300
And there are a lot of papers that will
be discussed during this course that use

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.840
different techniques on
how to represent results.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.300
So you can draw some ideas from there.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.618
Or there are other
documentations online,

00:00:46.618 --> 00:00:49.564
there are also courses that
are taught at Georgia Tech or

00:00:49.564 --> 00:00:53.779
also in the Audacity's platform that
talk about information visualization.

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:56.729
So you can benefit from such
content in terms of how

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:59.555
to really visualize your results.

00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:02.205
And make sure that you don't
just show the results.

00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:06.965
Actually make a conclusion, spell out
what is it that these experimental

00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:10.975
results support as far as
your claims are concerned.
