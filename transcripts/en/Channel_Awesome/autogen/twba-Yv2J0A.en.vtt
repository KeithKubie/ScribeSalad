00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 align:start position:0%
and they do but see that other giant
 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.909 align:start position:0%
and they do but see that other giant
ship<00:03:27.040><c> come</c><00:03:27.310><c> behind</c><00:03:27.609><c> it</c><00:03:27.849><c> so</c><00:03:27.970><c> not</c><00:03:28.150><c> only</c><00:03:28.269><c> did</c><00:03:28.480><c> they</c>

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 align:start position:0%
ship come behind it so not only did they
 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
ship come behind it so not only did they
master<00:03:29.919><c> this</c><00:03:30.129><c> technology</c><00:03:30.790><c> but</c><00:03:31.000><c> they</c><00:03:31.150><c> pushed</c>

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:31.449 align:start position:0%
master this technology but they pushed
 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
master this technology but they pushed
it<00:03:31.599><c> even</c><00:03:31.720><c> further</c><00:03:32.139><c> I</c><00:03:32.349><c> was</c><00:03:32.709><c> so</c><00:03:33.250><c> great</c><00:03:33.549><c> and</c><00:03:33.760><c> it</c>

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 align:start position:0%
it even further I was so great and it
 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.909 align:start position:0%
it even further I was so great and it
makes<00:03:34.060><c> sense</c><00:03:34.299><c> because</c><00:03:34.540><c> it's</c><00:03:35.019><c> it's</c><00:03:35.530><c> the</c><00:03:35.709><c> Fire</c>

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 align:start position:0%
makes sense because it's it's the Fire
 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.030 align:start position:0%
makes sense because it's it's the Fire
Nation<00:03:35.949><c> they</c><00:03:36.579><c> have</c><00:03:37.199><c> they</c><00:03:38.199><c> have</c><00:03:38.470><c> more</c><00:03:38.680><c> people</c>

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
Nation they have they have more people
 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
Nation they have they have more people
they<00:03:39.159><c> have</c><00:03:39.310><c> more</c><00:03:39.459><c> time</c><00:03:39.669><c> they</c><00:03:39.940><c> have</c><00:03:39.970><c> the</c><00:03:40.209><c> Empire</c>

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 align:start position:0%
they have more time they have the Empire
 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.890 align:start position:0%
they have more time they have the Empire
so<00:03:41.049><c> it</c><00:03:41.199><c> makes</c><00:03:41.379><c> sense</c><00:03:41.470><c> uh</c><00:03:42.449><c> so</c><00:03:43.449><c> the</c><00:03:43.599><c> battle</c>

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 align:start position:0%
so it makes sense uh so the battle
 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
so it makes sense uh so the battle
itself<00:03:44.169><c> was</c><00:03:44.440><c> fun</c><00:03:44.709><c> I</c><00:03:44.979><c> liked</c><00:03:45.459><c> Sokka</c><00:03:46.120><c> sort</c><00:03:46.720><c> of</c>
