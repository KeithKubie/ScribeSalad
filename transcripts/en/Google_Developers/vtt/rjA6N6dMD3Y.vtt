TIM ANDERSON: Hi, welcome
to Tech Trips From Teachers.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.380
In this episode, we'll
focus on elementary literacy

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.690
and we're joined by Alanna
Mednick from Berkeley,

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.910
California.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.570
Alanna has experience teaching
across all elementary school

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.910
grades and is also
co-authoring a book

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.730
on social emotional
development for students.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.902
So Alanna, tell us why
technology's important

00:00:18.902 --> 00:00:20.360
in the classroom
and, specifically,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.692
with elementary literacy.

00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:23.400
ALANNA MEDNICK:
Technology is everywhere.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.730
Our students need to
be adept at using it.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.430
With 30 students
in the classroom,

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.020
it's really difficult to meet
all their individual needs.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.710
This technology
facilitates that process.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.980
And with elementary
literacy, specifically, it's

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.920
a very complicated process.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.134
Technology allows us to meet
these emerging readers needs.

00:00:41.134 --> 00:00:42.800
TIM ANDERSON: And
speaking with a number

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.360
of different educators, we found
a few key themes that emerged.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.180
For elementary
literacy apps, it's

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.540
important that they support
language development,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.407
have differentiated content, and
engage all types of learners.

00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:55.240
ALANNA MEDNICK: Language
development support

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.340
is essential.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.410
Differentiated content
is very important

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.340
because it helps us meet each
student's individual need.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.430
I'm also able to maximize
my own instructional time

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.430
by making sure that my
students are interacting

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.040
with something very useful.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.060
Great apps engage all learners.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.040
In my classroom, I have visual,
auditory, and kinesthetic

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.820
learners.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.540
Ideally, students should
be able to see, hear,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.095
and interact with the content.

00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:19.470
TIM ANDERSON: Time
to take a look

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.900
at some apps that integrate
these elements really well.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.030
ALANNA MEDNICK: The first
app we're looking at

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.670
is Endless Reader,
a great example

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.210
of language development.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.320
The students are both able
to interact with the phonics,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.780
the shape of the letters,
and the phonemic awareness,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.290
the sound of the letters.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.090
The program also builds
from letter and sound

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.690
to words to sentence building,
so it covers a large span

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.310
of student ability.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.360
Raz-Kids is an excellent example
of differentiated content.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.010
This app has 27 levels of
difficulty allowing students

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.180
to receive content that matches
their individual ability.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.570
It's also very easy
for teachers to use.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.180
All student content
and passwords

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.810
can be managed from
a single dashboard.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.880
Booksy is an excellent
example of an app that

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.000
engages all types of learners.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.200
Visual learners see
the words and pictures.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.539
Auditory learners are
engaged because content

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.750
can be read aloud.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.100
And student users can be
recorded while they're reading.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.600
This also appeals to
the kinesthetic learners

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.084
who are naturally
interacting with the device.

00:02:19.084 --> 00:02:21.000
TIM ANDERSON: So for
elementary literacy apps,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.350
the key tips are developing
apps that support language

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.770
development, that have
differentiated content

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.060
and that engage all
types of learners.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.190

00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:35.530
So we'd like to think Alanna
Mednick for joining us

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.544
for today's episode.

00:02:36.544 --> 00:02:37.960
ALANNA MEDNICK:
I'm excited to see

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.980
more apps being developed to
better meet my students' needs.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.521
TIM ANDERSON: We'll
see you next time
