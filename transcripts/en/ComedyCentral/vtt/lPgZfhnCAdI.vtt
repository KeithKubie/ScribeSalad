00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:04.371
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW"!

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:06.540
MY NAME IS JON STEWART! GOOD
SHOW!

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:12.045
MY GUEST TONIGHT, AUTHOR JENNY
NORDBERG, SHE IS THE AUTHOR OF A

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:13.347
BOOK CALLED "THE UNDERGROUND
GIRLS OF KABUL."

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.049
SHE WILL BE JOINING US A LITTLE
BIT LATER.

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:21.154
BUT FIRST, NEW YORK CITY HOSTED
THE BIGGEST CLIMATE CHANGE MARCH

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:27.160
IN HISTORY YESTERDAY
FEATURING THE BIGGEST HAT

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:29.496
AND THE BIGGEST SIGN AND
THE BIGGEST KINDEST

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.432
PUPPET LIBRARIAN AND THE
BIGGEST PAIN IN THE ASS

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:36.470
TO GET ACROSS THE STREET
JUST TO GET TO CHIPOTLE.

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:39.439
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE BOLD FACED NAMES.

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:44.745
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE,
MAYOR BILL DeBLASIO, AND U.N.

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:45.312
SECRETARY GENERAL BAN KI-MOON.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.346
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHOA! WHOA!

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.916
STOP THE PARADE!

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.318
BAN KI-MOON?

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.021
THE BIGGEST CLIMATE CHANGE IN
HISTORY.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:59.960
WHAT DID YOU COME STRAIGHT FROM
YOUR AUDITION FROM

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:00.928
"YOU'RE A GOOD MAN,
CHARLIE BROWN"?

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.996
LOOK AT YOU! YOU'RE WEARING YOUR
CAMP CLOTHES?

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.031
YOU'RE BAN KI-MOON! YOU'RE THE
HEAD OF THE U.N.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:08.001
BY THE WAY, WHAT A GET FOR

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:09.736
U.N. RADIO.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.639
U.N. RADIO GETTING BAN KI-MOON.

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:14.942
NO, NO, I CAN'T TALK TO YOU.

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:15.809
OH! HELLO.

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:18.278
(LAUGHTER)
OF COURSE, POLITICIAN WEREN'T

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:19.680
THE ONLY BIG SHOTS ON HAND.
THERE WERE A-LIST MOVIE

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:24.017
STARS LIKE MARK
RUFFALO AND EDWARD NORTON, BOTH

00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:28.222
HAVE BECOME ACUTELY AWARE OF
ENVIRONMENTAL DANGERS SINCE

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:32.492
THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH GAMMA
RADIATION. THEY REALLY HAD...

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:40.334
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:45.105
&gt;&gt; Jon: WITH THAT SIZE IN STAR
POWER, YOU KNOW CABLE NEWS GAVE

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:48.642
IT EVERYTHING THEY HAVE.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:55.048
&gt;&gt; ALISON KOSIK IS IN NEW
YORK. DESCRIBE THE SCENE FOR US

00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:55.849
EARLIER.
&gt;&gt; EARLIER?

00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:57.317
IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING AS WE
SPEAK.

00:01:57.351 --> 00:02:03.690
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Jon: PERHAPS IT'S HAPPENING

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:04.958
RIGHT NOW.

00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:09.196
PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL BY THE FACT
THAT NOBODY CAN SEE ME IN MY OWN

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.596
NEWS REPORT.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.232
COME ON, CNN!

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:15.068
THIS IS CROWD FOOTAGE 101!

00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:19.706
YOU PUT THE REPORTER IN FRONT OF
THE CROWD!

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.241
MSNBC, SHOW THEM HOW IT'S DONE.

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:24.545
&gt;&gt; LET'S HEAD THERE NOW. WE HAVE
NED RESNIKOFF WHO'S STAND BY --

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:26.413
&gt;&gt; Jon: [BLEEP]! OH, JESUS!

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:27.614
NOT THAT FAR!

00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:28.715
COME ON!

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:32.386
(LAUGHTER)
KILL THE FEED!

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:36.890
GOT A GIANT METEOR APPROACHING
THE PARADE!

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:38.025
AHHH!
(LAUGHTER)

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:42.796
WITH YESTERDAY'S SOUP IN HIS
STASH!

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.566
(LAUGHTER)

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.701
ALL RIGHT, NOW YOU MAY BE
THINKING, DO WE REALLY NEED A

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:52.372
MARCH TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT
GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE?

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:55.275
I MEAN, IT'S AN ACCEPTED
SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENON PRETTY

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:56.276
MUCH EVERYWHERE.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.378
HERE'S WHY YOU NEED THE MARCH.

00:02:58.412 --> 00:03:02.049
IT'S ACCEPTED PRETTY MUCH
EVERYWHERE BUT THIS ONE PLACE

00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:05.152
CALLED THE UNITED STATES HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES COMMITTEE ON

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.455
SCIENCE, SPACE AND TECHNOLOGY.

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.357
THIS IS TRUE.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.161
LAST WEEK THEY HELD A HEARING
THAT THEY APPARENTLY RECORDED IN

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.395
1971 --
(LAUGHTER)

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:19.299
I GUESS THAT'S THE TECHNOLOGY
PART OF THE COMMITTEE NAME -- ON

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:23.637
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN TO SHRINK
CARBON EMISSIONS 30% BY 2030.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.276
THE HEARINGS' SISYPHUS,
PRESIDENTIAL SCIENCE ADVISOR

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:33.547
JOHN HOLDREN, CHARGED
WITH THE IMPOSSIBLE TASK OF

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.349
PUSHING 1 MILLION POUNDS
OF IDIOT UP A MOUNTAIN.

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.651
OF COURSE, LIKE ANY AVALANCHE,
IT DID BEGAN RATHER INNOCUOUSLY.

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:38.919
TEXAS REPUBLICAN STEVE STOCKMAN.

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:42.956
&gt;&gt; THE LEAD SCIENTIST AT NASA
SAID THIS, HE SAID WHAT ENDED

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.057
THE ICE AGE WAS GLOBAL WOBBLING.

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:48.762
IS THE WOBBLING OF THE EARTH
INCLUDED IN ANY OF YOUR

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:49.296
MODELINGS?

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.464
AND THE ANSWER WAS NO.

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:52.766
WHEN YOU HAVE A MODEL AND YOU
SAY WE'LL LEAVE OUT THE MOST

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.670
IMPORTANT IMPACT OF THAT MODEL
OUT OF OUR THEORY AND NOT TALK

00:03:56.703 --> 00:04:00.107
ABOUT GLOBAL WOBBLING, HOW CAN
YOU MAKE PROJECTIONS?

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:12.553
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT'S UP, SCIENTISTS?

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.154
GLOBAL WOBBLING, BITCHES!

00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:19.026
(LAUGHTER)
HE SEES YOUR SO-CALLED GLOBAL

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:20.928
WARMING AND RAISES YOU A
GLOBAL WOBBLING.

00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:23.163
EXPLAIN THAT DR. WHITE HOUSE.

00:04:23.197 --> 00:04:27.034
&gt;&gt; GLOBAL WOBBLING WHICH REFERS
TO CHANGES IN THE EARTH'S

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:33.807
TILT AND ORBIT TAKES PLACE ON
CHARACTERISTIC TIME SCALES OF

00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:35.275
22,000 YEARS, 44,000 YEARS AND
100,000 YEARS. IT IS VERY SLOW.

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:40.147
GLOBAL WOBBLES IS A TINY EFFECT
OF THE TIME SCALE OF 100 YEARS

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.483
IN WHICH WE TRY TO RUN THESE
MODELS.

00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:47.154
&gt;&gt; Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW WE WOULD
BE TALKING TO AN ACTUAL

00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:48.055
SCIENTIST...

00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:52.659
(WHISPERING)
ALL RIGHT, HOLDREN, YOU ACED

00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:54.628
THE WOBBLE WARMING.

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:56.163
RIDDLE ME THIS:

00:04:56.196 --> 00:05:03.203
&gt;&gt; AT WHAT POINT A LEVEL OF CO2
DOES CO2 BECOME DAMAGING?

00:05:03.237 --> 00:05:07.875
AT WHAT LEVEL DOES IT BECOME
HARMFUL TO HUMAN BEINGS?

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:09.776
&gt;&gt; Jon: BOOM! HOW CAN CO2 BE
DANGEROUS WHEN I CAN STILL

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.812
BREATHE?

00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:18.418
&gt;&gt; VICE CHAIRMAN ROHRABACHER, I
ALWAYS ENJOY MY INTERACTIONS

00:05:18.452 --> 00:05:19.553
WITH YOU.

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:23.590
&gt;&gt; Jon: MUCH THE WAY ONE
ENJOYS PLAYING PEEK A BOO WITH A

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:24.691
BABY.
(LAUGHTER)

00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:27.995
&gt;&gt; Jon: OR PERHAPS TEASING A
CAT WITH A LASER POINTER!

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:31.098
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO SAY WITH RESPECT

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:32.332
THAT'S A RED HERRING.

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:34.701
WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN CARBON
DIOXIDE CONCENTRATIONS BECAUSE

00:05:34.735 --> 00:05:38.005
OF THEIR DIRECT EFFECT ON HUMAN
HEALTH, WE'RE INTERESTED IN THEM

00:05:38.038 --> 00:05:41.808
BECAUSE OF THEIR EFFECT ON THE
WORLD'S CLIMATE AND CLIMATE

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:44.278
CHANGE HAS DISASTEROUS EFFECTS
ON HEALTH.

00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:47.581
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY CAN WE STILL
BREATHE?

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:49.216
THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING! I MEAN,
YOU CAN HEAR ME RIGHT?

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:50.417
I'M BREATHING!

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.021
AND IT GOT MORE AMAZING AS IT
WENT.

00:05:54.054 --> 00:05:55.422
INDIANA'S LARRY BUSCHON.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:59.426
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ABOUT AFFECTING THE
GLOBAL TEMPERATURE AND CLIMATE

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:00.627
CHANGE.

00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:01.662
&gt;&gt; THERE IS PUBLIC COMMENTS OUT
THERE THAT QUESTION HAS BEEN

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.431
ASKED AND ANSWERED SAYING NO.

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:07.100
&gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THE
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE RATHER

00:06:07.134 --> 00:06:12.105
THAN THE PUBLIC COMMENTS.

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:19.813
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)

00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:27.788
&gt;&gt; Jon: WITH ALL DUE
RESPECT, REPRESENTATIVE

00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:29.857
BUSCHON, I SUGGEST YOU GET THE
JOURNAL OF APPLIED

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.794
METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY AS

00:06:33.827 --> 00:06:35.863
OPPOSED TO THE YOU TUBE
COMMENT FEED OF OBUMMERLIES1776.

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:38.432
BUT HERE'S WHERE BUSCHON FINALLY
GIVES AWAY THE GAME.

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:42.603
&gt;&gt; OF ALL THE CLIMATOLOGISTS
WHOSE CAREER DEPENDS ON THE

00:06:42.636 --> 00:06:47.875
CLIMATE CHANGING TO KEEP
THEMSELVES PUBLISHING ARTICLES,

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:49.343
YES, I COULD READ THAT BUT I
DO NOT BELIEVE IT.

00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:54.681
&gt;&gt; Jon: I DO NOT BELIEVE THE
SCIENTISTS BECAUSE IT IS THEIR

00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:56.917
PROFESSION NOT THEIR HOBBY.
(LAUGHTER)

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.888
WELL SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE INFLUENCE MONEY MIGHT HAVE

00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:06.159
ON CLIMATE CHANGE OPINION,
IT TURNS OUT REPRESENTATIVE

00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:10.898
BUSCHON'S THREE BIGGEST CAMPAIGN
DONORS ARE MURRAY ENERGY,

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:15.903
KOCH ENTERPRISES, AND PEABODY
ENERGY. AND TRUST ME.

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:18.405
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
TRUST ME, THOSE THREE WELL

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:22.910
FUNDED COMPANIES WOULD
LOVE TO DISPROVE CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:25.045
TO THE SATISFACTION OF
THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AT

00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:27.247
LARGE. SO IF SCIENTISTS COULD BE
BOUGHT THESE MOTHER [BLEEP]

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:29.249
WOULD HAVE ALREADY MADE IT RAIN
IN NERD TOWN. TRUST ME.

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:30.717
AND AGAIN, I CAN'T STRESS THIS
ENOUGH.

00:07:30.751 --> 00:07:33.453
THIS IS THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES COMMITTEE ON

00:07:33.487 --> 00:07:38.091
SCIENCE, SPACE AND TECHNOLOGY.

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:43.030
&gt;&gt; HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR THE
SEA LEVEL TO RISE TWO FEET?

00:07:43.063 --> 00:07:48.769
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT, IF YOUR
ICE CUBE MELTS IN YOUR GLASS, IT

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:49.870
DOESN'T OVERFLOW,
IT'S DISPLACEMENT. I MEAN,

00:07:49.903 --> 00:07:51.438
THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:52.239
MATHEMATICALLY AND
SCIENTIFICALLY DON'T MAKE SENSE.

00:07:52.272 --> 00:07:53.540
&gt;&gt; Jon: ARE YOU [BLEEP] KIDDING
ME?

00:07:53.574 --> 00:07:56.343
ARE YOU [BLEEP] KIDDING ME?

00:07:56.376 --> 00:08:02.249
I DON'T EVEN KNOW --
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:08:02.282 --> 00:08:04.084
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO
WITH THAT!

00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:07.221
HOW FAR BACK TO THE ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL CORE CURRICULUM DO WE

00:08:07.254 --> 00:08:12.125
HAVE TO GO TO GET SOMEONE ON THE
HOUSE COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE,

00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:15.028
SPACE AND TECHNOLOGY CAUGHT UP?

00:08:15.062 --> 00:08:18.765
DO WE HAVE TO BRING OUT THE
PAPIER MACHE AND BAKING SODA SO

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:22.102
YOU CAN MAKE A (BLEEP) VOLCANO?
IS THAT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO?

00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:25.205
IS THAT HOW BASIC THE SCIENCE
CLASS WAS WHEN YOU WENT?

00:08:25.239 --> 00:08:27.908
NAH, I DON'T NEED TO KNOW
THIS ANYMORE. FOR GOD'S SAKES!

00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:29.543
LOOK, HERE -- HERE, LOOK.

00:08:29.576 --> 00:08:31.712
HERE'S A GLASS OF ICE WATER.

00:08:31.745 --> 00:08:34.715
HEY, THAT ICE ISN'T MAKING THE
WATER OVERFLOW BECAUSE IT'S

00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:36.817
ALREADY IN THE WATER!

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:41.121
BUT IMAGINE THERE'S A WHOLE
BUNCH OF OTHER ICE THAT'S NOT IN

00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:44.224
THE WATER, IT'S ON THE LAND --
YOU KNOW, THE PART WHERE THE

00:08:44.258 --> 00:08:45.726
WATER ISN'T!

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:51.431
AND THEN WHEN TEMPERATURES RISE
AND THE LAND ICE MELTS ENOUGH,

00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:52.432
TO FALL IN, OH, (BLEEP)!

00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:53.834
IT'S EVERYWHERE!

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:54.835
IT'S EVERYWHERE!

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:59.773
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:10.984
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:09:11.018 --> 00:09:15.923
GLOBAL WARMING, GIANT TOWELS.

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:19.793
(LAUGHTER)
ULTIMATELY, THE WHOLE INCREDIBLE

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:23.030
AND BY ALL AAPPEARANCES WILLFUL
MISUNDERSTANDING OF HOW

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:26.500
THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD HAS BEEN
APPLIED TO CLIMATE CHANGE MODELS

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:34.308
AND WHAT THE EFFECTS OF
WARMING CAN BE, PARDON THE

00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:35.576
PUN, BOILED DOWN
TO THIS EXCHANGE.

00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:39.713
&gt;&gt; THAT SCARE TACTICS LIKE THAT,
YOU KNOW, IS REALLY APPALLING TO

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:47.020
ME TO USE MEDICAL INFORMATION TO
SCARE PARENTS THAT THEIR

00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:49.890
CHILDREN ABOUT ASTHMA ATTACKS
AND SCARE PEOPLE SAYING THAT

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.158
THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE
HEART ATTACKS.

00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:55.796
I ARGUE THAT WE SHOULD ALL ON
BOTH SIDES OF THIS DISCUSSION

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:56.864
AVOID SCARE TACTICS.

00:09:56.897 --> 00:09:59.199
&gt;&gt; Jon: FIRST OF ALL, THERE
AREN'T BOTH SIDES TO THE

00:09:59.233 --> 00:10:00.167
DISCUSSION. WHAT HE'S
BASICALLY SAYING IS

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.503
IT'S UNFAIR TO TALK TO US
ABOUT THE SCIENTIFIC

00:10:02.536 --> 00:10:05.205
AND MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES OF OUR
ACTIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARY

00:10:05.239 --> 00:10:08.575
AND WE REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE
DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT ANYWAY

00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:11.411
SO FROM NOW ON WHY NOT AGREE
THAT SCIENCE AND THE OIL

00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:12.613
INDUSTRY BOTH HAVE OPINIONS.

00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:16.416
OH, AND BEFORE YOU TELL YOUR
KIDS TO WASH THEIR HANDS AFTER

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.920
THEY TAKE A (BLEEP) SO THEY
DON'T SPREAD DISEASE, MAYBE WE

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:24.024
SHOULD SPEND AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF
TIME HEARING FROM BIG FECAL.

00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:25.058
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
