[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.000
AMIR SHEVAT: The vision is to
take two people, two types of

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.970
people, who like to
create things--

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.030
developers and artists-- and
create amazing projects over

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.280
Google technology.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.280
YIFAT GURION: Where technology
and art meets,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.460
exciting things happen.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.250
And the partnership with
Google puts us

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.980
exactly at that spot.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.300
TZVIKA MARKFELD: Developers
can learn something new.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.320
And the artists can gain a new
experience of technology.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.020
AMIR SHEVAT: So we have
seven projects.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.220
They're really nice.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.900
The feedback up until now
has been amazing.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.040
SARON PAZ: The Action Painter is
an Android app that turns a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.290
smartphone into a color brush,
which actually acts as a

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.570
creative extension
of your body.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.330
TOMER DANIEL: We used the
Android application, which

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.370
samples accelerometer and
orientation devices.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.000
And on the Chrome side, we're
actually doing the painting,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.470
the four brushes that
we're painting with.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.810
The Action Painter is a
social application.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.860
And you can share your creation

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.521
with G+, with Google+.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.590
OMER GOLAN: Plant a Comment is
a multidimensional virtual

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.130
world in which thoughts
grow into trees.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.300
We asked people to send us a
text message saying anything

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.680
they liked about the event.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.663
YUVAL ADAM: And once we receive
a sentence of one of

00:01:18.663 --> 00:01:20.370
their thoughts, we would take
that and analyze it

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.140
semantically so that we are able
to group trees that talk

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.780
about the same subjects
together.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.540
We use the input via text
messages or from Google+.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.700
And then we analyze them using
Google prediction?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.010
API and Google Translation APIs
and take all that and put

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.090
it on a 3D world, which
is rendered in WebGL.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.160
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: Dissolving
Localities is basically a web

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.300
interface, which allows the user
or the public to take a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.960
tour of Jerusalem on Street View
with audio recordings of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.550
the places on Street View.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.520
And it's basically an artistic
tour of Jerusalem.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.430
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: It uses HTML5
features like cameras,

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.570
audio, and video tags.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.884
It also uses Google Street
View and Google Maps API.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.630
URI SHAKED: SoundTracker is a
way of making music by simply

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.640
walking around in a room.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.750
TOM MEMAN: The more technical
breakdown is that Android

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.070
cameras film the people
inside the room.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.750
Using that location, we
translate it into music.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.100
Each instrument gets a different
translation.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.650
AMIR SHEVAT: The Digital Art
Project aims to inspire

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.460
developers that they can do
amazing applications over our

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.710
technology.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.920
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: I think it's
a once in a lifetime

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.900
experience, being in
an art environment

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.480
with artistic people.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.900
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: I'm sort
of way out there.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.370
And I need someone both
to sort of clarify

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.000
the idea that I--

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.870
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: Someone
down to earth.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.540
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: No, clarify
the ideas that I have and also

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.330
be able to--

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.740
MICHAEL SVERDLIN:
More practical.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.240
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM:
Yeah, thanks.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.085
TOM MEMAN: I can't imagine doing
something like that if

00:02:54.085 --> 00:02:56.230
it weren't for the collaboration
between Google

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.090
and Fresh Paint.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.200
SARON PAZ: Suddenly I can get
a crazy idea, and these guys

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.640
will actually help me make it.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.650
IDO GREEN: Hello, and welcome
to GDL again.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.672
It's a special episode
on Devart.

00:03:18.672 --> 00:03:24.436
We have a few of the main
dudes that created a

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:27.610
wonderful, amazing project
over there.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.875
So let's let them maybe
introduce yourself.

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:30.990
URI SHAKED: All right.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.970
So I am Uri Shaked.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.218
I work for WatchDox and also
as lead of the local Google

00:03:40.218 --> 00:03:42.613
Developer Group here
in Tel Aviv.

00:03:42.613 --> 00:03:47.403
I'm also creating the Android
and the iOS applications in my

00:03:47.403 --> 00:03:53.080
free time, dancing salsa,
teaching salsa to people, and

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.015
overall, having a lot of fun.

00:03:56.015 --> 00:03:57.500
EMMANUEL WITZHUM: Fair enough.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.985
My name is Emmanuel Witzthum.

00:03:58.985 --> 00:04:02.450
And I'm an artist, a curator,
and project manager.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.363
And yep, that's it.

00:04:05.363 --> 00:04:07.327
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: My name
is Michael Sverdlin.

00:04:07.327 --> 00:04:09.291
I'm a developer, entrepreneur.

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:13.710
And I do the [INAUDIBLE]
work with Uri.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.450
And I do fun things in my
free time, like the

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.680
Fresh Paint 5 project.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.920
IDO GREEN: And talking
about the project.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.752
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: Yeah.

00:04:21.752 --> 00:04:26.410
More projects like submarines.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.660
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.740
IDO GREEN: So again watch it
if I missed it by mistake.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.080
So let's just jump into the
order, and maybe the best

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.890
would be to start with
what is Devart?

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.366
What's it all about?

00:04:39.366 --> 00:04:40.350
URI SHAKED: All right.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.813
So Devart is mainly about
connecting the developers and

00:04:45.813 --> 00:04:50.960
artists in order to create
some art with combining

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.690
technology, or better to say
make art by technology.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.440
So the artists are able to
express themselves in new

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.442
ways, rather than the
traditional canvas and paint

00:05:05.442 --> 00:05:11.400
or the traditional digital.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:19.680
So the idea behind Devart is to
take artists who have ideas

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.180
of new ways to use technology in
order to deliver their art

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.064
and connect them with developers
who take part in

00:05:30.064 --> 00:05:31.750
this project.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.540
And they actually work together

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.200
to create the projects.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.325
IDO GREEN: So maybe if you could
just share with us what

00:05:41.325 --> 00:05:45.745
was the last Devart like and
why people should come

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:47.690
for the next one.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.870
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: I think that
we live in a time where

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.380
people want to participate.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.300
They want to be active in
what they experience.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.520
And I think that Devart
provides a wonderful

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.380
opportunity for problem solvers
and problem creators--

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.590
so problem creators as artists,
problem solvers as

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.580
developers--

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.240
to sort of create projects
in which people

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.610
don't come as a public.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.360
They don't come to experience
something.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.230
They come to use something.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.960
And for me as an artist,
Devart was a phenomenal

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.580
experience exactly
because of this.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.910
As an artist, somehow you
sometimes feel that you're in

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:19.840
one corner.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.325
The public is another.

00:06:21.325 --> 00:06:23.640
And we need someone
to say, OK, gong,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.090
this the first round.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.200
And in this sense for
me, the developers

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.100
were that first round.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.620
Devart was this sort of ring,
where we could say, OK, we're

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.430
not in two corners.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.040
We can actually be
the same place.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.385
So I think that for me, Devart
was great because I could

00:06:35.385 --> 00:06:38.510
think of an idea, talk with
Michael about it.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.500
And then we develop something
together, thinking constantly

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.870
about the user.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.080
Not thinking about the public,
not thinking about someone's

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.080
going to clap at the end, but
instead, how are they going to

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.840
interact with this?

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.230
How are they going to use it?

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.540
How are they going to
experience what we

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.295
want to say with them?

00:06:51.295 --> 00:06:53.650
And then bring it back to us so
we can say, wait a second.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.530
We could do this differently
the next time.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.026
And so it's an ongoing process
as an artistic project

00:06:58.026 --> 00:06:59.650
together with the developers.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.390
IDO GREEN: I think it was very
fun to see how we're basically

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.490
closing the chasm between the
two worlds and creating some

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.140
pretty cool, inventive things.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.040
I think that one aspect for me
as a developer was to see the

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.240
problem develop in an open
source project that just comes

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.580
flourishing after
what is well.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.950
So there's one of the aspects
that is extremely compelling,

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.840
that you're starting something
with the idea, a

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.270
problem or a challenge.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.325
And then it's moving on and on
and actually taking a life of

00:07:27.325 --> 00:07:31.160
its own, which is
very, very nice.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.340
Maybe you could tell us a bit
about the specific project or

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.840
problem that you solved.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.280
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: Sure.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.600
Do you want to be it?

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.480
URI SHAKED: You go first.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:38.890
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: OK.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.630
So two years ago, I created an
artist project in which I

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.080
tried to use the daily life of
Jerusalem as a source for art.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.790
So just take people talking,
cars driving by, birds

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.610
chirping, and say, how can we
create art out of that?

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.590
The main reason for that was
because I wanted people to

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.230
experience life in Israel
in a more complex way.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.682
And also because I wanted to
have artists interact with

00:07:59.682 --> 00:08:01.310
life in Israel and also
artists interact

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.670
with life in general.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.290
And so until now, we've created
live projects and done

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.190
installations, et cetera.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.295
And then when the idea of
connecting this with Devart

00:08:09.295 --> 00:08:12.030
came about, it became an
incredible experience of

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.180
thinking how to use
Google Street View

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.030
as an artistic tool.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.330
Not necessarily to
say, oh, look.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.220
That's [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.790
or that's the Old City.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.120
But I say, how can I interact
with these places?

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.370
How can I create an artistic
tool of Jerusalem though

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.470
Google Street View?

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.490
And one of them-- the connection
was made with

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.150
[INAUDIBLE] and Michael
Sverdlin.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.679
And both of them really sort
of helped me figure out

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.969
exactly what I wanted to
do because sometimes--

00:08:36.969 --> 00:08:37.980
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: And
what's possible.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.950
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: That's
very true, very true.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.169
Sometimes I can think
very, very high.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:43.120
Michael's like, great.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:43.390
OK.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.904
Let's just talk about that.

00:08:44.904 --> 00:08:45.792
Let's bring us back here.

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:47.570
IDO GREEN: Excellent, yeah.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.440
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: And it was
a really great distinction

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.570
because things had
to be concrete

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.720
in order to be realized.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.340
And to me, that was a very
interesting platform to be in

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.750
because it can open
up the project in

00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:59.850
many different ways.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.020
And the end result was very,
very interesting to see.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.896
IDO GREEN: So I'll try just
to summarize to see that I

00:09:05.896 --> 00:09:08.890
understood and hopefully people
will understand it.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:14.510
You combined 3D audio around
Google Maps, Google Street

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.120
View, to give the users an
impression of what's going on

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.490
in a city or an area or place.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.930
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: We
constructed artistic tours of

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.800
Jerusalem with sound of the
images that they saw on Google

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.100
Street, and then we created
videos out of

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.880
these specific tours.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.600
And the audience could come,
and they could either

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.990
experience one tour, or they
could combine between

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.160
different tours together.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.640
So different places in
Jerusalem, it had overlaid on

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.600
top of each other.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.750
And then we created
musical loops that

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.710
accompanied the story.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.250
And then you almost could
actually also engage by

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.920
changing the color,
having an effect.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.050
It was like-- think
of an Instagram in

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.880
video sort of situation.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.180
And they basically could see
life in Jerusalem from a sort

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.060
of unique perspective.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.950
And that's what we
tried to do.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.500
IDO GREEN: Excellent.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.580
What were the main aspects
in terms of design?

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.503
I mean, what did you two take
in account when you started

00:10:05.503 --> 00:10:08.890
those building blocks and
combining them together?

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.640
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: I'll talk
from my perspective.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.086
It was very important for me
that the audience understand

00:10:14.086 --> 00:10:14.860
the audience.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.010
The people who come to
experience the project would

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.990
sort of understand immediately
what they were supposed to do.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.362
So it was very important for me
that they understood that

00:10:22.362 --> 00:10:23.690
they could interact with the
project, not only just come

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.890
and look at it and say,
OK, it's not moving.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.750
You have to press in order
for it to start moving.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.210
Because in Fresh Paint, people
who come to see artistic

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.300
projects usually think of
themselves as passive.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:34.920
They come.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.600
They look.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:35.940
Then they move.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:36.150
They look.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.390
They move.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.400
They look.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.830
And Devart was great because
you see people--

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.430
in your project, they
were moving around.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.180
In my project, the had to use
the mouse and sort of work

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.400
with what materials they
had, et cetera.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.360
So people came a little bit
more ready to be active in

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:50.810
what they saw.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.190
And for me, in terms of the
user experience and user

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.940
interface, it was very important
that I could provide

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.667
a doorway for them to
come inside there

00:10:57.667 --> 00:10:59.640
and experience that.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:10:59.830
IDO GREEN: Excellent.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.770
And then from your perspective,
the user

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.560
experience needed to be as
simple as possible or

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.832
self-intuitive?

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:10.710
How did you act it in terms of
someone would explain to them

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.150
that they needed to click?

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.970
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: We had
a person that helped.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:18.070
Our hostess was unbelievably--

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:18.830
she was great.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.310
We'd have her explain
the project.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:24.140
It was very important for me to
try and be as intuitive as

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:24.990
possible, so people come.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.250
They look.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.990
And they say, OK, this
is the effect line.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.310
I'm supposed to press Play
so that it will start.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.350
So it was also trying to be as
clear as possible, but also

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.614
trying to be as inviting
as possible.

00:11:34.614 --> 00:11:36.994
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: Actually, one
of the most interesting

00:11:36.994 --> 00:11:39.725
decisions that we came
to, I think, the

00:11:39.725 --> 00:11:41.206
day before the event.

00:11:41.206 --> 00:11:44.608
Our original plan was to put a
laptop in front of the people,

00:11:44.608 --> 00:11:45.580
the visitors.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:50.060
But we decided to only put a
mouse there so that people

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.270
will be very constrained
in what they do.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.670
And actually, people still
can't wait to escape our

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.180
sandbox of [INAUDIBLE], but--

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.599
and start playing.

00:12:03.599 --> 00:12:06.440
So we understand that
it was really

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.905
easier with only a mouse.

00:12:07.905 --> 00:12:11.437
People knew exactly what
they needed to do.

00:12:11.437 --> 00:12:12.820
IDO GREEN: Thanks.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.486
And so we talked about
the artistic aspects.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:19.414
Maybe we can talk a bit more
about the technical aspects or

00:12:19.414 --> 00:12:21.400
what were the main challenges.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.552
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: Well, the main
challenge in our piece of

00:12:24.552 --> 00:12:28.666
work is we are pushing two video
streams, which is pretty

00:12:28.666 --> 00:12:33.510
hard even on mobile CPUs,
a browser, of course.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:37.755
And even more, we're doing
pair frame effects, like

00:12:37.755 --> 00:12:39.599
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:39.599 --> 00:12:42.420
and inverting colors.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:49.386
And doing everything in about
33 milliseconds was hard on

00:12:49.386 --> 00:12:51.302
some of the computers
we tried it in.

00:12:51.302 --> 00:12:55.134
The kind of computer that was
provided for us was only an 83

00:12:55.134 --> 00:12:58.280
CPU, and it kind of lagged.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.742
It wasn't a smooth 30
frames per second.

00:13:01.742 --> 00:13:05.890
It was more like 15, 20
frames per second.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:10.160
And as you pile on the effect,
it gets worse and worse.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.990
So that was a real challenge.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:18.830
And some other challenges were
syncing the audio and video,

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.688
which was very important
for Emmanuel for the--

00:13:21.688 --> 00:13:22.632
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: For
the experience.

00:13:22.632 --> 00:13:23.576
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: --for
the experience.

00:13:23.576 --> 00:13:25.560
And it's totally
understandable.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.452
But we couldn't actually have
it screen from the network

00:13:30.452 --> 00:13:33.136
because then everything will
download at different times.

00:13:33.136 --> 00:13:36.756
It's about five audio streams
and two video streams.

00:13:36.756 --> 00:13:39.000
So they'll never sync.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.308
So we ended up running it on the
local web server and then

00:13:43.308 --> 00:13:49.362
copying it, saving the actual
file into a remote server, for

00:13:49.362 --> 00:13:54.302
replaying stuff like that, which
was actually one of the

00:13:54.302 --> 00:13:58.254
awesome features that I don't
think anyone ever used.

00:13:58.254 --> 00:13:59.736
But they're actually there.

00:13:59.736 --> 00:14:02.206
You can replay whatever
decisions you

00:14:02.206 --> 00:14:04.410
made during your tour.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.000
IDO GREEN: So you could go and
undo several elections, or

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.178
just do a replay of it?

00:14:08.178 --> 00:14:10.062
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: You can
do a replay then add.

00:14:10.062 --> 00:14:11.780
It saves all your steps.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:16.514
Like at second 23, you
chose [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:16.514 --> 00:14:20.490
At second 30, you
turned it off.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.726
IDO GREEN: You talked about a
point that I think is very

00:14:22.726 --> 00:14:22.975
interesting.

00:14:22.975 --> 00:14:25.595
What method are you
using in order to

00:14:25.595 --> 00:14:26.800
make the syncing work?

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.328
What have you attached to the
other parts, for instance, to

00:14:29.328 --> 00:14:31.880
make sure that you truly
sync with the video?

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.770
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: Well,
basically, since everything

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:38.110
was already preconstructed, it
was basically a matter of

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.570
deciding and then placing
and then sort

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.830
of having a go situation.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.280
But I have to also say that
this is actually an

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:48.340
interesting sort of question
from a more, I would say, meta

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.050
point of view.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.975
Because the connection between
Devart and Fresh Paint was

00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:54.580
interesting from my specific
perspective.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.130
I don't know how this was
for you in your project.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:03.640
But Fresh Paint were leaning
towards a result with me.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.418
Whereas Devart or Google
were saying we're

00:15:06.418 --> 00:15:07.580
interested in the process.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.550
And I'm very interested
in the process.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:14.440
And so to me, in a way, we had
sort of a hybrid between the

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.210
results and the process.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.306
And I would really have loved a
situation where things could

00:15:19.306 --> 00:15:21.090
have been more open ended, where
things could have been

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.205
more different, where you could
actually-- so instead of

00:15:23.205 --> 00:15:24.140
replaying the whole
thing, replay--

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.020
OK, I just want this 10 seconds
because that was

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.830
really interesting, what
happened there, et cetera.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.610
So the project is still
in process.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.510
And I think that Devart
is exactly that.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.360
It's an invitation to experience
a process.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.893
So in a way, for
us, this was--

00:15:37.893 --> 00:15:38.376
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: Yeah.

00:15:38.376 --> 00:15:42.964
I think actually it crossed
the threshold, where more

00:15:42.964 --> 00:15:47.550
people visited the site after
Devart than doing the actual

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.290
Fresh Paint event.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:53.210
Because if I remember correctly,
we had 600 views

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.190
during the event.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.650
And it's something
like 1,200 now.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:01.112
So it's still active,
at least.

00:16:01.112 --> 00:16:02.060
URI SHAKED: You are right.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.620
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: I'm not sure
what the user experience is

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:10.430
since it's in a very small
server right now But it's

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:11.912
really going.

00:16:11.912 --> 00:16:12.900
IDO GREEN: Very nice.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.660
And have you had some challenges
on things that you

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.940
started that you might have
been thinking of very high

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.120
from the macro view of things,
and then things didn't really

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.515
work as expected?

00:16:24.515 --> 00:16:25.520
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: There
were a lot.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.060
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: 12.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.000
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: Yeah.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.910
Definitely like a constant
negotiation between what we

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.820
can do and what we can
do realistically.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.215
We had something like two or
three weeks, sort of the

00:16:37.215 --> 00:16:41.160
actual project since
I joined it.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.500
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: We began the
project sort of at a time

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.750
frame where it was
very difficult to

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:46.990
generate things alone.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:50.910
I really wanted to create a
platform that would invite

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.340
other people to upload all of
your recordings of Jerusalem

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.320
and Tel Aviv.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.790
And in the end--

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.565
to create an app, actually,
where people could sort of

00:16:59.565 --> 00:17:01.700
create an mp3, 30 seconds,
upload it [CLAP]

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.956
with a geotag that says, OK,
it's this place on GPS and

00:17:04.956 --> 00:17:05.198
everything.

00:17:05.198 --> 00:17:07.130
And then we could actually
use this for the project.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.579
We couldn't reach
that in time.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:09.220
We didn't have enough time.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.250
So that was something that
I would have loved

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.990
to be able to create.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.823
And I think that we were
basically scrambling for time

00:17:16.823 --> 00:17:18.800
a lot of the time through
the whole thing.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.370
So it was a game of compromise--
of saying, OK,

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:24.798
I'm not going to give up on this
no matter what or, OK, I

00:17:24.798 --> 00:17:25.198
can let this go.

00:17:25.198 --> 00:17:26.196
And yeah.

00:17:26.196 --> 00:17:28.691
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: We have a very
fun feature, which I'm

00:17:28.691 --> 00:17:30.687
really bummed it
isn't finished.

00:17:30.687 --> 00:17:34.512
We had a tablet, and we wanted
to have people control it

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:35.178
using the tablet.

00:17:35.178 --> 00:17:35.574
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: Oh, totally.

00:17:35.574 --> 00:17:35.677
Yes.

00:17:35.677 --> 00:17:36.176
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: Yeah.

00:17:36.176 --> 00:17:40.325
That's one of the features I was
scrambling at 4:00 AM the

00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:41.864
day before, trying
to make it work.

00:17:41.864 --> 00:17:44.234
And I made it halfway there.

00:17:44.234 --> 00:17:46.905
But I wasn't really
prepared on time.

00:17:46.905 --> 00:17:48.090
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: No,
but we literally--

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.720
I mean, the fair started
at 5:00.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.360
At 5:01, we were still
at the ladder,

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.652
fixing everything, and--

00:17:54.652 --> 00:17:57.062
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:57.062 --> 00:17:58.990
IDO GREEN: Like any
great painter,

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.400
up to the last minute.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.328
Tighten the last screw,
whatever.

00:18:03.328 --> 00:18:04.292
Yeah.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:04.774
Great.

00:18:04.774 --> 00:18:08.960
And what type of technologies
did you choose and why, if you

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.435
could share a bit?

00:18:11.435 --> 00:18:13.415
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: Uri, you
could do your talk?

00:18:13.415 --> 00:18:14.405
Or I'll talk.

00:18:14.405 --> 00:18:15.395
URI SHAKED: All right.

00:18:15.395 --> 00:18:20.350
So first of all, let me tell
you about the project I

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.910
participated in.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:25.790
Emmanuel gave you
a teaser before.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:29.525
In my project, the direction was
by moving inside the room.

00:18:29.525 --> 00:18:31.465
The project was called--

00:18:31.465 --> 00:18:34.380
still called the SoundTracker.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:40.490
And the idea behind it is to
let the participants create

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:45.440
music by moving around
inside a room.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.774
So usually, it takes a musical
instrument and years of

00:18:49.774 --> 00:18:52.546
training in order to play
something that is

00:18:52.546 --> 00:18:56.280
clever to the ears.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.780
So we wanted to create an
experience that will let

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:05.040
anybody just walk into the
room and join into a live

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:10.760
orchestra, interacting with
other people in this same

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.920
space and creating music
as a consequence of

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.420
moving inside the room.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.996
So before I'm going to talk
about the technology, let's

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:25.460
talk a little about--

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:30.828
I will tell you a little about
the obstacles we had.

00:19:30.828 --> 00:19:32.780
We had many of them.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:37.550
First of all, we worked
with a music artist.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:42.809
And he wanted to create as
many tracks as eight.

00:19:42.809 --> 00:19:48.030
But then we realized that the
average person without musical

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:52.200
training can't tell what his
specific role is when there

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.380
are too many instruments
playing at once.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:00.330
So we had to cut down to four.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.494
And that actually solved a lot
of problems that we had.

00:20:04.494 --> 00:20:09.950
In order to find out where the
people are in every specific

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:13.422
moment-- what is their position
inside the room--

00:20:13.422 --> 00:20:17.390
we tried several approaches.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:22.350
And every single approach-- we
had a problem that the more

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:26.900
people we had, the approach
failed more times.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:31.940
Because people were hiding
by each other.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:36.970
And we tried several
alternatives.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:42.426
The beginning, we started with
putting hats on the people, on

00:20:42.426 --> 00:20:49.656
their heads, and using a camera
above to recognize the

00:20:49.656 --> 00:20:53.355
location of each of the
people in the room.

00:20:53.355 --> 00:20:58.559
We tried to take advantage of
the open source OpenCV, Open

00:20:58.559 --> 00:20:59.860
Computer Vision.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.350
That is a library.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:06.515
But it wasn't accurate enough.

00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:09.425
So we tried a whole different
approach.

00:21:09.425 --> 00:21:14.275
Instead of using simple image
accumulation to recognize the

00:21:14.275 --> 00:21:17.670
hats and LEDs-- the light
emitting LEDs

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.590
we had on the hats--

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:25.340
we changed to using full
body rests with

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.720
some sort of QR codes.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.340
And then we found a great open
source-- not open source, but

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:38.070
free library from Qualcomm
that's called Vuforia.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:43.515
And it's provided free for
both Android and iOS.

00:21:43.515 --> 00:21:49.480
So we shifted our approach from
using computer processing

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:54.350
to actually do the processing
on a set of Android devices.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:22:00.154
We had Android tablets hanging
all around the room from

00:22:00.154 --> 00:22:06.080
different provisions, and they
constant are taking pictures

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.100
of the room and analyzing the
pictures, looking for these QR

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:14.370
codes, using this
Qualcomm SDK.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:18.734
And then we used a main
server, which tried to

00:22:18.734 --> 00:22:23.750
integrate the information from
all the tablets and create a

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:29.818
track of music by letting each
person control their

00:22:29.818 --> 00:22:31.264
individual instrument--

00:22:31.264 --> 00:22:36.700
like drums, guitar, piano,
synthesizer--

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.446
using his position and the
state of his movement.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.904
We will add videos where you
will be able to see people

00:22:47.904 --> 00:22:50.264
interacting with it.

00:22:50.264 --> 00:22:55.980
Now one of the most interesting
aspects for us was

00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:00.300
the fact that people didn't
quite interact

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.700
with it as we expected.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:09.180
We thought that people will try
to come into the room and

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:12.684
then will just walk around
and see what happens.

00:23:12.684 --> 00:23:16.460
And we found out that different
kinds of people

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.380
interacted in different ways.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:25.450
For example, there were people
who just walked every one step

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.132
forward, then looked what
happened, another step

00:23:28.132 --> 00:23:30.315
forward, then looked
what happened.

00:23:30.315 --> 00:23:34.922
And the system was not designed
to identify such

00:23:34.922 --> 00:23:36.135
small movements.

00:23:36.135 --> 00:23:43.130
So we put shapes on the edges of
the floor in order to make

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.050
them move from shape to shape.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.726
So they tried to jump between
the shapes without--

00:23:48.726 --> 00:23:50.970
they turned it into
a kind of game--

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:58.480
without touching the floor or
sort of swimming the air or do

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.731
really cool things.

00:24:00.731 --> 00:24:06.695
And then we found that our best
audience was children,

00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:10.174
who really enjoyed running
all around.

00:24:10.174 --> 00:24:15.144
And I'm not sure whether they
really understood the relation

00:24:15.144 --> 00:24:18.130
between their position
and the music.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:18.920
But they enjoyed it.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.290
That's for sure.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:25.140
And also there were sort of some
old people who started

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.870
looking around and
then seeing--

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:32.600
you saw like, OK, this
is the real color.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.540
Guys, this is different.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:38.420
This is not just walking from
one room to another and

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.845
watching another painting
and saying wow.

00:24:40.845 --> 00:24:43.270
This is really getting
us active,

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:47.480
getting us the full angle.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.738
So that was the best thing
about the project, seeing

00:24:51.738 --> 00:24:56.260
people who were interacting
immediately with it, who were

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.690
enjoying it, were starting
to dance around

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.140
and do crazy things.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:06.550
And I think that's what
we wanted to achieve.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:10.490
And I think that we
succeeded in that.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.540
IDO GREEN: And you were just
speaking about the technical

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.687
stack that you used.

00:25:14.687 --> 00:25:16.120
URI SHAKED: Yeah.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:22.355
So for the audio, we wanted
the audio to follow the

00:25:22.355 --> 00:25:25.210
location of people
in the room.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:31.400
So if they are, for example,
controlling the piano, we

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:36.116
wanted them to hear the piano
from the same position as they

00:25:36.116 --> 00:25:38.920
were standing in, from
the same speaker

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.900
where they were standing.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:48.320
So we had to use the OpenAL
library that provides a 3D

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.390
audio spot.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:56.420
And in order to use the OpenAL
library from within Java, we

00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:00.360
had to create Java bindings
to the library.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:06.130
There were some very old Java
bindings which didn't work

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.195
well with our environment.

00:26:09.195 --> 00:26:13.360
So we started a new open source
project that is Java

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.790
bindings for OpenAL,
Java OpenAL.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:24.140
And this is a result
of the Devart.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:29.530
We now have it on GDocs
so we can--

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:32.470
IDO GREEN: Yeah, we'll show a
bit later some of the project.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:36.190
URI SHAKED: Check it out
if you are interested.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.548
And we also used
the FluidSynth.

00:26:39.548 --> 00:26:47.420
It's a sound synthesizer that
lets you synthesize sounds

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:52.470
from musical instruments
on the fly.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:57.733
So it was like the brain behind
the sound engine.

00:26:57.733 --> 00:27:00.691
And we fed the position
information.

00:27:00.691 --> 00:27:06.360
We translated it into a sequence
of play a note on

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.058
this instrument, stop playing
the note and so on.

00:27:10.058 --> 00:27:12.550
And we fed that into
the FluidSynth.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:14.970
It created the sound stream.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:18.698
And then we took that sound
stream and fed it into OpenAL

00:27:18.698 --> 00:27:23.820
in order to create the 3D sound
experience, where each

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:27.210
player controls a specific
instrument, both in the

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.736
position and in the way that
instrument's placed.

00:27:30.736 --> 00:27:32.712
IDO GREEN: Nice.

00:27:32.712 --> 00:27:35.182
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: Well, ours
was a little different.

00:27:35.182 --> 00:27:37.158
It was a web app.

00:27:37.158 --> 00:27:41.604
It was done with HTML5
technology, JavaScript, and

00:27:41.604 --> 00:27:46.050
especially the cameras and
video elements, which we

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:54.676
combined in very interesting
ways, like having three

00:27:54.676 --> 00:27:57.628
canvases all feeding
one another.

00:27:57.628 --> 00:28:03.040
And we also used Google Maps
for tour selection.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:09.436
And basically we had a small
back end written in PHP to

00:28:09.436 --> 00:28:14.850
save all the tours.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:15.340
IDO GREEN: Very cool.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.670
What would be the top--

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.342
I don't know-- three things
that you would recommend a

00:28:19.342 --> 00:28:22.980
group that is coming to build
a cool project next year?

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:26.375
Maybe I will split it into the
artistic part of things and

00:28:26.375 --> 00:28:27.830
the technical part of things.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.285
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: Begin with
the technical approach.

00:28:29.285 --> 00:28:30.255
IDO GREEN: OK.

00:28:30.255 --> 00:28:32.710
What is the most important thing
to pay attention to?

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:36.400
URI SHAKED: Well, I'm not sure
whether it's truly technical

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.090
or artistic.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:43.405
But what we learned is it's very
important to let people--

00:28:43.405 --> 00:28:47.365
if you are building something
interactive, as we did in our

00:28:47.365 --> 00:28:51.000
both projects, let people, your
friends, your family,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.961
interact with the system in an
early stage in order to figure

00:28:55.961 --> 00:28:58.265
out whether they are interacting
with it in the way

00:28:58.265 --> 00:28:59.340
that you planned.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.362
Or maybe there is a
much better way to

00:29:02.362 --> 00:29:04.920
interact with it.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:10.516
So we will be able to build a
system to be the most fun--

00:29:10.516 --> 00:29:13.668
or whatever your goal is--

00:29:13.668 --> 00:29:19.300
as you build it, and not just
build it as you think it will

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:24.300
be appropriated and then get it
and see that it is used in

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.610
different ways you didn't
anticipate.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:28.970
IDO GREEN: So, Emmanuel.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:30.800
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: Not me.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.474
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: Well, I think
my top advice is think

00:29:35.474 --> 00:29:36.470
about the user.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:40.952
Think about who is going to
stand in front of your project

00:29:40.952 --> 00:29:43.940
or the experience
you will have.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:47.590
And you should understand
that the crowd--

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:50.964
if you're a developer, the crowd
you see there is not

00:29:50.964 --> 00:29:52.860
your usual tech-y crowd.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:57.097
There are a lot of people who
are not fluent in computers.

00:29:57.097 --> 00:29:59.600
And you need to make
it as smooth of an

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.850
experience as possible.

00:30:03.458 --> 00:30:04.919
That's my top tip.

00:30:04.919 --> 00:30:08.328
And also, of course, have fun
and do something crazy, which

00:30:08.328 --> 00:30:10.290
is very important.

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:11.806
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: I'll
take that last

00:30:11.806 --> 00:30:14.060
crazy thing and yeah.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.650
Be open to experiment.

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:16.930
Be open to it being a process.

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.230
Don't feel that you're coming
into a project and you're

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.720
supposed to tell the developer
what to do or have the

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.250
developer tell you what to do.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.600
You're there to create
something together.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:29.260
Think of A plus B makes C. And
the public can be the C. You

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.570
guys can be the C. The end
product could be the C.

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:36.392
Everything can be a C. But the
idea behind it is to try and

00:30:36.392 --> 00:30:38.588
experiment and to try
to do something new.

00:30:38.588 --> 00:30:40.540
And Devart is exactly,
I think, that.

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:41.516
IDO GREEN: No, absolutely.

00:30:41.516 --> 00:30:45.420
And I think in Fresh Paint, we
had more than 40,000 people

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.290
that play and work with
the projects.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:52.684
So that's a huge number, just to
think about the users that

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:56.412
will interact and would
participate in it.

00:30:56.412 --> 00:31:00.139
Have you seen any other cool
project that you'd like to

00:31:00.139 --> 00:31:02.873
share with us, really short?

00:31:02.873 --> 00:31:03.867
URI SHAKED: Well, yes.

00:31:03.867 --> 00:31:07.843
There were a dozen of other
interesting projects.

00:31:07.843 --> 00:31:13.990
One of them was enabling the
audience, the guests in the

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:20.270
Fresh Paint event, to send text
messages that appeared on

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:23.070
a very wide display
inside a room.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:26.370
And these message
grew into trees.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:31.390
So you had trees of letters,
consisting of the messages the

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.750
audience sent.

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:37.540
And then once in awhile, when
the trees became too crowded,

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:42.140
you have seen them sink
into the ground.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:47.890
And the monitors then get
black, like into night.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:52.213
And then after a few
seconds, it was

00:31:52.213 --> 00:31:55.210
like the sun was rising.

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:59.715
And everything started to grow
new from new text messages

00:31:59.715 --> 00:32:01.200
that people sent.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.190
IDO GREEN: Cool.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:04.170
Any other things?

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.150
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: I really
like that project as well.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:07.140
I thought it was beautiful.

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.120
IDO GREEN: Yeah, and I think
this project is on Chrome

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:09.615
Experiments.

00:32:09.615 --> 00:32:10.605
So we'll show the
link as well.

00:32:10.605 --> 00:32:13.080
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: I liked that
there was a very simple

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.555
project that gave you
a controller.

00:32:15.555 --> 00:32:20.490
And you could play Tetris
with [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:24.450
It was very interesting
and very fun.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.925
Because, again, it was a
very simple experience.

00:32:26.925 --> 00:32:30.390
Tetris is something that
everyone knows how to play.

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:36.825
And in GeekCon, which was
another conference, there was

00:32:36.825 --> 00:32:43.322
a similar project which used
laser technologies to draw on

00:32:43.322 --> 00:32:43.967
the building.

00:32:43.967 --> 00:32:48.350
And the projector saves
that work of art that

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.820
you do with the laser.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:55.673
So things like that that have
you create something and

00:32:55.673 --> 00:32:59.166
interact with something that
is on a huge building, on a

00:32:59.166 --> 00:33:01.162
huge wall is very fun.

00:33:01.162 --> 00:33:02.160
IDO GREEN: Great.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:02.659
Great.

00:33:02.659 --> 00:33:04.655
So thank you very much
for your time.

00:33:04.655 --> 00:33:08.035
And hopefully we'll see very
cool things next year.

00:33:08.035 --> 00:33:08.735
URI SHAKED: Sure.

00:33:08.735 --> 00:33:09.462
Thank you very much.

00:33:09.462 --> 00:33:09.914
MICHAEL SVERDLIN: Thank you.

00:33:09.914 --> 00:33:11.164
EMMANUEL WITZTHUM: Thank
you for having us.
