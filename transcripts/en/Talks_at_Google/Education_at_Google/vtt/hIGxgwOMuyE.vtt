MAGGIE JOHNSON:
The way that Google

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.670
started was an academic venture.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.800
JEFF DEAN: How do you
find interesting problems

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.540
in the world?

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.720
ALFRED SPECTOR: Google
depends on academia.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.090
So many of the good ideas
that we've brought forward

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.910
to the world come from academia.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.850
JEFF DEAN: One of the real
reasons to engage with academia

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.561
is to get a really
fresh perspective.

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:22.060
MAGGIE JOHNSON: We
empower academics

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.280
to work on real problems.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.690
And in the other
direction, academics

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.300
bring ideas and
new approaches that

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.380
are put into practice
much more quickly

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.274
than in an academic environment.

00:00:33.274 --> 00:00:34.690
JEFF DEAN: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.481
That's interesting.

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:36.534
That's interesting.

00:00:36.534 --> 00:00:38.200
All of a sudden,
you've knitted together

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.545
something that is really,
really, tremendously powerful.

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:42.920
MAGGIE JOHNSON: We need their
help because of the problem

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.444
we're trying to
solve internally.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.860
ALFRED SPECTOR: Academia can
look far out into the future.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.260
It can take greater risks and
look for really interesting

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.990
solutions that industry
sometimes cannot.

00:01:05.522 --> 00:01:06.730
DAN RUSSELL: I'm Dan Russell.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.240
And I'm a researcher for user
experience in the search group.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.240
My job is to try to figure out
how people think-- particularly

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.310
about how search works,
but more generally I

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.740
work a lot with universities.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.680
And that's my connection
here with the Olsons,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.940
is part of the university
relationships program.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.290
So I'm heavily
involved in making sure

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.452
that Google connects with the
academic research in the world

00:01:29.452 --> 00:01:30.660
that's really relevant to us.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.800
And that's how I know
you guys, ultimately.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.075
GARY OLSON: I'm Gary Olson, a
faculty member at UC Irvine.

00:01:37.075 --> 00:01:40.900
I got my Ph.D. at Stanford
in cognitive experimental

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.530
psychology.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.550
Spent most of my career at
the University of Michigan,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.300
as did Judy.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.370
And I've been
studying collaboration

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.100
since the mid '80s.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.480
JUDY OLSEN: And I'm Judy Olson.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.750
And I have a very similar
background to Gary

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.950
in that I got my
Ph.D. not at Stanford,

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.190
but the University of Michigan
in cognitive psychology.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.370
And then the tech world
grew up around us,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.260
and there are lots of
interesting cognitive

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.456
things going on.

00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:09.039
DAN RUSSELL: I think the first
that Judy and Gary were working

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.970
on was this collaboration piece.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.220
And it became very clear
to me several years ago,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.720
working at Google-- because
I've been here eight years now--

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.710
that the docs work
that were doing,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.040
presentations and
spreadsheets and so on,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.960
was really in need of
some deep thinking.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.340
Now what I found interesting was
when I first visited you guys,

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.240
you had been working on ShrEdit
before that, the shared editing

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.070
stuff.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.653
And that actually
really impressed me.

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:38.530
Because then years later, when
I was at CSCW, the Computer

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.130
Supported Cooperative
Work conference,

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.910
I was demoing one of the
first versions of Google Docs.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.160
And I would demo this and
say, look, isn't this great?

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.740
And I remember somebody
coming up to me and saying,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:49.930
isn't that just ShrEdit?

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.240
And that kind of reminded
me, gee, Judy and Gary

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.755
have been doing this forever.

00:02:56.755 --> 00:02:58.380
And we really should
connect with them.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.570
GARY OLSON: We did some
carefully-controlled studies

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.861
that showed that working with
this collaborative editor

00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:05.542
really made collaborations
work better.

00:03:05.542 --> 00:03:07.250
I mean, we compared
that with people just

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.270
using the white board and
paper and pencil and so on.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.780
And the shared editor review
was a productivity enhancer.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.530
So we had early evidence
from the early '90s

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.100
that this was a good idea.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.360
And it took a long time
for it to be picked up

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.370
in the commercial world.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.432
And so we're delighted
that it has been.

00:03:24.432 --> 00:03:26.890
What's interesting is there's
a whole culture change that's

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.514
taken place in the
last-- I don't know,

00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:32.780
25, 3o-- years about how much
more important teamwork is,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.830
whether you're talking about
in an industrial setting,

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.390
or even in universities now.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.400
Group projects in
schools of business,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.000
schools of engineering,
schools of computer science

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.360
are just much more common
than they ever used to be.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.935
I'm waiting for the first
collaborative dissertation,

00:03:49.935 --> 00:03:52.449
because it's a natural outcome.

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.990
JUDY OLSEN: But there's also a
big science happening now too,

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.110
across universities.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.190
And some of that is impossible
without these kinds of tools.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.970
GARY OLSON: Working with other
people is considered cheating.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.261
DAN RUSSELL: Yes, that's right.

00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:05.120
GARY OLSON: Yet now we know
that it's actually important,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.040
it's valuable.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.960
DAN RUSSELL: The cycle time,
with which work gets done now

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.430
is very different.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.360
I remember going to a talk where
a student presented his work,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.110
and it was great.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.779
And beside me, the
guy had downloaded

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:23.370
the data set and redone all
the essential key aspects

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.210
of his algorithm and came
up with a different answer.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.850
So what happened was what took
four years, all of a sudden

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.002
now was compressed into
the time of the talk.

00:04:33.002 --> 00:04:34.960
Think about what it would
have been previously.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.668
Well, I'll get back
to you with the data,

00:04:36.668 --> 00:04:37.740
and I'll reimplement it.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.760
Maybe six months later
I'll write a paper

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.520
that rebuts what we found out.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.515
All of a sudden now we've
switched from months

00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:45.000
to an hour.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.400
And that immediacy
of data sharing,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.937
immediacy of being able
to reimplement and build

00:04:49.937 --> 00:04:52.505
on top of the
infrastructures that we have.

00:04:52.505 --> 00:04:53.880
GARY OLSON: Because
as we know, I

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.050
mean, to create the technology
that makes this possible also

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.740
creates interesting new social
issues about credit, sharing,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.550
privacy, control.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.957
So there's a whole
other round of research

00:05:05.957 --> 00:05:07.540
that's got to be
done on what happens,

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.915
what are the
consequences once we

00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:10.557
can do this stuff
technologically?

00:05:10.557 --> 00:05:12.140
JUDY OLSEN: Every
time we give a talk,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.900
there are excellent
questions that people

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.840
ask that all very much
influence our work,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.160
the next things that
we're going to work on.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.080
But also we find
out that people who

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.290
are experts in
various topics that we

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.190
find from the literature
are now at Google.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.040
And so they're a
phone call away.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.550
And they're willing
to talk to us, right,

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.700
because we're part
of this partnership.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.630
And that's been
totally enlightening.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.700
GARY OLSON: But in the
past, we did a sabbatical

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.580
at Microsoft Research-- I
don't know, 10, 15 years ago.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.350
We did a sabbatical
at Xerox, PARC.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.120
So we've done-- pretty
much all of our sabbaticals

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.890
have been in corporate settings.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.700
And we have very strong
connections with IBM.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.950
So we love to go back and forth
between academia and industry.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.110
I think that's a really
important kind of partnership.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.401
DAN RUSSELL: One of the things
that always impresses me

00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:04.110
when Judy and Gary come to
town is that people come out

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.324
of the woodwork that
I never expected.

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.490
So for example, I think the
last time you were here,

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.832
people from quantitative
marketing came and spoke to us.

00:06:10.832 --> 00:06:11.540
JUDY OLSEN: Yeah.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.081
DAN RUSSELL: And it
was like, really?

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.079
I had no idea.

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:15.870
And it turns there was
this deep connection

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.907
that I don't think any
of us had anticipated.

00:06:17.907 --> 00:06:19.490
And so there are
connections like that

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.834
that emerge that you
don't anticipate.

00:06:21.834 --> 00:06:23.750
That's one of the beautiful
things about this.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.060
GARY OLSON: There's
another odd connection

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.110
that Larry Page took a
class from Judy from he

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.530
was an undergraduate
at Michigan.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.113
JUDY OLSEN: So I
take credit for a lot

00:06:30.113 --> 00:06:32.815
of things of how
this company runs.

00:06:32.815 --> 00:06:34.230
DAN RUSSELL: Nicely circular.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.875
JUDY OLSEN: Yes,
nicely circular.

00:06:35.875 --> 00:06:37.625
GARY OLSON: This is
just an ongoing story.

00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:39.060
It doesn't end.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.340
And I think that's the
nature of research.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.400
So we'll study collaboration
for another 10 or 15 years

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.560
and we'll see where it goes.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.380
But then other people
will pick it up,

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.574
and the story will evolve.

00:06:50.574 --> 00:06:52.490
DAN RUSSELL: When we
started this relationship

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.670
with Judy and Gary, we had
hopes for certain things

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.270
that would come out of it.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.749
But the thing that
most surprised

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:01.290
me was how many
things came out of it

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.840
that I hadn't anticipated.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.506
And I think that's the key
idea about a lot of research.

00:07:05.506 --> 00:07:07.630
You can go in there, you
can make your spreadsheet,

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:08.780
make your project plan.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.830
You will execute X, Y,
and Z. And that's great.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.600
It's the alpha, beta,
deltas beyond that

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.000
you don't anticipate.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.470
and actually have
a lot of magic.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:17.950
GARY OLSON: That's
one of the reasons why

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.574
it's been so fun to
work with you guys,

00:07:19.574 --> 00:07:22.430
because we laid out a little
plan at the beginning.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.460
And we've done some
of that, but we've

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.767
done so many other things
we didn't have in that plan.

00:07:27.767 --> 00:07:29.350
And you were supportive
of doing that.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.200
I think that was terrific.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.991
JUDY OLSEN: It allowed
the inspiration came

00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:34.680
from people reacting to
what we doing so far.
