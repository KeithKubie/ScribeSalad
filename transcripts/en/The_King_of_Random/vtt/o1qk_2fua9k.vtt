00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.490
Hey guys I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop today. We're going to be taking a little bit of a look at ferrofluid. That's a liquid

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.859
That's attracted to magnets and make some really cool shapes when it's in a magnetic field the basic recipe for our

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.039
ferrofluid that we'll be making today is one that I got from a channel called brainiac75 they've got a lot of cool videos about

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.749
Ferrofluid so if you're interested in seeing more go check them out before we start making our ferrofluid

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.640
I wanted to talk a little bit about what it is

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.439
And why some recipes do and don't work the basic idea of a Ferrofluid is a liquid

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.630
That's attracted to a magnetic field

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.260
This is done by suspending a ferrous chemical inside a liquid base toward properly a ferrofluid needs at least three main components

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.189
The first is a magnetic powder that can be suspended in the fluid will be using magnetite a synthetic black iron oxide

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.240
Once we have our magnetic powder base

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.570
We need a fluid to

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.930
Suspend it in and this is where it can get a little bit tricky; an issue we quickly run into is that most liquids will

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.860
Not stick to the microscopically small particles that make up our magnetic powder

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.979
We may be able to get our powder wet, but as soon as a magnet is introduced all of the particles will stick together

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.650
So closely that there's no longer any space in between the individual ones for our fluid base

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.220
Let's see what happens if we try mixing our powder with plain water

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.349
This cup now has a mixture of a little bit of water and some of our

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.270
Magnetite powder you can see that it hasn't mixed in very thoroughly at the bottom

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.079
There's still sort of a thick goopy paste with a thinner

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.130
black liquid on top of it now this thinner liquid does have our magnetite suspended through it pretty well at this point

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.889
So you might think hey that should work won't that be magnetic well watch what happens when we actually put a magnet up against it

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.339
Look at that it squeezes the magnetic powder so much that it just pulls all of it right out of the water. You can see

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.799
We are now getting water that's almost clear again. We've just pulled all of the magnet powder right out of there

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.910
It does look kind of cool though. You can see all the magnetic powder flowing through the water

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.489
over to the magnet

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.660
So the water clearly doesn't work and that brings us to the third element that we need in our ferrofluid

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.079
and that's what's called a surfactant the word surfactant comes from a combination of the words surface active agent.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.649
A surfactant is something that lowers the surface tension between two substances

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:49.100
What we're looking for is one that will work as a wetting agent to make sure that our liquid base will surround every individual particle of our magnetite powder

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.720
Motor-oil does exactly what we're looking for it's a liquid oil base with surfactants added to make it stick well to the surface of oil

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.679
This particular brand is the same kind that was recommended by Brainiac75 on his channel

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.440
But I've tried it with a couple of other brands of synthetic motor oil

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.340
And they seemed to work just as well

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.920
So now let's take some of our oil and some of our Mack type powder mix them together and see what happens

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.920
And how it's different from mixing it with water

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:22.290
Now we have our motor oil in the cup, let's add that get up outta to it until it becomes a fairly uniform consistency

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.829
There we go we now have a fairly thick liquid mixed up, and that is our Castrol Magnatec oil mixed with our magnetite powder

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.859
Let's see how our liquid responds to a magnet

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.109
There we go you can see is definitely getting pulled on to it there

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.909
And we're also even starting to get a few fun little shapes forming look at that

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.490
The walls of this cup get coated pretty quickly in our black paste so to make it easier to see let's pour our liquid out

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.279
Onto a plate and then see how it reacts to a magnet

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.939
Alright, let's move our plate over our magnet and see how this goes

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.969
Definitely see your reacting you're starting to get some of those cool. Little spiky shapes that we're looking for from the ferrofluid

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.620
That's pretty cool

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.760
All right now, let's watch what happens if I take the magnet away from the mixture

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.350
Just kind of puddle back down have all our fun little spikes

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.569
Take it away, and they all just smooth themselves right out

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.540
Now that's pretty neat, but this ceramic magnet is actually not all that powerful

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.840
So let's see what happens if we use something a little bit stronger

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.240
We've got four neodymium magnets all stuck together right here, and this should provide some pretty intense power

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.600
Hopefully not too much power. Let's see the result. I want to break my plate either. Oh

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.259
Boy yeah look at that

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.919
It's so close to the magnetic field and the magnetic field is so strong that we're not getting the normal points

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.099
We're looking for but we're just getting some interesting plate

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.380
Spots on the most concentrated bits in the magnet also see this little puddle of oil in the middle

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.649
That's what I was talking about by using magnets that are too powerful

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:31.280
It's actually squishing our magnetic powder together, so powerfully that it's squeezing the oil out from in between the particles

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.179
Try and take this magnet off and then back it away, so it's not quite as close to our magnet powder

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.699
We've added two more plates that should keep our magnets a little more separated from our ferrofluid now. Let's see how it reacts

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.520
We're still getting the four different concentrated points so our four magnets are clearly not all acting it has one powerful magnet

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.580
Which makes sense?

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.800
There we go look at that

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.000
Oh that's beautiful

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.480
Those spikes are fantastic

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.900
As long as I keep moving the magnet they sort of keep growing in the magnetic field

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.759
If I just hold the magnet still of course they don't move anywhere just to illustrate it. It's only when I'm moving the magnet

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.580
That the fluid is moving with it

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.800
Well that was a pretty powerful magnet now

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.259
I also have some ultra powerful knives these things are huge and so strong

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:43.538
I'm afraid it might be too strong and it might just pull the magnetic powder right out of the oil

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.789
But we got to try it

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:53.949
You'd still like fully an inch away. We're getting good results though spikes are giant

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:04.029
That looks so cool. Let's see what happens if I pull the magnet away. Well. We've got these giant spikes

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.409
Bloop huddled back down

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.860
back

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.500
We got sort of these like weird ridges instead of regular spikes

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.210
Not quite what I had in mind, but also kind of neat

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.849
There we have it our ferrofluid may not be quite so runny or thin as some commercially-available

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:39.580
Ferrofluids, but it does respond well to magnets and we do get those cool points sticking out of it

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.619
Just the way we wanted to. One more test

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.990
I want to try because I know a lot of you are gonna want to see it

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.050
Let's see what happens if we freeze it with liquid nitrogen

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:53.050
I have a prediction and I think the liquid nitrogen is going to freeze the motor oil and it'll become so rigid that it no

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.179
Longer responds to the magnets well

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.290
Let's find out now pouring the liquid nitrogen on just like this would be no fun

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:05.529
So let's try and get some good spikes on there, and then freeze those so if they stay even when we remove the magnet

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:12.189
All right those some good spikes put on the safety glasses

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.050
See about freezing our ferrofluid

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:28.700
Hopefully, it doesn't just shatter my plate. It's a very real possibility. I understand

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.740
Take away the magnet

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:42.019
Well I would say we've got some good frozen spice it's actually got a cool

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.650
You bet anymore to keep it nice and frozen

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:53.539
And normally without a magnet these things are just gone now, I've got some frozen motor oil and spike shaped

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.960
I can poke them

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.260
Now I got some of the unfrozen stuff on my magnet, that's annoying

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.720
There you go how to make your very own ferrofluid using magnetite powder and

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:18.410
Castrol Magnatec motor oil this stuff is pretty fun to play with although I do recommend you wear gloves because

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:25.160
Motor oil is designed to stick to stuff and this stuff is very black in color, so if you get any other than hands

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.520
It's going to be on your hands, and it's going to spread to everything you touch

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.619
It's really hard to get off even with soap and water if you've got any ideas on how to make ferrofluid

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:38.630
That's a thinner consistency more like the commercially available ferrofluid let us know down in the comments

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.330
I would love to try all of your ideas and if one of them works

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.680
We'll make an updated video showing you how to make that kind of ferrofluid

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.660
And we'll send you 25 bucks.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:52.280
Well now we know that ferrofluid is made from a magnetic powder base a liquid base and some kind of surfactant.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.260
Motor oil already has a liquid base and a surfactant in it so it bonds

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.890
Well to our magnetite powder to give us a ferrofluid liquid, nitrogen

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.679
We'll freeze our ferrofluid solid so it remains

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.869
Spiky even when we take our magnets away from it if you love these kinds of hands-on experiments

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:14.239
