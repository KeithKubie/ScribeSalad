00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.904
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.904 --> 00:00:09.348
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.980
SPEAKER: OK, so,
the rough patch.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.600
Why do they call
it the rough patch?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.750
Is there a rough patch
in every marriage?

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.730
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE:
Simple answer, yes.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.500
More than one, usually.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.840
I named the book "The Rough
Patch," which is obviously

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.880
a very common term.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.479
It's not only applied to
what I'm writing about.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.210
Because what I was noticing
in my practice as I see

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.510
couples and individuals
was people having the sense

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.930
that they had
created their life.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.750
They had partners, they had
houses, they had children,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.130
they had a structure.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.800
But that sometime in
the middle period,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.450
they were finding
themselves feeling

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.840
kind of lost, or
confused, or stuck,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.120
or feeling that something
about their emotional life

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.360
wasn't working.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.080
So that's what I
use the time for.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.640
But the book is structured
so that each chapter

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.070
is about a different
kind of rough patch,

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.780
or a crisis, or a struggle.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.540
So there's a chapter
on money issues.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.190
There's a chapter on affairs.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.930
There's a chapter
on alcohol use.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.960
Different things that people
confront over the course

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.430
of a long relationship.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.570
SPEAKER: And so are
these the types of topics

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.700
that are covered in the book?

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.464
Are they changing over time?

00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:30.380
Or are they the same
problems that our parents

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.210
have dealt with, and our
grandparents dealt with?

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.710
Or is there something
different now?

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.090
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE:
Well, I think

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.460
people now live longer
than our parents

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.550
and our grandparents did.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.060
So people are trying to have
close relationships over longer

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.020
lives.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.354
And our model of marriage
has also changed.

00:01:47.354 --> 00:01:48.770
In other words,
it used to be more

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.210
of an economic arrangement.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.920
In the '60s, it was more kind
of find yourself arrangement.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.370
Now, it's more of
a how can we have

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.890
a close, intimate
partnership that helps

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.320
carry us through and support
each other in that process.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.230
And so the model has changed,
and our life span has changed.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.600
So that's a fact
of living today.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.889
There were obviously
the timeworn problems

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.300
that people have
in relationships

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.030
in terms of emotional
communication

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.170
and the other things
I've mentioned.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.540
I think a couple things
that probably all of you

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.610
can relate to that
are new and different

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.610
are the way in which
technology has completely

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.030
seeped into every
aspect of our lives,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.600
and all the possibilities
for connecting that have

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.940
been created by social media.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.700
And my understanding of
that is it's new and old.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.580
I mean, it's a new way in
which we deploy our time.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.550
But it's also often used
in very common ways, namely

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.150
to disconnect, to avoid
difficult emotional situations,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.849
to have a moment of
escape and privacy.

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.390
All the things that
people are always

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.890
trying to balance
in marriage anyway.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.060
SPEAKER: What about
the trends in terms

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.100
of when people are
having children,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.210
or kind of some of
the historical gender

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.410
roles in relationships?

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.720
Are those complexities as well?

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.680
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: Right,
so a couple of things

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.096
are really interesting
about that.

00:03:08.096 --> 00:03:11.150
One is that, if you look at
the statistics on longevity

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.780
of marriage now, the people
who are staying married and not

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.420
getting divorced are
people who have education

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.195
and economic resources.

00:03:19.195 --> 00:03:21.320
Which makes a lot of sense,
because often they have

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.570
fewer stresses in their lives.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.140
They have fewer
economic stresses.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.820
They have more opportunities.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.050
It also usually means that it's
a more egalitarian marriage.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.970
Whereas in the past, and even as
recently as the '60s and '70s,

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.700
women's education was actually
a risk factor for divorce.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.780
Now, it is a protective
factor for marriage.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.920
So in other words, you can see
that an egalitarian marriage

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.500
tends to offer certain
opportunities for collaboration

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.304
and partnership.

00:03:46.304 --> 00:03:47.720
Of course, it also
means we're all

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.150
taking all roles, all the time.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.420
So everybody is trying to be
a full partner in every way.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.860
Work, child care, money,
household chores, et cetera.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.600
So that means a lot
of collaboration,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.820
a lot of negotiation,
a lot of conversation,

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.780
and often conflict around
division of labor, fairness,

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.190
who does what,
that sort of thing.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.020
SPEAKER: And so,
talking about children,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.037
how are children
hard on a marriage?

00:04:12.037 --> 00:04:13.620
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE:
Right, so children

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.011
are known to be one of the
hardest stresses on a marriage.

00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:19.260
Obviously, it's one of the
reasons people get married.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.630
It's one of the reasons
people want to stay married.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.554
Having a family is
a high aspiration

00:04:24.554 --> 00:04:25.470
for many, many people.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.930
But the research
does unequivocally

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.120
suggest that when you
have your first child,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.402
your marital
satisfaction goes down.

00:04:32.402 --> 00:04:34.110
And the way I think
about that, because I

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.280
teach a class to young
parent-- well, not so young.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.780
I live in the Bay
Area, and I teach

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.238
a class for people who are
about to have their first child.

00:04:42.238 --> 00:04:45.120
And it's basically how to keep
a couple relationships strong

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.500
when you have a child.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.710
This demographic may
be similar to that one.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.150
The people's big worry is
I've had this great life,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.010
I've you know done
all this cool stuff,

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.839
I'm a fully formed individual.

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:56.130
We have this great partnership.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.950
Is this kid going to kind
of ruin everything, right?

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.780
I mean, that's a
whole different model

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.730
from when people had their
kids that 21, 22, 25, whatever.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.550
And so there is this
feeling that children

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.290
are going to disrupt my life
often with people today.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.697
But the way I think they
do disrupt your life,

00:05:15.697 --> 00:05:18.030
because I think we can all
agree children are wonderful,

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.120
but that it depletes resources.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.802
That it's basically more
people that everything

00:05:23.802 --> 00:05:24.510
has to go around.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.110
So if you think of that
certainly economically but also

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.400
emotionally and time-wise.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.000
And so I think what
happens with children often

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.700
is that the do-list and the
hierarchy of things that

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.780
have to happen, your emotional
needs and your need to connect

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.730
goes lower, lower,
lower on the list.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.800
Because, of course, there
are important things

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.602
to take care of.

00:05:44.602 --> 00:05:46.060
And as a mature,
functioning adult,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.360
you have to take the kids
first, the job second.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.580
And so it's this sort
of subtle demotion

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.950
that starts happening
about the relationship.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.280
And I think people try
really hard to work on that.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.510
But what's so tricky about it is
that the emotional relationship

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.900
is something that is
complex, is messy.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.070
Emotions are inconvenient.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.030
You might feel things.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.310
You might feel angry
or sad or disconnected,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.830
and need to actually take
time to talk about that

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.949
and sort it through.

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.740
And that's exactly what
people are missing,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.030
is the time to do it.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.340
So that just takes
its toll over time.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.300
SPEAKER: I imagine too that
things like sleep deprivation

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.380
probably play into it, at least
in my own personal experience.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.140
And things like wanting to
have those conversations,

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.177
but maybe not in front
of the children, right?

00:06:30.177 --> 00:06:31.260
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: Right.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.650
Less time alone, obviously.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.420
Sleep deprivation is
murder for your moods,

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.070
for your sense of resilience.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.820
All your worst qualities
just are totally on display.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.380
So yeah, all of that.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.185
SPEAKER: So then a
once-a-week date night

00:06:46.185 --> 00:06:47.331
will fix it all, right?

00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:49.080
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE:
Yeah, of course, yeah.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.790
Now, one thing I
do tell couples,

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.317
which sounds
incredibly pragmatic,

00:06:52.317 --> 00:06:54.900
but I think it really can help--
part of the problem with date

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.510
night, which I write
about in the book,

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.320
is that what you want
on date night is fun.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.640
You want romance, you want fun.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.390
You want not to be worrying
about the kids' problems

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.270
all the time.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.000
And that can be hard,
because if that's

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.580
that top stress on your mind
and your only time to talk,

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.380
it's like, well, now's the time.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.500
But I recommend that people
decide on a time of the week,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.300
like 8 o'clock Tuesday morning.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.740
That's not when you're
about to try to go to sleep.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.080
That's not when you're
going to try to have sex.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.520
It's not on your date night.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.400
And it's like, let's just
take a minute to check in.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.710
How's the division of labor?

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.501
How are you feeling
about our relationship?

00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:31.740
Just sort of almost
like a meeting.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.860
Because what I find is
so pernicious in couples

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.380
over time, because--

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.120
and this book is really
about this thing, which

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.910
is that our emotional
life is who we are,

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.740
and our relational
life is who we are.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.380
And yet it sort of gets put
on the sidelines, right?

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.200
And so easily in terms
of all our other roles.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.110
And so I think that it can be
very hard to be the person who

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.000
has to bring up
the conversation,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.430
or has to be the person
to say, let's talk.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.440
Some people are
like, ah, no, no,

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.640
I don't want to talk, right?

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.760
So if you know that it's
Tuesday morning at 8:00

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.676
that you're going to
have this back and forth,

00:08:03.676 --> 00:08:05.820
it can take the pressure
off of one person

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.280
to be the initiator
of discussion.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.150
SPEAKER: Or when your spouse
hears, hey, we need to talk,

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.802
that they don't start having a
panic attack because it's bad.

00:08:14.802 --> 00:08:16.260
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE:
Right, exactly.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.670
Everybody knows, 8 o'clock
Tuesday morning, we're

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.162
going to touch base.

00:08:21.162 --> 00:08:22.620
SPEAKER: So you
talked about having

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.610
more resources can actually
contribute to better outcomes.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.080
So then, how can money be
such is such a problem?

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.872
If you have more money,
isn't that better?

00:08:33.872 --> 00:08:35.580
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE:
It's certainly better

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.900
than not having money, right?

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.740
I mean, again, on this sort
of two Americas thing where

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.039
people with education
and economic resources

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.900
are doing better in
terms of their marriage

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.680
than people, that's sort
of the rich get richer,

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.679
and the poor get poorer.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:50.000
That's the America we live in.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.300
So people who are the
poorer and less educated

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.180
part of the demographic tend
to not get married as much,

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.180
not stay married instead of
marrying more often, et cetera.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.320
And obviously, economic stress
is a huge, difficult thing

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.910
when you have it.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.756
But just like everything else,
it reminds me of the fact

00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:10.880
that people come into couple
therapy, and they say,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.370
I can't believe we're fighting
about the toothpaste tube,

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.650
or who takes out the trash.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.190
This is so trivial,
it's so stupid.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.970
Why are we fighting
about these things?

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.060
But of course, life
is those things,

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.370
and it's this constant
navigation of those things.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.710
And money is a
really charged issue,

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:26.960
even if you have a lot of it.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.480
Because I believe the
reason it's a charged issue

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.410
is because it so close to
our primal sense of survival

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.730
and identity.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.310
Especially in this
country, perhaps,

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.930
but how you spend money,
what money you have,

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.870
where you're allocating it is
very close to people's sense

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.320
of who they are.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.914
And so in a marriage, the ideal
picture of marriage in my mind

00:09:46.914 --> 00:09:48.830
is there's one individual,
another individual,

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.670
and together, you
create this thing.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.810
This living, breathing
organism called the marriage.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.160
And so it's not just what do
you want, what do you want?

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.410
Oh, if you get what you want,
I don't get what I want.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.660
It's what does the
marriage need, what

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.850
does the family need,
what do we need together

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.050
to make this thing that
we're creating together?

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.750
And I think money
lends itself to a sort

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.750
of zero-sum mentality, where
people are kind of, if you

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.170
get yours, I won't get mine.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.200
And it breaks down very quickly.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.130
SPEAKER: So are
you of the opinion

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.140
that all marriages can work?

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.600
All marriages can be made
to be good marriages?

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.800
Or are there situations
where you kind of

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.880
need to know when to say when?

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.730
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: So when
I started writing this book,

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.610
I had the hope, I
had the thought,

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:36.009
that if people work
enough on themselves,

00:10:36.009 --> 00:10:37.550
they can work out
their relationship.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.490
Because I felt in my work,
one of the things you run up

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.280
against a lot of times when
a couple's having problems

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.550
is they come in, and each one
wants you to fix their partner

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.380
and make them a better partner.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.210
But it's very, very
hard for people

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.881
to really take
stock of themselves

00:10:51.881 --> 00:10:53.630
and think, what am I
contributing to this?

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:54.920
So part of the work
of a couple therapy

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.420
is you're both creating this.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.460
You're both taking a role.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.420
So I sort of had this
somewhat hopeful, I guess,

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:06.680
idea that if people really
grappled with their own stuff,

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.950
that they can come to the
relationship on a better

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.430
footing, and they will be in far
better position to work it out.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.110
All of which I still agree with.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.040
But I do believe also that some
marriages are, in some sense,

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.430
fatally flawed.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.347
And I think part of what
"The Rough Patch" is

00:11:22.347 --> 00:11:24.430
about-- the book is about,
the thinking is about--

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.160
is how do we figure that out.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.910
SPEAKER: And so taking
stock of yourself

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.290
and personal accountability
for improvement,

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.059
is that what you refer
to in the book as guts?

00:11:35.059 --> 00:11:36.850
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE:
That's an aspect of it.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:41.410
I think people have the illusion
that if the relationship's

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.590
working well, it's
peaceful and serene.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.880
And I don't think that.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.860
I've been married
for 26 years, and I

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.430
would say every day we have some
kind of difficult conversation.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.410
Not necessarily about our
relationship with each other,

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.520
but one about the kids,
or one about something

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.900
we have to solve.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.270
And I talk about
guts because I say

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.980
it's always going to
take courage to have

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.450
the difficult conversations.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.786
The fascinating thing
about being a human,

00:12:06.786 --> 00:12:09.160
and this has really come
through with attachment research

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.290
in the last 30
years, is we never

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.760
get over being
dependent and attached.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.760
It's not OK that my husband
said I love you yesterday,

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.340
or last week, or
said goodbye then.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.640
He has to keep doing it.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.720
In other words, you keep have
to feel that the person keeps

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.410
turning toward
you and giving you

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.370
appreciation, and gratitude,
and affection, and warmth.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:31.900
That's never done.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.947
And so I sort of
feel like, similarly,

00:12:33.947 --> 00:12:35.530
the hard conversations
are never done.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.610
If you're trying to
get through life,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.010
if you're trying to figure
out are we going to retire,

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:43.610
what's our budget like, are
we drinking too much, how's

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:45.280
our sex life, all
these things are not

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.500
going to be easy to talk about.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.010
They're actually
vulnerable to talk about.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.330
And I sort of want to help
people shift their paradigm.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.205
It's a good day for you
if they have the guts

00:12:55.205 --> 00:12:57.330
to talk about the hard things.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.120
SPEAKER: And so you
have part in the book

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.500
that you talk
about where you say

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.880
that you need to get a life.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.050
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: Mm-hmm.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:03.990
SPEAKER: Can you explain?

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.031
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: Yeah.

00:13:05.031 --> 00:13:11.180
So this book is about how do
you have a close relationship

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.720
over a long life.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.017
And I think sometimes people
have the notion that in order

00:13:17.017 --> 00:13:19.100
to get along with another
person over a long time,

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.810
you sort of have to
suppress yourself,

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.660
or somehow just adapt yourself.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.550
And I really believe
that it's only

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:30.140
going to work if you feel you
can keep developing and growing

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.990
as an individual,
that you bring more

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.060
and more into the partnership.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.594
And I think sometimes
people feel--

00:13:36.594 --> 00:13:38.260
I was just talking
to a friend yesterday

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.270
whose husband is a doctor,
and he had all this training.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.770
And the whole family
life was really

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:46.010
geared around his life
and his profession.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.690
And she said, it's
been so hard for me

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.940
to sort of step out
of that and realize

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:54.830
I need to start having a
voice and assert what I want.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.539
And we're always
trying to balance that.

00:13:56.539 --> 00:13:57.830
How much we have to compromise?

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.500
How much do we have to
suppress in order to get along?

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.750
But I really think,
over the long haul,

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.300
suppressing yourself isn't
going to do the trick.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.690
You have to be developing
yourself and evolving yourself.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.710
And maybe that's going to mean
saying, look, I'm changing.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.480
And the way it was 10 or 20
years ago or five years ago

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.130
isn't going to work for me.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.630
Sometimes people
get upset that they

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.580
feel their spouse has
changed the contract on them,

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.246
and we agreed under
these circumstances.

00:14:21.246 --> 00:14:23.230
And now, how can you
suddenly want this?

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.690
And in my view, it's like,
of course that happens.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:26.600
Time's passing.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.050
You're growing, you're changing.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.440
And so my idea of
get a life is you

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.080
have to sort of bring a
lot of yourself to this,

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.940
and you have to keep
developing yourself.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.770
And that can always be a
kind of messy balancing act.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.640
SPEAKER: And so the old
adage about how marriages

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.290
work, and it takes work
to make a marriage.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.599
You kind of challenge the idea
of what "work" means in that.

00:14:48.599 --> 00:14:49.640
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: Yeah.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.848
SPEAKER: Can you describe it?

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:54.689
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: So there
is this idea marriage is work,

00:14:54.689 --> 00:14:55.980
and everybody rolls their eyes.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.660
It's like, ugh.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.000
What I see as the
work of marriage

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.380
is being open and
emotionally vulnerable.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.210
That's the work.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:09.430
It's hard to show up every day
and be honest, and say where

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:10.930
you're at, and
express your feelings

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.280
and communicate about them.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.200
And I happen to
believe that it's not

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.940
a tenable stance in
a marriage to say,

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.770
I don't like to
talk about feelings.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.199
Basically, you may not like
to talk about feelings.

00:15:20.199 --> 00:15:22.740
You may be a person who finds
it hard to talk about feelings.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.500
It may be that you feel you're
a person who's not an expert yet

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.360
at talking about your feelings.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:32.810
But the job, the work, is
to cultivate the ability

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.530
to know how you feel,
and to express it.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.690
And that's not easy.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.440
And every day, you
wake up, and it's like,

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.960
gee, the easy thing to do
would be to watch my shows,

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.050
and get on my phone, and go
work out, and not really deal

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.357
with this other complicated
person who wants things

00:15:46.357 --> 00:15:48.940
from me, and I want things from,
and I can't really figure out

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.570
how to get along with.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.330
Your job is to go
like, no, my job is

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.409
to keep trying to turn
toward this person,

00:15:54.409 --> 00:15:56.200
keep trying to figure
out the relationship,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.780
keep trying to be close.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.140
That's not easy.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.110
SPEAKER: How do things like
communication differences

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.200
in style and things--

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.330
one example being that
somebody may simply

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.510
be wanting to talk about what
they're thinking or feeling,

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.310
and the other person
thinks they're being

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:16.560
asked to solve the problem.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.420
How do you overcome
those kinds of things

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.295
in that work to stay open?

00:16:25.295 --> 00:16:27.670
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: Well, so
it's a complicated question.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.160
But I'll just say one thing
about it, which is in, I think,

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.550
chapter 3 or 4 of the book.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.860
I use this phrase called
feeling with and thinking about.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.081
And it comes out of
a whole tradition

00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:40.330
of psychological research
that you can read more about

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.737
if you're interested.

00:16:41.737 --> 00:16:43.570
But basically, we've
all had that experience

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.870
of being in a couple situation,
and one person coming home,

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.520
just trying to pour
out their feelings

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.780
and talk about what
happened, and sort

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:50.670
of process their emotion.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.590
The other one saying, well,
let me roll up my sleeves

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:53.920
and help you solve the problem.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.150
And then the first
person is like, I don't

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.358
want you to solve my problem.

00:16:56.358 --> 00:16:58.390
I just want you to listen to me.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:01.180
So I believe that in
a loving relationship,

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.890
if you look at
emotional communication,

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.849
it has two parts.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:08.810
It has you feel with the person,
and you think about the person.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.920
And so you both have the
experience of saying,

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.310
oh, I'm listening to you.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.520
I'm trying to
understand how you feel.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.220
I'm trying to
empathize with you.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.990
Or you had a
horrible day, and I'm

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.599
trying to listen
and support you.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.845
And then there's-- let
me think about you.

00:17:24.845 --> 00:17:27.220
Let me think about the problem,
let me help you solve it.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.428
Do you want to help solve it?

00:17:28.428 --> 00:17:30.730
And sometimes
couples break down.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.200
Sometimes it's
along gender lines,

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.574
sometimes the
roles are reversed.

00:17:33.574 --> 00:17:36.740
But basically, it's like
one person's fixing,

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.070
and the other person's
just wanting empathy.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.190
So I think everyone should
be cultivating the ability

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.110
to both feel with
and think about.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:48.670
And love is expressed
through that combination.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.680
SPEAKER: So if you
could give everyone

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.070
one thing to either go back
and think about or practice

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:59.180
at home tonight, what
would that first step be?

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.530
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE:
OK, so I think

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.650
there's two things that
are kind of, in my mind,

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:07.570
the wonder drug of marriage.

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.640
Basically, you can
take two relationships

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.580
that are identical in all
their different problems

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.720
and dysfunctions.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:18.860
But if in one situation the
partners are able to say,

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:23.726
I'm aware of my part in this,
and I'm trying to change.

00:18:23.726 --> 00:18:25.600
So in other words, what
I call it in the book

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.460
is self-awareness and
self-responsibility.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.940
So what I mean by
that is, if you

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:35.050
can look at what you're doing
together and really say,

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.240
I know I have a part in this.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.000
I'm trying to understand
what I'm doing,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.310
and I'm sorry if it
bothers you or whatever,

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.680
and I'm trying to change.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.090
That is the key element.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.860
Everything else can be equal.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.520
But if people can do that, if
they can look at themselves

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.290
and take account
of their behavior,

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:54.910
and then be
responsible about it,

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.400
no matter what
they're doing, that

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.010
is just the critical
difference that gives people

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.540
hope or hopelessness.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.810
If you're married to a person
where the story always is,

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.760
it's your fault
that I'm doing this.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.520
If you would just change,
I would be different.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:14.180
That creates a very corrosive,
toxic, hopeless atmosphere.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.200
So that's the one
thing I would say.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.300
SPEAKER: OK, you have
your marching orders.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.310
We are going to take questions.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:24.700
Because we are recording
this, please make sure

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.380
that you make your
way to the microphone

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.920
if you would like to
ask questions today.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.420
I'll talk about one
more thing here,

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.910
and then we'll go ahead and
take questions from the mic.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.240
I keep waiting for
the age of my children

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.898
to arrive where it gets easier.

00:19:40.898 --> 00:19:43.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.740
Yeah, OK.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.837
And what I get is
this kind of reaction,

00:19:47.837 --> 00:19:49.670
especially from people
whose kids are older.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.410
They're like, no, it's not
easier, it's just different.

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:57.960
And so navigating those
changes over the years,

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.140
the medication's got
to evolve too, right?

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:00.560
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE:
Well, it reminds

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.820
me of when you have
really little kids.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.444
You're like, someday
this will be over.

00:20:03.444 --> 00:20:05.509
They'll be in school.

00:20:05.509 --> 00:20:06.800
SPEAKER: That's what I thought.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.560
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: My
kids are 25, 21, and 19.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.370
And every day, we're
worrying about something.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.340
And every day, we're having our
conversations about what should

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:16.980
we do about it.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:17.480
Swearsies.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.370
So it doesn't ever go away.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.830
But there's a
gratification in actually

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.120
being able to talk in a
productive and collaborative

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:24.620
way.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.510
That's kind of the hope, right?

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.690
So yeah, the physical
exhaustion, I would say,

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:30.230
changes.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.686
But there's always something.

00:20:31.686 --> 00:20:32.810
The stakes only get higher.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.210
Now we're worrying about,
can they support themselves,

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.860
and will they find
happiness and love?

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.117
SPEAKER: Or we're worrying about
our parents and the decline

00:20:41.117 --> 00:20:42.200
that happens there, right?

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.170
So you get out of one
situation, and you

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.982
start to take on another.

00:20:46.982 --> 00:20:48.440
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE:
And one thing I

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.439
say, because I have a
chapter on the empty nest,

00:20:50.439 --> 00:20:52.760
which I've just become one of.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.442
And I say it's OK
to be a beginner.

00:20:56.442 --> 00:20:58.400
When you first have a
child, you're a beginner.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.320
When you first have no kids
at home, you're a beginner.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.190
Like, what do we want now?

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.760
Who are we?

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.900
What are we doing?

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.640
I think sometimes we
feel, by that age,

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.440
we should know what's going on.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.640
And I think life's
not like that.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.610
You're always learning.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.210
SPEAKER: Are there any
additional considerations

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:18.930
or tips for when you go through
really big life changes?

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.830
Whether it's a change
in career, or you're

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:25.660
moving to a completely different
place, or you've lost a parent?

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:32.180
The big, big life changes
where one or the other partner

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.180
may not be on their best.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.520
So what other things
can people throw in

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.771
to help through those patches?

00:21:39.771 --> 00:21:42.061
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: I think
there's a couple of things.

00:21:42.061 --> 00:21:44.510
I think one is to keep
reaching out toward each other,

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.609
but to respect what
the other person needs.

00:21:46.609 --> 00:21:48.650
And that can be hard
sometimes, because sometimes

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.690
if your partner has
gone through something,

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.430
they're very absorbed,
and they're not

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.130
that available to you, and
you feel kind of deprived.

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:59.060
But part of the thing is
to keep offering support.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.590
The other is to sort
of accept that--

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:06.030
I talk about this with the
metaphor, the golden ring.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.850
But the point is that you're
standing next to each other,

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.840
looking at life, and trying
to help each other through.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.470
And there are going
to be these things.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.587
And so to be able to just accept
that there are going to times

00:22:16.587 --> 00:22:18.920
when you're not available to
each other, when one of you

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:23.240
is terribly sad, end and to
sort of understand that that's

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:27.050
kind of part of the deal.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.320
But I do want to say,
and I talk about this,

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.120
and I have a chapter called
Lovesickness and Longing

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.480
about people who sort of have
these very absorbing crushes,

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.820
even if they're happily married.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.260
And one of the
things I've noticed

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.857
about that in my own clinical
work-- it's anecdotal,

00:22:41.857 --> 00:22:43.940
but I'm really interested
in studying it further--

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.310
is I think when people
go through a big loss

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.670
of some kind, maybe lost a
parent, maybe lost a job,

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:51.680
maybe their child
has a big problem,

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.230
it depletes son and sort
of hollows them out.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.900
And sometimes then
they will they

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.660
try to grab something in the
world that will excite them,

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.220
that will distract them.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.010
And so I think also just to
know your own vulnerability

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.140
and the vulnerability
of your partner

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.840
when you're going through
something very devastating.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.487
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:23:10.487 --> 00:23:11.497
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: Hi.

00:23:11.497 --> 00:23:13.330
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any advice or thoughts

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.430
on being in a relationship
with someone who

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:19.230
has either significantly less
or orders of magnitude more

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.430
income and wealth?

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.170
And I'm asking for a friend.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.122
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:24.122 --> 00:23:26.080
SPEAKER: I suspect there
will be a lot of that.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:32.350
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: Wow,
that is so interesting.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:34.630
In my own experience,
you realize

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:37.150
in adult life you often
end up around people

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.300
about your level of wealth,
because it's not uncomfortable.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:44.255
You sort of know what
everybody can do.

00:23:44.255 --> 00:23:46.630
But my best friend from high
school is extremely wealthy.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.449
And so that's sort of my
only real-- it's fascinating.

00:23:49.449 --> 00:23:50.990
I haven't given much
thought to that.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:52.960
I mean, can you
say anything else

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.965
specific about the struggle
or the difficulty there?

00:23:56.965 --> 00:23:58.893
AUDIENCE: Er.

00:23:58.893 --> 00:24:00.934
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: Do
you want me to make it up?

00:24:00.934 --> 00:24:03.169
AUDIENCE: I'm going to
go sit down, actually.

00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:04.460
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: I mean, OK.

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.500
So one thing I could
imagine coming up,

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.630
which comes up with my
friend, is she's like, hey,

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:09.770
let's have a spa weekend.

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.670
Well, I can't afford
the spa weekend.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.630
So it's like, are you paying?

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:18.460
And then in a couple, I would
imagine, they're sort of like--

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.870
what are the feelings around
one person having all this money

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:27.080
that they can sort of fund
things that can't be equitable,

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:27.580
right?

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:31.100
Now, what I do and my friend is
she gets this huge spa weekend,

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.680
then I buy the pizza
on the way to the spa.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.130
So I guess there's going
to be some discussion.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.320
Money is obviously a
huge, hot-button issue,

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.030
and there's a whole
50-page chapter on it.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.220
But there's got to be
some discussion of what

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.590
the understanding
is there, I think,

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:50.320
because I think this
stuff's so complicated

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.320
to talk about, we're all so
bad at talking about money,

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.680
that I think the main
advice I would have is make

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.490
it an explicit conversation.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.492
Now, that doesn't mean
everybody is going

00:25:00.492 --> 00:25:02.950
to know what their feelings
are, because it's an incredibly

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:06.100
confused area for people,
and very conflicted,

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.490
and very complicated.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:09.310
But at least to
be having the sort

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:13.090
of conscious, explicit
conversations of,

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:14.620
you have this, I have that.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.780
How are we going to do this
so everyone feels fair?

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.320
I'll just say one other thing.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.710
I think one of the very
most important things

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:24.670
in a long-term relationship is
a sense of fairness and justice.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.490
And if people start
feeling that's not working,

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:29.337
it's very corrosive to the bond.

00:25:29.337 --> 00:25:31.420
So I think you have to try
to understand what does

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.580
the money mean to each person.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.390
To what extent do they feel
you're kind of freeloading?

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.660
Even if they don't want to
feel that, they kind of do.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.050
Try to really get all of
this stuff out on the table

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:45.670
so you can be conscious
about the agreements

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:46.570
that you're making.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.134
I think that would
be really useful.

00:25:49.134 --> 00:25:50.550
AUDIENCE: Would
you happen to have

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:53.670
any advice for choosing a
partner in the first place

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:58.002
so that when problems do appear,
they're easier to work through?

00:25:58.002 --> 00:25:59.460
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE:
Great question.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.334
I feel like my next
book, because my kids are

00:26:01.334 --> 00:26:04.080
kind of getting to be
that age, is like, how

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.397
to choose a good partner.

00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:07.980
Of course, my kids don't want
to hear from me about it, right?

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:14.390
I would say that the
most important thing--

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.170
I don't think it's
shared interests,

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:19.670
because actually you can bring
a lot of different interests.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.120
And it's important to have
your own interests anyway.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.410
I think sometimes people
think, well, we've

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:24.950
checked all the boxes on all
these compatibility things.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:28.130
And I think that's beside
the point, actually.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:31.072
I think it's about
emotional communication.

00:26:31.072 --> 00:26:32.780
Obviously, it's about
the obvious things.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.450
Attraction, and that you
find them fun and like being

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:37.601
around them, whatever.

00:26:37.601 --> 00:26:40.100
Good if there's not a ton of
mental illness in their family,

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.540
just on a purely generic level.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:47.630
But I would say that it's
about whether this person is

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:49.799
able to talk through problems.

00:26:49.799 --> 00:26:52.340
And I wouldn't get married till
you've had some opportunities

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.381
to talk through problems.

00:26:53.381 --> 00:26:56.050
Weddings are great opportunities
to talk through problems.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:57.860
Just be willing to
like bag it if you

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:00.410
can't get through the problems.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.810
But I think sometimes
people get together

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:08.150
with highly emotional, dramatic
people who sort of excite

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:10.490
them and activate
them, only to find out

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:14.220
later the person is a
total piece of work,

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.760
can't regulate their
emotions to save their life,

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.460
and is driving them
completely nuts.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.110
So I would try to
really look at,

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.090
can this person
manage their emotions

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:26.990
and talk to me in any sort
of reasonable way about what

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.830
they feel?

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:28.950
And can I do the same?

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:31.160
So volatility, I think,
is something to avoid.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.930
Addictions are
something to avoid.

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:36.230
I could go on and on, but
that would be my main advice.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.060
AUDIENCE: So if you
have a couple where

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.400
both parties have a
tremendous amount in common

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.640
and just do everything
together, but then later on they

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.270
realize they do need to get a
life and sort of like cultivate

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.820
themselves, what do you
think a good framework

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.860
for that discussion would be?

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.780
How would the
couple find the ways

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.050
in which they can and
should develop themselves

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.330
in individual ways?

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:03.160
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE:
So that's interesting.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.990
I'm getting a feeling that that
question might have within it

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:11.920
something like one of the
people is feeling a little bit

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.204
of a need for more of that.

00:28:13.204 --> 00:28:14.620
Because if both
people are feeling

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.450
like we just love doing
everything together

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:20.170
and have only shared
interests, I can't really

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:21.850
say that's a problem.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:26.060
Life will introduce
difference over time.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:26.630
It just will.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:27.930
You might have different
parenting styles.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:29.780
You might have different things
you like to do with the kids.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.105
You might have different
families in different places

00:28:32.105 --> 00:28:32.980
that you're visiting.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:33.855
It will introduce it.

00:28:33.855 --> 00:28:35.790
But say you're in
the early courtship.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:37.540
You've been together
a while, and you just

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.831
love doing everything together.

00:28:38.831 --> 00:28:39.740
That sounds great.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.410
I think it's probably
more, though, when

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:44.230
one person is realizing it's
a little claustrophobic here.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.210
It's a little too
much like this.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:49.120
I need to have more outside.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.400
And I think people in
certain relationships

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.220
feel very threatened
by individuality.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.132
And I think that's
something to really take on.

00:28:57.132 --> 00:28:59.590
I don't think it's a tenable
position in a long-term couple

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:02.080
to be like, you can't go
out with your friends,

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.240
or you can't go--

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.150
that's a problem.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:11.710
It's important to hold a
space for something like,

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.400
I love doing
everything together.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.980
We're incredibly compatible.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.980
But sometimes I feel I just
want to get out and do stuff

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.960
with so-and-so, or go do this.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.480
And I want that
to be OK with us.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.836
I don't want it to feel unsafe.

00:29:23.836 --> 00:29:25.210
I don't want it
to feel insecure.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:26.860
I don't want you
to be too anxious.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.050
Anxiety is a huge
thing in relationships.

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.610
And part of
relationships is working

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:32.440
through why you're
anxious, what can I

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.760
do to make you less anxious.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.490
But claustrophobia and
having to always be together

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:40.695
is usually, over the
long haul, a problem.

00:29:40.695 --> 00:29:42.820
So if I were the person
who was feeling like I just

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.530
want a little more
elbow room here,

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:46.870
I would just try to
introduce it as, I

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.120
think it would be really
healthy for our relationship.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.203
Hey, let's read this book.

00:29:50.203 --> 00:29:52.390
It says it would be healthy
for our relationship

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.000
to have a few things that
we do alone, just to have

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.500
more interests and more--

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.580
because as life goes
on, I see couples

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.580
who are in the middle of
life, and they're like,

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.920
our life's really boring
and understimulating.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.370
Because I feel like my spouse
doesn't have any interests,

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.495
or they're always sort of
watching TV, or whatever.

00:30:07.495 --> 00:30:09.730
So just talk about it
in terms of the benefit

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:13.120
to the relationship of bringing
more stuff in, I think,

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.449
might help.

00:30:14.449 --> 00:30:14.990
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.620
I was wondering if you could
speak to living together

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.330
before marriage a little bit.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.030
I'm in this situation where a
lot of my friends and people

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:24.775
I know who are in their
mid 20s out in Seattle,

00:30:24.775 --> 00:30:28.235
they see living together before
marriage as a good trial period

00:30:28.235 --> 00:30:29.860
to see what it's
going to be like to be

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.830
with this person for
the rest of your life.

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:36.220
But then, on the other side,
I have my parents and people

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.920
their age who say,
no, you can't do that,

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.160
because living together without
a bigger sense of commitment

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.820
just makes it too easy to
run away at the earliest

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.080
sign of trouble.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.630
So I was wondering what
your thoughts were on that.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.100
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.800
And I think the research on that
is kind of all over the map,

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.580
so I'm just going to
talk from my own gut,

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:58.770
kind of, about this.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:05.060
I think that living
together will confront you

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:10.040
with the problems of
living, like someone said.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.750
You'll have to work stuff out.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.520
And that can actually
help you figure out,

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.900
can we work stuff out, right?

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.040
So that's on the plus side.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.890
I think that on the
negative side is I--

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:25.700
now, at my age, looking back,
because some of my friends are

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.630
divorced, some aren't.

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.580
It does seem to me
that people kind of who

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:31.400
backed into relationships,
who weren't really

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.129
wild about this
person, who maybe felt

00:31:33.129 --> 00:31:35.420
persuaded by the other person,
oh, let's live together.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:36.503
We're not really marrying.

00:31:36.503 --> 00:31:38.390
It's just a step to where--

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:41.900
if in your heart, you
don't feel like I really

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.270
want to be in this,
to live together

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:47.240
to see if you might then
be more in love, I think,

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.710
is a bad plan.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:50.985
Because once your
lives are merged,

00:31:50.985 --> 00:31:53.360
and then we bought furniture
together, and we have a dog,

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.270
it's so hard to ever really
see things clearly and say,

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:00.350
well, I got into this in a
sort of half-hearted way.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.430
And now, how am I going
to possibly get out?

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:06.875
So I think it takes a real
reckoning with yourself.

00:32:06.875 --> 00:32:08.610
Am I in love with this person?

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:10.730
Do I really want to
be with this person?

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.770
They may want to be with me more
than I want to be with them.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.270
I've got to be truthful
about that now,

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.186
because it's going to
be way harder to get out

00:32:16.186 --> 00:32:17.370
of it in five years.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:21.050
So I think the parents
are thinking that way.

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:22.950
Whether you have a
marriage contract,

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:25.560
have a license, in
my mind, who cares.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.980
But if your emotional
feeling is not

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:32.750
that this is really the one,
I think it can be very costly.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:35.360
And more costly to women, just
in terms of biological clock,

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.940
frankly.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.590
My daughter I would
be more worried

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:42.630
about moving in with someone
than my son, probably.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:50.100
AUDIENCE: Should couples strive
for happiness or contentment

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.712
as individuals?

00:32:51.712 --> 00:32:53.299
That was kind of
vague, so I don't

00:32:53.299 --> 00:32:54.840
know if there's
really a distinction,

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:55.930
or it's just semantics.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:56.920
What do you think?

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.340
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE:
Well, so, wait,

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.510
when you say as individuals,
what does that mean?

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:02.886
AUDIENCE: I mean like,
I'm happy, I'm content.

00:33:02.886 --> 00:33:04.010
She's happy, she's content.

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:05.857
We're good.

00:33:05.857 --> 00:33:07.065
Is there a distinction there?

00:33:09.519 --> 00:33:11.310
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE:
You mean like, if we're

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:13.800
content with each
other, is that enough?

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.210
Is that what you're saying?

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:18.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah, content with
our relationship, or our family,

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:21.017
or just happy about
the relationship.

00:33:21.017 --> 00:33:22.350
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: Well, right.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:23.910
So this is so
fascinating, right?

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.560
Because we live in
this culture where

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.410
there's so much written
about being happy,

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:31.290
and there's sort of this
standard, like are you happy.

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:33.090
And then you feel like
you're falling short

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:35.820
if you just actually have
a calm, happy, [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:39.625
pleasant sane life.

00:33:39.625 --> 00:33:41.890
Again, I'd almost say
it's similar to my answer

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:47.710
to the other person in terms of
do you feel something's missing

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.280
in some subjective sense.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:54.880
I think some people are just
much calmer, much happier, much

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.740
more contented in a
domestic arrangement

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.120
where they get along.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:04.510
And they appreciate that, and
they feel satisfied with that.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:07.510
And other people need
a lot of excitement.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.190
And it's sort of
knowing itself seems

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:11.139
to be the important
thing in terms

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:13.120
of what do I need in my life.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.000
I have a friend whose son
just got married very young.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.167
And basically, they
both just love nesting.

00:34:18.167 --> 00:34:19.000
That's who they are.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.050
They like a home.

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:21.469
They like being home together.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:25.080
They like buying little
rugs and couches,

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.080
and that's who they are.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.850
Other people would be like,
oh, I couldn't stand that.

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:30.000
I need to hike Mount
Everest or whatever.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.219
So it really kind of depends
too on how you're made,

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:35.260
and how you're made together.

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.480
Hi.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.460
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:44.889
So while people are
dating, me or my friends

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:47.968
like to say comments on--
well, they're dating,

00:34:47.968 --> 00:34:49.509
and say, oh, they're
totally for you.

00:34:49.509 --> 00:34:50.800
Or like, no, they're no good.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.000
You should totally
date somebody else.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.210
But once they're
married, you sort of

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:56.840
don't have that kind
of conversation,

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.450
maybe because we're supposed
to forever hold our silence,

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:02.910
because we didn't
say anything thing.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:05.580
Do you think that is OK?

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:09.130
Is that beneficial to just,
now that they're married,

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:10.320
just let them be?

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.960
Or if you do notice
something, I'll

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.300
be OK with them talking about
that spouse behind the back?

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.800
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE:
Wait, so are you

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.002
saying should you say something
to the friend about her spouse,

00:35:21.002 --> 00:35:22.710
or should the friend
say something to you

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:23.418
about her spouse?

00:35:23.418 --> 00:35:25.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
should we as friends

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:30.000
have a conversation at all
about other people's spouse?

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.520
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: Right.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.970
So this is really interesting.

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:37.550
So I'm of the view that if
you have a close friend,

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:41.420
and you really have questions
about who they're with,

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.650
that you should talk
to them about it.

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:45.650
So we're talking before
they get married, right?

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:46.941
Before they make that decision?

00:35:46.941 --> 00:35:48.080
I believe that.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:54.090
Because I think who else is
necessarily going to say it?

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:57.300
And you know them, and you may
see something they don't see.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.880
And in fact, I just
read a book that's

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.580
sort of about people who've been
married for a very long time,

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.520
and what advice they
give for younger people.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.220
And one of the things they say
is, if your friends or family

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:11.800
are expressing doubts about
your partner, listen to them.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.030
And the idea there is
that you may have--

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:17.040
because you're in
love or whatever,

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.200
you don't have as clear
a picture as they do.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.410
And so the people you
trust, you should listen to.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:24.900
And I thought that was
really good advice.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.230
But I do think, and I talk
about this in my class

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.650
with these couples who are
having their first baby--

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:34.050
part of the issue when
you make a family,

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.620
and the little unit of
the couple and the child,

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.840
is you have to create a
certain boundary around that.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.900
You have to have a
filter for the in-laws

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.160
and everybody else
weighing in, right?

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:50.280
And I do think it's
probably risky to a marriage

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.860
to feel like you have a closer
channel with your girlfriends

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.970
than your spouse, just in
terms of that family structure

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:58.320
and building something.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.356
It can be a problem unto
itself if every time you're

00:37:01.356 --> 00:37:02.730
having a fight
with your husband,

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:04.604
you're telling your best
girlfriend about it.

00:37:04.604 --> 00:37:07.710
That doesn't create
trust with your husband.

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.860
But I think it's a really tricky
thing to navigate that shift,

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:11.617
right?

00:37:11.617 --> 00:37:13.950
I mean, basically, it seems
to me when your friend says,

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:17.610
we decided to get married,
I would think it's time

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.470
to just stop weighing in.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:23.262
But I would be inclined
also not to then continue

00:37:23.262 --> 00:37:24.720
to have the same
kind of girlfriend

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:29.370
relationship about every
complaint she has about him.

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:33.427
I just think that's a
dividing line, in my mind.

00:37:33.427 --> 00:37:35.010
AUDIENCE: One of
your earlier comments

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:37.490
around if there's that
one thing we take away.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:39.480
And it was basically
like, self-awareness

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:43.770
was the thing that kind of
sets relationships apart.

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:48.630
And I guess my question is, what
happens when one partner brings

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:52.230
something up, and the other
person doesn't acknowledge it

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.987
as a problem?

00:37:52.987 --> 00:37:54.320
So I have two specific examples.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.111
So one, I don't know
if you've ever heard--

00:37:56.111 --> 00:38:00.030
there's like a "New Yorker"
Harper's article on emotional

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.510
labor about how--

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.310
not to stereotype, but
like a lot of women

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:07.770
take on a lot of
planning for the family,

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:11.460
or doing certain little things,
or cleaning up a little bit.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.620
And then a lot of
times, their spouses

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.240
don't consider those important,
so they don't consider it

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.930
something they need to do.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.410
And another example,
I have some friends

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:22.890
that are having issues
with their in-laws.

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:26.730
So they have different opinions,
and they look to their husbands

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:27.540
for support.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.873
And they don't get it, because
the husbands don't see it

00:38:29.873 --> 00:38:30.640
as a problem.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.910
So I guess
self-awareness is there,

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.690
but how do you address
if you don't even

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:36.787
see something as an issue?

00:38:36.787 --> 00:38:37.870
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: Right.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:38.740
No, it's huge.

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.790
Those are both really,
really common things,

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:43.440
and really important things.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.296
And not easy, obviously.

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:53.460
So I think I want to try to
answer it from two angles.

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:57.101
These are deeply
emotional issues,

00:38:57.101 --> 00:38:58.350
division of labor and in-laws.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.790
Sometimes when we don't
see eye to eye on them,

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:06.180
we try to just manage
our own feelings,

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:10.890
maybe suppress them, not voice
them, work around it, whatever.

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:13.110
But we come to a
point where we feel so

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:18.730
challenged by it that we might
express it in a very strong,

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.460
maybe negative way.

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:24.600
At which point the
partner is reacting

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:28.350
purely to the negativity,
and just then minimizes.

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:30.510
Basically, I see the
partner just trying

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:31.880
to survive emotionally.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.575
Sort of like, tries
to shut you down,

00:39:33.575 --> 00:39:35.700
because it's like, oh,
that's not a problem, that's

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:36.003
not a problem.

00:39:36.003 --> 00:39:37.544
Which is basically
like, I don't want

00:39:37.544 --> 00:39:40.440
to feel all the awful feelings
that talking about this

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.760
has created.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.397
And then that person shuts
down, and then the other person

00:39:44.397 --> 00:39:46.230
starts getting more
reactive and more upset.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:49.110
So I just want to differentiate
the actual problem, which

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.210
are real problems
that need solutions,

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:55.034
from the process that gets
going when you can't find

00:39:55.034 --> 00:39:56.700
common ground, or you
just feel like you

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:57.908
keep butting up against wall.

00:39:57.908 --> 00:40:01.050
And what I'd like to suggest is
that, especially in these very

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:06.612
emotionally loaded issues,
you feel unapologetic

00:40:06.612 --> 00:40:08.070
for your stance
and your emotions--

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:10.620
namely, in these
cases, it actually

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:13.110
is an unfair division
of emotional labor.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.140
Or we're a family
unit now, and we

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.910
need to figure out a
functional way for us

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:20.310
to stand up to the in-laws.

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:25.140
Those are legitimate issues
that a person has every right

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.700
to demand a solution to.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:30.990
And to keep that in
mind enough to say,

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:36.240
this is an issue that we need
to have as neutral as possible

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.200
a discussion on.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.990
In other words, it's not all
about my reactivity to you.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:45.180
It's about this isn't fair,
or this isn't working.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.610
And then to go from
that, because really

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:49.800
what happens often is when
we're highly emotional,

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.591
the other person shuts
down because they're

00:40:51.591 --> 00:40:53.160
reacting to our emotion.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.920
So I feel like you have
to keep advocating,

00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.600
keep bringing it to the table,
not be willing to be shut down

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.090
by, oh, this is just
you being emotional,

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:05.700
or you have a special
problem with my mother.

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:09.300
But just keep being the
rational, fair-minded person

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.652
that you are at work
to solve this problem.

00:41:11.652 --> 00:41:13.860
And I think people don't
always think of it that way,

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:17.200
because it seems so
denuded of the emotion.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.000
But I think that's actually--

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.850
Gottman, again, from
Washington, talks

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:23.730
about being as
neutral as possible

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:26.484
in talking about highly
emotional issues is key.

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:27.900
And I think what
happens sometimes

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:31.440
in these situations is people
are trying to emotionally

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.050
survive, so they start blaming
the other person for how they

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:36.660
feel, and minimizing.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.600
And what's so hard and
challenging in that moment is

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.760
to say, I'm going to hold on.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.730
I'm going to hold on
to my point of view.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.050
I'm going to continue to
assert it in a calm way,

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:48.000
and I'm not going to
give up on this until we

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.920
come to a workable solution.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.380
That takes fortitude, it takes
courage, it takes energy,

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:53.560
it takes all sorts of stuff.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.761
But that's the basic stance,
I think, is important.

00:41:55.761 --> 00:41:57.510
And I also think I
said this, but I'm just

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:58.530
going to say it again.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:00.510
I don't believe it's
a tenable position

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:03.349
in a long-term marriage to say,
I don't want to talk about it.

00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:05.140
You have to learn how
to talk about things.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.723
And it's not OK for
the person saying,

00:42:06.723 --> 00:42:08.520
why are you always
harping on this?

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.920
I do plenty around
here, or whatever it is.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:15.090
That's not going to be the
end of that conversation.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:18.044
You have to say, no,
it's a problem for me.

00:42:18.044 --> 00:42:19.460
One thing I talk
about in my class

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:25.410
with the parents of babies to
be is you're the grownups now.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:27.270
There's no parent
out there deciding

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:29.395
what's right and wrong,
and which sibling is right.

00:42:29.395 --> 00:42:31.228
When you're a kid it's
like, you started it.

00:42:31.228 --> 00:42:31.900
No, you started.

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.233
Oh, I don't care who started it.

00:42:33.233 --> 00:42:35.610
You go to your room.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:37.260
People can sometimes
have these sort

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.300
of sibling-esque kind
of ideas about there's

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.450
some right or wrong on high
that could be handed down.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:46.230
All the marriage is about
is caring about each other,

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.070
and caring about each
other's feelings.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:50.111
So if someone's minimizing
your feelings, saying,

00:42:50.111 --> 00:42:52.170
well, I don't feel that
way, so it's not real,

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:55.959
that's not a stance
that is going to work

00:42:55.959 --> 00:42:57.000
for you in the long haul.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.860
The stance is, oh, I
don't see it that way.

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.660
I don't see my
mother as a problem.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:02.820
But you do.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.580
So let's try to figure this out
so that you're not suffering,

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.010
because you're my wife,
and I care about you.

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:11.334
That's where you're
trying to go here.

00:43:11.334 --> 00:43:12.750
SPEAKER: So thank
you so, so much.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:14.350
We greatly appreciate
your coming today.

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:16.475
DAPHNE DE MARNEFFE: Thank
you very much for coming.

00:43:16.475 --> 00:43:19.280
