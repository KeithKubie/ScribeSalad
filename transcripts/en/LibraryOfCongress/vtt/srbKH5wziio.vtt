00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.440
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Again,
my name is Steve Winick.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.080
I'm the editor here at the
American Folklife Center.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.820
Actually my job title is
writer/editor and that comes

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.410
into play in the next thing
that I'm going to introduce,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.350 position:56%
which is the new edition of Folklife
and Fieldwork, which I think many

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.460
of you have been handed
out on your way in.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.360
If you haven't, just
wave to a staff member

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.900
and someone will approach
you and hand you a copy.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.720
But this is our fieldwork
manual and it has been

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.170
around for a good long time.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.100
And in fact, the first
edition of Folklife

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.690 position:56%
and Fieldwork was published in 1979.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.220
And the author of that book was
Peter Bartis, who we are very lucky

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.900
to still have on the staff of the
American Folklife Center today.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.340
And Peter and I were the co-authors
of this new version of the book.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.630 position:56%
And so, I just want to talk a little
bit about what's new in the book,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.210
and also talk a little
bit about the history.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.540
I think one of the nice things
about Peter and I being able

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.250
to collaborate on this is that
Peter was kind of an early student

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.360
and I was kind of a later student
of a man named Kenny Goldstein.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.040 position:56%
And Kenny Goldstein's dissertation
was called "A Guide for Fieldworkers

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.570
in Folklore", which
he then published

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.520
through his own publishing company
and it was the fieldwork guide

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.070
in folklore for years until, you
know, the sort of reflexivity

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.750 position:56%
of looking at fieldwork became more
and more a thing within anthropology

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.610
and ethnography, and then a lot
of books on fieldwork came out.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.870 position:56%
But before that was the case, if you
wanted to know much about fieldwork,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.370
you went to Kenny's book.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.070 position:56%
And so the fact that Peter distilled
a lot of the wisdom that he gotten

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.000
from Kenny and that I then got
to rework some of this as well

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.370
in this new edition was very
nice for both of us I think

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.330 position:56%
to acknowledge Kenny's effect on us.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.180
So what's new in the new edition
of Folklife and Fieldwork?

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.530
It's always been a great guide,

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.590
introductory guide on
how to do fieldwork.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.160
And I know that a lot of people
who worked on our field projects

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.850
and then a lot of people
who've worked on field projects

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.040
and field schools that we've
run have used the book.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.650
But we did make a few large
changes in the new edition.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.120
In particular, we decided to make
it a little bit more chronological

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.100
so that we essentially
laid it out in the order

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.860
in which you would
think about things

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.600
when you're doing a
fieldwork project.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.720
So you have to think about the
ethics up in advance, right,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.540
before you actually
design the project,

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.790
so that's up toward the
beginning of the book.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.290
So that made a big change in
the book from the old version.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.900
And one thing that's nice about
that is that it allows the table

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.720
of contents to essentially be a
checklist of things that you have

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.640
to do on the way to doing
a fieldwork project.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.130
So if you take a look at that,
you'll see that as one aspect

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.150
of the new nature of the book.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.820
Second thing is that the tone
has gotten a little big lighter.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.190
We are hoping for a kind of a
broader audience, maybe to be able

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.380
to use it with advance
undergraduate but also they use it

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.280
with graduate students
and with professionals.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.040
And for that reason,
we adopted what I said

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.330
in the early production
meeting, I used the word breezy

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.090
and that became a kind
of a joke among us.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.510
So this is the breezy version
of Folklife and Fieldwork.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.710
And the third thing that
you'll notice is some issues

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.010
that we weren't able to talk
about at length in the book

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.340
but that we wanted to
introduce are brought

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.830
up in these little green text
boxes and it's kind of interesting

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.790
to hear a lot of the issues that
were brought up during the morning

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.710
and see how we dealt with some of
them in Folklife and Fieldwork.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.490
So I'll say on page six, if
you want to flip to page six

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.990
on the very bottom, there's
a green box that says,

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.250
one of the first decisions
to make is whether

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.920
to do your fieldwork
alone or in a team.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.060
Many of the best field projects in
the AFC archive were accomplished

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.320
by teams of fieldworkers
rather than individuals.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.170
Teams allow you to divide the
labor, to document the process

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.680 position:56%
of fieldwork, for example, by
photographing interviews in progress

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.600
and to brainstorm with teammates.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.560
They also require you to negotiate

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.690
with your teammates beginning right
here with the goals of the project.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.260
So again, we're putting that
in where you have to make

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.220
that decision, which
is when you're thinking

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.750
about what you actually
want to accomplish.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.980 position:56%
Another example is on page 11, when
we talk about the IRB and, you know,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.150
the issue that if you're
at a university you may run

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.130
into this issue and you
have to be conscious of it.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.650 position:56%
So those are things that we try to
bring up this kind of both practical

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.710
and theoretical and ethical
concerns that you might have

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.020
and to bring them up in a way
that essentially directs you

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.410 position:56%
to our website where we have larger
discussions of these issues for you.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.660
So that's one thing to
say about the new book.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.510
And then the other thing
is just that, you know,

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.970
it's gotten a new design look
so that it's in color now.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.460
And we hope that that'll help
folks to interface with it.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.590
You know, it'll make it
sort of more eye-catching.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.240
So, that's Folklife and Fieldwork.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.620
It is now a physical book which you
can hold in your hands as you see.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.620
It's also a PDF which is going
up on our website as soon

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.450
as we can make it accessible.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.050
So keep, you know, revisiting
our website and very soon,

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.870
within the next couple of weeks,
we're going to have Folklife

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.520
and Fieldwork up there as well.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.820
So now--

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.120
&gt;&gt; How much does it cost?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.420
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And it's free.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.720
It's free of cost.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.780
So if you are interested in
using this in your classes

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.000
or in using this for any kind of
field project that you're doing,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.320
just give us a call or send us
an email at folklife@loc.gov

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.120
and we will send off to you
as many copies as you need.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.400
We have taken delivery of 11,000
copies of this book today.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.710
So, we have a few to give away.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.390
So now, we're going to
move on to our next--

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.010
the next part of our symposium.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.460
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.580
Yeah. And this will be Nicole
Saylor is going to talk about audio

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.220
on the web, so come on up.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.670
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Hello again.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.970
All right.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.110
The idea behind these
10-minute collection features is

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.550
to allow staff an opportunity to
highlight parts of the collection.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.990
And since our AFC pre-1950s disc
recordings are so well-known,

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.150
I thought I'd move beyond what's
actually in the collection

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.810
and discuss how our
thoughts are developing

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:46.970
around making accessible
disc trove to scale.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:53.660
So, I want to thank AFC staff,
many of them, Marsha, Todd, Maggie,

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.570
Jennifer, Steve, Judith, many
others who have deep knowledge

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.860
of this collection and
took the time to explain

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.930
and re-explain all the
idiosyncrasies of it

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.270
and its various iterations.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.450
Oh, I need to drive.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.130
OK. In short, the pre-1950s
disc collection includes seminal

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.280
fieldwork conducted by John
Lomax and his son, Alan.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.560
During the time they worked
at the Library of Congress,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.570
they recorded legendary
musicians such as Leadbelly,

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.190 position:56%
Woody Guthrie and Jelly Roll Morton.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.700
There's some other fieldwork
materials in there, Haiti fieldwork

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.980
from the '30s and work
from the Upper Midwest.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.230
There's also other collectors'
materials, Herbert Halpert,

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.090
Zora Neale Hurston, Vance
Randolph and others.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.530 position:56%
So I've had friends and colleagues--

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.740
colleagues who weren't
archivists remark, you know,

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.020
that's just great stuff, you
should just put that online.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.020
Yeah. Yeah, we should
and of course, we have.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.530
We've started anyway.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.950
But responsibly scaling access

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.860
to the collection online
is a major initiative

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.440
for us as I mentioned earlier.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.170
But there are some hidden
complexities inherent

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.670
in mounting a large AV
collection that need to be sorted

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.300
out before we just put it online.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.200
And so, I'll just walk you
through a few of those things.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.020
OK, so first some context, right?

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:27.980
The date span of materials in our
archives ranges from 1890 to 2016.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.090
So, that's about 125 years
worth of documentation

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.270
on every imaginable
audiovisual format.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:38.930
So, we're a fairly contemporary
archive by many standards.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.340
And so, the topic today
is the orange there.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:47.840
It's the disc era which was
largely the '30s and '40s.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:53.510 position:56%
And so, I also mentioned descriptive
tools that help you access these,

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.810
and that's the card catalog.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.830
And that was started in 1933.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.380
I'll talk about that more later.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.260
Because the Lomaxes were eager
to start publishing the material,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.020
they collected right away and
they needed a way to organize it.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.360
And so flash forward to 2007,

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.030
that card catalog information
went online.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.870
So now flash forward to
2016, where we are today,

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.240 position:56%
and we are a dozen years away from
marking the hundred year anniversary

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.210
of the archive founded in 1928.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:30.610
The date for us, 2028, has come
to not only mark the anniversary

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.610
of the archive, but it sort of sits
out in the distance as a marker

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.940
for where we want to be
with our preservation work

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.420
on audiovisual materials.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:47.410 position:56%
So, the Library of Congress National
Recording Preservation Plan says

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:52.360
that many analog recordings must
be digitized within the next 15

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.660
to 20 years, and this is to avoid
degradation and obsolescence.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.600
And so, we figured that by the
time we hit the hundred year mark,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.290
we ought to have this problem
solved or at least well

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.570
in hand as much as we can.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:12.150
So, this is why we are preparing
to conduct comprehensive assessment

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:17.860
of our AV holdings and start making
some moves toward seeking external

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:23.820
funding for ramping up that work.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.050
OK. So in the digital world--
Well, in analog world, of course,

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.840
you've got two main pieces of
information from the field.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.350
You've got the recording itself and
then you've got the field notes.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.320
Now, often, they would use disc
sleeves to write information

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.430
about the recording and they
would sometimes use notebooks.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.120
And I'm ignoring the fact that
they took photographs just

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.420
for simplicity's sake.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.500
But yes, those are
the main components

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.530
of the fieldwork from this era.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.340
So in the digital world, that turns
into audio files and metadata,

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.190
right, metadata, description
about data.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:10.090
OK. So, WPA workers created the
catalog in the '30s and '40s,

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:14.750 position:56%
and the archive staff then continued
to build it through the late 1960s.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.050
It's still in our reading room.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.190
It's kind of a cool artifact,
but it also does get active use.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:23.440
People like to go to it even
though it is also online.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.450
And here are the happy
people who made it go online.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.460
Some of them are in
the room, I believe.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.330
This was a real game
changer for the archives

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.170
and it remains a widely
used resource.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:38.200
Not only was the information
transcribed into a database,

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.250
but the cards themselves were
imaged and included online.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.230
So, the issue now is that the
database needs to be migrated

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:50.400
out of an old unsupported software
into a new library environment.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.260
So, this seems like a
great opportunity to sort

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.970
of re-imagine what this would
look like with the sound attached.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:01.050
So, v.3 as I like to call
it would be online access

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:07.280
to the whole shebang, except
it's a little complicated.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.330
And a caveat, my numbers
are slightly squishy.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.860
So, don't hold me to them, please.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:18.850
But-- So, it should be noted

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:24.040
that we have more digitization
to do in the collection.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.340
What happened in the late '60s

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:30.110
and early '70s was a wholesale
transfer of the discs to tape.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:33.780
And so, we have these
materials on tape.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:37.580
Now, we also have digital
copies of the tape.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.500
We have digital copies of the disc.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.020
Yeah. So, there's a little
bit of sorting out to do.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.060
Two minutes, oh my
goodness, all right.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.170
Well, I'm saving you from
some minutiae, right.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:54.190
OK. Flash forward,
we have a digital--

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.320
we have the National
Audio-Visual Conservation Center

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.760
and a fabulous engineer
named Rob Cristarella

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.610
who works hard digitizing
the materials for us.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:08.410 position:56%
So when we consider what to do-- you
know, how to get this stuff online

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.020 position:56%
in an efficient and
cost-effective way, we have to think

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.860
about things like, you know, do we
go to the source material which is,

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.690 position:56%
of course, the better quality choice
typically but is more expensive

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.930
and time-consuming to transfer.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.610
And we have to look at condition
issues across the two formats.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.530
Is the reel good in this case,
is it better than the disc?

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:33.050
And so, there's a lot of evaluation
and there's also duplicates, right?

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.820
So, there are duplicate discs and--

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.760
anyway, so there's some things to
[inaudible] in an interest of time.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.740
I almost killed this slide,

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.890
but it was too hilarious
so I had to keep it in.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:47.550
I don't quite know how to
articulate it, but we have got--

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.620
So we've got two digital files
from side A and side B of a disc

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.320
for example, then you digitize
a reel, reel-to-reel tape

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.300
and you can get a file or
multiple files depending

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.600
on how it was ordered.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.620
And then, the card catalog
has track-level information,

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.640
so yet a more granular, like
more granular than a disc side,

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.180
it has the various tracks
on a particular side.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.940
So when you look to unite
these in a digital environment,

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.940
it's tricky to just put it briefly.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.120 position:56%
Anyway, so we think about, you know,

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.860
people zip up raw data
and they hang it online.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.800
We're probably not going to
do that for various reasons.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.820
And then, there's this what we
call hand-crafted where you sort

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:33.950
of sit there and preciously cut
out all your tracks and, you now,

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.540 position:56%
edit your metadata which is now, OK.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.300
So moving on, I'll just say
that we did a little experiment

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.020
with the Lomax in Michigan
materials.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:50.140
We used-- We attempted a pilot,
More Product, Less Process,

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.450
it's what we call it in archives
land where you try to sort

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.100
of be a little less precious
and get more out there.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:01.520
And so, we did things like we
took all these track-level records

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.320
and we smooshed them
into one record.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.270
So, you'll see that the title
is like title colon, title--

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.990
I mean, so it's a little ugly.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.000
The transfers are flat.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.300
They aren't speed corrected.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.600
They aren't anything.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:19.440
They are also-- They're
not, you know, synced up

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.490
or time stamped to
the metadata at hand.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.510
I'll stop there, thank you.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.480
[ Applause ]

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.780
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Right.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.080
And thanks very much, Nikki.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:37.380
I'm Nancy Groce again and I'll be--
as I speak, actually the panelists

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.990
for this next panel
would like to come up.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.100
Well, in no particular
order, I'm going--

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.320
We're going to be talking about
the Occupational Folklife Project

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.900
in particular and the
community engagement

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.530
and collecting in a digital age.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:57.850
And while everybody
is taking their seat,

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:02.330
I'll just tell you a little bit
about this project which is--

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.100
was an innovative born
digital history documentary--

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.500
oral history documentation project

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.330
that the American Folklife Center
initiated in 2008 as in if--

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.330
initially, it's the American Works
project and was kind of conceived

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.360 position:56%
at the height of the Great
Recession as an oral history project

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.180
to document the voices and
concerns of contemporary workers.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:28.460
And it was honestly inspired by the
1930s WPA American Life Histories

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.460
and previous occupational histories
that are here at the library,

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.300
and we consider one of the
gems of our collection.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:42.980
Occupational Folklore-- Folklife
collecting goes through periods

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:47.670
like any other trends
in folklore scholarship

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.680
and it's now ascending again.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.790
For many years, people weren't
doing it for a number of reasons.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:58.430
We can discuss during
the course of this panel.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:02.890
But this-- the Occupational
Folklife Project was launched

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.770
in 2008 and started off.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:12.980
Well, it was really aided by
the fact that Peggy Bulger

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:17.530
who was then the director of the
American Folklife Center arranged

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:21.150
for funding for Archie Green
Fellowships to be given

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.960
to people throughout-- through
a competitive scholar fellowship

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:30.030
program to people throughout
the country to do research

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.190
in their own communities and
share that material with us.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.120
To date, we have almost
600 substantial interviews

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.840
with American workers from--
throughout the United States

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.130
and more being added to the
American Folklife Center's archives

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.480
every week.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:50.960
And today's speakers
are all awardees

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.370
of the Archie Green Fellowship.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.160
So, what I'm going to do
is I'll introduce them

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.340
and then we can perhaps take turns.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:02.030
They'll each take about 10 minutes
to talk about their projects,

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:08.800 position:56%
and we can-- and then have time for
some question and answer at the end.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.700 position:56%
So first, I'd like to introduce Bob
Bussel who's the associate professor

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.940
of history and director of
the Labor and Education Center

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.060
at the University of Oregon
and he's joined by Bobbie Sotin

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.980
of the Service Employees
International Local 503

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.640
in North Bend, Oregon.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.970
And they designed and worked

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:31.460
on a 2015 Archie Green
Fellowship called Taking Care,

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.670
documenting the occupational
culture of home healthcare workers.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:40.140
There is-- Next to them is
Candacy Taylor who's director

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.490
of Taylor Made Culture
in Los Angeles,

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:46.720
California who received a
2013 Archie Green Fellowship

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:51.180
to document hairdressers and
beauty shop culture in America.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.920
Next to her is Maida Owens
from Louisiana Division of Arts

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.250
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana who
oversaw a team of researchers

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:06.090 position:56%
for the 2014 Archie Green Fellowship
documenting Baton Rouge mall

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.060
businesses and trades.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:13.590
And finally is Chris Mule from the
Brooklyn Arts Council in Brooklyn,

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:18.170
New York, who received the 2015
Archie Green Fellowship to work

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.540
with Domestic Workers
United in Brooklyn,

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.170
New York to document
domestic workers

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:26.460
in the New York Metropolitan
area, so very diverse.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:30.990
And of the 30 some odd
projects that have been involved

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:37.510
with the Occupational Folklife
Project, we've been delighted

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:45.500
by both the geographic diversity
and the different occupations

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.800
that have been highlighted.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:52.200
And we specifically-- we're
specifically delighted that most

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:57.020 position:56%
of the one-- of the people and teams
who've gotten support are working

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:02.290
in trades and occupations that
are frankly underdocumented

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:06.060
at the American Folklore--
Folklife Center.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.950
So, they're helping
us enrich our archive.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:13.810
So with that, I'm going to go tramp
across the stage and take my seat.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:18.080
And would you like to
start off with the Oregon--

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.380
&gt;&gt; Bob Bussel: Sure.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.680
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: -- material?

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.980
OK.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.280
&gt;&gt; Bob Bussel: Sure.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.970
Well, thank you very much, Nancy.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:28.200
And I just first want to say thank
you to the American Folklife Center

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.500
and the Library of Congress.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.140
Nancy was a dream to work
with throughout this process.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.420
So, thank you very much for that.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.830
And I'm delighted to be joined

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:40.790
by Bobbie Sotin who's a
caregiver and also an interviewee.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.640
So, we're going to
divide our time here

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.050
in talking briefly
about our project.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:49.260
So, we also, in addition to Taking
Care, we started to call this work

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.690
and the things that are growing
out of it the quiet revolution

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:57.380
because caregiving people that
care for the elderly, disabled,

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.860
people that are physically or
developmentally disabled often work

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.660
in private homes and their
work isn't often seen.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.960
They care for some of the most
vulnerable people in our society.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:12.350
And oftentimes, their work was
not that well recognized or given

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:16.740
that much dignity or respect until
the advent in Oregon and elsewhere

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.700
of collective bargaining
and unionization.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.800
So, that's part of
our story in addition

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.490
to documenting the occupational
culture of these workers.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:26.660
We had a wonderful team
that worked on this project.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.580
I want to also acknowledge
my colleague

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.190
at the Labor Education
Center, Helen Moss.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:34.220
We had two folklorists,
Nathan Moore and Don Stacy.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.880
And Don Stacy is himself
a home care worker,

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.020
and another videographer,
Sonia De La Cruz.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.670
And also, we could not have done
this without the cooperation

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:46.780
of Service Employees International
Union Local 503 that represents

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.430
over 11,000 of these workers
in the state of Oregon.

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:53.100
So, I wanted to first answer
a couple of questions just

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.020
about the logistics of the
project as Nancy had requested

00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:01.000
that we interviewed 35 workers,
24 were women, 11 were men.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.040
It is an industry that tends
to be dominated by women.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.790
And we tried within that relatively
small sample to get as much racial

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:10.020
and ethnic diversity as we could.

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.080
So, we interviewed workers
from Eastern Europe.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.450
There are a group of workers that
increasingly have gotten involved

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:18.390
in home care, Latinos and some
African-Americans as well.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:22.010
And we interviewed people from both
urban, rural and suburban areas.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.180
So, we also tried for
geographic diversity.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.380
And I would just say
I'm going to talk

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.630 position:56%
about four major themes very briefly
that grew out of this research,

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:32.930
but I would just say this.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.090
We'd share this with you
that one of our inside jokes

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:38.280
about the project was as we
got into this that we thought

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.070
that we should have brought tissue
or handkerchief boxes with us

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.320
or the interviewee should
have because invariably,

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.720
somebody almost broke down
into some level of tears

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.980 position:56%
when we heard just these rich and
profound stories from these workers.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.580
These interviews lasted
from a half hour to an hour.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.760
So, let me just say a couple
of things about the interviews

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.020
and I'm going to use
little snippets of words

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.510
to convey what was
going on thematically.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:05.450
One theme was the previous
experience with caregiving

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:09.380
as one worker put it, we were
always taking care of somebody.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:13.100
Almost everybody we interviewed had
some experience, many people caring

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.130
for relatives, family members, it
was really something that seemed

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.950
in people's blood or DNA
that caregiving was something

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:23.110
that was familiar to them
and was not something

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.490
that seemed out of the ordinary.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.590
So, they carry that on very
directly into their work.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.660
It was an extension of who
they were and their identity.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.110
Another piece of this was
a profound sense of mission

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.660
as one worker memorably put
it, this is work that is good

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.090
for the world and good
for your soul.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:43.180
Many people talked
about giving consumers

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.480
or their clients the lives
they want, the lives they need.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.600
Excuse me.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.820 position:56%
And one caregiver who cared for her
autistic child said, my son is going

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:58.500
to have a life due to this
type of work that we're doing.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.970
I have a brief film clip I wanted
to ask you if you could cue up.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.220
This is a home care
worker named Edward Smith,

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.150
and I think you'd get a sense
in this very brief film clip

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.170
about what this work
means in terms of mission.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.470
Can we run that?

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.210
&gt;&gt; It's possible, so
much in [inaudible].

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:18.100
&gt;&gt; We keep in mind we are
taking care of disabled person,

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.720
always try to put yourself in their
shoes about what they can't do

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.380
and understanding that, you know, I
have legs, I am [inaudible] shoes.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:33.010
&gt;&gt; I am her walking to the
mall, I am all those things.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:34.310
[ Foreign Language ]

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bob Bussel: You could stop there.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:36.910
&gt;&gt; I believe--

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:38.980
&gt;&gt; Bob Bussel: I'd love to show you
more, but I think you get a sense

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:43.880
from Edward's quote just
the meaning of this work.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.490
And the worker who came on
afterwards was also talking

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:50.280
about how removing the stigmas
from people with disabilities,

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.170
a memorable quote from Nephtali
Garcia that disabled folks are not

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.250
from another planet or universe.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.580
So, this sense about the mission
of the work was very powerful.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.740
Someone else talked about an
amazing journey with each client,

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.620
the relationships, the deep
relationships that often develop

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.170
between caregivers and
the people they care for.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.930
One example of this was giving
people a sense of choice.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:15.200
So, bathing, you know, doing
the most intimate type of work

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.000
with people and the
emotional labor that goes

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.650
into that can be very difficult.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.130
This homecare worker talked
about making it into a spa day,

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.660
that they would actually--
This was the way in which

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.800 position:56%
that work was done with this person.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.540 position:56%
So, enormous amount of inventiveness
and creativity that we saw

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.760
in the occupational
culture of these workers.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.900 position:56%
And then finally, there's this
sense of making us bona fide workers

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.550
that the role of the
union, that getting a union,

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.540
being able to be viewed as a
professional as one worker put it

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.030
to follow-up to this project.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:46.190
It will be called the
quiet revolution.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.840
And we just think there's
lots of potential in terms

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.420
of showing this film, the film
clips and the documentary,

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.310
the various groups of stakeholders
all around Oregon and elsewhere.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:59.850
We have a presentation lined up at
a major labor history conference.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.830
Others in our team will
use this professionally,

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:04.550
so I would just conclude by
saying that the funding we got

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:09.050
from AFC is truly the gift
that's going to keep on giving.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:10.690
Bobbie?

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:14.110
&gt;&gt; Bobbie Sotin: I've been a
homecare worker for 15 years,

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:17.110
and I have worked with
several seniors

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:18.910
and people with disabilities.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:24.220
And it's been a heck of a ride.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.160
When I first started,
we had no rights.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.850
We had no workman's comp.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:33.690 position:56%
We had very little of anything until
our union came along and said, "Hey,

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:38.100
you know, if we organize you, we
can help and make things better."

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:43.580
So, not only has my union
helped with my career,

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:50.470
because I consider this a career
now, they also helped services

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:52.610
for the people I take care of.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:57.620
We go to the capital every time
we get a chance to to tell them

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.630
and explain to them
exactly what homecare is.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:05.600
And these videos are very helpful
on telling people or showing people

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.320
who we are and what we
do, and who we work for,

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.310
because I directly
work for these people.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.610
They hire and fire me.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:16.060
The state pays me but they can
hire and fire their workers.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.720
And so, having this opportunity
to come here and say thank you

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.240
for what you're doing and letting
people know what homecare is

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.410
and what homecare does.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:31.100
And I know the people that
I work for are very grateful

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.160
for having someone to stand
up for them and speak for them

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.620
when they're not able to.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:39.760 position:56%
So, that's one of the best things in
the world that is being able to come

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.020
to someone's house and say,
hey, let me, you know--

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.110 position:56%
When I left she was crying because I
was going to be gone for four days.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:52.990
So, it's a very rewarding job
and it's an important job.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:59.240
And any time that your legislators
are asking you to pass a funding

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.250
for these kinds of programs,
please, it's important

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:08.320
that these people are taken care
of in a manner that's respectful

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:13.900
and honoring their service to
our community and our country.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.700

and thank you to the American
Folklife Center for this opportunity

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.140
for the grant to do this work.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.630
It was such a gift.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:48.460
I did a project called
American Hair,

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.360
the document of beauty shop culture
throughout the United States.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.190
And I traveled over 20,000 miles
conducting interviews in salons

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:01.140
that served everyone from
African-American to Appalachian,

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:07.170
Cajun, Dominican, Gullah,
Japanese, Lumbee Indian, Pakistani.

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:10.520
I also interviewed some of
the industry powerhouses

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:15.530
like the Vidal Sassoon
family, Tabatha Coffey from

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:20.210
"Tabatha Takes Over",
Bob Marley's hairdresser,

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:23.420
Paul Mitchell and the like.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.720
So let me see.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.180
I'm going to advance.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:30.740
OK. And I started this project
in 2006 because I was sitting

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:34.500
in my hair salon for about
10 years and realized

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.460
that in the whole time I'd been
there, I've never seen anybody

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.470
but black people in there.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:44.250
And one day a white woman walked
in and wanted to get her hair done.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.940
She just wanted to wash
and set, really simple.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.640
And my hairdresser shooed her away.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.540 position:56%
Well, she was nice but she was
like, you know, no, I don't do that.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.200
And then, when she
left, the woman left,

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.930
my hairdresser said,
I don't do white hair.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.340
And I was shocked.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.640
I was like, "Oh my god."

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:05.380
You know, I thought maybe this
is Gigi's exterior of the salon,

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.050
and I felt uncomfortable.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:10.530
I was like, am I part of a secret
society that I don't know about?

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:14.910
Because I lived in San Francisco,
one of the most diverse places

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:20.440
in the world, and I just be-- it
was glaring how segregated it was.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.280
And that's when I started
this project.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.830
For the next several years, I just
would sit under the hair dryer

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:30.690
and just study what was
happening in the salon.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.830
And I realized, you know,
I watched Gigi, our--

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.840
my hairdresser, counsel
us, support us.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.080
I mean she-- Everybody went through
every kind of emotion imaginable

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.490
in that salon and Gigi
was there for us.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:47.620
And I realized that she was
protecting this environment

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.040
that was rooted in
culture and ritual.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:54.260
And I wondered, you know, if other
salons are like this, you know,

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:59.280
what about Japanese
salons or Pakistani salons.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.400
And so, that's when
I got the opportunity

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.520
to do this project
when I got this grant.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:08.840
And it was interesting because then
I had to go outside of my little,

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:12.990
you know, womb basically,
that was so protected,

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.730
into these other salons
are very intimate spaces.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:21.310
And so, when I tried to go to see
a Chinese salon in San Francisco,

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:24.120
it was like, you know,
walking in and the music stops

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.220
and everybody looks at you,
like what are you doing here.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.890
And I tell them I'm not
here to get my hair done

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.090
and they would just
be really relieved.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.710
And that look of relief
would be like, oh god,

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.620
you know, then why are you here?

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.680
And when I would explain the
project, you know, I would just--

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:44.590
generally people were not, that
one out of eight, that's liberal,

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.240
would allow me to even
to do the project.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.320
It was very hard to get access.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:54.070
Having an outsider come in, I
mean, I'm there in their face

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:57.930
with this camera was, you
know, it was kind of invasive.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:01.920
And ironically, after getting
the Library of Congress grant,

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.010
I thought, "Oh, this will
make it more important."

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:09.270
And I mean actually made it more
difficult because a lot the--

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.880
these were, you know,
immigrant-based communities,

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.880
these were small, you know,
they just heard government.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.610
They were like, "Definitely not."

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:21.070
You know, we don't want to
have anything to do with that.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:24.350
So, it was challenging.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.910
But I continued on.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:31.070
I continued to study the anatomy
of hair and understand that most

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:34.090
of the salons were segregated
because of hair texture.

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:37.240
You know, it wasn't just culture
but there was a logistical issue

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.520 position:56%
of hairdressers not knowing how to
deal with that kind of hair texture.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.940
And so, I learned about those
differences, the difference

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:48.770
between Asian hair and
why it's so hard to curl.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.300
How it's, you know-- why
black hair just tends to be

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.320
so much kinkier and curlier.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:02.770
I went to a Japanese salon and
saw-- it's actually in DC here.

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:05.210
And you can see how, you
know, this contraption,

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.220 position:56%
there's all these chemicals, there's
all these things that they use

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:13.550
that the salon owner would have to
go to Japan to get these materials.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.330
So, you know, it's not just--

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:18.840
I mean there's a comfort factor why
people group themselves, you know,

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.140
amongst people like them.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.730
But then, there's this
logistical issue.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:24.320
So, I learned about that.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.810
And that, you know, easy
breezy kind of wave pattern,

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:33.920
that took about five hours for
her to get that, that look.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:41.070
I also went to Bollywood Salon
which was Pakistani in Queens.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.490
Shahzad here doing hair.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:45.400
He said, you know, the most--

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:51.130
He probably did Jennifer Aniston's
haircut for 30 years of his career.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.230
And it's very difficult
to get Indian hair

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.970
to fall like Jennifer Aniston.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:59.540
So, he talked about that.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.300
I looked at, you know, there's
this assumption that, oh,

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:07.830
the blond straight hair,
they have it easy and realize

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.860
that it's very time consuming
and expensive to be blond.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.500
And that has its own
hurdles to deal with.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.130
I was also very interested

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:22.820
in the labor involved
in doing hairdressing.

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.820
You know, I interviewed
Farrah Fawcett's hairdresser

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:30.180
and he said there's
75 steps to a haircut.

00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:32.260
And so, he went through
that, just the architecture

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:37.030
of building a haircut and how much,
you know, knowledge goes into that.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:41.560
I went to a traditional
African salon

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.510
and it was a home salon
in Philadelphia.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:47.350
And that was one of the most
interesting interviews I did

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:50.650
because their hair-- it
wasn't just about the hair.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:54.150
It was really, really tied to
their culture and identity.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:57.210
And what they end up
doing a lot is trying

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:00.170
to fix black hair that's
been damaged

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:02.170
because of the straightening
and all the chemicals.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:06.090
So here, Ifama is getting
braids, which is her natural hair

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:08.670
but at the top it's all extensions.

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:11.250
It's all fake hair until
her natural hair grows

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:16.090
out because she damaged it
so badly from chemicals.

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:21.560
And they were trained in these
traditional African hairstyles

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.150
so they had incredible knowledge.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:27.190
And there's also I found
a white hairdresser

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:30.400
who has primarily black clientele.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.700
Her name is Rina.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.000
She's Sicilian.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.430
So again in Sicily they tend to
have that kinkier texture hair

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:40.910
so she kind of wasn't afraid of
it and knew how to handle that.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:44.720
So, she was amazing.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:52.630
And you can see her
straightening, the transformation.

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:56.050
And I was also interested in
multicultural salons because,

00:35:56.050 --> 00:36:00.520
you know, with the fact that,
you know, we're living in a world

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:04.140
where people are not of one
race, a lot of people choose

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:09.020
to say I'm not identified
with a particular race and one

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.480
in seven marriages or interracial.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.190
So, we're looking at there's
different hair textures that are,

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:19.010
you know, just popping up
and people are demanding

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.230
to be served in regular salons.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:24.700
They don't necessarily
want to go to a black salon

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.500
or a Chinese or Japanese salon.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.970
So, there are multicultural
salons popping

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:34.360
up where the hairdressers are
trained to work on different types

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:38.430
of hair and people who are adopting
kids of a different race can go

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.330
into the same salon and get
their hair done as their child.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:44.010
So, this is a big demand right now.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:49.610
And Ms. Mia here is half Brazilian
and half black and, you know,

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:52.560
so her Brazilian mother who has
a straight hair is like, oh,

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.740
it's such a relief that I
can finally go to a salon

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.990
where we can both be served.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:01.840
I was also looking at
Lumbee Indian women

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:06.130
and there's an African
bloodline in the Lumbeean tribe,

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:08.210
and so kinky hair does come up.

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:12.180
But this was a daughter of
a mother who had curly hair

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.970
and was really ashamed to have--

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:15.860
because all her brothers and
sisters had straight hair

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.610
that were traditional Indian

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.620
but she always hid her curls
and was really ashamed.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:24.610
And now her daughter has this
curly hair and embracing her curls.

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:31.100 position:56%
And so looking at the transformation
of time was also really was special

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:36.140
to see people changing
their identity around that.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.600
And also, you know,
if you are-- have--

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.780
of Asian descent and
you want dreadlocks,

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:45.640
that's a whole process that,
you know, they have created

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.450
at Twisted Salon in New Orleans

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:51.780
where she had a steamer
nozzle attached to a hose and,

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.080
you know, and back combed.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.880
And it was really complicated but
they could dread somebody's hair.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.610
So, that was another shoe.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:04.730
And I went to Orthodox
Jewish salon in Brooklyn

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:08.540
and thought I'd be walking into
some place that was so, you know,

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:15.560
I want to say repressed but
just, you know, very somber.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:20.510
But they have one of the
leading, you know, salons of--

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:23.380
for wigs for people
of African descent.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:28.460 position:56%
People from all over the country buy
their wigs and they've really broken

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:29.840
onto the box of religion.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.600
So I am running out of
time but this is it.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:37.390
So, I just wanted to say again,
you know, thank you so much

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:42.740
for this opportunity to continue
to do this work., you know.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.390

of my other projects,

you know, go to my website there.

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:48.660
I do have some book cards.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.290
I have some, you know, information.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:54.260
If you want to come up to me,
I'll give you information.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:59.010
But again, I think without being
able to do the field research,

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:02.070
without getting the funding which
is very difficult to do to get

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:04.770
that kind of funding, this
is such a critical program

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:07.750
and this made all the
difference in my project.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:10.510
So, thank you for your time.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.960
I have slides also.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:26.610
I used the Archie Green Fellowship
to support a larger project.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:30.300
I wanted to document Baton Rouge.

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:34.050
The larger project is now
called Baton Rouge Traditions.

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:40.320
It's a small midsize southern
city that boom since World War II.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.570
Over the years I've noticed
that all too many people

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:48.750
like to criticize Baton
Rouge, my hometown

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:51.490
and Louisiana's capital city.

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:55.660
People love the state and its
culture but some make an exception

00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:01.120
about Baton Rouge, especially
cultural workers and researchers.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.630
Many residents and
especially nonresidents think

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:09.130
that it lacks any expressions of
folk culture even though it is home

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:10.710
to an array of individuals

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:14.470
who maintain Louisiana's
defining traditions.

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:17.100
I started wondering why
Baton Rouge is perceived

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.010
as having no folk culture.

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:23.140
I knew that as the capital
city, it is a cultural microcosm

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:26.550
with people coming from
across the state to work.

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:29.490
Others have moved here from
throughout the United States

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:34.510
for employment at the
universities and industry.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:39.320
I began to realize that Baton
Rouge had a major identity issue.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.890
It doesn't help that Baton Rouge
is sandwiched between New Orleans

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:48.300 position:56%
and Lafayette, two cities that are
known for their traditional culture.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.760
The rapid increase in
population coincide

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.900
with the growth of suburbia.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:57.970 position:56%
The region includes urban, suburban,
and rural areas in addition

00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:02.230 position:56%
to small towns that are closely
connected to the city creating a web

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:05.050
of relationships and networks.

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.210
As the economic hub of the region,

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:12.090
its population density allows
specialized businesses to exist

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:15.830
that otherwise, would
be difficult to sustain.

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:18.970
And thus, the Baton Rouge
Folklife survey was born.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.310
Elsewhere, I explore the
identity issues in greater detail

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:24.890
but today I'd like to look
at the occupational folklore

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:28.740
that we documented with support
of the Archie Green Fellowship.

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:33.720
I received this in partnership with
the Louisiana Folklore Society.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:40.610

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.450
"Baton Rouge Traditions".

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:08.620
The virtual book includes an
introduction by me in six chapters,

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:11.730
Baton Rouge Gives, Baton
Rouge Makes, Plays,

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:14.820
Worships, Works and Diversifies.

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.930
Each essay features photographs

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:20.030
and most have audio clips
from the interviews.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:23.490
Essay is based on fieldwork
supported by the project

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:26.170
to have field reports that
are available upon request

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:28.260
and offer more details.

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:32.730
Baton Rouge works includes
essays on occupational folklore.

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:36.550
The Archie Green Fellowship enabled
us to focus on people employed

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:40.560
in small businesses and trades
who have specialized skills.

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.920
Two of the field workers had
already done work in Baton Rouge.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.900
Douglas Manger and Laura Marcus
Green are both senior folklorists

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:51.290
who have vast experience
with contract fieldwork.

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:54.140
One reason that I chose them
is that they had no experience

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.300
in Louisiana or even the south.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:00.300
So they came with little to no
preconceived ideas about the city.

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.220
This fresh perspective
was significant

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.070
in that they noticed
things about the city

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:07.130
that I had overlooked
or took for granted.

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:09.850
For example, the abundance
of beauty parlors,

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:12.470
barber shops, and nail salons.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:16.610
I assigned projects in part based
on the strengths and interest

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:20.260
of each researcher and
provided a list of possibilities

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:23.230
but the field workers
contributed ideas and I was open

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:25.960
to the serendipity of fieldwork.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:30.170
Douglas Manger documented a
taxidermist, barber, funeral home,

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:34.150
custom sign maker, piano
tuner, and a clothier.

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:37.210
He also looked at restaurateur
[inaudible]

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:41.630
and how he used his welding skills
to creatively solve problems

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:45.490
for his restaurant and
food processing business.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:47.680 position:56%
Laura Marcus Green did two projects.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.980
She looked at bakeries

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.960
and specialized cakes
including groom's cakes

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:56.160
and the emerging tradition of cakes
that announce a baby's gender.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:00.670
She also documented shop owners
who specialized in hats and dresses

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:04.260
for African-American
women to wear to church.

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:07.690
Jocelyn and Jon Donlon are a
folklorist photographer team

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:11.620
formerly based in Baton Rouge so
they were familiar with the city.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:14.930
And have-- They've done
other contracts for me.

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:20.560
With this project, they focused on
repair services, shoes, furniture,

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:25.600
rods and reels, instruments and
jewelry in addition to a locksmith,

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.830
a baton maker, and clothier.

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:31.120
A fourth field worker contributed

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.800
to the Archie Green
collection as a volunteer.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.770
Maria Zorang [assumed
spelling] interned

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:41.830
with me during summer 2013 before
starting her PhD work at IU.

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:45.430
She came to the project
familiar with Baton Rouge

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:52.210
and documented ethnic grocers,
Buddha makers, and tea cake makers.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:56.050
All field workers had difficulty
documenting small businesses,

00:44:56.050 --> 00:45:00.470 position:56%
especially if the person to
document was not the business owner.

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:04.340
The first to confront this
issue was Maria Zorang who had

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:07.940
to abandon her original goal
of documenting butchers.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:10.790
She was not successful in
getting any meat markets

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:14.010
to allow their butcher to
be interviewed on work time

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:17.360
and then the owners did not
want to ask their employees

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.900
to do it on their own time.

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:21.220
So they simply declined.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:25.900
Many small business owners
clearly saw time as money

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:29.140
and did not perceive being
included in this documentation

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.670
as a worthwhile use of their money.

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:33.600
And we even had letters
of introduction

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.530
from the lieutenant governor,
you know, things like that.

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:38.830
But all of them had trouble.

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:43.520 position:56%
With more time and other strategies,
no doubt we could have figured

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.970
out how to get access to butchers.

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:48.440
But she had to complete
the fieldwork that summer,

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.650
and so redirected her energies.

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:53.380
She put in an extraordinary
effort and can't be faulted

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.130
for not trying hard enough.

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:57.660
She would come in every day-- You
know, she worked out of my office.

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:00.280
So every day I heard the
tales of what she was trying.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.240
She cannot be faulted.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.500
Nonetheless, I thought more
experienced contract field workers

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:07.250
might not have this problem.

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:09.250
I was wrong.

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:12.510
All three other projects
had more declined interviews

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:15.170
than I have ever seen in a project.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:16.820
But all persisted and were able

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:20.020
to contribute the interviews
for the collection.

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:24.980
After each project is completed, I
post the essay online and share it

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.290
with the interviewees
for their review.

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:30.970
Some request clarifications,
some never respond at all,

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:34.940
occasionally they want additions,
photographs added or such.

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:39.250
The next step is to publicly
present the results in other ways.

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:42.210
Since the folklife program
does not have the resources

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:44.310
to present the traditions
to the public other

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:49.100
than through the online essays, I
partner with the local arts agency

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:51.970
so that they can incorporate
it into their programming

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:53.650
and expand their constituency.

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:56.530
They're ecstatic with the work.

00:46:56.530 --> 00:47:01.200 position:56%
But again, we haven't, you know,
the flood actually is a major issue.

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:04.880
The project has not been
officially announced

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.020
so that the work is just beginning.

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:10.370
And the flooding has impacted
the region so profoundly

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:13.600
that we are postponing
the announcement and how--

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.390
and determining how to announce it.

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:22.680
Despite documenting 259 tradition
barriers over the larger project,

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.250
there were many that
did not get included.

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:28.170
Some of the occupational
traditions include welders

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:32.860 position:56%
who fabricate custom outdoor cooking
equipment used for crawfish boils

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:34.890
and other catering businesses.

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:38.410
Other small repair
businesses such as watch repair

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:42.380
and many other food businesses such
as seafood market, snowball stands

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.410
and of course butcher shops.

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:49.390
Finally the building
trades need to be looked at.

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:52.460
It won't be easy to change the
perception about Baton Rouge.

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.780
This summer I got a reminder
when I presented to a group

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.870
of educators in nearby Lafayette.

00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:02.680 position:56%
I shared the rich traditions that
we had found in Baton Rouge and said

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.040
that their students might
find similar traditions

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.810
in their hometowns.

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:10.920
Afterwards one told me that,
well, it was a good project.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:14.380
The problem is that Baton Rouge
just does not have a soul.

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:19.990 position:56%
I suspect that this midsize southern
capital city's identity is conflated

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:23.000
with people's frustration
with state government.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.510 position:56%
The city's horrid traffic and having

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:30.390
to attend dreaded statewide
required meetings.

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:33.380
Perception about Baton Rouge
will not change easily.

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:37.280 position:56%
But hopefully this project will give
civic leaders more data to consider

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:40.610
and expand their concept
of what folk traditions are

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:42.310
in the city and the region.

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:46.150 position:56%
And I would again like to thank, you
know, for receiving the fellowship.

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:50.510
We would not have been able to
explore these subjects without him.

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:56.180
[ Applause ]

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.350
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:00.270
&gt;&gt; Chris Mule: I'm going to sit.

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:01.910
Yeah. But I can use this, right?

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:03.210
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: OK.

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:04.510
&gt;&gt; Chris Mule: This.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:06.330
OK. So, hi, my name is Chris
from the Brooklyn Arts Council.

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:11.560
And I worked with the team in
Brooklyn on a project called

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.450
"Preserving and protecting
the domestic workforce".

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:20.950
I worked with a group of
domestic workers called Domestic

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:22.250
Workers United.

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:23.550
Before we get there,
I'm going to talk

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:24.850
about what is a domestic worker.

00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:27.250
Someone who works in another
person's home and cares

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:31.360
for their children or an
elderly person, is a housekeeper,

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:35.540
does other work in or around the
home like gardening or repair work.

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:38.790
Domestic Workers United is a
membership based organization.

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:40.090
They're not a union.

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:44.040
They are base of Caribbean, Latina
and African nannies, housekeepers

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:48.460
and elderly caregivers in New
York, organizing for power, respect

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:53.160
and fair labor standards to end
exploitation and oppression.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:59.420
So the two key terms here are
trying to fight for recognition

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:02.180
that this work is real work.

00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:05.180
As of today, DWU, that's
how I'm going to refer

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:06.570
to Domestic Workers United,

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:09.230
has organized over
6000 domestic workers.

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:14.130
There's an estimated 300,000
domestic workers in New York State.

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:18.770
So the goals as I mentioned,
Domestic Workers United wants

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:21.640
to make sure there is equal
rights for domestic workers,

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:24.040
but the recognition of the
occupation of as real work.

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:28.320
One of the common phrases
you hear them talk about is

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:32.520
that they do the work that
makes all other work possible.

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:36.250
They work for very wealthy
lawyers, doctors, you name it,

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:39.370
in New York City, Long
Island as well.

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:43.380
And in 2010-- So Domestic
Workers United started in 2000.

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:47.270
In 2010, they passed something
called the Domestic Workers Bill

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:48.570
of Rights.

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:53.010
So this bill of rights was
to guide domestic workers

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:56.740
and have them communicate
their rights

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.730
to avoid harassment on the job.

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:02.860
Sexual harassment or harassment
based on gender or ethnicity

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:06.080
to advocate and to understand
that they get days off.

00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:09.840
That once they work
over-- And also, yeah,

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.960
once they work a certain amount
of time, they're required

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.430
to have one day off a week
at least if they're in--

00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:17.030
they're working in-house
or a live-in.

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:22.030
They are required to have 24 full
hours off of that seven days.

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:24.500
It taught domestic workers
to use their rights,

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:29.070
how to advocate the fact that
they have rights and reinforce

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:31.580
that the rights applied to
domestic workers regardless

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:32.880
of immigration status.

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:36.020
And this is the key
thing for all the workers

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:39.230
that Domestic Workers United worked
with because they don't have--

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:42.890
Many of them, I'd say I think 75%

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:45.170
of the ones we interviewed
do not have--

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:49.410
their immigration statuses
is cloudy and difficult

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:53.130
that they don't have the ability
to advocate for themselves.

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:54.430
They're afraid.

00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:58.560
They're afraid to-- When their
employer ask them to walk the dog

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.770
which is like the worst thing
you can do for a Caribbean woman

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:04.400
to ask them to walk a dog.

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:08.270
And so when they're asked to do
that separate job that's different

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:10.490
than being a nanny, but they're
not going to say no to it

00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:12.580 position:56%
because they're afraid to get fired.

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:15.890
They don't know where
their next job might be.

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:17.770
Many times this status,

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:20.800
their immigration status
has been used against them.

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.910
And they've been-- that people
might threaten them that, you know,

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:27.440
if you don't do this and if
you don't work, you know,

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.980
seven days a week then
I'll report you.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.760
Even now they do-- So
they do have rights.

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.240
That doesn't really mean anything.

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.540
They shouldn't be afraid.

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:36.430
So Domestic Workers
United, that's a big thing.

00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:43.110 position:56%
So this project, the idea of working
with on this particular issue

00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:46.200
and that the fact that there
is-- it's such a sensitive issue

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.260
and there's so much trauma involved

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:53.320
in the way these workers are
treated, we assembled a team.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:57.010
So the first couple, the first
women that you'll see there,

00:52:57.010 --> 00:53:00.230
that's Christine Lewis on the
left and Patricia Francois.

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:02.740
They are the leaders of
Domestic Workers United.

00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:06.800
They would be the lead
interviewers and organizers

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:09.710
of this whole Archie Green project.

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:14.820
The next woman is-- I forget
her-- Ramone [assumed spelling],

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:18.130
and she is a-- who also works
for Domestic Workers United.

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:21.500
She is from Dominica, but her
mother was a domestic worker.

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:25.900
A key component of this was
also, you know, how do you manage

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:27.620
as a domestic worker
your own family.

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:30.950
So she was able to really help
us understand that aspect.

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:32.980
Ninaj Raoul is the next
woman on the right.

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:36.690
She runs an organization called
Haitian Women for Asian Refugees.

00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:39.980
And she is-- was the one
who actually connected me

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:42.390
with Domestic Workers United.

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:44.660
There's a lot, there's a large
Haitian community in Brooklyn.

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:48.050
So she was instrumental in
making getting us to connect

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:51.730
with the Haitian population,
but also understanding

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:53.620
that she works a lot with
the immigration status.

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:58.970 position:56%
So understanding how to-- one of
the things that she advocates for is

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:01.850
that these women talk about
their immigration status.

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:03.150
That it's OK.

00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:06.810
So she brought a lot of information
and a lot of help and guidance

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:11.120
for this process when we had them
talk about their immigration status

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:14.110
and what types of things
have been used against them.

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:16.270
The next woman on the
bottom is Eileen Condon.

00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:18.160
She works for-- used
to work for the Center

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.760
for Traditional Music and Dance.

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.780
They run these wonderful
things called community

00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:24.080
cultural initiative.

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.650
So she really understand, you
know, community organizing,

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:31.230
how to make sure that all
sides are heard in the process

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:34.320
of creating a project
or any type of project.

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.620
So she was instrumental.

00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:36.920
That's me in the middle.

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:38.220
And then Kaitlin McClure is a--

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:43.380
she was a grad student and she
did a lot of transcription for us.

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:48.970
So the methodology is taken
directly from Carl Lindahl's idea

00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:52.740
of survivor interviews
during her legends

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:55.660
from hurricane Katrina, I think.

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.100
&gt;&gt; Right, on Katrina.

00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:00.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Chris Mule: So the idea that as
I mentioned earlier that it would be

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.860
so difficult for me to sit there

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:05.590
and do interviews not
understanding all the aspects

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:09.250
that these domestic
workers go through.

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:12.530
And I thought that if we did
a worker to worker interview,

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:14.370
it would be more effective.

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:17.860
It would be a great opportunity
for them to talk to each other,

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:21.840
to explore new issues, new ideas.

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.990
So in this process, I'm
sort of behind the camera.

00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:30.630
Occasionally, I would jump in and
ask to pull out certain questions.

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:34.440
But we worked for about three
months creating a list of questions

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.030
that they're all happy with.

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:39.090
That dealt with a variety
of different issues.

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:43.300
And one of the-- just to sum it
up, one aspect we're interested

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:47.010
in is domestic work, domestic
workers inside the home.

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:51.460
So what skill and techniques does
it require to be a domestic worker?

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:52.850
What knowledge do you need?

00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:56.660
What sort of communication
happens between you and the elder

00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:59.420 position:56%
that you're caring for or the child?

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:03.310
Relationship management is
probably the biggest skill needed

00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:05.310
to be a domestic worker.

00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:09.330
Relationship management with
your employer, with the child

00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:12.440
or elder you're caring for
and relationship management

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:15.110
with your own family
during this process.

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:17.790
You would think that the
goal would be to make sure

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:21.200
that you have the kid--
that the kids love you

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.180
and that they almost call you mom.

00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:25.580
But many different
workers had different ideas

00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:27.850
about how to keep their guard up.

00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:30.310
A real good domestic worker,
many people would think,

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:31.660
is you keep your guard up.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:33.710
You don't-- You make
sure that a child--

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:36.150
that you don't develop
that type of relationship

00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:39.790
because that can be very
difficult for you and the child.

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:41.090
Relationship management

00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:43.090
with employers is the
hardest part of this.

00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:47.660
That was always the difficult
stories about wage theft

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:51.280 position:56%
and exploitation, assault, a variety

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.420
of awful things that
I won't get into.

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:56.100
Cultural expressions and conflict.

00:56:56.100 --> 00:57:00.540 position:56%
So many of these women, I'd say the
majority of them from the Caribbean,

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:04.370
they talked a lot about the
expressions that they brought

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:08.290 position:56%
to the table, whether it's the food
they cooked or the stories they tell

00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:11.650
or the songs they told and
how that could be currency.

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:15.140
But also it could cause conflict
when you're a woman that's working

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:18.170
in an orthodox household,

00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:22.340
your cultural expressions
are curved immensely, so--

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:26.730
And when you're working for--
with kosher food, that can be--

00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:30.120 position:56%
They talked a lot about the
difficulty in navigating that world.

00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:33.320
And also grievances,
that was the one thing

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:37.330
that Domestic Workers United was
interested in this project for is

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:41.370 position:56%
to get these women to talk about the
difficulties they have on the job

00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:43.340
to make sure that those
were expressed.

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.170
So, John, could you press play.

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:47.770
This is Patricia Francois
on the left

00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:49.390
and Christine Lewis on the right.

00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:50.790
Christine Lewis is
being interviewed.

00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:53.390
Go for it.

00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:54.690
&gt;&gt; Christine Lewis: You know what?

00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:56.400
When I was growing up my
parents are working class people.

00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:58.690
We had people who came
to see about us.

00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:00.990
Who comb my hair, who make
sure my clothes was ironed.

00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:04.560
I don't think when I leave
Trinidad I would come and work

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:07.560
in somebody's home or
care for somebody's baby.

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:10.220
And by the way, the article
in Trinidad newspaper,

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:14.040
before I leave Trinidad
once, do you know--

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.560
and I'm talking for
Trinidad, young women.

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:17.750
I don't know what the
other people would say.

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:19.050
&gt;&gt; Patricia Francois: Yes.

00:58:19.050 --> 00:58:20.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Christine Lewis: Do you know what
Trinidad young women are selling

00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:24.460
their house and land
to go to America to do?

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.920
Walk peoples' baby on
the upper west side.

00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:28.970
There it was and you
ask me that was me.

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:30.320
I rode that donkey years ago.

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.620
&gt;&gt; Patricia Francois: Yes.

00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:33.210
&gt;&gt; Christine Lewis: And the shame
that is attached to domestic work.

00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:35.810
But you know what?

00:58:35.810 --> 00:58:38.830
As I look back on-- and the
[inaudible] you get from belonging

00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:42.370
to a movement is that
all work is good.

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:43.670
The Father created the universe,

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:46.160
and when he created the
universe what do you see?

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:48.530
The seven days that
he saw his creation

00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:50.490
in the [inaudible],
he said it was good.

00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:51.790
&gt;&gt; Patricia Francois: Yes.

00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:53.680
&gt;&gt; Christine Lewis: Doesn't
matter [inaudible] be the best,

00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:54.980
that's what you could do.

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:58.850
Trust me, when I work for
the children that I work for,

00:58:58.850 --> 00:59:01.060
I do the best that I could.

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.360
You know what?

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.990
You know what is my joie de vivre?

00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:06.730
Let me tell you what
is my joie de vivre.

00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:09.650
When the mother comes
home and this little boy,

00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:12.760
he is holding on to his mother but
he is looking around for Christine

00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.410
with a beautiful smile on his face.

00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:18.150
The mother don't even have
to ask him how his day was.

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:19.450
the smile tells it.

00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:20.750
&gt;&gt; Patricia Francois: Yes.

00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:22.050
&gt;&gt; Christine Lewis:
The treatment he gets

00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:23.350
when she's not there,
I treat him as my own.

00:59:23.350 --> 00:59:25.070
How could you not love innocence?

00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:27.980
So, yes. So this bill of
rights, who doesn't recommend--

00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.890
recompense me for the love.

00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:31.760
You can't pay for love.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.830
You can't pay for unconditional
love that I wish sometimes

00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:40.390
that these people would look at the
work that we do for loving a child,

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:41.690
for taking care of your home.

00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:42.990
&gt;&gt; Patricia Francois: Yes.

00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:44.290
&gt;&gt; Christine Lewis: Making sure

00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:45.590
that when you come back
this child is scratchless.

00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:46.890
He does not have a mark
on his, on his thigh.

00:59:46.890 --> 00:59:48.190
&gt;&gt; Patricia Francois: Just happy.

00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:50.150
&gt;&gt; Christine Lewis:
But he's just happy.

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:51.450
&gt;&gt; Patricia Francois: Yeah.

00:59:51.450 --> 00:59:52.750
&gt;&gt; Chris Mule: So the next
part about that we're looking

00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:55.330
to is their lives outside
of the home.

00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:56.630
So, dual parenting.

00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:58.160
If you're a domestic worker
and you're taking care

00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.340
of your own family, how does
that impact your own family

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.870
if you're working seven days
a week for another family

01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:05.280
and giving love to another child.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.580
And education, what types of
skills were these women interested

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:09.880
in acquiring?

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.180
Who we choose to interview.

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:14.150
We interviewed Domestic
Worker United members.

01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:16.710
Also day laborers,
there is a lot of--

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:19.850
There was two women we interviewed
from Ecuador that were day laborers

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:25.410 position:56%
and worked-- stood on the street and
got picked up in South Williamsburg

01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:28.670
and worked with orthodox families.

01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:32.780
Haitian refugees, licensed
daycare providers provide us a way

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:36.200
as we realize what is it like
to talk to someone who works

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.870
on a regulated daycare industry.

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:40.780
And also special needs caregivers.

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:43.310 position:56%
A lot of these women would take jobs
not knowing that they were going

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:45.300
to be caring for an autistic child.

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:46.990
Two of them were in that situation.

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:50.730 position:56%
They didn't get paid any more nor
did they necessarily have the skills

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:52.450
but they rose to the occasion.

01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:53.750
Access outside the LOC.

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:58.300
So I was thinking about
this like what would this--

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:04.580 position:56%
what would be a good way to use this
information and how can the Library

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:05.880
of Congress deal with it.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.620
So this idea of pain
porn is something

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:11.770
that you might hear something
about like poverty porn

01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:15.000
where people are showing
oral histories or stories

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
that are meant to make you cry.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.510
And that's something
that this and not--

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:21.970
If it's not put in the right
context, that with this--

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:24.490
That's what this stuff can
be used for but there's

01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:26.690
so much more nuance
to these stories.

01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:31.470
And I fear that it's very important
to make sure that they're shown

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:34.400
in the right context
and shown locally

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.720
for a particular community
that empowers them.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:41.890
So I worry if it was just thrown
up on the web that it might be used

01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:44.470
in a way that is not going
to help the movement.

01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:47.130
And that's what I'm
talking about is, you know,

01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:50.820
how can we work together with these
local organizations to make sure

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:54.230
that if the Library of
Congress is giving access to it,

01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:58.210
that it's in cooperation with
domestic workers in New York State

01:01:58.210 --> 01:02:01.410
or throughout the country, to
make sure that that happens.

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:03.620
I'm not going to play this.

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.570
It was received well.

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:06.950
It gave them a chance to talk.

01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:11.450
The women were also paid to do
the interviews and be interviewed.

01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:16.410
And this is going to be great
material for this organization,

01:02:16.410 --> 01:02:20.180
Domestic Workers United, to
build their movement, to build--

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:24.020
We've talked about doing an exhibit
where they can organize people,

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:28.320
because really this is just an
organizing organization to try

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.160
to get people to be mobilized
and understand their rights.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.380
And that's it.

01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:34.680
Thank you.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.480
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Thank you.

[ Applause ]

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:43.280 position:56%
We have a little time for questions.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.970
Would you entertain some questions?

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:47.270
We have--

01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:54.110
Oh, alright.

01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:58.380
&gt;&gt; I mean thinking back-- hello?

01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:59.680
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:02.280
&gt;&gt; Thinking back to our
discussion earlier today

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.580
about the team projects,

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:06.300
I'm wondering to what extent
say Chris's project and Bob

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:12.460 position:56%
and Bobbie's, was there any
opportunity for cross fertilization,

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:16.080
for learning from the experience
of the other project or Maida

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.590
and Candacy or is working
immediately some

01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:24.860
of the Baton Rouge things
touched on the same topics.

01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:26.290
Does the Archie Green Fellowship

01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:30.890
and the Occupational Folklife
Program provide those formal

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:34.340
and opportunities or is
it just Nancy's you ought

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:36.430
to talk to x, y, or z?

01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:37.730
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah.

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:44.320
I'm not trying to understand
the question.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.010
You mean talking with the--

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:49.710
&gt;&gt; How are you working with--

01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:51.010
&gt;&gt; Bob Bussel: Yeah.

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:53.150
&gt;&gt; Chris's project I
think came a year or two

01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:55.270
after the Oregon project.

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:56.570
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Right.

01:03:56.570 --> 01:04:01.140
&gt;&gt; Did you have access to their
lessons, their experiences or,

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:05.980
you know, were you reinventing
finding your own way and anything--

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:08.530
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh, you mean
across different projects?

01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:09.830
&gt;&gt; Among the researchers--

01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:11.130
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: -- project.

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:12.430
&gt;&gt; Correct.

01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:15.690
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Occasionally, very
often these come as local projects

01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:20.750
with a real community in
sense of point of view.

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:24.650
These will eventually
be available online.

01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:26.460
Right now they're not.

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:33.030
So, in some cases you heard-- I
forget-- it really depends on the--

01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:40.480
I don't routinely-- because this
is competitive and people apply

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:46.570
and are evaluated by the outside
panel of-- and are awarded.

01:04:46.570 --> 01:04:50.580
Sometimes I do put people in
touch with similar projects

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.400
that have occurred before.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:56.640
Sometimes I'm not in touch with
the applicants before the awards

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:57.940
are given.

01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:02.070
If there's a relevant project,
I often will try to hook them

01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:03.590
up after they receive the award.

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:09.630
But because of its-- We're
responding to applications

01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:15.280
from the field, it's-- There's only
so much control we have over it.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.760
Did I answer your-- Yeah.

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.050
All right, and I forget, did I
put you in touch with each other?

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.350
I think I had--

01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:23.650
&gt;&gt; Chris Mule: I don't know.

01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:24.950
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Did I
have you talk to Bob?

01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:26.250
&gt;&gt; Chris Mule: I don't think so.

01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:27.550
We didn't talk but now we can.

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:28.850
&gt;&gt; Bob Bussel: Because I
would say I mean it's just--

01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:30.150
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You can say
I want to talk to you after.

01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:31.450
&gt;&gt; Chris Mule: Yeah.

01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:32.750
Yeah, now it's--

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:34.050

so much overlap--

01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:35.350
&gt;&gt; Chris Mule: Yeah, yeah.

01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:36.650
Yeah.

01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:37.950

know, with our projects.

01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:39.250
That's really exciting.

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:40.550
I mean I would just say
that there have been people

01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:41.850
who were considering applying for
Archie Green grants that, you know,

01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:43.150
did get in touch with us.

01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:44.450
And so we had some
fruitful conversations

01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:47.970
about just our experience with the
program and any pointers we had.

01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:50.690
So, you know, those were
really conversations, and yeah,

01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:52.630
I look forward to this dialog--

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:02.010
Do you have questions
for each other?

want to talk to him afterwards.

I'm with the Teamsters Labor
History and Archives Project.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:20.020
And it's interesting that,
Chris, you said upfront

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:23.110
that the Domestic Workers
United is not a union--

01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:24.410

and doing the same sort

of work that Bobbie is doing.

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:31.890
Is it because that you're--
Bobbie, you're getting state money

01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:35.060
and with these people,
Chris, that there are

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:37.270
so many different employers
that are--

01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:38.570
There's no way to have
an election [inaudible]?

01:06:38.570 --> 01:06:40.020
&gt;&gt; Bobbie Sotin: Well,
I'll tell you one thing.

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:43.630
It's really hard to organize
people who are in individual homes.

01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:44.930
It's a tough job.

01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:47.450
It's a lot of work to
get people to organize.

01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:53.390 position:56%
Are you-- 503 is working on projects
right now to find a way for people

01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:58.700
to join a union, our union,
without being in a local.

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:03.350
So they can have a-- So they can
contribute to changing society

01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:05.440
and getting people
to understand what--

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.220
what needs aren't being
met out there.

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:11.590
So, I believe 503 is-- probably
would love to talk to you.

01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:13.710
So that's the reason why I
wanted to talk to you afterwards.

01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:15.010
&gt;&gt; Chris Mule: Yeah.

01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:17.100
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: I have to
say having listened to a lot

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:20.150
of your interviews, if I'm ever
sick, I'm moving to Oregon.

01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:24.110
&gt;&gt; Bobbie Sotin: We
would love to have you.

01:07:24.110 --> 01:07:28.530
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So it was just
so-- The people are so eloquent

01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:33.480
and so caring about their
charges and what it meant to them

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.780
and meant to their community.

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:37.980
It was very heartening to
listen to your interviews.

01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:39.280
&gt;&gt; Bobbie Sotin: If you ever--

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:42.520
If people out there watch the news
you will see Oregon is a leader

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.400
in changing the country.

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:49.330
And we continue-- And that we
are getting a lot of flack,

01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:53.340
a lot of people are putting money
into initiatives and stuff to try

01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.640
to stop things from passing.

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.730
But Oregonians are a
little hard to convince

01:07:57.730 --> 01:08:01.520
that we don't need what we need
and they're spending lots of money

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.900
that are probably is
going down the toilet.

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:05.690
That's what I-- That's
what I'm hoping.

01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:06.990
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yes?

01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:09.330
&gt;&gt; Thank you for a wonderful,
wonderful presentation.

01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:10.890
I mean I just find
it all fascinating.

01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:14.000
And one of the things that I'm
thinking about is the neighborhood

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.360
where I live which is very diverse.

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:20.470
There are a lot of people that are
barely making ends meet to those

01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:24.310
who aren't-- who are doing alright
but it's a very diverse community,

01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:27.310
a good number of immigrants
and a number of our neighbors

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:30.240
that we've gotten to know
do a lot of domestic work.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.750
They're working in
homes with individuals,

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:35.470
either people with disabilities
or taking care of children.

01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:38.570
And it's been really
fascinating getting to know them.

01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:42.480
And what this does for
me is it challenges me

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.110
to think more about
their experiences.

01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:46.530
I already have some insights
in terms of the complexities

01:08:46.530 --> 01:08:51.740
and disadvantages and even at times
mistreatment of these individuals.

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:55.610
So my question is as just being
a neighbor to people that come

01:08:55.610 --> 01:09:00.880
from these workgroups, what can
somebody like myself who feels

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.770
like they're being
increasingly educated

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:06.010
through this work do
to apply this at home?

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:09.110
What can I say to them to
say, hey, you're not alone,

01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:11.200
look what's happening
here over there.

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.870
Can you help me with that?

01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:15.170
&gt;&gt; Chris Mule: That's it.

01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:17.330
&gt;&gt; Bobbie Sotin: I would say
put them in touch with 503.

01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:18.630
&gt;&gt; Bob Bussel: Yeah.

01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:19.930
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: It might
be outside the scope

01:09:19.930 --> 01:09:22.060
of this particular project, but
I think it's a good question.

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:25.900
Maybe something we could discuss
over break which I think we have--

01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:29.260
which we might go to right now.

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:32.420
Why don't we-- Why
don't we take a break

01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:36.560
and discuss this further and-- Yes?

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.560
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:39.990
Does the panel with-- Yeah.

01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:41.290
I should know this.

01:09:41.290 --> 01:09:46.740
So, all the more reason that
we'll-- We'll go to the next panel.

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:50.590
And I want to thank everybody for
coming and this has been great.

01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:51.890
Thank you so much.

01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:53.190
&gt;&gt; Chris Mule: Thank you.

01:09:53.190 --> 01:09:54.490
Thank you.

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:55.790
[ Applause ]

01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:58.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: All right, today
you're going to hear from two people

01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:01.430
who are leading large scale
collecting efforts that end

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:03.780
up in a national library.

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:05.870
There are two very different models

01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:09.660
and they're leveraging
technology to do the work.

01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:12.070
You'll first hear from
Kevin Bradley.

01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:14.540
He's the senior curator
of research collections

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:17.670
and unpublished materials at the
National Library of Australia,

01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:21.770
and then you'll hear from Virginia
Millington who is the recording

01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:23.880
and archive director at StoryCorps.

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:25.180
All right.

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:26.670
Take it away.

01:10:26.670 --> 01:10:27.970
I'm so sorry.

01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:30.270
&gt;&gt; Kevin Bradley: That's all right.

01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:35.310
And I'm just going to wait a second

01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:38.890
for the right dramatic impact
and my slides to start.

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:54.250
OK, in 1902, the newly established
Australian Parliament passed the

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:57.820
Commonwealth Franchise Act, which
said a uniform law entitling women

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:01.780
to vote in federal elections and to
stand for the federal parliament.

01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:04.200
We were the second country
in the world to allow women

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.990
to vote in national elections.

01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:07.290
New Zealand was the first.

01:11:07.290 --> 01:11:09.150
And then those of you who
know anything about Australia

01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:12.370
and New Zealand know that
we have a great rivalry.

01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:15.600
So, I would like to say that women
were not eligible to be elected

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.620
in the House of Representatives
in New Zealand until 1919.

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:22.720
So we can claim a very
tiny moral high ground.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:26.880
The picture you're looking at
over there is the Regatta Hotel

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:30.330
which overlooks the Brisbane
River in Brisbane Queensland.

01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:32.000
So, you're asking yourself,
I know you are,

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.110
"How were these two
things connected?"

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:36.390
Why did I tell you this
piece of information

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:38.210
and show you the picture.

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:41.140
Well, I didn't want you to think
the country was run by prejudiced

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:46.050
and chauvinistic individuals when
I tell you that up until 1965,

01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:48.190
it was illegal for women
to be served drinks

01:11:48.190 --> 01:11:50.330
in the public bar of
a licensed hotel.

01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:57.160
In 1964-- '65, the law was changed
after two women chained themselves

01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:00.260
to the bar at the Regatta Hotel.

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:04.130
Their action, laugh you may, their
action is now recognized as one

01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:08.200
of the defining moments of second
wave feminism in Australia.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.700
And I hope the fact about the
women's suffrage might mitigate

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.990
slightly against the
embarrassing announcement.

01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:17.800
The second reason is it was
in this bar that after the end

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.220
of the successful meeting of
the Oral History Association

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:23.310
of Australia, Al Thompson, noted
oral historian and professor

01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:26.850
of history at Monash University,
and I were having a drink

01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:30.950
in what is now called Merle's
bar in honor of Merle Thornton,

01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:33.160
the woman you see chained
to the bar there.

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:36.110
Al was watching his team
lose the grand finals

01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:39.800
in the Australian Rules Football,
and I was trying to convince him

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.150
that we needed a large scale
oral history survey project

01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:45.780
to document social
change in Australia.

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:47.950
Part of my argument
was to use the example

01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:49.810
that public opinion
regarding attitudes

01:12:49.810 --> 01:12:53.960
to women drinking in
bars had so changed.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:58.790
That at this time, people can't
imagine was ever any other way.

01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:02.930
It has been so naturalized.

01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:05.640 position:56%
And in fact, I was explaining to one

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:10.210 position:56%
of my young staff what it was we're
doing and she was horrified to think

01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:13.130
that this was true and your
own mother would have known

01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:14.430
this situation.

01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:17.710
So this sort of cultural
forgetting is going on all the time

01:13:17.710 --> 01:13:20.530
and a large survey
project was needed.

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:22.760
For me, it was fill of
gap in our collection,

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:28.010
an update to a previous project
and Al agreed and led the project.

01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:31.770
He described it as to be a
major project to investigate

01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:34.910
into generational dynamics
and impact of dramatic social,

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:38.320
technological and environmental
changes on the experience

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.890
and attitudes of succeeding
Australian generations.

01:13:41.890 --> 01:13:44.930
And he was able just prior
to starting the project

01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:47.240 position:56%
to win a National Library fellowship

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:52.290
so that he can investigate the
1938 project which was run in 1988,

01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:56.170
which was the last similar
project to be run in Australia.

01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:57.610
Now, the project wasn't
run on its own.

01:13:57.610 --> 01:14:01.320
I listed here the many projects
would have been undertaken

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.090
in the past few years.

01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:07.020
Some projects have concentrated
on specific periods and events

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.110
like bush fires, or
unemployed drivers,

01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:11.960
members of religious
orders and so on.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:15.510
Some have been to nationally
significant issues

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:19.760
such as cultural context of
unemployment, Australia's response

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.220
to AIDS, the Bringing
Them Home project

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:24.490
about the indigenous
stolen generation,

01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:27.270
and the Forgotten Australians
and Former Child Migrants.

01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:29.250
Those brought up in care.

01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:31.070
Generations project,
the one that's sort

01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:33.890
of in this discussion is
the focus of the discussion

01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:37.400
and what we're talking about but it
shouldn't be considered on its own.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:41.960
It's part of a larger collection
or a larger set of projects as well

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:44.020
as what it finds on its own.

01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:45.360
So, the National Library,

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.340
all our interviews are
what we term hall of life.

01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:51.020
That is we try to embed
the topic we are pursuing

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.650 position:56%
in the context of a life trajectory.

01:14:53.650 --> 01:14:57.890
Their interviews with Australians
who ensure their life stories,

01:14:57.890 --> 01:15:00.720
memories, perspectives
and personal insights,

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.510
which in short say that
these are captured.

01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:06.410
We plan for all our interviews
to be around five hours long,

01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:08.680
some are shorter, most
are significant longer--

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:09.980
significantly longer.

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:12.580
If the interviewee wants to talk,

01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:15.800
we try to accommodate them even
though our interviewers will be

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.100
there to guide them.

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:20.160
Interviewers-- interviews
are a negotiation

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.240
but the interviewee should
be in the driver's seat.

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.770
And if they don't like the
interview, they have the right

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:27.640
to destroy it at any time.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:31.800
We have a true-- two-day training
for our generations project

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.390 position:56%
and all our interviewers are already
very experienced interviewers

01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:37.670
when they begin.

01:15:37.670 --> 01:15:40.450
Each interview focused on
a person's life history

01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:43.280
but for this particular
project, we had some themes

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.040
that we wanted to pick up as well.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.490
And so, those themes included
like faith and belief,

01:15:47.490 --> 01:15:50.700 position:56%
family and friends, place,
belonging, growing older, difference

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.310
or disability, leisure, play time,

01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:58.240
technological transformations
and so on.

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:00.610
Other themes grew out of
the interviews and one

01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:03.600
which surprised us all was the
occurrence in many interviews

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:06.610
of a deep and personal
discussion of mental health.

01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:10.030
Right. The interviewee has control

01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:12.150
over the recordings
for their lifetime.

01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:15.050
Unpublished collections are
acquired from individuals

01:16:15.050 --> 01:16:16.350
and this is from our themes.

01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:20.850
Generally, unpublished collections
require an ongoing relationship

01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:23.670
with the creators and
[inaudible] for their ease of use.

01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:25.660
We ingest the standards right forms

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:28.120
into our information
collection management system

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.770
and we manage them accordingly.

01:16:29.770 --> 01:16:32.240
Our project is selective.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:36.190
Unpublished collecting is
highly selective by its nature.

01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:40.010
Using-- There is no complete
set unless it's everybody.

01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:41.470
Using the priorities outlined

01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:44.270
in the library's principal
library staff exercise judgment

01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:46.660
to determine the significance
of materials

01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:50.630
and the research documentary or
historical value of a collection.

01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:53.490
But once we say we're going to
look at a topic or a subject,

01:16:53.490 --> 01:16:55.140
we look across our collection.

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:56.440
We look for papers.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:57.740
We look for photographs.

01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:02.680 position:56%
We look for the whole to embed an
entire research archive within them.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.520
The most valuable part of
the IRC research project is

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:09.210
that we can bring a range
of expertise to all sorts

01:17:09.210 --> 01:17:12.530
of projects issues of which
the selection process is an

01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:13.860
important one.

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:15.180
I still have five minutes.

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:17.480
I've just made it to six.

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:20.240
Generations.

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:23.390
We had far more volunteer to be
interviewed than we can possibly do

01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:25.580
and perhaps you can ask
me about that later.

01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:30.060
It was-- The Australians
Generations Project was funded

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.930
by the Australian Research Council,
which is a way of funding it

01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:35.620
and had two universities
within there,

01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:37.390
the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation

01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:40.300
and National Library as partners.

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:43.090
It ran over four years,
created around 2000 hours

01:17:43.090 --> 01:17:44.720
of oral history interviews,

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.880
and all the interviews
had time pointed summaries

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.720
like Doug was describing before.

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:54.330 position:56%
We had a similar sort of system that
we developed I think slightly ahead

01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:57.670
of you Doug but-- See, there's
another moral high ground.

01:17:57.670 --> 01:18:00.370
And we supplied all the
audio recording equipment

01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:03.260
and all the files are recorded
at broadcast word files to allow

01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:06.160
for long-term preservation.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:08.460
Two last points, we innovated

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:12.180
because we used a system called
Zotero for the researches.

01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:17.030
We packaged up those time pointed
summaries with all the information

01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:20.700
and the audio, and then you could--
The researchers could have access

01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:23.180
to that material only
and search the content.

01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:26.450
And then annotate them and share
the information between each other

01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:30.170
as they worked on the project
so it was a constrained part.

01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:32.610
And what we produced in the
end apart from the interviews,

01:18:32.610 --> 01:18:37.580 position:56%
which was the main part, there were
a series of national radio programs,

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:41.180
a number of papers in addition of
the Australian historical journal,

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:42.630
which is entirely dedicated

01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:45.250
to the Australian Generations
Project in a book.

01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:48.740
And the nice thing about the
book is published as an e-book

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.040
and I forgot to hit my slide.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.340
Is there more pictures?

01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:52.640
Yes, there is.

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:57.760
Zotero, group library, those sorts
of things, and that's the page.

01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:01.500
So, the e-book, we could use
our audio delivery system,

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:02.800
cite the content so that

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:06.160
when a person is reading the
book, they click on the link.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:09.860
It takes them to that place in
the complete five-hour interview

01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:13.760
and plays that part but then people
can begin to understand the context

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.000
and the relationship of
it to the larger story

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.770
and the larger narrative,
and of course,

01:19:17.770 --> 01:19:19.590
the larger libraries collection.

01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:21.510
I'll stop there.

01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:26.500
[ Applause ]

01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:37.090
&gt;&gt; Virginia Millington: Great.

01:19:37.090 --> 01:19:39.370
So, it's a real pleasure
to be here today.

01:19:39.370 --> 01:19:41.250
My name is Virginia Millington.

01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:45.010
And I'm the director of Recording
and Archive at StoryCorps.

01:19:45.010 --> 01:19:48.820
And one thing that has become
clear to me over the course

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:54.020
of the day is how situated
StoryCorps itself is as a project

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:58.640
within the precedence set by
the American Folklife Center

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.720
and in the work that's
being done today.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:04.200
And just to single out a few
people, the work of Doug Boyd

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:09.550 position:56%
and Bergis Jules continues to
influence our work and our progress.

01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:12.070
Next slide please.

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:18.070
&gt;&gt; Lola Kemp: OK, well,
Seymore [assumed spelling],

01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:20.500 position:56%
I think I'll start and I'll ask you.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.050
&gt;&gt; Seymore Kemp: Well,
you are first.

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:24.740
&gt;&gt; Lola Kemp: All right,
you ask me then.

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:30.400
My-- I'm Lola Kemp [assumed
spelling] and I'm 67 years old

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.570
and I'm here with my
husband, Seymore Kemp

01:20:34.570 --> 01:20:38.870
and we've been married
for 45 years in March.

01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:40.170
&gt;&gt; Seymore Kemp: It's very--

01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:41.470
&gt;&gt; Lola Kemp: Now tell
me who you are.

01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:42.770
&gt;&gt; Seymore Kemp: My
name is Seymore Kemp

01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:44.070
and I'm your husband,
aren't you thrilled?

01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:51.540
Anyhow, I was born in
Brunswick, New Jersey.

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:53.640
I live in Highland Park, New Jersey

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:56.120
across the river so
I'm not very far.

01:20:56.120 --> 01:21:02.340
And you say, we've been married
45 years and today we decided

01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:09.850
to ask questions we probably
never even thought of asking

01:21:09.850 --> 01:21:16.360
at all these 45 years,
but these questions will--

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.890
maybe will get some
nice answers, who knows?

01:21:19.890 --> 01:21:22.300
Anyhow, would you like to begin?

01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:23.600
&gt;&gt; Lola Kemp: All right,
I'll start then.

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:26.870
How would you describe
yourself as a child?

01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:28.170
Were you happy?

01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:31.060
&gt;&gt; Virginia Millington: So
that is a StoryCorps interview

01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:34.110
that was recorded within
the first few months

01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:39.590
of StoryCorps' beginning in 2003.

01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:48.720
And I love that interview or at
least the few seconds we heard

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:52.630
because it really illustrates
key principles essential

01:21:52.630 --> 01:21:53.930
to StoryCorps interviews.

01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:57.160
Those two participants
knew each other, obviously,

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.630
knew each other very well.

01:21:58.630 --> 01:22:02.990
And I think that you can hear
the sincerity and the sort

01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:06.150
of importance they're placing

01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:08.630
on the conversation
they were about to have.

01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:11.830
Every StoryCorps interview
was about 40 minutes long

01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:17.240
and we have encouraged although
we do not require people

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:21.770
to interview someone that they
know, maybe they love or maybe

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:24.400
as a friend, a colleague
and acquaintance.

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:28.830
And in that way I think that the
model that has been established

01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:34.130
within the StoryCorps collection
leads not only to the establishment

01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:36.850
of personal narratives,
of conversations

01:22:36.850 --> 01:22:41.940 position:56%
that reflect personal
relationships but also conversations

01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:47.890
that reflect broader
social, cultural

01:22:47.890 --> 01:22:51.650
and historical events, phases.

01:22:51.650 --> 01:22:57.600
And I think that it's that
combination of the personal

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.980
and the historical that makes
StoryCorps an interesting

01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:06.720
and unique collection and one
that we are happy to place

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:10.090
within the tradition of the
collections described today.

01:23:10.090 --> 01:23:13.830
I have a few numbers behind
me which I don't want to dwell

01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:18.800
on because those are not
the most important part

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:21.190
of what I'd like to talk about.

01:23:21.190 --> 01:23:26.480
But just to give you a sense of the
size of the StoryCorps collection,

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:32.590
at this point, we have
collected over 66,000 interviews

01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:38.350
in the last 13 years, that's
over 30,000 hours of audio.

01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:40.460
At this point, we have

01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:43.160
over a quarter million
participant photographs.

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:49.760
In 2015, we launched the StoryCorps
app which is an opportunity

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:55.700
for anyone with a phone or a tablet
to record StoryCorps interviews

01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:58.000
that are also archived at
the Library of Congress.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:07.820
Since the launch, over 85,000
interviews have been uploaded

01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:14.370
to StoryCorps.me, over a
hundred thousand users.

01:24:14.370 --> 01:24:20.560
In addition to these interviews,
we have over 700 edited broadcasts.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:24.640
We have animated shorts and
we have full length books

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.750
that contain interviews.

01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:31.120
At this point though, one of the
things that we're most interested

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:37.740
in doing is moving beyond
the curated approach

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:40.930
to StoryCorps collections
and thinking about how

01:24:40.930 --> 01:24:46.750
to make this amazing collection
which is comprised of interviews

01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:49.260
like the one you just heard,
more accessible, more usable

01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:52.720
and more helpful to
researchers, scholars,

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:56.130
the general public
and to communities.

01:24:56.130 --> 01:25:03.710
One of the things that we're
really excited about is thinking

01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:07.830
about this collection that we
have built with the full support

01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:12.200
and collaboration of the
American Folklife Center as a site

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:16.280
for research and scholarship
and education.

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:22.190
The slide you see behind me is just
one example of research potential

01:25:22.190 --> 01:25:24.380
of the StoryCorps collection.

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:28.400
This is actually a
transcript generated

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:34.350
by MIT's Lincoln Laboratory
in support of a project

01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:38.130
that tested a sociolinguistic idea

01:25:38.130 --> 01:25:41.520
against computer algorithmic
results.

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:46.100
We've heard from researchers who
are interested in studying all

01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:48.850
of our interviews between
teachers and students.

01:25:48.850 --> 01:25:52.500
We've heard from researchers that
are interested in studying faith

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.570
and belief within the
StoryCorps archive.

01:25:54.570 --> 01:25:58.060
And we've also heard from
researchers who were interested

01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:03.290
in specific collections, our
9/11 collection and others.

01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:08.010
In addition to the
potential for StoryCorps

01:26:08.010 --> 01:26:17.440 position:56%
to not only be a collection of great
importance to researchers, scholars

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:24.140
and others, we believe very,

01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:33.210
very strongly that the StoryCorps
collection represents a multitude

01:26:33.210 --> 01:26:35.110
of sites of engagement.

01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:39.090
Over the course of 13 years,
we've partnered with hundreds

01:26:39.090 --> 01:26:42.150
of different community partners

01:26:42.150 --> 01:26:45.760
and different organizations
across the country.

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:52.840
And it is our belief that those
partners make the possibility

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.850 position:56%
of the StoryCorps archive a reality.

01:26:55.850 --> 01:27:00.510
We don't consider our collection
to be a monolithic collection.

01:27:00.510 --> 01:27:03.690
We consider it to be a collection

01:27:03.690 --> 01:27:06.000
of multiple relationships
and partnerships.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.900
The two partnerships
I've highlighted here,

01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:11.760
the first you can see an exhibition
that use the StoryCorps interviews

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.130
that was created to commemorate the
Robert W. Saunders Public Library

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:17.430
in Tampa, Florida.

01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:20.020
And the second was a
memory map that was created

01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:21.840
by the Oakland China Town
Oral History Project,

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:23.140
in which StoryCorps
interviews were situated

01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:24.440
within a Google Map of
important locations.

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:25.740
I'm not sure--

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.040
&gt;&gt; My father had a bakery shop, was
the first black bakery in Tampa.

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:28.340
It was called Tasty Bakery Shop.

01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:29.640
And I remember I was just
like 4 or 5 years old.

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:30.940
And I remember being-- hanging
out the front door standing

01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:32.240
and watching the business, the cars
and the people walking up and down

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.540
with those lot entertainment,
entertainers,

01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:34.840 position:56%
that was the chilling circuit of all
the entertainers who come in town.

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.140
And they would walk
down the sidewalk.

01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.440
So you would see the entertainers
during the day and the night.

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.740
They would come to my father's
bakery shop and buy pastries,

01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:40.040 position:56%
donuts and twist which he was famous
for, the donuts and the twist.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.670
The twist donuts was the-- that
was the favorite amongst the cakes

01:27:41.670 --> 01:27:42.970
and the pies.

01:27:42.970 --> 01:27:44.270
But the twist donuts was
one of the favorites.

01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:45.570
&gt;&gt; Virginia Millington: So I
use that example which was used

01:27:45.570 --> 01:27:46.870
in the exhibition because
I think it displays a--

01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:48.170
one thing that I think
is very important

01:27:48.170 --> 01:27:49.470
about the StoryCorps collection,
it contains moments so specific

01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:50.770
and so local that you can
see how the public that comes

01:27:50.770 --> 01:27:52.070
to this exhibition opening would
respond in an almost visceral way

01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:53.370
to those memories of food.

01:27:53.370 --> 01:27:54.670
And I think that to consider
the StoryCorps collection as one

01:27:54.670 --> 01:27:55.970
of intense locality and specificity
but collected on a large scale,

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:57.270 position:56%
opens up the possibilities and opens

01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:58.570
up the possibilities
for collaboration.

01:27:58.570 --> 01:27:59.870
We are eager to make the StoryCorps
collection more accessible

01:27:59.870 --> 01:28:01.170
and we are grateful to funders
like the National Endowment

01:28:01.170 --> 01:28:02.700
for the Humanities for helping
us to do, to achieve this goal.

01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:04.050
We believe that by making
this collection accessible,

01:28:04.050 --> 01:28:05.850 position:56%
by allowing for community access and
collaboration with the collection,

01:28:05.850 --> 01:28:07.290
we can do more than capture
the stories of communities

01:28:07.290 --> 01:28:08.590
and individuals across the country.

01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:10.050
We could use them to enhance and
amplify and celebrate the voices

01:28:10.050 --> 01:28:11.350
of people all across the country.

01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:12.650
So to end, I'm excited to
join this conversation.

01:28:12.650 --> 01:28:13.950
And we are excited to work towards
a place where the collection

01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:15.450
that we are privileged enough
to hear every day at StoryCorps

01:28:15.450 --> 01:28:16.860
and the Library of Congress
can be made accessible

01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:18.160
and useful for a broader public.

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.960
Thank you.

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:24.970
[ Applause ]

01:28:24.970 --> 01:28:27.790
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: OK, 30
minutes is just not enough time

01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:32.730
to get-- to get too far.

01:28:32.730 --> 01:28:34.800
Where to begin?

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:38.610
So can you guys talk about both

01:28:38.610 --> 01:28:41.790
of you are doing large
scale collecting work.

01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:46.140
What's the primary impact in being
able to collect at this scale

01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:54.210
and what is the-- what's the
most challenging aspect to that?

01:28:54.210 --> 01:28:56.400
&gt;&gt; Virginia Millington:
I could start.

01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:01.940
So, we record-- Can everyone hear
me-- 5000 interviews per year,

01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:05.740
through our traditional StoryCorps
methods which include stationeries,

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:08.700
story booths in Chicago,
San Francisco and Atlanta.

01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:12.080
Teams of facilitators which I
think really actually hearken back

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.350
to the field workers that
we've heard from today.

01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:18.130
Teams of facilitators
that go across the country

01:29:18.130 --> 01:29:19.910
in an actual Airstream trailer

01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:23.300
that cycles the country
recording stories.

01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:26.610
We have cataloging systems in place

01:29:26.610 --> 01:29:31.110 position:56%
where our facilitators will tag each
interview, will create log notes

01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:34.410
for each interview and will
describe each interview.

01:29:34.410 --> 01:29:36.990
So that by the time it comes
to our archive department,

01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:39.710
there's enough metadata
to make it describable.

01:29:39.710 --> 01:29:42.820
Without that, I think we would face
a lot of challenges in being able

01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:47.280
to access the information
within those interviews.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:51.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kevin Bradley: We kind of-- We
use a number of [inaudible] machines

01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:53.350
which we send around the country.

01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:54.650
We have interviewers who are all--

01:29:54.650 --> 01:29:57.640
as we said in the talk
are all contracted

01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:01.160
to undertake particular work and
we tend to contact them and do it.

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:03.690
And I negotiate the
arrangement with the interviewer.

01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:09.310 position:56%
Materials brought back to us because
I said in broadcast way format,

01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:12.220
we ingest that into our
collection management system.

01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:17.030
And we create access
points for our interviewers

01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:18.570
to create time pointing summaries

01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:20.640
which they create as
part of the process.

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:23.620
We ingest all of that into our
collection management system,

01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:26.500
create a package that we can then
export that people can use it

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:29.280
and match it up with the
rights document which may--

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:32.180
can then be made available
or not as we go along.

01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:37.610 position:56%
But the-- our Virginia automation is
a necessary part of anything you do.

01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:42.690
We have a small number of staff
that facilitate the interviews

01:30:42.690 --> 01:30:46.780
and manage miracles and
keeping those things going.

01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:49.350
And retaining contacts with
the individuals as well,

01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:52.540
as well as providing access to
the collection, whether it's open

01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:56.790
because it was [inaudible],
whether it was written permission

01:30:56.790 --> 01:31:00.080
or closed for a period of time.

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:03.060
Many of our interviewers could
be closed for the lifetime

01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.640
of the person, which is
part of the process as well.

01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:10.210
We feel that it's-- We'd rather
them talk as long as they like

01:31:10.210 --> 01:31:12.640
and tell us things that they
probably don't want out there

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:15.170
and providing the things
that they eventually hoped

01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:17.830
to have made available, so.

01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:19.530
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: I'm
[inaudible] that you use Zotero.

01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:21.530
Could you talk a little bit
about what that is for anybody

01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:25.020
who might not know and how that
helps facilitate your work?

01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:28.260
&gt;&gt; Kevin Bradley: Zotero we used
in the Generations Project only.

01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:29.560
It's not one we generally use.

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:33.840
And we use that because it was a
research project and had a team

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:38.320
of researchers working together
on a single base of material.

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:42.150
So our collection time pointing
system has the capability

01:31:42.150 --> 01:31:45.530
to export a package of
the audio and the content.

01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:50.270
Now Zotero is a-- It's sort
of like a super EndNote.

01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:52.500
You can manage also sorts
of information in it

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:55.750
so that you can annotate
and describe it

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:59.920
and then write your essays and it
all produce all citations for you.

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:04.260
But it also has the ability to
manage group research projects.

01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:07.980
So it allow multiple access
to folders and information

01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:09.620
and be able to share content.

01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:12.920 position:56%
So what I meant was is when a person
did an interview, they'd come back

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:18.000
and actually the-- in text or in
audio record their impressions

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.300
of the process in the interview.

01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:24.900 position:56%
So it's sort of a, you know, they
could put a note there for posterity

01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:28.440 position:56%
that says that was very hard to do
for these reasons or I had a problem

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.780
with the next door neighbor's
dog and we had to tie it

01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:32.440
up outside or whatever it is.

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.520
All those things add a
huge amount of context

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.710
to understanding an interview
when you remove from it.

01:32:37.710 --> 01:32:40.960
And but they could also go
in, search the time summaries

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:43.000
and annotate points in it as well.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.920
And there were some discussion
this morning about time,

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:49.240
about how you summarize with
those papers and with others.

01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:51.430
And that's a-- It's an
interesting process to think

01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:54.800
about how you label information,
how you put information in there.

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:57.540
And so we used Zotero for
the researchers to be able

01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:00.690
to collaborate and to
be able to work together

01:33:00.690 --> 01:33:04.460
to eventually produce a series
of very different chapters

01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:08.050 position:56%
about different topics but using the
same base materials that they did

01:33:08.050 --> 01:33:12.090
or as different radio programs
or different other sorts of app

01:33:12.090 --> 01:33:16.020
that comes that they produce
as part of the project.

01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:17.320
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: You're
talking metadata.

01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:19.160
It reminds me of some
conversations Virginia

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:22.030
and I have been having
about metadata.

01:33:22.030 --> 01:33:25.540
Do you want to talk any
about contextualizing those?

01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:26.840
&gt;&gt; Virginia Millington: Sure.

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:30.480
Well, we-- You know, as a
project that began 13 years ago,

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:34.280
we've certainly evolved
in the dozen or so years

01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:35.580
that we've been recording.

01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:36.880
And I was actually thinking a lot

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:41.060
about what our collecting practices
will look like in 10 or 20 years.

01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:46.600
When we began, we were using a
series of file maker databases,

01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:47.990
read-only file maker databases.

01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:51.940
We've moved on to a content
management system that's web-based.

01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:56.350
We used to provide or we
provide CDs to our participants.

01:33:56.350 --> 01:33:58.370
We're now moving to
a digital download.

01:33:58.370 --> 01:34:03.060
And in a similar way, our
metadata collection has expanded

01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:04.360
and been enhanced.

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:07.830 position:56%
I think also with the great
support of people like Maggie Kruesi

01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:10.100
at the American Folklife
Center, we--

01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:16.860 position:56%
When we began, interestingly enough
we collected demographic information

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:21.820
that was limited to I
believe religion and gender.

01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:24.100
And we collected information
about the inter--

01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:28.320
each interview that could be boiled
down to one sentence description.

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:34.490
At this point we collected multiple
points of metadata with the belief

01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:36.630
that when we make this
collection more accessible

01:34:36.630 --> 01:34:39.680
and even now the more
points of access the better.

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:42.210
So at this point we have
interview descriptions.

01:34:42.210 --> 01:34:44.000
We have time coded log notes.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.090
We have a set of keywords
that are actually based

01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:48.410
on the ethnographic thesaurus.

01:34:48.410 --> 01:34:52.570 position:56%
And we continually update that list.

01:34:52.570 --> 01:34:57.570
We are trying-- We are trying
to make our metadata even better

01:34:57.570 --> 01:35:00.770
and that's now we're thinking
about ways to embed things

01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:04.800 position:56%
like copyright statements within
our audio files and our photographs.

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.880
But it's an evolving process.

01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:09.730
We don't have transcripts
for all our interviews

01:35:09.730 --> 01:35:12.650
and that's something we've--
we're continually thinking about.

01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:17.270
But we do believe that the
points of access we have

01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:21.740
at least provide a baseline for
first of all its searchability.

01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:23.720
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Anything
you want to add?

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:26.610
&gt;&gt; Kevin Bradley: Well, we can
start the whole conversation again.

01:35:26.610 --> 01:35:28.860
I think it's a very
exciting topic all around.

01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:31.200
You stated that that was
so much fun, but let's go.

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:32.930
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: I
was going to say, well,

01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:34.710
let's just open it up
for some questions.

01:35:34.710 --> 01:35:37.500
We just have a couple of
minutes but let's try.

01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:40.510
Does anyone have anything?

01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:45.220
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:46.880
Not that I saw, but I might have.

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:48.180
&gt;&gt; Kevin Bradley: The
mic is coming to you.

01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:49.480
Here it is.

01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:50.780
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Sorry, I--

01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:52.080
&gt;&gt; Hogging the floor.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:53.380
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: I saw you.

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:54.680
You're the closest.

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:55.980
&gt;&gt; I was impressed by the
first session this morning

01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:58.620
where we were hearing about
social media and the way

01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:07.370
in which people want to use social
media resources as a resource

01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:09.600
for strategy or research
and of course sometimes

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:12.230
that will be individuals
looking for individual topics.

01:36:12.230 --> 01:36:16.630
But there's also there's always
the theme of mass analysis

01:36:16.630 --> 01:36:18.420
or data mining or something
like that.

01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:23.840
So I'm curios in either of these
oral history projects, is--

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:28.000
do you get signals from
researchers who wish

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.640
that somehow they could
data mine the collection

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:36.480
and can you imagine any
way that might happen?

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:37.900
&gt;&gt; Kevin Bradley: Well, yes we do.

01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:39.890
Sorry, I jumped in first.

01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:42.470
And, yeah, we do quite a bit
and we certainly are engaged

01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:44.200
with the digital humanities
community a bit

01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:46.080
and discussing the way we do it.

01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:51.320
Part of it is the way
we expose our content.

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:54.360
So the stuff that's publicly
available is exposed through trove

01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:58.380
which is like the DPLA
Australian version.

01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:01.150
So it harvests all the
metadata that's inside the time

01:37:01.150 --> 01:37:02.450
pointed summaries.

01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:05.370 position:56%
And you can go-- you can now go
there and download that information.

01:37:05.370 --> 01:37:07.590
We have had people do that and
they'll bring that information

01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:10.350
and then represent it
in other sorts of ways.

01:37:10.350 --> 01:37:14.180
It's limited in that it
would be nice to get--

01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:19.790 position:56%
I would like to be able to allow
searching of the non-expose content,

01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:22.720
but not expose the results is
the other part I'd like to do,

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:24.020
which is sort of a complex way

01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:26.880
of saying how we can do
the whole collection rather

01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.650
than just the parts that
are publicly available

01:37:28.650 --> 01:37:30.810
without breaching the trust
of the people we have.

01:37:30.810 --> 01:37:35.730
But, yeah, it's currently
there for people to do

01:37:35.730 --> 01:37:37.850
and people are more
comfortable working

01:37:37.850 --> 01:37:40.310 position:56%
with pictures type approaches to it,

01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:42.090
but there has been
some audio approaches

01:37:42.090 --> 01:37:45.660
as well representing a data
and otherwise finding content,

01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:48.150
mining it for other
sorts of information.

01:37:48.150 --> 01:37:54.810
&gt;&gt; It tend to be political history
questions or social theories?

01:37:54.810 --> 01:37:58.040
&gt;&gt; Kevin Bradley: Mostly I think
there are people trying to figure

01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:00.590
out what they can do with
it more than anything else.

01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:06.360
I think the main research is we're
getting the people who are wanting

01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:12.010
to use the technology and
seeing how far they can push it.

01:38:12.010 --> 01:38:18.210 position:56%
I think politics will-- those sorts
of things will definitely come next.

01:38:18.210 --> 01:38:19.510
&gt;&gt; Did they not talk [inaudible]?

01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:20.810
&gt;&gt; Virginia Millington: Yes.

01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:22.110
Absolutely.

01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:23.410
We've heard from quite
a few researches.

01:38:23.410 --> 01:38:27.000
Actually one just on last Friday
who want to use the collection

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.510
for large scale data processing.

01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:33.680
We hear from people actually
who are very interested

01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:36.540
in speech recognition and, you
know, I just want to mention

01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:42.470
that while we're so interested in
these inquiries, one of the reasons

01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:48.380
that we haven't been able to
fully fulfill this request is

01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:54.360 position:56%
because we're going about making
the collection more accessible again

01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:58.150
with the collaboration of
Library of Congress in a way that,

01:38:58.150 --> 01:39:02.190
as you just said, respects the
participants' wishes, their intent

01:39:02.190 --> 01:39:03.550
and their own perspective

01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:06.520
on the interview materials
they've contributed.

01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:10.720
So, I fully imagine in a
few years or even later

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.950
than that our collection
will be used

01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:14.280
for large scale research request.

01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:15.860 position:56%
But at this point we're only hearing

01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:17.450
about those requests not being
able to act on them too much.

01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:18.750
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Sadly, I'm going
to have to leave it right there.

01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:20.050 position:56%
It was-- We hardly got started but--

01:39:20.050 --> 01:39:21.350
&gt;&gt; Kevin Bradley: I had
questions for Virginia.

01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:22.650
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Did you--
Do you-- Well, I mean--

01:39:22.650 --> 01:39:23.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kevin Bradley: We'll do it later.

01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:25.250
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: I encourage you
all to catch them on the break.

01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:26.550
So, thank you.

01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:27.850
[ Applause ]

01:39:27.850 --> 01:39:29.150
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So our next
collection feature is going to be

01:39:29.150 --> 01:39:31.230
about the Sidney Robertson
Cowell Collection here

01:39:31.230 --> 01:39:33.310
in the American Folklife
Center Archive.

01:39:33.310 --> 01:39:37.370
And there's no better person
to introduce that collection

01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:39.440
than my colleague Cathy Kerst.

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:43.430
And I've been privileged to work
with Cathy Kerst now for 11 years

01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:45.710
and she is the source of knowledge

01:39:45.710 --> 01:39:48.570
on the Sidney Robertson Cowell
Collection among many other things.

01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:52.210
She is a folklorist and she's
a cataloger and she's been

01:39:52.210 --> 01:39:53.620
with the AFC for a long time.

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:56.400
And in fact, she has
quite recently retired.

01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.280
She's the most recent
person to retire

01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:00.310
from our staff and we miss her.

01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:04.590 position:56%
But the nice thing is that she is
volunteering and coming back to work

01:40:04.590 --> 01:40:07.370
on the Sydney Robertson Cowell
Collection and she's working

01:40:07.370 --> 01:40:10.510
on a book based on this collection.

01:40:10.510 --> 01:40:12.570
So, Cathy Kerst is
going to tell us now

01:40:12.570 --> 01:40:15.400
about the Sidney Robertson
Cowell Collection.

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Thank you Steve.

01:40:17.410 --> 01:40:20.070
Lady on Wheels.

01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:24.350
In a draft of an undated manuscript
entitled "Lady on Wheels" written

01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:29.840 position:56%
by Sidney Robertson Cowell probably
in the 1950s, she drafted a proposal

01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:32.580
for a series of programs,
as she put it,

01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:35.710
about the life of a lady on wheels.

01:40:35.710 --> 01:40:39.190
She explained, "Most of you
know that my chief preoccupation

01:40:39.190 --> 01:40:43.920
for a long time has been the
quote 'Music that's gifted to us',

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:48.130
as an old lady in North Carolina
once defined folk music to me."

01:40:48.130 --> 01:40:51.420
Robertson traveled
thousands of miles in her car,

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:55.610
accompanied by her dog, collecting
traditional music and song

01:40:55.610 --> 01:40:59.210
from the 1930s into the 1950s.

01:40:59.210 --> 01:41:05.850
In the "Lady on Wheels" proposal
she wrote, "Folksong is song alive.

01:41:05.850 --> 01:41:10.750
It seems to me that folk song has
gone on living only where new ways

01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:14.990
and new uses for it could give
it freshness and vitality."

01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:19.200
Throughout her ethnomusicological
research, Robertson had no use

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:22.410
for song as remnant or survival.

01:41:22.410 --> 01:41:25.030
It was living song
that she was after.

01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:27.930
And luckily for us here at
the Library of Congress,

01:41:27.930 --> 01:41:31.190
she left her perceptive
and colorful descriptions

01:41:31.190 --> 01:41:35.000
of the music she recorded and
the performers who sang for her

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.020
in ample field notes,
correspondences--

01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:41.630
correspondence and reminiscences
both in the music division

01:41:41.630 --> 01:41:44.610
at the library here and the
American Folklife Center.

01:41:44.610 --> 01:41:50.810
Robertson was born Sidney William
Hawkins in 1903 in San Francisco.

01:41:50.810 --> 01:41:54.520
Precocious, curious and
gregarious from an early age.

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:57.870
She graduated in Romance
languages from Stanford,

01:41:57.870 --> 01:42:03.390 position:56%
studied music in Paris, and attended
Jung seminars in Zurich and London.

01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:08.090
By the late 1920s, Robertson was
back in California teaching music

01:42:08.090 --> 01:42:11.820
at the progressive Peninsula
School in Menlo Park,

01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:15.520
and excited to be attending
lectures on world music

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:17.850
at the San Francisco
Conservatory given

01:42:17.850 --> 01:42:21.590
by composers Ernest
Bloch and Henry Cowell.

01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:25.980
Here I will refer to
her as Robertson,

01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:28.460
the name she acquired
from her first marriage.

01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:32.380
Later, after the California project
and her marriage to Henry Cowell,

01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:34.810
she was called Sidney
Robertson Cowell.

01:42:34.810 --> 01:42:39.130
Here's a picture taken
in 1929 when she was

01:42:39.130 --> 01:42:42.420
in her 30s-- in her 20s, excuse me.

01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:45.580
In 1936, while visiting
friends in Washington,

01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:49.690
Robertson met Charles Seeger,
then in charge of the music unit

01:42:49.690 --> 01:42:51.860
at the Resettlement Administration.

01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:54.830
She soon became his
assistant and also proficient

01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:57.930
at making instantaneous
disc recordings.

01:42:57.930 --> 01:43:01.050
As she put it, "I got
hooked on the work

01:43:01.050 --> 01:43:04.390
and the wonderful hopeful
and dedicated new deal.

01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:08.570
So when Charlie asked me to
stay on, I couldn't resist."

01:43:08.570 --> 01:43:11.920
With Resettlement and then the
Farm Security Administration,

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:16.620
Robertson traveled thousands of
miles on her own making hundreds

01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:19.540
of recordings of traditional
music throughout the south,

01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:22.100
the Ozarks and into the Midwest.

01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:25.920
When funds from Washington for
further recording dried up,

01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:31.240
she gave her remaining contacts
to Alan Lomax for his later forays

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:35.860
into Croatian, Finnish, and other
communities in the Upper Midwest

01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:38.250
and she returned to San Francisco.

01:43:38.250 --> 01:43:42.510
There she hoped to create a survey
of northern California folk music

01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:45.470
on her own by recording
English language

01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:48.980
and what she called minority
immigrant groups supported

01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:53.720
through the WPA, the Works
Project Administration.

01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:55.450
Without giving much background here

01:43:55.450 --> 01:43:58.490
on the complicated process
it entailed, let me just say

01:43:58.490 --> 01:44:02.310
that she was successful and
it was quite an achievement.

01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:06.330
Robertson was 33, energetic,
outgoing and eager

01:44:06.330 --> 01:44:11.340
to record what people were singing
wherever and whenever she could.

01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:15.280
She secured co-sponsorship for
the project from the Library

01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:19.050
of Congress, which among other
things sent blank acetate discs

01:44:19.050 --> 01:44:20.960
for making recordings.

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:23.110
And from the University
of California Berkeley,

01:44:23.110 --> 01:44:26.650
she was provided an
office on Shattuck Avenue

01:44:26.650 --> 01:44:31.170
for 20 workers she handpicked
from the California relief rolls

01:44:31.170 --> 01:44:34.030
and were required by the WPA.

01:44:34.030 --> 01:44:39.030
Once the project opened, Robertson
supervised the staff during the day

01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:43.470
and in the evenings and on the
weekend she took her baby portable

01:44:43.470 --> 01:44:46.900
presto recording machine as she
called it, new on the market

01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:52.390
at that time, out and about to
make recordings wherever she could.

01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:55.880
Here she is making copies
for the Library of Congress

01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:57.180
of the recordings that were made.

01:44:57.180 --> 01:45:03.560
So from October 1938 through early
1940, Robertson recorded 35 hours

01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:07.350
of music from numerous California
performers on the project.

01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:11.740
WPA staff took photos and made
technical drawings of many

01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:13.380
of the musical instruments.

01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:15.810
She hoped that her project
would become a prototype

01:45:15.810 --> 01:45:18.650
for the collection of folk
music across the country,

01:45:18.650 --> 01:45:20.930
something that had
never been done before,

01:45:20.930 --> 01:45:25.710
especially with the inclusion of
the music of recent immigrants.

01:45:25.710 --> 01:45:29.770
It is really hard to describe
the breadth of genres recorded

01:45:29.770 --> 01:45:33.420
from so many cultural
groups in 10 minutes.

01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:37.230
Two thirds of the recording were
what she called minority groups.

01:45:37.230 --> 01:45:42.710
She was sensitive as we are
now about the word foreign.

01:45:42.710 --> 01:45:47.190
She-- So she called the minority
groups Armenians, Basques, Finns,

01:45:47.190 --> 01:45:50.270
and you see this quite
impressive list.

01:45:50.270 --> 01:45:54.260
Then one third of the collection
was English-language material.

01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:58.560
And she even went so far as to call
some of the migrants from Wisconsin

01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:03.650
in the Upper Midwest immigrants to
sort of level the playing ground

01:46:03.650 --> 01:46:05.340
of what she was recording.

01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:07.570
She was very aware of this.

01:46:07.570 --> 01:46:11.730
In the September 1938 San Francisco
Chronicle article, Robertson wrote

01:46:11.730 --> 01:46:14.210
about California's
rich cultural heritage,

01:46:14.210 --> 01:46:17.890
including the Native
Americans, the early Spanish

01:46:17.890 --> 01:46:20.960
and Portuguese arrivals,
and the discovery of gold

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:25.420
which brought settlers from five
continents and the seven seas.

01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:28.280
How can we believe that
these successive waves

01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:31.600
of hardworking citizens
contributed nothing

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:34.890
to California beyond
the work of their hands?

01:46:34.890 --> 01:46:36.820
What traditions came with them?

01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:40.290
What were they thinking and
feeling as they labored in mines

01:46:40.290 --> 01:46:45.730
and forests, herding cattle and
sheep along the slopes, plowing

01:46:45.730 --> 01:46:49.070
and harvesting in the valleys
and fishing along our coasts?

01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:52.240
Their songs will tell
us if we can find them.

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:54.580
How does one find songs, she asked.

01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:56.350
They are everywhere at hand.

01:46:56.350 --> 01:46:59.030
A man changing a tire
on Shattuck Avenue

01:46:59.030 --> 01:47:03.560 position:56%
in Berkeley last month sang an old
ballad as he worked and was startled

01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:07.470
by an urgent request to repeat
it so it could be written down.

01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:10.220
A receipt for a bill for a rail--

01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:13.780
paid to a railway express
deliveryman was signed

01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:15.420
with a Basque name.

01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:18.120
This led to a whole nest of songs.

01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:22.440
And one man in Chester County
offered to outsing the gas tank

01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:24.510
if he might ride along to Fresno.

01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:31.060
My thought is to give you a
teeny taste of the recordings.

01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:35.680
These two recordings, if I
can fit them in, are portions,

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:40.520
feature songs about
the homeland that many

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:45.630
of the immigrants left behind
central to the story of migration.

01:47:45.630 --> 01:47:47.530
This is Rouben Baboian.

01:47:47.530 --> 01:47:51.560
Robertson attended all sorts
of events of the Armenians,

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:56.790
visited their coffee shops and she
was entranced by the lively variety

01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:59.690
of music making she
found in the community.

01:47:59.690 --> 01:48:04.210 position:56%
Her field reports tell that Mr.
Baboian was an unusually fine singer

01:48:04.210 --> 01:48:06.170
who had learned all
his songs as a boy

01:48:06.170 --> 01:48:10.920
in the Armenian mountains near
Van, currently in Eastern Turkey.

01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:13.450
The role of folk singer
was traditionally

01:48:13.450 --> 01:48:15.620
in his father's family, she wrote.

01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:18.610
And he learned these songs
in the pure Armenian style,

01:48:18.610 --> 01:48:21.360
free of any Turkish taint.

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:26.420
Andouni is an Armenian folk song
often translated as the homeless.

01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:30.900
Following the First World War and
the Armenian genocide in 1915,

01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:32.420
that included massacres

01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:35.940
and deportations near
Baboian's original home.

01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:39.730 position:56%
And this song has become
emblematic of the losses experienced

01:48:39.730 --> 01:48:43.680
by Armenians and continues to
hold great symbolic meaning

01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:45.980
for those in the diaspora.

01:48:47.510 --> 01:49:12.830
[ Singing ]

01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:14.840
Next slide, please.

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:19.810
Elinor Rodriguez was one of
three women from Puerto Rico

01:49:19.810 --> 01:49:24.810
who sang children songs and games,
Christmas songs or aguinaldos

01:49:24.810 --> 01:49:28.290
and other popular tunes
for Robertson in Oakland

01:49:28.290 --> 01:49:30.070
where many Puerto Ricans migrated.

01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:34.730
And Elinor Rodriguez's
version of "Lamento Borincano",

01:49:34.730 --> 01:49:37.370
a sense of heartfelt
emotion and deep longing

01:49:37.370 --> 01:49:41.160
for Puerto Rico infused her
singing although her pronunciation

01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:43.350
and articulation reflect the fact

01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:46.860
that she was a second
generation Puerto Rican.

01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:54.500
[ Singing ]

01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:03.340
OK.

01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:24.130
[ Singing ]

01:50:24.130 --> 01:50:26.480
This popular bolero
was and continues

01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:30.510
to be a heartfelt song among Puerto
Ricans with his nostalgic imagery

01:50:30.510 --> 01:50:34.040
and sense of longing
for the homeland.

01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:38.660
So this has been a mere
glimpse of the valuable

01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:42.160
and expensive California folk
music project collection organized

01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:45.430
and carried out single handedly
by a remarkable, ambitious

01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:49.030
and open-minded collector
in only 17 months

01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:51.350
in California during the new deal.

01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:53.790
There is much, much more
about this collection

01:50:53.790 --> 01:50:57.330
that I have absolutely no time
to talk about with you today

01:50:57.330 --> 01:51:00.040
but you can find most of
the collection online here

01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:04.730 position:56%
at the library on the California
Gold site including the photographs,

01:51:04.730 --> 01:51:07.240
the scale drawings,
the field reports,

01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:09.570
and all sorts of other things.

01:51:09.570 --> 01:51:13.820 position:56%
It will be migrated to Project One
soon so I don't know if it will look

01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:19.230
like this in the future, but
there's a lot to be discovered.

01:51:19.230 --> 01:51:21.030
Thank you very much.

01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:23.740
[ Applause ]

01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:25.040
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: We have this.

01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:26.650
Good. Mics are alive.

01:51:26.650 --> 01:51:27.950
My name is Todd Harvey.

01:51:27.950 --> 01:51:30.160
I'm a curator at the
American Folklife Center.

01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:34.980
I'm proud to be a member of the
American Folklife Center staff,

01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:39.130
an organization that can bring
together a group like this

01:51:39.130 --> 01:51:42.120
for a whole day and keep
them in their seats.

01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:44.570
It's pretty amazing.

01:51:44.570 --> 01:51:50.680
And I hope to continue to--
continue the discussion.

01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:55.830
The discussion to me has been
about collections and about access.

01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:58.280
And that's, of course, the two kind

01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:01.420
of central tenets of
working in archives.

01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:07.380
You have to gather the
materials and preserve them

01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:09.490
and you have to create access.

01:52:09.490 --> 01:52:12.450
And we work with that every day.

01:52:12.450 --> 01:52:20.230 position:56%
In 1932 or so, the Archive of
American Folk Song, as it was called

01:52:20.230 --> 01:52:26.240
at the time, consisted of about
900 wax cylinder recordings.

01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:35.630 position:56%
This year, we're going to accession
among other things Virginia's 85,000

01:52:35.630 --> 01:52:39.210
plus oral histories
with StoryCorps.me.

01:52:39.210 --> 01:52:42.600
So, there's a slight
shift in scale with that.

01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:45.400
And with that comes access, right?

01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:53.500
And in 1932, there was
no access to the archive.

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:57.620
This is the first point of
access that we had as an archive.

01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:02.170
And it's a 1934 publication,
the reading room's copy

01:53:02.170 --> 01:53:06.910
of "American Ballads and Folk
Songs" by John Lomax and Alan Lomax

01:53:06.910 --> 01:53:10.750
which contains among other
things transcriptions of some

01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:13.670 position:56%
of the recordings that they had made

01:53:13.670 --> 01:53:18.390
or that they had themselves
transcribed in the field.

01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:22.380 position:56%
They, you know, according to my
research there was no way for anyone

01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:26.500
to listen to any of those discs
if even they were at the archive.

01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:30.180
I think most of them were still
on the Lomax's possession.

01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:36.270
And so from this publication,
the paper publication, again,

01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:40.830
we have StoryCorps.me, which
is a brand new collection

01:53:40.830 --> 01:53:45.440
and there's instantaneous
access to that thing.

01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:50.610
So, we'll be talking about
different ways to access

01:53:50.610 --> 01:53:55.140
and different approaches to access
to the material in our archives.

01:53:55.140 --> 01:54:00.570
And we've assembled a panel
of notables that I would

01:54:00.570 --> 01:54:02.790
like to introduce to you.

01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:05.540
Next to me is Lance Ledbetter.

01:54:05.540 --> 01:54:13.180
He is the-- He and his wife April
are-- does the digital records.

01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:18.070 position:56%
And Lance, who's been a great friend
to the archive in publishing some

01:54:18.070 --> 01:54:22.130
of our materials and
we hope to cultivate

01:54:22.130 --> 01:54:27.160
that wonderful relationship
long into the future.

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:30.340
Kelly Navies is from the
Smithsonian National Museum

01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:32.760
of African-American
History and Culture.

01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:34.950
You just have to say the new museum

01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:37.720
and everyone knows what
you're talking about there.

01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:43.010
I can't imagine how we got her away
from there so close to the opening.

01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:44.460
&gt;&gt; Kelly Navies: It wasn't easy.

01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:46.890
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: But she's
here for a good reason

01:54:46.890 --> 01:54:54.570
and that is per Congress's
mandate we have worked with that,

01:54:54.570 --> 01:54:57.930
that museum to create the Civil
Rights Oral History Project.

01:54:57.930 --> 01:55:00.520
And Kelly has been integral to it

01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:05.350
as has John Bishop,
the man next to her.

01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:10.530
John was the-- is a filmmaker
and they let him out for the day

01:55:10.530 --> 01:55:14.690
from Los Angeles to
come and sit with us.

01:55:14.690 --> 01:55:17.210
And he was the-- He's the
man behind the camera.

01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:20.320
If you go to those oral
histories which are online

01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:23.490 position:56%
through the American Folklife
Center website, you'll see his work.

01:55:23.490 --> 01:55:26.420
And John has deep, deep roots

01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:30.250
with the American Folklife
Center going back to his work

01:55:30.250 --> 01:55:34.790
with Alan Lomax on "Land
Where the Blues Began"

01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:37.930
and a number of other projects.

01:55:37.930 --> 01:55:43.160
And then furthest away, Gabriela
Perez Baez from the National--

01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:46.700
Smithsonian National
Museum of Natural History.

01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:52.520
One of the great assets in our
collections are the recordings

01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:55.330
of native peoples of North America

01:55:55.330 --> 01:55:58.740
and South America and
Central America.

01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:01.070
And one project to bring those

01:56:01.070 --> 01:56:04.160
out into the world is
called Breath of Life.

01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:06.880
And I hope that you'll
talk about that.

01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:10.150
And I wonder if we'll-- We
should just start at that far end

01:56:10.150 --> 01:56:11.770
and work our way this direction.

01:56:11.770 --> 01:56:13.090
And I'll turn it over.

01:56:13.090 --> 01:56:17.220
&gt;&gt; Gabriela Perez Baez: Thank you.

01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:23.090
And so this is-- very good.

01:56:23.090 --> 01:56:25.530
OK. Well, thank you all for coming.

01:56:25.530 --> 01:56:29.810
I am the curator of linguistics
at the National Museum

01:56:29.810 --> 01:56:31.940
of Natural History in the
Anthropology Department.

01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:34.510
And I'm also the director
of Recovering Voices.

01:56:34.510 --> 01:56:39.610
And I'd like to talk to you a
little bit about Recovering Voices

01:56:39.610 --> 01:56:43.140
and I'll finish with-- in to talk--

01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:48.850
talking about the Breath of Life
Institute which is a big focus

01:56:48.850 --> 01:56:51.070
of our work in Recovering Voices.

01:56:51.070 --> 01:56:57.320
Sorry, I'm having to use
my two hands to navigate.

01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:02.580
It's a little confusing but--
So, the Recovering Voices as we'd

01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:06.220
like to call it a response from
the Smithsonian Institution

01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:09.530
to the language endangerment
and knowledge--

01:57:09.530 --> 01:57:13.810
endangerment of knowledge
systems crisis around the world.

01:57:13.810 --> 01:57:18.220
So, the 6 or 7000 languages
spoken around the world,

01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:23.250
it's known that at least a third,
if not more, are in the process

01:57:23.250 --> 01:57:26.380
of being replaced by the other
more dominant languages whether

01:57:26.380 --> 01:57:28.960
regionally or internationally
and it could--

01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:32.810
The forecast suggest
that as many as 90%

01:57:32.810 --> 01:57:36.430 position:56%
of these languages could potentially
go silent by the end of the century.

01:57:36.430 --> 01:57:37.940
So, what can the museum do?

01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:43.570
We have articulated an approach
based on research, on languages

01:57:43.570 --> 01:57:46.460
and knowledge systems to understand
the loss of cultural diversity

01:57:46.460 --> 01:57:48.980
and develop effective
responses to reverse it.

01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:52.320
This is based on access
to collections.

01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:55.590
So, this access is central to
the recovery and generation

01:57:55.590 --> 01:57:57.740
of knowledge in the process.

01:57:57.740 --> 01:58:00.080
And global impact is
achieved through partnerships

01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:02.490
with communities and
academic institutions,

01:58:02.490 --> 01:58:06.760
one of them being the
Library of Congress.

01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:12.960
What distinctive competence
do we offer?

01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:15.760
Among many assets at the museum,

01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:18.530
we have the National
Anthropological Archives.

01:58:18.530 --> 01:58:23.210
And also within the many assets
at the NAA are 9000 linear feet

01:58:23.210 --> 01:58:29.180
of manuscript dating back to the--
the bulk dates back to the 1800s

01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:32.420
but we have manuscripts
that go back to the 1600s

01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:34.820
from everywhere around the world.

01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:40.190
In addition, we have a very
extensive collection of film

01:58:40.190 --> 01:58:47.620
at the Human Studies Film Archives,
as well as photographs and artwork.

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:51.130
In-- Outside the archives
in our collections,

01:58:51.130 --> 01:58:58.250
we have over 126 million objects,
and that means natural specimens.

01:58:58.250 --> 01:59:01.440
It means mineral samples.

01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:06.320
It means ethnographic
material culture collections.

01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:09.750
So, the point is to
capitalize on these collections

01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:14.390
and on the intellectual capital
of the institution to be able

01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:16.210
to put these strengths
to the services

01:59:16.210 --> 01:59:19.140
of community based
researchers who are looking

01:59:19.140 --> 01:59:24.250 position:56%
to revitalize their languages,
their knowledge systems or cultures.

01:59:24.250 --> 01:59:27.770 position:56%
We have two programmatic and we
have several programmatic activities

01:59:27.770 --> 01:59:29.170 position:56%
but two of them that I want to focus

01:59:29.170 --> 01:59:32.420
on today are the Community Research
Program and the National Breath

01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:35.950
of Life Archival Institute
for Indigenous Languages.

01:59:35.950 --> 01:59:39.320
I'll just say National
Breath of Life for short.

01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:44.100
Community Research
Program, this is a program

01:59:44.100 --> 01:59:48.650
through which we fund
a visit to our museum

01:59:48.650 --> 01:59:51.630
or our institution collections,
not exclusively the museum,

01:59:51.630 --> 01:59:54.270 position:56%
for community research who have us--

01:59:54.270 --> 01:59:58.850
of an articulated project
for revitalization

01:59:58.850 --> 02:00:01.280
of language, of knowledge
or culture.

02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:08.670
And so we will fund up to $10,000
in travel expenses for a group,

02:00:08.670 --> 02:00:12.660
preferably intergenerational,
preferably interdisciplinary,

02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:17.870
but not tied to any specific
academic credentials to come

02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:21.400
and carry out research
in collections, again,

02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:26.840
at the National Museum of Natural
History or NMAI or any other unit

02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:29.630
in the Smithsonian
although it tends to--

02:00:29.630 --> 02:00:32.690
the research tends to
focus on the collections

02:00:32.690 --> 02:00:35.130
of the these two museums.

02:00:35.130 --> 02:00:40.480
And National Breath of Life,
the National Breath of Life,

02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:44.530
it follows the model of the
California Breath of Life

02:00:44.530 --> 02:00:50.200
which began in the 1990s and
takes place every two years.

02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:54.710
And it's some-- it's a training
program to provide capacity.

02:00:54.710 --> 02:00:57.390
It's a capacity build of--

02:00:57.390 --> 02:01:04.700
program to train researchers from
communities on research on archives

02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:08.930
and research in linguistics for the
purposes of language reclamation.

02:01:08.930 --> 02:01:12.750
At the origin in California,
the focus was on tribes

02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:15.960
who no longer had first
language speakers.

02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:21.150
This later expanded and
two institutes were held

02:01:21.150 --> 02:01:23.420 position:56%
in Oklahoma at the Sam Noble Museum.

02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:27.820
We have held three National
Breath of Life Institutes

02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:30.230
and we now have funding secured

02:01:30.230 --> 02:01:33.310 position:56%
from the National Science Foundation
Documenting Endangered Languages

02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:41.860
program to hold the 2017 institute
May 29 to June 9th of next year.

02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:46.530
So, the point is to
bring researchers to DC

02:01:46.530 --> 02:01:49.030
so that they can have access
to the unparalleled collections

02:01:49.030 --> 02:01:51.290
at the National Museum
of Natural History,

02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:54.080
notably the Anthropological
Archives, the National Museum

02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:59.210
of the American-Indian and
the Library of Congress.

02:01:59.210 --> 02:02:03.180
The objective is to familiarize
participants with the holdings

02:02:03.180 --> 02:02:06.970
at these institutions, teach
fundamentals of linguistics

02:02:06.970 --> 02:02:10.200
so that they can begin to read
and interpret the materials.

02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:13.110
So, for this purpose each
participant gets paired

02:02:13.110 --> 02:02:17.370
up with an academically
trained linguist.

02:02:17.370 --> 02:02:21.570 position:56%
And from day one they work on the
analysis of manuscripts on languages

02:02:21.570 --> 02:02:23.500
that they're interested in.

02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:28.390
They discuss and demonstrate ways
that materials can be utilized

02:02:28.390 --> 02:02:31.500
for purposes of language
revitalization and learning

02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:34.530
and provide optional short
sessions on computer technology,

02:02:34.530 --> 02:02:37.990 position:56%
dictionary development, song
writing, writing systems, et cetera.

02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:44.120
We are-- We have now worked
with over 50 languages

02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:48.240
and we'll add another
14 or 15 in 2017.

02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:53.130
It has been critical to
partner with the Library

02:02:53.130 --> 02:02:57.720
of Congress especially
given our joint history tied

02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:00.950
to the Federal Cylinder Project.

02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:04.210
So, the materials here,
the songs are--

02:03:04.210 --> 02:03:09.340
the prayers are really
critical to these researchers.

02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:12.980
These researchers get very
technical linguistics training

02:03:12.980 --> 02:03:15.850
so that they can decide
for so to speak some

02:03:15.850 --> 02:03:20.080
of the language documentation
produce by linguists.

02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:23.850
But they're really, really
more interested in being able

02:03:23.850 --> 02:03:27.690
to regain cultural knowledge
that is in these collections.

02:03:27.690 --> 02:03:31.500
And in that respect, the Library of
Congress collection is essential.

02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:32.800
Thank you.

02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:34.600
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Thank you.

02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:39.150
[ Applause ]

02:03:39.150 --> 02:03:40.450
Mr. Bishop.

02:03:40.450 --> 02:03:42.130
&gt;&gt; John Bishop: Well, I'm
not sure why I'm on the panel

02:03:42.130 --> 02:03:48.130
because mostly I should film and
edit film and produce things.

02:03:48.130 --> 02:03:52.310
But as a freelance
camera person I'm often--

02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:57.520
I'm involved in large scale
doc-- we call documentation.

02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:01.730
I work with the Dance
Department at UCLA and, you know,

02:04:01.730 --> 02:04:06.730 position:56%
did films on Hawaiian dance, did
several projects on Cambodian dance.

02:04:06.730 --> 02:04:12.490
And one thing that
I realized in make--

02:04:12.490 --> 02:04:16.250
in shooting documentation is

02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:19.380
that people don't really
want to be documented.

02:04:19.380 --> 02:04:22.010
They want to be loved.

02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:26.480
And it's in a-- Say it's a--
Actually it sounds like a joke

02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:29.070
but it's very, very true.

02:04:29.070 --> 02:04:33.240
They're engaging with
you when you're shooting.

02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:34.540
It can be a dance.

02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:36.300
They're not going to
show you the steps,

02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:38.750
they're going to dance for you.

02:04:38.750 --> 02:04:42.410
On people when we do the civil
rights oral history interviews,

02:04:42.410 --> 02:04:44.840 position:56%
we're not just getting a story told.

02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:47.520
They are performing
the story for us.

02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:54.270
And the resulting tape is
a glimpse into that moment

02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:56.510
when this information was shared.

02:04:56.510 --> 02:04:58.710
There's a lot more valence to it

02:04:58.710 --> 02:05:02.140
than just what can be
abstracted from the words.

02:05:02.140 --> 02:05:07.720
And I just wanted to mention that
as something that should be kept

02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:11.260
in mind that it's very
easy when you're--

02:05:11.260 --> 02:05:14.350
what it used to be now with the--
now I just use my cellphone.

02:05:14.350 --> 02:05:17.850
But in the olden days when
you were on photographing

02:05:17.850 --> 02:05:22.720 position:56%
with like they're doing in the back,
it's easy to get lost up and swept

02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:28.020
up in your technology,
you know, your craft.

02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:33.060
And in the kind of work we all
do, it's much more important

02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:36.830 position:56%
to nail the craft before you go out.

02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:40.570
Know how to get it into focus,
make a nice composition.

02:05:40.570 --> 02:05:44.050
And then you're engaged--
You as a crafts person,

02:05:44.050 --> 02:05:47.510
you're actually engaged in a
communication with the person.

02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:52.000
On the oral history
interviews, we'd-- We have--

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:55.940
usually just myself
and the oral historian.

02:05:55.940 --> 02:06:04.930
And it's a relationship
in those two hours.

02:06:04.930 --> 02:06:13.360 position:56%
Another point I'd like to make about
shooting for documentary projects is

02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:17.720
that really helps to visualize
how the material will be used.

02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:23.680
I'd say on my darkest days I see
it going into a lead lined box deep

02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:27.720
in a pyramid in the desert.

02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:30.000
And other times though
like I see the--

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.990
like I can see it being used
a little bit of stock footage.

02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:38.280
Someone might want to pull material
that we shoot for essentially

02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:45.460
to document aspects of craft or
aspects of performance or history.

02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:52.680 position:56%
I can visualize it on being used--
being edited, being presented either

02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:59.300
in short pieces or what way with
the civil rights oral histories.

02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:03.760
I go crazy by about the third
interview in the sequence

02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:06.310
because I'm editing it in my mind.

02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:07.700
Oh, so and so said that.

02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:10.720
That goes along with what
someone else was saying.

02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:14.060
Because in this case,
we're building a tapestry,

02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:17.790
the documentation is
building an enormous tapestry

02:07:17.790 --> 02:07:22.400
of a huge historical event.

02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:26.730
The other point I'd
like to make is just

02:07:26.730 --> 02:07:32.090
to give a hundred thousand
props to the Library of Congress

02:07:32.090 --> 02:07:38.270
for putting the first hundred and--
I guess 120 oral histories actually

02:07:38.270 --> 02:07:41.090
up on the web with the transcripts.

02:07:41.090 --> 02:07:44.270
So anyone can access it live

02:07:44.270 --> 02:07:47.400
and they can feel what
people are saying.

02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:51.990
They can read the transcript and
get into abstract information

02:07:51.990 --> 02:07:53.570
or to find where they are.

02:07:53.570 --> 02:07:57.740
This is something that's now
technologically possible.

02:07:57.740 --> 02:08:03.050
And this is the first time I've
been involved in something that--

02:08:03.050 --> 02:08:08.910 position:56%
thanks to Guha Shankar who actually
done-- and actually makes it happen.

02:08:08.910 --> 02:08:12.200
First time in my life that that
material I haven't had to wait

02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:18.470
for a year or two or whatever
before things can circulate or--

02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:27.440 position:56%
And these enterprises we are
engaged in or done at great expense,

02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:31.140
great financial expense
and great personal expense.

02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:34.950
There's a lot of effort
that goes into it.

02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:42.740
And it's extremely gratifying
to see it actually being seen.

02:08:42.740 --> 02:08:46.010
So I'll let someone else
have that minute and a half.

02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:48.510
[ Laughter ]

02:08:48.510 --> 02:08:55.340
[ Applause ]

02:08:55.340 --> 02:08:57.640
&gt;&gt; Kelly Navies: Good afternoon.

02:08:57.640 --> 02:08:58.960
My name is Kelly Navies.

02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:00.900
I'm the museum specialist
oral historian

02:09:00.900 --> 02:09:02.570
at the Smithsonian National Museum

02:09:02.570 --> 02:09:04.830
of African-American
History and Culture.

02:09:04.830 --> 02:09:08.370 position:56%
I would like to thank the Library of
Congress for inviting me here today.

02:09:08.370 --> 02:09:11.180
We are as you know very busy.

02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:12.770
But I'm very happy
to be on this panel,

02:09:12.770 --> 02:09:16.380
and I'm glad that you're here, Mr.
Bishop, because I never met you.

02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:18.010
This is my first time meeting you.

02:09:18.010 --> 02:09:20.590
I'm relatively new so I
actually wasn't there for all

02:09:20.590 --> 02:09:22.830
of the interviews that he's
talking about but I'm going

02:09:22.830 --> 02:09:25.440
to share a little bit
more about that project.

02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:29.310
The oral history program at
the Smithsonian National Museum

02:09:29.310 --> 02:09:31.320
of African-American
History and Culture is

02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:33.830
as you know a new and
evolving program.

02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:37.710
Our goal is to produce and
collect oral history content

02:09:37.710 --> 02:09:39.260
for our growing collection.

02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:42.240
In addition, we are committed to
making this material accessible

02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:45.440
and usable to our many
publics, general, scholars,

02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:47.930
researchers, teachers and students.

02:09:47.930 --> 02:09:50.040
These various constituency
should be able

02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:52.590
to access oral history
materials not just recordings

02:09:52.590 --> 02:09:55.430
but associated documentation
both online

02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:57.730
and by coming into the museum.

02:09:57.730 --> 02:10:00.850
In addition, our collection is
intended to support the work

02:10:00.850 --> 02:10:04.430
and research of our curators
as they develop exhibitions.

02:10:04.430 --> 02:10:07.510
In the years prior to our
opening and prior to my joining

02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:09.870
with the program, we began
to collect oral histories

02:10:09.870 --> 02:10:12.040
through our collaboration
with the Library of Congress

02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:13.670
on the civil rights
oral history project.

02:10:13.670 --> 02:10:16.650
And you've been hearing
a little bit about that.

02:10:16.650 --> 02:10:20.400
The civil rights history
project began in 2009

02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:24.350
when the US Congress passed the
Civil Rights History Project Act.

02:10:24.350 --> 02:10:27.350
This law directed the Library of
Congress and the National Museum

02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:28.810
of African-American
History and Culture

02:10:28.810 --> 02:10:32.860
to conduct a nationwide survey of
existing oral history collections

02:10:32.860 --> 02:10:36.020
with relevance to the civil
rights history movement,

02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:37.750
and to record new interviews
with people

02:10:37.750 --> 02:10:39.720
who participated in the movement.

02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:43.360
There have been approximately
144 interviews conducted

02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:45.110
and recorded on film.

02:10:45.110 --> 02:10:48.000
Some of these interviews are
with well know movement icons,

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.820
but many others are with
less known individuals

02:10:50.820 --> 02:10:53.160
who played important
roles in the movement.

02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:55.860
The significance of these
interviews is immense.

02:10:55.860 --> 02:10:58.930
Their content reveals the work
and day-to-day experiences

02:10:58.930 --> 02:11:00.910
of major players not
just in the south

02:11:00.910 --> 02:11:02.440
but throughout the United States.

02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:05.810
For example, the most recent
cohort of interviews were done

02:11:05.810 --> 02:11:07.880
in Southern California
with former members

02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:11.330
of the Black Panther Party
and the Brown Berets.

02:11:11.330 --> 02:11:15.110
One of my favorite interviews
is with Freeman Hrabowski.

02:11:15.110 --> 02:11:18.500
Dr. Hrabowski is known mostly
in academic circles for his work

02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:21.800
as the president of the University
of Maryland, Baltimore County

02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:24.860
where he has developed a highly
successful math and science program

02:11:24.860 --> 02:11:26.160
that targets those

02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:28.380
who are historically
represented in those fields.

02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:31.150
What is less known is his
role in the Children's Crusade

02:11:31.150 --> 02:11:35.030
of Birmingham, Alabama and the
fact that he was actually friends

02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:36.960
with the four girls who
were killed in the bombing

02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:40.740
at the 16th Street
Baptist Church in 1963.

02:11:40.740 --> 02:11:43.580
During his interview
with Dr. Joe Mosnier

02:11:43.580 --> 02:11:46.290
of the Southern Oral History
Program at UNC Chapel Hill

02:11:46.290 --> 02:11:48.290
where I'm also from, by the way.

02:11:48.290 --> 02:11:51.750
Dr. Hrabowski gives a poignant
and moving telling of this chapter

02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:54.230
in his life and the
life of our nation.

02:11:54.230 --> 02:11:56.960
In story, one is struck by
the trajectory of his life

02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:59.530
from the upheaval and
trauma of those early years

02:11:59.530 --> 02:12:02.120
to his contemporary role
as a committed activist

02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:04.360
in the sphere of academics.

02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:06.750
What this and other
oral history interviews

02:12:06.750 --> 02:12:09.780
from this collection reveal
is that beyond the retelling

02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:13.120
of historical events, oral
histories have the power to inspire

02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:16.660
and trigger the much
needed healing process.

02:12:16.660 --> 02:12:20.180
As a nation we are still grappling
with the trauma of racial violence

02:12:20.180 --> 02:12:22.590
and it is one of the goals
of the National Museum

02:12:22.590 --> 02:12:25.520
of African-American History and
Culture to be a place of healing

02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:27.660
as well as a place of learning.

02:12:27.660 --> 02:12:29.980
With the availability
of this collection,

02:12:29.980 --> 02:12:33.990
a visitor can view the display of
Emmett Till's coffin, and then go

02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:37.120
and listen to the reflections
of those like the Ladner sisters

02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:41.890
who were directly impacted
by Till's murder in 1955.

02:12:41.890 --> 02:12:44.870 position:56%
Another strength of the civil rights
history project is the diversity

02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:46.170
it portrays.

02:12:46.170 --> 02:12:48.190
In addition to the
integration of the well known

02:12:48.190 --> 02:12:51.600
with the less celebrated, it also
showcases stories of non-black

02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:54.240
such as Luis Zapata, a
Latino-American who grew

02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:57.560
up in Orange County,
California and became active

02:12:57.560 --> 02:12:59.230
in the United Farm Workers.

02:12:59.230 --> 02:13:02.430
And then moved to Mississippi
to become active in both SNCC

02:13:02.430 --> 02:13:05.270
and the Mississippi
Freedom Labor Union.

02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:07.630
Then there's the story of
David and Satoko Ackerman,

02:13:07.630 --> 02:13:10.520
an interracial couple,
Caucasian and Japanese,

02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:13.640
who met at the Chicago Theological
Seminary and were then recruited

02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:16.210
by fellow student Jesse
Jackson to join the march

02:13:16.210 --> 02:13:18.640
from Selma to Montgomery.

02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:21.160
There are also many interviews
with the women of the movement

02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:23.900
like Dr. Kathleen Cleaver
of the Black Panther Party,

02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:27.920
and sisters Joyce and Dorie Ladner
who have led lifetimes of activism

02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:30.170
through involvement
in the NAACP, SNCC,

02:13:30.170 --> 02:13:33.330
and in many other campaigns
for justice.

02:13:33.330 --> 02:13:35.390
The cultural and gender
diversity displayed

02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:38.730
in these interviewees provides
a more complete picture

02:13:38.730 --> 02:13:42.300
of what we call the movement
and it reaches our understanding

02:13:42.300 --> 02:13:45.480
of the contextual experience
of those we call activist.

02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:46.990
What motivates them?

02:13:46.990 --> 02:13:49.990
What are their lives like
on a day-to-day basis?

02:13:49.990 --> 02:13:51.740
There are also interviews
with siblings

02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:53.820
and whole families would
shed light on the ways

02:13:53.820 --> 02:13:57.330
in which the civil rights movement
impacted not just individuals

02:13:57.330 --> 02:14:00.590
but social networks
and entire communities.

02:14:00.590 --> 02:14:03.820
I've already used this collection
to introduce foreign students

02:14:03.820 --> 02:14:05.760
to our oral history collection.

02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:08.010
Students from Southeast
Asia were very interested

02:14:08.010 --> 02:14:11.470
in how oral history enables one
to capture stories of trauma

02:14:11.470 --> 02:14:13.230
and oppression and
were anxious to go home

02:14:13.230 --> 02:14:16.940
and record their own stories, as
well as interview their relatives.

02:14:16.940 --> 02:14:21.140
One of the reasons I am so
passionate about oral history is

02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:23.060
that there are so many
layers of meaning

02:14:23.060 --> 02:14:26.040
and so many ways of
using the material.

02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:29.210
I look forward to presenting
oral history to our many publics

02:14:29.210 --> 02:14:31.040
through exhibits and
variety of programs

02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:33.010
and through training and workshops.

02:14:33.010 --> 02:14:35.840
The civil rights history project
is a good model for the kind

02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:39.140
of oral history work we
plan to do, collaborations

02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:41.810
with other institutions that
produce rich oral histories

02:14:41.810 --> 02:14:45.710
that have multifaceted
meanings and applications.

02:14:45.710 --> 02:14:48.630
Most recently, I have been
directing an oral history project

02:14:48.630 --> 02:14:51.040
with individuals who
donated significant items

02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:53.290
and artifacts to our collection.

02:14:53.290 --> 02:14:56.260
As a museum, our oral history
collection is deeply connected

02:14:56.260 --> 02:14:58.460
to the material collection.

02:14:58.460 --> 02:15:00.040
There are interviews
with artifact donors

02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:02.800
that reveal not just the
provenance of particular pieces

02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:06.240
but also the relationship of
these items to the lives of those

02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:08.770
who once possessed them
and how these stories fit

02:15:08.770 --> 02:15:10.070
into the larger narrative

02:15:10.070 --> 02:15:12.150
of African-American
history and culture.

02:15:12.150 --> 02:15:13.600
Yeah, I'll take questions later.

02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:16.510
OK. Thank you.

02:15:16.510 --> 02:15:20.500
[ Applause ]

02:15:27.370 --> 02:15:30.950
&gt;&gt; Lance Ledbetter: Hi, I'm Lance
Ledbetter from Dust-to-Digital.

02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:34.060
As Todd was saying, we
are a record company.

02:15:34.060 --> 02:15:38.860 position:56%
My-- It's just my wife and myself
and we're based in Atlanta, Georgia.

02:15:38.860 --> 02:15:42.450
I think a record company like ours,

02:15:42.450 --> 02:15:46.210
there's not really a
roadmap for what we do.

02:15:46.210 --> 02:15:50.780
We've sort of evolved over time
but I want to walk through today

02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:54.150
and kind of tell the story
about how we got to work

02:15:54.150 --> 02:15:57.340
with such great archive as
the Library of Congress,

02:15:57.340 --> 02:16:02.540
the Florida Folklife Program,
the Center for Southern Folklife,

02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:05.650
the Association for Cultural
Equity and the University

02:16:05.650 --> 02:16:08.220
of Georgia Archives among others.

02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:11.840
Our label started in
2003 with the release

02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:14.640
of a box set called
"Goodbye, Babylon".

02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:18.700
And what we were trying to do
with that set was, you know,

02:16:18.700 --> 02:16:22.220
it's all gospel music
recorded between 1902 to 1960.

02:16:22.220 --> 02:16:26.410
But what we're trying to do is
provide access point to this sort

02:16:26.410 --> 02:16:30.900
of overwhelming amount of
content by showing like subgenres

02:16:30.900 --> 02:16:33.490
of the different styles
of gospel music.

02:16:33.490 --> 02:16:36.640
We worked with musicologists like
Dick Spottswood, Charles Wolfe

02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:41.140
and Tony Russell to produce a
set that sort of told the story

02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:44.540
of gospel music while making
various objective selections

02:16:44.540 --> 02:16:45.940
to get people an access point.

02:16:45.940 --> 02:16:51.230
During the four and a half years to
produce "Goodbye, Babylon" we sort

02:16:51.230 --> 02:16:55.480
of set the standards, aesthetic
standards and mission of our label.

02:16:55.480 --> 02:17:00.870
We decided we want to produce
high quality cultural artifacts.

02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:05.450
And what I mean by that is we want
to have topnotch documentation

02:17:05.450 --> 02:17:09.160
with beautiful packaging
and terrific design.

02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:13.070
We thought that the music was so
important we want to elevate it to,

02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:15.080
you know, to this thing
that was beautiful

02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:16.770
where people will hopefully
pay attention.

02:17:16.770 --> 02:17:18.880
And that was back in '03

02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:23.880
when there's a lot less
distractions than there are now.

02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:28.360
In 2004, Art Rosenbaum and I met.

02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:30.340
And Art Rosenbaum,
for those of the--

02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:34.910 position:56%
for those of you that don't know, he
made field recordings for probably

02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:39.110
about 40 years in their house at
the University of Georgia Archives

02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:41.260
where Art was a professor.

02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:45.030 position:56%
Art and I had several conversations.

02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:47.700
He was a fan of "Goodbye,
Babylon" and we talked

02:17:47.700 --> 02:17:52.320
about possibly doing something
similar, like a similar model

02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:54.710
for his field recordings.

02:17:54.710 --> 02:17:59.650
So Art and I spent about a year
and a half just listening to all

02:17:59.650 --> 02:18:03.460
of his recordings and it was just--
it was a great, great experience

02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:08.300
to do that with somebody as
incredible as Art Rosenbaum.

02:18:08.300 --> 02:18:10.540
And the set we produced
was called "Art

02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:13.310
of Field Recording"
that came out in 2008.

02:18:13.310 --> 02:18:18.880
It was well received and it was
our first work with an archive.

02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:21.390
It was with the University
of Georgia Archive.

02:18:21.390 --> 02:18:23.260
Before that time, we
were only working

02:18:23.260 --> 02:18:25.920
with private record collectors.

02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:29.250
Like I said, the set
was well received,

02:18:29.250 --> 02:18:31.600
actually, even won a Grammy Award.

02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:36.730
And we were so excited but at
the same time my wife and I,

02:18:36.730 --> 02:18:40.280
although it was a terrific
experience, we realized, you know,

02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:44.080
to take a year and a half to listen
to audio and still be a, you know,

02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:47.730
functioning recording company
and putting out records,

02:18:47.730 --> 02:18:51.370
we needed to refine that
process a little bit.

02:18:51.370 --> 02:18:52.670
So we did.

02:18:52.670 --> 02:18:55.280
You know, we started to
hear from other archives.

02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:58.400
You know, I think the "Art of
Field Recording" set sort of put us

02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:04.170
on the archival map with people
that had lots of great material.

02:19:04.170 --> 02:19:07.580
The next set that we did with
an archive was the "Drop on Down

02:19:07.580 --> 02:19:08.880
in Florida" set which was a--

02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:12.240
it was a reissue of a double LP

02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:18.870
that the Florida State Folklife
Program have put out in the 1980s

02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:20.760
and they want to do like
an expanded edition.

02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:24.310
So we kept their original notes.

02:19:24.310 --> 02:19:27.920
We expand the liner notes and we
expand the audio to be two CDs.

02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:33.220
It's almost like double the audio
material as the original double LP.

02:19:33.220 --> 02:19:36.960
But in doing so, we worked
a lot with the archive.

02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:39.370
We let them develop a lot of the--

02:19:39.370 --> 02:19:42.350
make a lot of the decisions
in the development stages.

02:19:42.350 --> 02:19:47.580
What we sort of shifted our
expertise to was more in the--

02:19:47.580 --> 02:19:51.280
helping them with the concepts,
the packaging and the design,

02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:54.880
the marketing, the
manufacturing and the distribution.

02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:57.750
And that set was well received too.

02:19:57.750 --> 02:20:01.420
We didn't win a Grammy but
it was very well received.

02:20:01.420 --> 02:20:05.380
And it came together very well
and it sort of tested this sort

02:20:05.380 --> 02:20:09.680
of new approach for us to where
we can work with an archive

02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:12.790
and have them using their
expertise in their field

02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:15.420
and us using our expertise
in our field.

02:20:15.420 --> 02:20:18.690
So since then we've worked

02:20:18.690 --> 02:20:22.320
with several more archives
including the Library of Congress.

02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:27.430
We worked with Jim Leary at the
University of Wisconsin to do a set

02:20:27.430 --> 02:20:29.910
of folk songs from another America.

02:20:29.910 --> 02:20:34.340
And we-- That was a partnership
with the University Press,

02:20:34.340 --> 02:20:36.670
the University of Wisconsin Press.

02:20:36.670 --> 02:20:40.160
And since then we've done another
Library of Congress project.

02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:43.710
We did the-- It was sort of similar
to the "Drop on Down in Florida"

02:20:43.710 --> 02:20:47.770
where it was originally put out as
a three LP set in the '70s "Music

02:20:47.770 --> 02:20:51.060
of Morocco" which was
recorded by Paul Bowles.

02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:55.990
And that set that came out earlier
this year has been probably one

02:20:55.990 --> 02:21:00.030
of our best received
projects and in several years.

02:21:00.030 --> 02:21:02.990
So, you know, I want to just
kind of say how, you know,

02:21:02.990 --> 02:21:07.140
what our process is, how we've
evolved to work with more archives.

02:21:07.140 --> 02:21:10.650
And I think what we, you know,
as a label bring to the--

02:21:10.650 --> 02:21:14.870
to this, you know, the sharing
is with a physical package,

02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:16.600
you have a beginning
and you have an end.

02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:19.780
And you can direct people, you
know, to the infinite archive.

02:21:19.780 --> 02:21:24.150
The online material, you know,
that's something that we can help,

02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:29.880
you know, raise awareness of what
archives have in the context of,

02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:35.270 position:56%
you know, consumerism and record
nerds and, you know, all that stuff.

02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:38.930
And we get those people to
appreciate and come to learn

02:21:38.930 --> 02:21:41.320
about all the great
work that archives

02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:43.070
like the Library of Congress does.

02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:44.870
Thank you.

02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:49.780
[ Applause ]

02:21:49.780 --> 02:21:52.020
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: I wonder if we
can go straight to questions.

02:21:52.020 --> 02:21:55.630
This is some fast meeting folks.

02:21:55.630 --> 02:21:57.010
&gt;&gt; John Bishop: Can I
ask the first question?

02:21:57.010 --> 02:21:58.310
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Yeah.

02:21:58.310 --> 02:22:02.210
&gt;&gt; John Bishop: I just wanted
to comment on Freeman Hrabowski.

02:22:02.210 --> 02:22:06.840
He was one of the more
intense interviews.

02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:11.550
And the story that when
he told about the girls

02:22:11.550 --> 02:22:16.030
in Birmingham he was
crying, I was crying.

02:22:16.030 --> 02:22:20.330
I'm really good at staying
in focus when I'm crying.

02:22:20.330 --> 02:22:25.010
And we had to pause and he said
that he hadn't told that story

02:22:25.010 --> 02:22:28.440
in 30 years, but it was the
attention we were paying to him.

02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:34.060 position:56%
It is literally that he would-- that
he felt moved just to tell it and--

02:22:34.060 --> 02:22:35.670
what he'd not intended to.

02:22:35.670 --> 02:22:37.150
&gt;&gt; Kelly Navies: That's
a very powerful segment

02:22:37.150 --> 02:22:41.210
and you edited it quite
well, so yes.

02:22:41.210 --> 02:22:42.510
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Hey, Mary.

02:22:42.510 --> 02:22:46.200
&gt;&gt; Mary: I wanted to just
say how much I appreciate--

02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:49.110
Well, it's a wonderful,
wonderful session of course.

02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:51.630
Thank you for putting it together.

02:22:51.630 --> 02:22:56.040
I wanted to just say to John
Bishop how much I appreciate--

02:22:56.040 --> 02:23:01.310
You're bringing out the
recording and the photograph

02:23:01.310 --> 02:23:03.530
as really an artifact
of the relationship

02:23:03.530 --> 02:23:07.980
between the photographer, the
field worker, and the person.

02:23:07.980 --> 02:23:13.780
And I-- Yeah, I don't think we
paid enough attention to that

02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:17.510
in our session this morning
because we were almost--

02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:19.840
We were on the verge of getting
there but didn't get there.

02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:23.880
And I just love the way
that you've drawn that out.

02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:29.420
Do you-- So what do you-- So where
does that go when you're looking

02:23:29.420 --> 02:23:33.860 position:56%
at these decontextualized artifacts?

02:23:33.860 --> 02:23:36.800
Can you as a photographer
read those--

02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:38.100
&gt;&gt; John Bishop: Well,
I can see that--

02:23:38.100 --> 02:23:39.400
&gt;&gt; Mary: -- as a way-- I mean
and Anne Hoag [assumed spelling],

02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:40.700
actually she anticipated.

02:23:40.700 --> 02:23:43.080
She said, look and
look at these pictures.

02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:44.820
You can see that there
is a relationship

02:23:44.820 --> 02:23:47.110
between the photographer
and the subject.

02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:48.520
Can you talk about that?

02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:50.400
&gt;&gt; John Bishop: Well, I could
see it in the photographs

02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:53.910
that you showed in
your presentation.

02:23:53.910 --> 02:23:56.050
What do you about it or?

02:23:56.050 --> 02:24:03.740
&gt;&gt; Mary: Well, you just say
something more about that.

02:24:03.740 --> 02:24:05.040
Yeah.

02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:06.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Bishop: Well, it's--
There's a leap that you have to make

02:24:06.950 --> 02:24:10.250 position:56%
between the tech-- with what you're
doing technically and aesthetically.

02:24:10.250 --> 02:24:15.620
And you-- I don't consider
myself an artist.

02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:20.080
I'm, you know, its-- that's
I'm not there to make art.

02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:23.950
But I feel an obligation
when I take people's time

02:24:23.950 --> 02:24:25.960
to do something with it.

02:24:25.960 --> 02:24:29.640
And often it comes in a
compulsion to edit what I've shot

02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:32.710
after an interval of time goes by.

02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:37.280
I remember that something they said
or some beautiful movement they did

02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:42.070
or something and feel that
I have to make the film just

02:24:42.070 --> 02:24:45.710
to get these three
things in and, you know,

02:24:45.710 --> 02:24:49.550
that there is that
sort of post thing.

02:24:53.310 --> 02:24:57.250
Otherwise, you know,
it's just-- and like I--

02:24:57.250 --> 02:25:00.180
people seem to tolerate
me pretty well, so.

02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:06.180
But I think that's part of the--
What happened in your case as well

02:25:06.180 --> 02:25:10.370
that people like you and
you got along with them.

02:25:10.370 --> 02:25:12.940
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Someone this
morning used the term shoulder

02:25:12.940 --> 02:25:16.410
to shoulder as in fieldwork.

02:25:16.410 --> 02:25:23.930
But in a sense we're expanding
that to be inter-institutional

02:25:23.930 --> 02:25:27.870
or across professionalize
with these folks

02:25:27.870 --> 02:25:32.950
because they are providing
access to our collections.

02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:36.270
And John didn't mention
media generation.

02:25:36.270 --> 02:25:41.500
His-- the distribution
aspect of his creative work,

02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:44.690
which is in a way similar
to Dust-to-Digital

02:25:44.690 --> 02:25:47.370
in that they are providing
great access

02:25:47.370 --> 02:25:51.270
and beautiful access
to archival material.

02:26:00.170 --> 02:26:02.300
&gt;&gt; So is there [inaudible]
competitors.

02:26:02.300 --> 02:26:03.600
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: No, no.

02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:04.900
No.

02:26:04.900 --> 02:26:06.200
[ Laughter ]

02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:09.430
&gt;&gt; Well, and Mary's question
and John's remarks, you know,

02:26:09.430 --> 02:26:11.080
make me think, help me out.

02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:13.570
Am I remembering the
term reflexivity?

02:26:13.570 --> 02:26:16.060
Is that one of those
words that we hear in--

02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:17.360
&gt;&gt; Kelly Navies: Yeah.

02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:19.850
&gt;&gt; -- hotdog.

02:26:19.850 --> 02:26:24.650 position:56%
I think a characteristic of what
you're talking about and what we did

02:26:24.650 --> 02:26:31.320 position:56%
in fact to see in the pictures this
morning has to do with a willingness

02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:34.730
and a consciousness of the
importance of reflexivity

02:26:34.730 --> 02:26:38.290
in the work of documentation
that we did.

02:26:38.290 --> 02:26:41.260
And what it gives you
at least to not--

02:26:41.260 --> 02:26:45.850
in those pictures that
we saw because the team

02:26:45.850 --> 02:26:52.920
in a sense gave a meta-documenter
of the documentary act, and in--

02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:56.050
as was said in enriched
contextual thing

02:26:56.050 --> 02:26:59.130
that lets you understand
the document quo document,

02:26:59.130 --> 02:27:01.980
if you see what I mean, because
you not only have the document,

02:27:01.980 --> 02:27:04.850
you also sort of have the
sense of how it was made.

02:27:04.850 --> 02:27:07.490
But it's also a reflexive process.

02:27:07.490 --> 02:27:09.170
I mean, I remember I
worked on that book

02:27:09.170 --> 02:27:11.570
of bluegrass photos,
it was Neil Rosenberg.

02:27:11.570 --> 02:27:16.410
And the text is threaded through
with how the two of us drove hither

02:27:16.410 --> 02:27:18.170
and thither and ran into people.

02:27:18.170 --> 02:27:22.090
So we're a part of the
story and, you know,

02:27:22.090 --> 02:27:26.260
there may be egotism involved
that I think it was also,

02:27:26.260 --> 02:27:28.590
you know, to contextualize it.

02:27:28.590 --> 02:27:30.650
But this is a sort of thing
you're really good at.

02:27:30.650 --> 02:27:32.420
So what do you think?

02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:34.790
&gt;&gt; Mary: No, again--

02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:36.380
&gt;&gt; The reflexivity.

02:27:36.380 --> 02:27:38.090
&gt;&gt; Mary: Well, I don't know.

02:27:38.090 --> 02:27:43.830
Well, I wasn't quite thinking of
it so much as although-- Yeah.

02:27:43.830 --> 02:27:47.820
I mean I think of reflexivity as
this sort of two-headed aspect

02:27:47.820 --> 02:27:50.100
that you have to have when
you're doing ethnography.

02:27:50.100 --> 02:27:53.040
You have to be able to--
as you said, the metadata.

02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:56.990
But you have to be able to be--

02:27:56.990 --> 02:28:00.580
to move very rapidly between
being absorbed in the interaction

02:28:00.580 --> 02:28:04.880
and standing back and
giving it a label, metadata.

02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:06.420
This is, you know,
here's what we're doing

02:28:06.420 --> 02:28:10.200
and here's what I'm going
to ask next or whatever.

02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:15.530
But this whole business of
the photograph reflect--

02:28:15.530 --> 02:28:17.100
Well, reflecting, reflexivity.

02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:21.670
Reflecting something of the
relationship that is going on.

02:28:21.670 --> 02:28:26.550
I think that that's
something that the big moment.

02:28:26.550 --> 02:28:28.490
I remember Alan one
time saying that they--

02:28:28.490 --> 02:28:33.480
The great insight of the
20th century was context.

02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:37.320
And that context, you know, across
the philosophies and at the--

02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:40.980
in sciences and so forth that.

02:28:40.980 --> 02:28:43.650
And so we shifted.

02:28:43.650 --> 02:28:46.140
Around the time that the
American Folklife Center

02:28:46.140 --> 02:28:49.460
and the legislation was passed,
we shifted from this idea of--

02:28:49.460 --> 02:28:57.320
from this practice of
collecting nuggets.

02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:01.060
That, yeah, text and
images and so forth.

02:29:01.060 --> 02:29:07.020
And to actually going off
in search of those moments

02:29:07.020 --> 02:29:08.800
of what Dell Hymes has
called breakthrough

02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:12.040
into performance where--
and then turning that.

02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:19.370
So that these things in the
archives are potentially very

02:29:19.370 --> 02:29:21.870
living documents.

02:29:21.870 --> 02:29:24.350
I mean the-- What happens
to those relationships?

02:29:24.350 --> 02:29:26.840
I think of that-- it as the--

02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:29.600
what [inaudible] called
the difference between--

02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:37.270
the difference is not between
body and soul or matter and mind

02:29:37.270 --> 02:29:42.060
but between flesh fallen
and flesh transfigured.

02:29:42.060 --> 02:29:45.590
And the transfigurement
is in the relationship.

02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:47.650
And you take that--
You just take the--

02:29:47.650 --> 02:29:49.600
You take the document
or whatever and it's

02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:51.850
like what Barry Tolchin [assumed
spelling] said is a footprint,

02:29:51.850 --> 02:29:54.150
you know, of an interaction.

02:29:56.480 --> 02:29:58.000
Thank you.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.220
[ Laughter ]

02:30:00.220 --> 02:30:01.520
&gt;&gt; Hey.

02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:02.950
[ Laughter ]

02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:04.720
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Over here.

02:30:04.720 --> 02:30:06.340
Wow.

02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:12.910
&gt;&gt; Hi, I just wanted to comment to
Gabriela that I appreciate the work

02:30:12.910 --> 02:30:17.990 position:56%
that you do among many others for
Recovering Voices and Breath of Life

02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:20.050
because I think it's a
really wonderful example

02:30:20.050 --> 02:30:26.750
of how these amazing institutions
that physically are located

02:30:26.750 --> 02:30:31.220
in DC can give back to
communities all over the world,

02:30:31.220 --> 02:30:32.970
especially indigenous communities.

02:30:32.970 --> 02:30:36.160 position:56%
And I was hoping you could talk
about some sort of concrete examples

02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:39.100
of what you saw people
take home with them.

02:30:39.100 --> 02:30:40.490
What did they take with them

02:30:40.490 --> 02:30:44.750
to their communities even
though it lives in the archives?

02:30:44.750 --> 02:30:47.630
How are those relationships
expanding?

02:30:47.630 --> 02:30:50.790
&gt;&gt; Gabriela Perez Baez:
Good question.

02:30:50.790 --> 02:30:53.960
So, OK. So we've done
Breath of Life three times.

02:30:53.960 --> 02:30:56.210
And I think I would
say that what they take

02:30:56.210 --> 02:30:58.870
with them is a lot of excitement.

02:30:58.870 --> 02:31:02.470
What ends up happening is that
our holdings are so extensive

02:31:02.470 --> 02:31:07.430 position:56%
that two weeks of intensive training
in linguistics, intensive training

02:31:07.430 --> 02:31:12.640
into what the archives hold, it
ends up being super overwhelming

02:31:12.640 --> 02:31:18.010
in a good way and they live and
they're very excited to know

02:31:18.010 --> 02:31:24.240 position:56%
that all of this material has exist
and it's a resource for them to use.

02:31:24.240 --> 02:31:27.910
Now what we're trying to do now
because one thing that we're not--

02:31:27.910 --> 02:31:31.750
don't have a good handle on is
what happens after they leave.

02:31:31.750 --> 02:31:35.840
And so for example
we have experiences

02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:38.150
with the [inaudible],
the Barbareno Chumash.

02:31:38.150 --> 02:31:43.280
And with the Seneca groups
where they left knowing--

02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:47.550 position:56%
when they were here for Breath of
Life they had developed an inventory

02:31:47.550 --> 02:31:50.620
of all the materials that they
had and we were able to take

02:31:50.620 --> 02:31:53.010
that inventory and
we had an opportunity

02:31:53.010 --> 02:31:54.930
to digitize the materials.

02:31:54.930 --> 02:31:57.570
I should mention that
when-- with Breath of Life,

02:31:57.570 --> 02:32:01.110 position:56%
we digitize a selection of materials

02:32:01.110 --> 02:32:03.960
so that the participants
have something

02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:05.860
to work on right of the bat.

02:32:05.860 --> 02:32:09.760
They won, they have a digital
surrogate that they can work on.

02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:13.400
And we choose that very carefully
depending on the vitality

02:32:13.400 --> 02:32:16.450
of the language, the experience
that the person might have

02:32:16.450 --> 02:32:21.210
in doing linguistic research
or not and we select something

02:32:21.210 --> 02:32:23.280
that they can start
working on right away.

02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:27.950
We also have post institute
digitization funds.

02:32:27.950 --> 02:32:29.250
So if they discovered something

02:32:29.250 --> 02:32:32.860
that they really want,
we can digitize it.

02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:36.250
But generally the collections
tend to be very extensive

02:32:36.250 --> 02:32:39.490
and they go away knowing
that there's boxes and boxes,

02:32:39.490 --> 02:32:42.960
especially when it comes to
languages and cultures documented

02:32:42.960 --> 02:32:45.110
in the Harrington Collection
for example.

02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:47.130
It's just massive what
they might have.

02:32:47.130 --> 02:32:52.320
So anyway in the case of the
Seneca and the Chumash groups,

02:32:52.320 --> 02:32:54.620
we were able to do follow
up in two different ways.

02:32:54.620 --> 02:32:58.010
So the Seneca developed an
inventory of all the materials.

02:32:58.010 --> 02:33:00.690
We happen to have a
digitization grant.

02:33:00.690 --> 02:33:03.100
So we were able to digitize
the entire collection

02:33:03.100 --> 02:33:07.290
of Seneca materials and
return that to them to--

02:33:07.290 --> 02:33:11.720
at no charge to the
community, to the researchers.

02:33:11.720 --> 02:33:13.700
So now they have all this wealth.

02:33:13.700 --> 02:33:16.840
They're so overwhelmed but
they have the stuff with them

02:33:16.840 --> 02:33:22.090
and they can start digging through
and I'll go back to that point.

02:33:22.090 --> 02:33:26.270
The-- with the Barbareno Chumash,
they knew that there was a lot

02:33:26.270 --> 02:33:28.440
of stuff because this is one
of the languages documented

02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:30.200
in the Harrington Collection.

02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:31.500
So they came back.

02:33:31.500 --> 02:33:33.600
They came to Breath of
Life, they worked on that

02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:35.250
for two weeks then they applied

02:33:35.250 --> 02:33:39.070
for a community research
program opportunity.

02:33:39.070 --> 02:33:44.020
And they came back for a
week and I worked with them

02:33:44.020 --> 02:33:47.330
that whole week specifically
to develop an inventory

02:33:47.330 --> 02:33:51.860
that they could use to
develop their notation

02:33:51.860 --> 02:33:56.690
so that they could always
go back to the document

02:33:56.690 --> 02:33:58.670
of where they could find
the particular word.

02:33:58.670 --> 02:34:03.090
So for the Barbareno Chumash,
they have been reconstructing

02:34:03.090 --> 02:34:05.750
for example their-- or they were
working on their numeral system

02:34:05.750 --> 02:34:11.310
and they had found number 24,
number 26 which allow them to--

02:34:11.310 --> 02:34:12.910
which provided an important clue

02:34:12.910 --> 02:34:16.690
as to how the numeral
system was constructed.

02:34:16.690 --> 02:34:20.730
So-- But they needed to be able
to pinpoint that one page in--

02:34:20.730 --> 02:34:24.470
amidst the thousands of
pages where that word is.

02:34:24.470 --> 02:34:27.550
So this was a rudimentary
way to do it.

02:34:27.550 --> 02:34:32.010 position:56%
Now with those two experiences, we--

02:34:32.010 --> 02:34:36.410
I'm working with our partner
which is someone who I neglected

02:34:36.410 --> 02:34:39.650
to mention but who's a
critical partner in this

02:34:39.650 --> 02:34:43.710
and they were Daryl Baldwin
at the Myaamia Center,

02:34:43.710 --> 02:34:47.030
which is at the Miami
University in Ohio

02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:50.600
and he has led the revitalized--

02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:53.750
the reclamation efforts
for the Myaamia language.

02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:57.840 position:56%
And one of the things that they have
developed is this tool to be able

02:34:57.840 --> 02:35:02.890
to manage digital surrogates,
annotate them, analyze them,

02:35:02.890 --> 02:35:07.270 position:56%
translate, whatever it is that is
necessary for that given manuscript.

02:35:07.270 --> 02:35:14.130
And so, an output in a
dictionary format or another way.

02:35:14.130 --> 02:35:19.630
So now we're working to try to
figure out how we can use this tool

02:35:19.630 --> 02:35:23.400
to present it at a
Breath of Life Institute

02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:29.940 position:56%
and allow the participants take that
tool with them and be able to carry

02:35:29.940 --> 02:35:31.700
out the work once they leave.

02:35:31.700 --> 02:35:34.840
So, they can still leave
overwhelmed but with a tool

02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:39.850 position:56%
where they can start plowing away in
a methodological systematic manner.

02:35:39.850 --> 02:35:45.270
So we're learning a lot about what
communities need and don't need,

02:35:45.270 --> 02:35:48.200
what they know and don't
know and we're very mindful

02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:51.530
that what we're asking
these communities to do

02:35:51.530 --> 02:35:54.760 position:56%
when we're giving them access to the
archive is that we're asking them

02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:59.410
to become linguists, to become
folklorist, to become archivist,

02:35:59.410 --> 02:36:03.280
to become ethnographers and
they're just average people.

02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:06.980 position:56%
So it's really important that we
understand what access really means.

02:36:06.980 --> 02:36:10.870
It's not just letting them
come in for two weeks.

02:36:10.870 --> 02:36:12.830
It's actually creating
an environment

02:36:12.830 --> 02:36:19.760
where that access is meaningful
to whatever goals they have.

02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:31.170
&gt;&gt; I second the comment this
was a great presentation.

02:36:31.170 --> 02:36:32.780
My question is for Kelly.

02:36:32.780 --> 02:36:36.860
I'm wondering if you could expand
on the concept of the many publics

02:36:36.860 --> 02:36:40.470
that you described and talk
about that idea in the context

02:36:40.470 --> 02:36:41.890
of the own-- your own collections

02:36:41.890 --> 02:36:43.350
that you're building
in your program.

02:36:43.350 --> 02:36:44.650
&gt;&gt; Kelly Navies: Sure.

02:36:44.650 --> 02:36:45.950
It's a great question.

02:36:45.950 --> 02:36:48.010 position:56%
Well, I was actually thinking while
you were talking how important it is

02:36:48.010 --> 02:36:51.720
to empower the communities to be
able to do that work because one

02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:53.530
of the things that I'm getting

02:36:53.530 --> 02:36:58.480
as essentially the only oral
historian right now are requests

02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:00.810
from all over the country.

02:37:00.810 --> 02:37:04.790
I know this person that needs to
be interviewed right now, tomorrow,

02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:07.050
in addition to requests
from our own staff.

02:37:07.050 --> 02:37:12.110
So, one of my biggest jobs is going
to be managing our internal request

02:37:12.110 --> 02:37:14.250
with the request coming
from the public.

02:37:14.250 --> 02:37:17.020
I'm someone who has a background
in community oral history.

02:37:17.020 --> 02:37:21.930
And so it's really important
to me to create a situation

02:37:21.930 --> 02:37:24.070
where the community can
come and be educated

02:37:24.070 --> 02:37:26.450
to go back and do their own work.

02:37:26.450 --> 02:37:29.960
They may or may not donate
those-- that work to us.

02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:33.370
But I think it's important
to encourage people to donate

02:37:33.370 --> 02:37:36.360
to their local historical
societies and libraries as well.

02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:38.720
But the important thing is
that they have those skills

02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:40.510
and the training to do that.

02:37:40.510 --> 02:37:43.280
And I was really glad to hear
that that's one of the things

02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:45.570
that you're doing because I'm
really looking forward to doing

02:37:45.570 --> 02:37:46.880
that with our program as well.

02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:48.710
So we have the communities.

02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:50.010
We have churches.

02:37:50.010 --> 02:37:53.610
We have different social
institutions,

02:37:53.610 --> 02:37:55.580
activist groups like
Black Lives Matter.

02:37:55.580 --> 02:37:58.700 position:56%
I think-- groups like that that will
come to us that that is a public.

02:37:58.700 --> 02:38:00.910 position:56%
Then you have individuals, families.

02:38:00.910 --> 02:38:02.340
We also have a genealogist.

02:38:02.340 --> 02:38:04.090
One thing that's I
think relatively new is

02:38:04.090 --> 02:38:06.430
that we have a permanent
oral historian

02:38:06.430 --> 02:38:10.070
and a permanent professional
genealogist on staff.

02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:11.850
There'll be a family
oral history center.

02:38:11.850 --> 02:38:14.840
So, people will be trained to
not just conduct oral history

02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:17.090
but to do genealogical research.

02:38:17.090 --> 02:38:19.700
So there are a lot of different
ways that we're planning

02:38:19.700 --> 02:38:21.000
to reach out to the public.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:22.300
There'll be classrooms.

02:38:22.300 --> 02:38:25.510
We'll invite classes in.

02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:29.380
I really enjoy doing public
trainings and workshops.

02:38:29.380 --> 02:38:31.080
So that's one of the
things that we're looking

02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:33.690
for to getting started
as soon as possible.

02:38:33.690 --> 02:38:36.570
Does that answer your question?

02:38:36.570 --> 02:38:37.870
&gt;&gt; Sure.

02:38:37.870 --> 02:38:41.760
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: I'm wondering
if it's in the cards for you

02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:45.110
to use American Folklife
Center collections

02:38:45.110 --> 02:38:46.510
as well in that outreach.

02:38:46.510 --> 02:38:48.460
I mean can we kind of
piggyback on those communities?

02:38:48.460 --> 02:38:49.760
&gt;&gt; Kelly Navies: I mean absolutely.

02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:51.690
I think we love working with
the Library of Congress.

02:38:51.690 --> 02:38:53.220
I mean I think yes.

02:38:53.220 --> 02:38:55.930
I mean absolutely, these
are rich collections

02:38:55.930 --> 02:38:57.230
and I'm excited [inaudible].

02:38:57.230 --> 02:38:58.530
I collect records.

02:38:58.530 --> 02:38:59.830
&gt;&gt; Lance Ledbetter: Oh, yeah.

02:38:59.830 --> 02:39:01.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kelly Navies: I want to tell you.

02:39:01.130 --> 02:39:02.430
I want to talk to you about that.

02:39:02.430 --> 02:39:04.650
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Well, Lance, how
does that fit into what you all do?

02:39:04.650 --> 02:39:07.160
I mean what communities
are you building?

02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:09.910
&gt;&gt; Lance Ledbetter: Well, I
think, you know, since we started,

02:39:09.910 --> 02:39:12.310
you know, every release
I think we're up to--

02:39:12.310 --> 02:39:13.960
We're over 50 releases now.

02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:18.340
And, you know, what we try to do
is stretch maybe what our audience

02:39:18.340 --> 02:39:19.640
might expect.

02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:22.120
You know, we try to explain
to them why it's important

02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:25.930
and not everything, like we
kind of look at our fan base

02:39:25.930 --> 02:39:27.770
as being adventurous listeners.

02:39:27.770 --> 02:39:32.700 position:56%
So not everything is going to be for
everyone but with each new release,

02:39:32.700 --> 02:39:35.320
we hopefully will bring
more people to the audience.

02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:41.190
You know, more people to sort of
the, you know, what's coming next,

02:39:41.190 --> 02:39:42.490
you know, kind of build excitement.

02:39:42.490 --> 02:39:45.040
And I think that's what
we try to bring, you know,

02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:48.550
to archives that we work
with is like trying to figure

02:39:48.550 --> 02:39:54.720 position:56%
out what is the hooks that might
help get people that read, you know,

02:39:54.720 --> 02:39:59.610
pitchfork or mojo or whatever it
is, what's going to express to them

02:39:59.610 --> 02:40:01.100
like maybe I should check that out.

02:40:01.100 --> 02:40:03.940
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Well, how did you
do that with the Morocco book set?

02:40:03.940 --> 02:40:07.600
&gt;&gt; Lance Ledbetter: I mean sort--
You know, I knew Paul Bowles,

02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:09.520
the fact that he made
those recordings,

02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:13.930
I knew that his name connected
to it was going to be, you know,

02:40:13.930 --> 02:40:16.460
a big seller but I
didn't realize how big.

02:40:16.460 --> 02:40:20.740
You know, his fan base is very
obsessed with him, you know,

02:40:20.740 --> 02:40:22.640
and they want his liner note.

02:40:22.640 --> 02:40:25.280
They'll buy a box set just to
get his liner notes, you know.

02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:29.380
So it was a-- It's a
little surprising how,

02:40:29.380 --> 02:40:31.260
you know, his fan base reacted.

02:40:31.260 --> 02:40:32.560
But it was great.

02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:34.110
I mean, it was really exciting.

02:40:34.110 --> 02:40:37.230
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Did you have
a question, Alan, or comment?

02:40:37.230 --> 02:40:40.130
&gt;&gt; Alan: I just have
a general question.

02:40:40.130 --> 02:40:43.310
The phrase oral history
has been used widely.

02:40:43.310 --> 02:40:44.610
Sorry.

02:40:44.610 --> 02:40:45.910
&gt;&gt; Yes.

02:40:45.910 --> 02:40:50.580
&gt;&gt; Alan: Today and I'm interested
in the history of that phrase

02:40:50.580 --> 02:40:55.370
because I think it would
tell us something about,

02:40:55.370 --> 02:40:59.100
you know, how it was generated.

02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:06.370
And oral history, well, history is
either oral or written, you know,

02:41:06.370 --> 02:41:11.080
literally speaking and-- But to
invent the phrase oral history,

02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:16.060
a lot of people say, well, that--
What's the name of that historian

02:41:16.060 --> 02:41:19.840 position:56%
from Columbia invented oral history.

02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:26.240
Well, that-- I didn't
have any way to deny that.

02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:29.680
But on the other hand,
I ran across a letter

02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:35.520
and Alan Lomax is correspondent
to the library here from the '30s

02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:38.290
that used the phrase oral history.

02:41:38.290 --> 02:41:44.120
And so the phrase is older
than the Columbia professor

02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:48.490
who was post World War II.

02:41:48.490 --> 02:41:52.890
So does anybody have any
insight into that and--

02:41:52.890 --> 02:41:54.190
&gt;&gt; Kelly Navies: That's
a big question.

02:41:54.190 --> 02:41:57.980
I don't know who first coined
the phrase but you are correct,

02:41:57.980 --> 02:42:02.580
it doesn't go back to
the early '20s and '30s.

02:42:02.580 --> 02:42:03.880
And is Doug Boyd still here?

02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:05.750
He may know.

02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:08.760
I think it's an interesting
question though

02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:14.020
because people often misunderstand
what oral history is and obviously

02:42:14.020 --> 02:42:16.730
within this group of people we
all have an idea or definition.

02:42:16.730 --> 02:42:18.680
We may not all agree on
it but we do have an idea.

02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:21.350
But when I'm out in the world and
I tell people I do oral history,

02:42:21.350 --> 02:42:25.470
the first thing they think is you
tell stories, you're a storyteller.

02:42:25.470 --> 02:42:27.660
And I have to-- I always
have to explain to them,

02:42:27.660 --> 02:42:29.210
no, that's not what I do.

02:42:29.210 --> 02:42:31.250
But it's interesting that that's
the first thing that they think

02:42:31.250 --> 02:42:32.550
when they hear oral history.

02:42:32.550 --> 02:42:37.950 position:56%
So it does make you wonder about the
term itself and how accurate it is

02:42:37.950 --> 02:42:44.120 position:56%
in describing what we do, that's--
But in terms of the actual evolution

02:42:44.120 --> 02:42:45.720
of that term, that's
a good question.

02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:47.600
Guha.

02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:48.900
&gt;&gt; Guha: This has nothing to do

02:42:48.900 --> 02:42:51.330
with oral histories
although only tangentially.

02:42:51.330 --> 02:42:54.990
So you all have been a
very nice, polite and not

02:42:54.990 --> 02:42:57.510 position:56%
to say also good looking bunch and--

02:42:57.510 --> 02:42:58.810
&gt;&gt; Kelly Navies: Thank you.

02:42:58.810 --> 02:43:00.120
&gt;&gt; Guha: -- that's all
been very kind of you

02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:02.680
to speak so nice of the archives.

02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:07.350
Maybe if it's not too impossible
a question, could you talk perhaps

02:43:07.350 --> 02:43:09.960
about what are your
biggest frustrations

02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:11.730
with using archival materials?

02:43:11.730 --> 02:43:15.590
Because we certainly working at
the library, work in the museum,

02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:19.220
working at the archives of
the American Folklife Center,

02:43:19.220 --> 02:43:22.590
we need to know from the user
base not just the fan base

02:43:22.590 --> 02:43:25.960
as to what we do and
what we could do better.

02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:27.260 position:56%
Sorry, I mean, any-- and all of you.

02:43:27.260 --> 02:43:28.740
&gt;&gt; Kelly Navies: That's
for the audience.

02:43:28.740 --> 02:43:30.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well--

02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:31.560
&gt;&gt; Guha: And you guys, I guess
since you're the principal users--

02:43:31.560 --> 02:43:32.860
&gt;&gt; Kelly Navies: OK.

02:43:32.860 --> 02:43:34.800
&gt;&gt; Guha: -- users but also
from other folks here.

02:43:34.800 --> 02:43:36.100
Take it away.

02:43:36.100 --> 02:43:38.660
&gt;&gt; Kelly Navies: You're trying
to get us in trouble up here.

02:43:38.660 --> 02:43:40.890
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: We're trying
to provide better service.

02:43:40.890 --> 02:43:45.190
&gt;&gt; Kelly Navies: Yes,
somebody else start.

02:43:45.190 --> 02:43:49.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Bishop: Well, I hardly ever
try and get anything out of you, so.

02:43:51.330 --> 02:43:53.660
But you're always extremely
pleasant to work with.

02:43:53.660 --> 02:43:55.320
Well, that-- You know what--

02:43:55.320 --> 02:43:59.190
for advice or fixing your
recording and things like that.

02:43:59.190 --> 02:44:03.150
It's-- I don't know,
and I can tell you

02:44:03.150 --> 02:44:08.800
about a Canadian experience I had.

02:44:08.800 --> 02:44:10.100
I was making-- no.

02:44:10.100 --> 02:44:11.400
No.

02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:15.740
&gt;&gt; Kelly Navies: I have tried
to access the collections

02:44:15.740 --> 02:44:20.030
as an outsider before I came
to work for the Smithsonian.

02:44:20.030 --> 02:44:22.910
I'm also a librarian by training.

02:44:22.910 --> 02:44:31.020 position:56%
I think that a challenge is deciding
what that accurate search term is.

02:44:31.020 --> 02:44:32.920
And that's even for me as a
librarian when you're trying

02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:35.540
to narrow down if you're looking
for photographs or you're looking

02:44:35.540 --> 02:44:39.230
for a specific interview, I
think that is always a challenge

02:44:39.230 --> 02:44:41.280
and I'm not-- I think I know
that's something that we're--

02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:43.500
we work on in cataloging.

02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:47.870
But that is-- That's an area that
we are-- We need to work on more.

02:44:47.870 --> 02:44:50.390
So, all of us because we're
trying to do the same thing now

02:44:50.390 --> 02:44:53.550
in the museum to make people
aware of the collection

02:44:53.550 --> 02:44:55.380
and find what it is that
they're looking for.

02:44:55.380 --> 02:44:58.210
How do you know for
example that Freeman--

02:44:58.210 --> 02:45:02.520
I mean although we do have
metadata that list certain topics,

02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:05.300
but you would necessarily
know Freeman Hrabowski talks

02:45:05.300 --> 02:45:08.110
about Emmett Till just by
knowing that his interviews

02:45:08.110 --> 02:45:10.090
in our collection for example.

02:45:10.090 --> 02:45:14.380
So we have to find ways to
make that information easier

02:45:14.380 --> 02:45:16.680
for the public to [inaudible].

02:45:20.740 --> 02:45:25.600
&gt;&gt; As a video guy, maybe for
Mr. Bishop but also audio files.

02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:28.500
In this day and age it seems like
we're going to shorter and shorter,

02:45:28.500 --> 02:45:31.400
shorter sound bit-- bites
and things like that.

02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:35.160
How important do you feel it
is to kind of document things

02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:38.590
in a longer form and maybe
an unedited, unvarnished

02:45:38.590 --> 02:45:42.750 position:56%
and let people have maybe their full
say because you're seeing shorter

02:45:42.750 --> 02:45:44.910
and shorter sound bites in the
media and things like that.

02:45:44.910 --> 02:45:47.670
So how important is for
multiple places to give

02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:52.160
like the full unedited maybe
unvarnished look into our history

02:45:52.160 --> 02:45:57.810
so people get a full
capsule of it, do you feel.

02:45:57.810 --> 02:46:00.610
&gt;&gt; John Bishop: I'm
working on two films now.

02:46:00.610 --> 02:46:07.280 position:56%
One is with Jake Homiak at the
Smithsonian Anthropology Department.

02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:12.700
And with Rastafarian elders who
are very loquacious and difficult

02:46:12.700 --> 02:46:14.250
to understand, you know,

02:46:14.250 --> 02:46:17.140
they're going to need some
subtitling outside the

02:46:17.140 --> 02:46:20.870
Jamaican community.

02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:25.010
And I've gone back and forth in my
own thinking and talking with Jake

02:46:25.010 --> 02:46:29.190
about alternative ways
of presenting it.

02:46:29.190 --> 02:46:30.800
They all need-- each

02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:36.310
of the interviews we did require
some trimming and they go all

02:46:36.310 --> 02:46:38.170
over the map and then
they come back.

02:46:38.170 --> 02:46:41.160
So there should be some, you know,
consolidating to make it flow

02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:44.730
like a, you know, coherent piece.

02:46:44.730 --> 02:46:47.470
But it might be more
useful to have it.

02:46:47.470 --> 02:46:53.140
There's a series of things 10
minutes or even a 20-minute one

02:46:53.140 --> 02:46:55.850 position:56%
with some annotations going with it.

02:46:55.850 --> 02:46:59.160
And they get this hyper--
more of a hypertext in,

02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:01.840
because no one is going
to watch 90 minutes

02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:05.400
and I'm not sure we could ever
cut it down to 90 minutes.

02:47:05.400 --> 02:47:09.430
Are you familiar with
the concept of this new--

02:47:09.430 --> 02:47:12.630
the smallest narrative unit?

02:47:12.630 --> 02:47:15.520
This is-- There's a movement

02:47:15.520 --> 02:47:21.420
to build platforms
for dealing with this.

02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:25.290
So people can pull the small
narrative units together

02:47:25.290 --> 02:47:28.090
and weave their own piece.

02:47:28.090 --> 02:47:30.640
I don't have much confidence that
people will have the patience

02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:34.190
for that, but it's an
interesting idea in thinking

02:47:34.190 --> 02:47:37.670
when you have large
bodies of material,

02:47:37.670 --> 02:47:40.800
what's going to be the
smallest narrative units

02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:46.230
that you can use possibly
to use in multiple ways

02:47:46.230 --> 02:47:48.840
or string in multiple ways.

02:47:50.170 --> 02:47:54.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Friends, I think
that we have reached the camera man,

02:47:54.850 --> 02:47:58.600
that he's asking his questions
means that we've done our job

02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:02.560
that we've saturated this
audience with thought and ideas.

02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:06.510
And I thank you all very
much for joining me today.

02:48:06.510 --> 02:48:12.370
[ Applause ]

02:48:12.370 --> 02:48:13.670
&gt;&gt; Kelly Navies: So
great to meet you.

02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:15.970
&gt;&gt; John Bishop: It's
great to meet you and--

02:48:19.260 --> 02:48:22.230
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So just in
closing, I'd like to kind

02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:26.010
of reiterate something that
my colleague Todd Harvey said,

02:48:26.010 --> 02:48:28.460
which is what a privilege
it is to work at a place

02:48:28.460 --> 02:48:30.990
like the American Folklife
Center where we have

02:48:30.990 --> 02:48:35.150
such wonderful collections and such
wonderful people who are dedicated

02:48:35.150 --> 02:48:38.190
to making these collections
accessible to everyone.

02:48:38.190 --> 02:48:42.410 position:56%
And not only can we bring a group of
wonderful people like this together

02:48:42.410 --> 02:48:44.080
for a whole day as Todd said.

02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:49.020
We hope to be able to do so for a
whole 1.5 days because we are going

02:48:49.020 --> 02:48:51.710 position:56%
to continue this tomorrow of course.

02:48:51.710 --> 02:48:55.460
And tomorrow we're going to
be talking about two sort

02:48:55.460 --> 02:48:58.030
of separate communities
that have issues that--

02:48:58.030 --> 02:49:03.380
or whose oral narratives
and whose material has it--

02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:08.020
have issues for collectors
and for archivist.

02:49:08.020 --> 02:49:11.020
And those are indigenous
communities and veterans.

02:49:11.020 --> 02:49:14.310
So we'll be talking specifically
about our indigenous collections

02:49:14.310 --> 02:49:16.620
and about the Veterans
History Project tomorrow.

02:49:16.620 --> 02:49:20.780
So we welcome you back tomorrow
to hear about those materials.

02:49:20.780 --> 02:49:25.690
But we'd also like to thank a
whole lot of people for today.

02:49:25.690 --> 02:49:27.710
So first of all I'd
like to thank the staff

02:49:27.710 --> 02:49:30.860
of the American Folklife Center
who's done such a great job

02:49:30.860 --> 02:49:32.210
in putting this together.

02:49:32.210 --> 02:49:39.780
Particularly those people who
you saw up here on the stage,

02:49:39.780 --> 02:49:44.800
but also a number of people like
Thea Austin who does a lot of work

02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:46.990
on these events but does
not get seen on the stage.

02:49:46.990 --> 02:49:49.010
So we'd like to thank them as well.

02:49:49.010 --> 02:49:50.450
[ Applause ]

02:49:50.450 --> 02:49:52.830
We'd like to thank
all of the speakers

02:49:52.830 --> 02:49:55.340
from today including this
wonderful panel here.

02:49:55.340 --> 02:49:59.750
There have just been such
great ideas being thrown around

02:49:59.750 --> 02:50:02.880
and so many different ideas
and so much to think about.

02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:05.540
So we'd really like to thank
everyone who spoke today.

02:50:05.540 --> 02:50:07.510
A round of applause
for them as well.

02:50:07.510 --> 02:50:12.340
[ Applause ]

02:50:12.340 --> 02:50:14.780
We'd like to thank our sound
crew and our video crew.

02:50:14.780 --> 02:50:18.620 position:56%
They're helping us get this together
and put it on the web as I said

02:50:18.620 --> 02:50:21.570
so that this like the archival
materials that we're talking

02:50:21.570 --> 02:50:23.140
about will be accessible.

02:50:23.140 --> 02:50:24.810 position:56%
And that's a really important thing.

02:50:24.810 --> 02:50:28.210
So we'd like to thank them as well.

02:50:31.650 --> 02:50:36.030
And finally, one thing that
came up again and again

02:50:36.030 --> 02:50:41.570
in our discussions today was how
the Library of Congress goes about

02:50:41.570 --> 02:50:42.870
and working with all this material.

02:50:42.870 --> 02:50:44.660
And one thing that we should say is

02:50:44.660 --> 02:50:50.010
that the American Folklife Center
is not, you know, an isolated unit.

02:50:50.010 --> 02:50:54.590
We actually work within
a library that has a lot

02:50:54.590 --> 02:51:00.140 position:56%
of resources available for us to
work with including a whole ITS team

02:51:00.140 --> 02:51:05.520
that puts things like this on
the web and also a whole web team

02:51:05.520 --> 02:51:07.880
that puts our materials on the web.

02:51:07.880 --> 02:51:10.220
So there is just a whole lot of
people throughout the Library

02:51:10.220 --> 02:51:12.670
of Congress in all the
divisions that we work

02:51:12.670 --> 02:51:15.390
with that we really couldn't
do our jobs without them.

02:51:15.390 --> 02:51:17.980
So we'd like to thank them as well.

02:51:21.870 --> 02:51:25.770
And finally, we would like to thank
you for coming and participating

02:51:25.770 --> 02:51:28.860
in this in all the ways that you've
done and we really want you to,

02:51:28.860 --> 02:51:31.940
as I said, continue to
participate tomorrow.

02:51:31.940 --> 02:51:34.230
So we look forward to
having you here tomorrow.

02:51:34.230 --> 02:51:37.270
Now, I would like to point out
that the wall has been removed.

02:51:37.270 --> 02:51:39.390
We've broken the third wall.

02:51:39.390 --> 02:51:42.300
And this means that-- or the
fourth wall I guess I should say.

02:51:42.300 --> 02:51:45.580
And this means that behind
there you will find a reception.

02:51:45.580 --> 02:51:48.610
And any of you of course
who have signed

02:51:48.610 --> 02:51:51.770
up for the dinners will
be proceeding to them

02:51:51.770 --> 02:51:53.120
after the reception is over.

02:51:53.120 --> 02:51:56.250
So now it's time to think about all
those wonderful issues that came

02:51:56.250 --> 02:51:59.330
up within your discussions and
remember the people that you wanted

02:51:59.330 --> 02:52:02.820
to ask a particular question of and
find those people at the reception

02:52:02.820 --> 02:52:04.440
and we'll continue chatting then.

02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:07.870
So once again, I'm Steve Winick
for the American Folklife Center

02:52:07.870 --> 02:52:09.640
and we will see you again tomorrow.

02:52:09.640 --> 02:52:11.940
But for the moment let's
hang out and have some fun.

02:52:11.940 --> 02:52:13.410
Thank you.

02:52:13.410 --> 02:52:15.570
[ Applause ]

02:52:15.570 --> 02:52:19.210

of the Library of Congress.
