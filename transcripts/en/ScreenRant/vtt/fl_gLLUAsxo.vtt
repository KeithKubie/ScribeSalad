00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.450
No one can know what the future holds, but
writers and filmmakers are constantly taking

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.780
their best guess, trying to predict technology
and world affairs decades ahead of time - or

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.460
showing a future they only WISH would come
true. Now that&nbsp;October 21, 2015&nbsp;- the future

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:34.461
date that blew Marty McFly's mind - has finally
arrived, it's time to see just how much the

00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:37.610
movie got right. But it's not the only film
that turned out be a lot more accurate than

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.380
the filmmakers probably ever expected (even
if we're still waiting on hover boards). Here

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.040
are Screenrant's 10 Movies That Actually Predicted
The Future.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.159
Back to the Future Part II

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.879
The version of October, 2015 that Marty McFly
visited in this time travelling sequel isn't

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.232
anywhere near as advanced as our own, but
some of the future tech promised in the movie

00:00:54.232 --> 00:00:57.840
was right on the money. The ability to watch
multiple channels at once on a wall-mounted

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.850
TV is taken for granted now, and even getting
to video chat with coworkers on the comfort

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.780
of your home instead of using a phone was
made possible through teleconferencing programs

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.720
like Skype, or Face time. Thankfully, people
don't lose their jobs over fax machines...

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.560
Probably because we just don't use them anymore.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.560
Minority Report

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.409
Steven Spielberg consulted real tech experts
when crafting the future of this Tom Cruise

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.590
adventure, from self-driving cars to targeted
advertising. But no gadget turned more heads

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.750
than the gesture-based computing and user
interface seen in Pre-Crime headquarters.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.260
It's crazy to think that touchscreens completely
replacing standard interfaces was deemed science

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.909
fiction, but audiences and inventors clearly
liked what they saw.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:34.909
Total Recall

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.189
It's hard to imagine that in less than a century,
people could be living and working on the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.619
planet Mars, but not every idea in Total Recall
is so far-fetched. When the movie was released

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.899
in 1990, nothing was more of a fantasy than
a car that would take its driver for a ride

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.340
by simply stating their destination. But enough
research and technology has been put into

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.939
self-driving cars by Google alone to convince
experts that they really are the future. They

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.110
may not include the robot driver of the movie's
Johnnycab, but the idea was ahead of its time.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.640
2001: A Space Odyssey

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.960
It's no secret that Stanley Kubrick's astronaut
epic became one of the most influential in

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.821
not just science fiction, but filmmaking as
a whole. The movie was such a landmark, it's

00:02:09.821 --> 00:02:13.490
hard to know if Kubrick's vision of space
travel predicted the future, or technology

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.209
just tried to recreate the movie's style.
But the star of the movie, just like the novel,

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.260
was the murderous A.I., HAL. An artificial
computer program that takes orders and reacts

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.140
like a human - voice and all - was total fiction.
But when Siri brought exactly that to millions

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.980
of iPhones, mods and apps that gave HAL's
voice to the feature weren't for behind.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.940
Back to the Future Part II

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.920
Although virtual reality headsets or Google
Glass haven't revolutionized society just

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.690
yet, the idea of playing video games without
using your hands really is possible (Elijah

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.720
Wood arcade scene when he first arrives).
Today's gamers still prefer game pads and,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.950
and virtual reality hasn't gone mainstream
yet. But who knows, the average teenager really

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.379
could be wearing Marty Jr's goggles before
long.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.379
Blade Runner

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.110
Seeing Los Angeles packed shoulder to shoulder,
struggling with pollution and crime isn't

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.700
too hard to believe, but moving digital billboards
big enough to cover the sides of entire buildings?

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.340
That was entirely alien when Blade Runner
hit theatres. But extreme advertising has

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.050
already forced several cities to outlaw the
size and brightness of billboards, including

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.489
video screens. It's not as extreme just yet,
but if companies have their way, seeing a

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.159
building-sized Coke ad or a Geisha eating
candy may not be too far away.

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.159
Jurassic Park&nbsp;

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.209
Author Michael Crichton's story of re-engineered
dinosaurs was inspired by actual research

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.220
into DNA preserved in petrified mosquitoes,
but when the movie released, experts line

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.930
up to call it a fantasy, since no Dinosaur
DNA or blood could survive to modern times.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.390
But the theory was sound. In 2015, scientists
at Harvard University inserted wooly mammoth

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.530
DNA into that of an Asian elephant. Like the
movie's dinosaurs, it wouldn't be an EXACT

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.680
clone. But returning mammoths from extinction
could be the first step.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.680
The Cable Guy&nbsp;

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.231
Ben Stiller's tale of an obsessed cable guy
wasn't a hit when it released in 1996, but

00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:58.620
Jim Carrey's crazed character turned out to
be downright prophetic. At the time, merging

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.129
TV, phones, and video games using the Internet
sounded like the ramblings of a madman. But

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.530
listen to it these days, and it's hard to
believe how well Carrey guessed the Internet

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.960
would change the world - for couch potatoes
in particular.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.010
Enemy of the State

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.120
Not every leap forward in technology is a
good one, and these days, the idea that "big

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.040
brother is watching" is more accurate than
ever. And one Will Smith movie predicted the

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.000
rise of the surveillance state with chilling
accuracy. A push for increased NSA clearance

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.919
and satellite monitoring kicks Enemy of the
State into action, and every government asset

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.310
is used to track an American lawyer with damaging
information. Audiences were wowed at the idea

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.181
that the NSA could listen in on every phone
call and hack into every camera. They probably

00:04:35.181 --> 00:04:39.550
didn't think that just a decade later, government
officials would be testifying about the legality

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.610
of those very same programs.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.610
The Net&nbsp;

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.810
When this cyber thriller was released in 1995,
most people didn't even know what an online

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.330
identity meant - so the idea of someone "stealing
your identity" using only computers seemed

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.020
ridiculous. Today, almost anyone can find
out how much trouble a hacked bank account,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.639
email, or stolen credit card number can really
be. The movie may go overboard with evil software

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.240
companies, but it's not make believe anymore.
And thankfully, computers really CAN be used

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.699
to order a pizza these days, too.

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.830

gadgets or technology? Let us know in the
