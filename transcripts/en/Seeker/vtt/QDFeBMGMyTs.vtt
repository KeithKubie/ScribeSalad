00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.430
ESP isn't real.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.055
And no, you don't
have a 6th sense.

00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:04.680
You're just going to
crush all my hopes

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.455
and dreams like that, huh?

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:06.913
Yeah, well, if you
had a 6th sense,

00:00:06.913 --> 00:00:09.360
you'd know that I secretly
love to crush hopes and dreams.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.030
You don't need ESP to see that.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.620
Hey, everyone.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.536
Lacy and Anthony here.

00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:18.980
You've heard of ESP, right?

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.240
It stands for
extrasensory perception,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.630
and refers to the ability to
pick up things with your mind.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.020
As opposed to your ears, eyes,
nose, mouth and skin, which

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.242
obviously have nothing to
do with the mind, I guess.

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:30.950
Clearly, clearly.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.260
ESP is, in a nutshell,
knowing something

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.610
that isn't immediately obvious.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.859
For instance, you're sitting
next to a dude on a train

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.070
and you sense that he's
been in a car accident.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.761
Or that he murdered someone.

00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:41.260
Right.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.610
Or murder detection, which
is a very useful ESP skill.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.920
Despite the fact that more
than one in three Americans

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.390
believes in it, a year-long
study published in Plus One

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.306
this week is ruling out the
possibility of a 6th sense.

00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:53.930
In the study they
found that it's true,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.610
people who claim to have ESP
are picking up on something.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.780
But it's not because
they're psychic.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.280
Right.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.120
It's because, for instance in
the case of the murdery jerk

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.090
on the train, you might
have subconsciously

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.800
noticed a fleck of
blood on his jacket.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.770
We're intuitively processing
what we're seeing,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.560
and our mind draws
some conclusions.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.650
The catch is that
we don't consciously

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.900
realize that our sense is peaked
because of the blood, which

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.800
leads some people to attribute
it to psychic ability.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.460
Other examples
might be registering

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.290
scars on someone's
face and knowing

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.974
that something bad
probably happened,

00:01:22.974 --> 00:01:25.390
or registering that your kids
are really quiet, so they're

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.360
up to no good, or picking up
on subtle communication cues

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.720
and predicting that a
couple is about to break up.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.970
The brain does a lot
of tricksy things.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.130
The more of these paranormal
studies that come out,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.087
the more I realize I
can't trust my own brain.

00:01:37.087 --> 00:01:38.170
It's a little frightening.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.430
How did they go about the study?

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.960
Well, it all started
with a student

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.340
who claimed to have a 6th sense.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.756
The lead scientist wanted to
figure out what was going on.

00:01:44.756 --> 00:01:46.760
The team showed student
participants an image,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.450
gave a one-second pause, and
then showed another image.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.330
And sometimes, the second
image was the same.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.585
Other times, it had
a very subtle change.

00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:56.120
And when the image
changed, the students

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.210
had no idea what
change, they just

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.950
knew that something
more was there.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.470
Amongst those students who
picked up on the change

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.380
that they couldn't
explain, some said

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.216
it was because of
their 6th sense.

00:02:06.216 --> 00:02:07.830
So essentially, the
researchers found

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.580
that what people are
calling the 6th sense

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.990
is information that we
aren't consciously aware of,

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.224
or can't verbalize.

00:02:13.224 --> 00:02:14.890
This happens because
the brain is always

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.900
taking sensory metrics,
visual cues, [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.142
cues, faint sounds
in the distance.

00:02:19.142 --> 00:02:20.600
They're constantly
being registered

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.880
in what is essentially
a giant, constantly

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.270
running database in your brain.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.370
And only when the information
is of immediate concern or focus

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.705
do we really draw on all
that sensory information

00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:32.080
that we're subconsciously
receiving from our environment.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.690
I love the way the researchers
describe this, by the way,

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.774
like an abstract painting.

00:02:35.774 --> 00:02:38.398
You looked at it and you're not
really sure what you're seeing,

00:02:38.398 --> 00:02:40.990
and yet you get some sense of
what the painting is about.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.740
It's like magic.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.250
Except it's not
magic, it's science.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.720
It's science magic.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.999
No, it's just science.

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:50.790
Thanks for joining us
for D News, everyone.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.170
What psychic skill do
you wish you possess?

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.880
Oh, I like the one where
you can start fires.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.300
And I also like the one
when you turn invisible,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.020
because then you start
the fire and no one knows.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.520
OK.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.090
So tell us about
it in the comments.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.530
And if the studio hasn't
burned down by then,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.279
we will be back with
more science updates.

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:09.570
And if it does burn down,
you won't know who did it.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.320
Yeah, we're gonna
know who did it.
