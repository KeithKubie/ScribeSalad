1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.740
The Joe Rogan experience.
Whereas like say a Chappelle,
if it was like,

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:09.540
you should go after like an hour.
Well,
you know,
he's got a very unique process.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.620
Chip Chappelle does,

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.220
and he can turn over an hour like no one I've ever seen before.

5
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:16.860
And I was talking to Donna wrongs about it recently,
who,
you know,

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.480
was on the Chappelle show with him and he's like,

7
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.260
we both agreed like he's the best ever at turning over a new hour.

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.490
He could have a new way.

9
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:27.930
He could release a Netflix special and then have a new hour within a couple of

10
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.320
weeks.
He doesn't even make sense.
I don't,
I don't understand how he's doing it.

11
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.850
It must just floodings it's just,
he's in a great space.
You know,

12
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.040
he's in a great mindset to do comedy.
You know,
if,

13
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.080
if you pay attention to how,
you know,
when,
when people study,

14
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.280
like have you read outliers,
um,
and you read how people,

15
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.600
when people study,

16
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.470
why people are great at what they do and what makes them exceptional.

17
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.000
There's always a variety of factors and whatever the factors are with Dave,

18
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.000
he's got this easygoing personality,

19
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.750
this like very carefully carefree way of looking at things.

20
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.400
He's also gone through a lot of bullshit in his career with the leavings of the

21
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.050
Chappelle show and you know,

22
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.740
abandoning $50 million and going to Africa and really understanding what is real

23
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:19.860
motivation where he was caught up in that world where they were trying to change

24
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:24.861
him and commercialize his television show and he handled it as good as anybody

25
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:25.980
that's ever handled it.

26
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.170
He handled fame and temptation I think better than anyone I've ever heard of.

27
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.290
He just said,
fuck you.
And he just went away.

28
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.160
He went away and then didn't do gigs for years.
People don't understand.

29
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.150
He would show up and do standup places,
but he wouldn't book anything.

30
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.950
So like he wasn't getting paid.
He was just,
he did stand up.

31
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:50.070
Dave Chappelle did stand up in the park in Seattle.

32
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.510
He brought like a little amplifier and a microphone set up and just started

33
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:56.370
doing stand up and people just gathered round.

34
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.570
And he did this just to sort of get him back in touch with his roots.

35
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:04.140
Cause he used to do a lot of street performing in New York and I saw him do a

36
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:05.460
street performing in Montreal.

37
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:08.610
We did a club and then we came out of the club and Dave,

38
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.030
I think Dave was like 18 and 19 is a time just started doing stand up on the

39
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:15.390
street and put his hat out and people would put money in his hat.

40
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.660
I mean he was a constantly sharpening that sword and he stopped doing standup

41
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.550
for a long time in terms of like booking gigs.
And then after a while I said,

42
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:30.210
fuck it,
I'm gonna come back again.
And then he started doing these gigantic gigs.

43
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:32.470
And then of course he did his two recent,
uh,

44
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.490
Netflix specials were amongst his best work ever and you know,
and now he's,

45
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.860
he's working all the time.

46
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:41.550
He's constantly popping into the comedy store and the comedy cellar and all

47
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:45.930
these different clubs all across the country and constantly doing standup and no

48
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:49.320
social media.
He goes not not involved in any of that stuff.

49
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.160
It doesn't do anything just to just perform.
It's just does this stuff.
Yeah.

50
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:55.680
That's interesting.
When you,
it's like I,

51
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.160
I feel that some people have like found the essence and found

52
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.450
<v 1>their path and live it like,
and like they know the light there.</v>

53
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.620
A Yogi or a priest or something,
but he's just got a devotional.
This is who I am.

54
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.440
I'm not doing anything but it's not that.
And yeah,

55
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.910
that's exhibited even in earlier stuff prior to the crime that you know what you

56
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.820
were just,
you know,
the crisis of the 50 million walk away thing.

57
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.070
Like by then if he was 18 doing them clubs,
he was hardened.
Like what?
That,

58
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.880
what seems so loose on stage was something that had been refined as a person

59
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:32.110
who's comfortable and he was always good.
He was good when I first met him

60
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.400
<v 0>when he was like 18 I think he was 18 I was 21 so it was somewhere in that
range.</v>

61
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.060
Maybe I was a little older maybe who's a,
maybe it was like how old day?

62
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.650
46 47 I think he's five years younger than me.

63
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.210
Is that correct?
46 or 47 45 okay.

64
00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:52.990
So He's more so six years,
six years younger than me.
So you know,

65
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.940
I was probably 25 and he was probably 18 ish,

66
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.600
25 26 1817 but he was um,

67
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.380
he was so like calm and like he was very like,

68
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:12.160
it was,
you were attracted to listening to him.
It was like,
like look at this guy.

69
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.400
Like this guy is like so comfortable in his own skin and so friendly and easy

70
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:19.360
going and hilarious.

71
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.630
But who he was then and then who he became is all the work that he put in.

72
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.600
You know,
it's like he had this base of this really,
you know,

73
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.210
this curious young,

74
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.470
very wise person who saw things that other people didn't see in the world.

75
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.230
And then he just kept going and just kept going.

76
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:41.890
And then of course the Chappelle show,
which is in my opinion,

77
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:44.050
the greatest sketch comedy show of all time,

78
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:48.790
even though it was only two seasons to the best ever.
And then after that,

79
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.910
I mean he's basically just on stand up and done it completely outside of the

80
00:04:52.911 --> 00:04:55.600
system.
He's done some parts in movies and shit like that,

81
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:59.350
but for the most part what he's doing is just stand up completely outside of the

82
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:04.240
Hollywood system.
Completely free,
just goes up,
you know,
just to talk some shit.

83
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.920
How's a couple of drinks,
laughs and,
and,
and a,
and it's incredibly compelling.

84
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.750
He's found his groove,
you know,
and that's,

85
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.430
it's a beautiful thing to watch as a fellow standup comedy practitioner when

86
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:18.340
someone,
he it treat Cheves this mastery level,
like we,
you know,

87
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:21.760
we were talking about like this Hixon Gracie of standup comedy level because

88
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:22.560
that's where he's at,
right?

89
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.220
<v 1>Yeah,
I agree with you.
Become who you are.
Yeah.
He's,
yeah,</v>

90
00:05:26.221 --> 00:05:29.220
he's become himself and he doesn't have things that are getting in the way of

91
00:05:29.221 --> 00:05:29.590
that.

92
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.280
<v 0>Yeah.
That's what's really interesting.
Like,
you don't see him.
He's like,</v>

93
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:35.410
it's not on social media.
He's not on anything.

94
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:37.930
Twitter or Facebook is not on any of that shit.

95
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.920
He doesn't pay attention to any of it.
He's just just being a person,

96
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:46.570
just being a person and doing stand up.
You know,
it's a,
and he doesn't have to,

97
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:49.630
which is unique to,
you know,
he doesn't have to promote things.

98
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.650
They just sell out.

99
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.610
<v 1>Well,
an amazing example,
or an amazing example.</v>

100
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.670
I've got promote some things.
So what do you the book mentors.

101
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.250
<v 2>Huh?</v>

102
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.450
<v 1>So I've really learned some powerful lessons there from the story that of a,</v>

103
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:08.090
the apotheosis of comedy that Dave Chappelle's achieved.

104
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:09.340
Here's these obligations.
Yep.
