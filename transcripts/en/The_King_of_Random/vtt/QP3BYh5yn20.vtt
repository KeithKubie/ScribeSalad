If you're looking for a fun and cheap way
to watch events like the Superbowl or March

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.040
Madness, here's a low budget life hack that
will convert your laptop, smartphone, or tablet

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.020
into an improvised home-theatre!

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.750
I started this project with a cardboard box,
and a roll of duct-tape. I got the black kind.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.290
Aside from those, the only other thing we'll
need is a simple magnifying lens. I got this

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.850
one online for about $4 with free shipping.
These are typically sold as full page magnifiers

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.960
for reading small text. The end of this cardboard box is just slightly bigger than the plastic

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.030
lens. So let's place it in the middle, and
when it looks about center, we can trace around

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.610
the edges. Now the lens is gonna be taped
to the inside of this box, so let's trace

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.860
out another set of lines about 1/2" smaller,
and now the setup should look like this. While

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.810
we're here, let's use a credit card or hotel
key to trace out a rectangle in the center.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.149
Alright, it's time to get to work making some
cuts, and scissors can be a little awkward,

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.079
so I'm gonna try using this steak knife
instead. Let's start by cutting out the center

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.539
piece, taking time to make the cuts as clean
as possible. Now we'll need to cut along the

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.060
inside edges, and if you've done it right
you should be left with a piece that looks

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.749
like this, but don't throw it away. Now this
part is optional, but I'm gonna add some

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:41.109
duct-tape along the cut edges just to smooth
them over and clean up the look. Now let's

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:46.729
flip the box over to expose the inside, and
add our lens. This gets placed over the hole

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.840
with the grooved side facing up. Some more
duct-tape is added to secure the lens in position,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.149
and now we can work on making the box a little
more sturdy. I'm folding the big bottom flaps

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.799
in first, so that the smaller flaps are on
the outside. A strip of tape will ensure the

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.179
inside bottom is flat and smooth, and the
outside flaps are taped down as well. Next,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.180
let's use our knife to cut down the two corners
at the back to make a flap that opens up.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.410
The top can now be closed, and tape used to
hold everything together firm and strong.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.210
I gave mine a quick paint job, and there's
the finished projector.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.240
Well, that was cheap and easy. 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.580
Ok we're gonna need a projection screen,
so I went to a sign supply company and found

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.170
this sheet of 0.02 hi-impact styrene for about
$2. The sheet is 4 feet wide and adding a

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.700
little black duct-tape to the edges gives
it a nice looking border. I had just enough

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.640
tape left to hang the screen on the wall,
and rig up a make-shift theatre room. Now

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.060
this lens configuration will allow the most
light to shine through, but if your okay with a

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.110
darker but crisper image, you can go ahead
and add the shroud to the front of the lens.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.290
This will tighten the aperture and give a
better focus. At this point we're about ready

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.760
to test it out. I'm gonna try it with this
iPad, and we'll need to go into the settings

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.260
menu and make sure we lock the rotation of
the screen. We'll also need to bring the light

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.400
up to maximum. To hold your tablet upright
in the projector, you'll need to find something

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.640
sturdy. This box of tomato paste was the right
size for me, so I used a couple of rubber

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.020
bands to hold the iPad firmly against the
box and with the screen flipped upside down.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.200
This can be slid into the projector, and

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.460
you may need to play around with the positing
of your tablet to see where it focuses the

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.320
best. Ok let's turn off the lights and test
it out. 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.600
Well there you go. We just made a

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.040
cheap version of a 50" home theatre, and it
looks pretty decent.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.990
If you try this with your smartphone, the
process is pretty much the same, but your

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.210
picture will be a little smaller. I found
that a laptop computer gives the best results

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.710
because it's got the brightest screen. It
fits together a little differently, but works

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.950
for all the same reasons. So if you're trying
to save money there's a little trick that

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.900
will hopefully keep costs low, and put a fun
spin on your next sports party. If you liked

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.440
this project, perhaps you'll like some of
my others. Check them out at www.thekingofrandom.com
