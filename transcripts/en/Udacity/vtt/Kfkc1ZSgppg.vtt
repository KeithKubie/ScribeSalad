00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Andrew Goldberg described a data structure that can be used

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to very rapidly compute shortest-path distances between nodes in a network.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The way that it worked was each node of the network has a label.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What a label is is a list of other nodes in a network that he called hubs

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
along with the distance to that hub.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The hubs are chosen for each node,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the labels are chosen for each node,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
so that they have the property that for any two nodes in the network,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
any two nodes where you want to compute a shortest-path length between them,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
will have some hub in common in their labels that is on the shortest path

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
between those nodes.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Let's make sure that you have a feel for this idea,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and let's look at a particular kind of network--a star network--

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
where there is one node in the middle and all these other nodes directly connected to it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
How many hubs do we need to list in the labels of each of the nodes in a star network

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
so that we can make sure that we satisfy this property

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that we can compute the shortest path length sufficiently,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
specifically because for any pair of nodes in the network

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
their labels will have some hub in common.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Why don't you type the number into the box.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You can use this particular star network as your example

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and give the answer for this star network,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but it turns out it actually works for star networks of any size.
