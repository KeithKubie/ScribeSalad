00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.896
Now what do we get if we multiply this entire quantity x minus 2 times what we

00:00:03.896 --> 00:00:08.480
wrote up here, x squared? Please write your answer in this box, and make sure

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.928
that you write it in standard form for polynomials. So in other words write the

00:00:12.928 --> 00:00:17.949
highest degree term here and then the next highest here and so on and so forth.
