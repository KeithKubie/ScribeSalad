00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.370
Welcome back.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.600
Where we left the last
problem, we essentially

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.750
found ourselves having to solve
this equation right over here.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.260
And where we left off, we
said, well, maybe, just maybe,

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.610
we might be able to
simplify this a little bit

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.180
if we can find some common
factors between the numerator

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.200
and the denominator.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.879
And I want to do it here because
if I multiplied this out,

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:19.670
and multiply it times
the square root of 3,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.620
and then subtract
it or add it to that

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.367
so I got just a straight-up
polynomial, that polynomial

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:27.200
is going to have the
square root of 3 in it.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.960
It's going to be a really,
really messy thing.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.760
And it's still going
to be fourth degree.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.080
And at least this way,
I have some chance

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.220
of being able to solve it.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.910
At least I just have integer
coefficients over here.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.000
And the only way that
this is going to simplify

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.370
is if it has any common factors
with the stuff down here.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.110
And when you look
over here, this right

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.680
here is actually going
to have complex roots

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.550
if you did the negative b plus
or minus the square root of b

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.350
squared minus 4ac over 2a.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.675
The b squared
minus 4ac over here

00:00:56.675 --> 00:00:58.050
is actually going
to be negative.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.130
So it's not going to
have any real roots.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.569
So that is not going to have any
easy, real roots, but this is.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:10.390
The x squared plus 1, that
has x plus 1 and x minus 1.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.670
Or another way to think
about it is roots to this

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.800
are negative 1 and positive 1.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.722
So if either of those
are roots to this,

00:01:17.722 --> 00:01:18.680
then we're in business.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.050
And actually, just
looking at this,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.630
there's a decent chance,
because in general,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.640
if you want to think about the
roots of really any n-th degree

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.819
polynomial, the roots,
if you think about them--

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.110
let me just write it over here.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.453
If I have a bunch of roots--
x minus r1, x minus r2,

00:01:36.453 --> 00:01:40.220
x minus r3, and
then let's say we

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.867
have a fourth
degree, x minus r4.

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.200
So let's say we have four roots.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.360
When you multiply
this whole thing,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.110
you're going to have x to the
fourth plus blah, blah, blah,

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.760
blah, blah, all the way.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:56.000
And then the last term over here
is going to be r1, r2, r3, r4.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.680
It's going to be the
product of all of these.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.420
And so if you wanted
to put this equation

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.130
right or this
expression in this form,

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.490
you divide the whole
expression by 2.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.009
Or you can kind of say, well,
let's just look at this thing

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.987
and divide it by 2.

00:02:09.987 --> 00:02:11.820
And then you would have
x to the fourth plus

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.070
2x, all of that plus 1/2.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.900
And so this thing would
have to, in this context,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.910
be equal to 1 over 2.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.200
And away, this is
kind of a-- it's

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.410
not a fail-proof
technique, but it

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.480
is one way to kind of
discover roots, is you,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.300
say, OK, the roots could
be the factors of this

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.630
divided by the factors of that.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.012
And 1 is definitely a
factor of both of those.

00:02:35.012 --> 00:02:36.970
And actually, if you
think about it, negative 1

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.678
could be as well.

00:02:37.678 --> 00:02:38.820
So we feel good.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.070
But let's actually try it out.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.986
Instead of going through
all of this argument,

00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:43.890
let's actually see if
either 1 or negative 1

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.130
are factors of
this thing up here.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.880
If they're not,
then we just have

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.942
to move ahead and multiply
this thing out, multiply it

00:02:52.942 --> 00:02:54.650
by square root of 3,
and then just solve.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.860
But we can hope.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.200
Usually the test writers
aren't that big sadists.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.100
Otherwise, it would be
impossible to solve.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.550
So I'm feeling good about this.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.170
So let's just try it with 1.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.280
So if we try 1 here,
so let's put 1 here

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.770
and see if we get 0 over here.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.709
So if we get 2 times 1 to
the fourth plus-- so let

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:14.500
me just write that.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.810
So 2 times 1 to the fourth
is just 2, plus 2 times

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.130
1 to the third is just 2, minus
3 times 1 squared is just 3,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.270
minus 2 plus 1.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.100
So this is 4 minus 5 plus 1.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.050
That indeed equals 0.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.500
And let's try negative 1.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.390
So this is 2 times
negative 1 to the fourth.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.800
That's still 2.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.410
Plus 2 times negative 1 to the
third, so that's negative 2.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.480
Minus 3 times negative 1
squared, that's negative 3.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.340
And then minus 2 times negative
1, so that's plus 2 plus 1.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.860
So this is 0 minus
3 plus 2 plus 1.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.860
This also cancels out.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.100
This also gets us 0.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.900
So we now know that both
x plus 1 and x minus 1

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.790
are factors of
this thing up here.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.720
Or another way to
think about it is

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.150
their product is a factor
of this thing up here. x

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.330
squared minus 1 is
a factor of this.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.824
So if we were to divide x
squared minus 1 into this,

00:04:09.824 --> 00:04:11.240
we should get a
reasonable answer.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.365
We shouldn't get a remainder,
I guess I should say.

00:04:13.365 --> 00:04:14.280
So let's do that.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.155
So we're going to get
a little practice doing

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.630
polynomial long division.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.890
So if we divide x squared minus
1 into this thing up here,

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.470
2x to the fourth plus
2x to the third minus

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.970
3x squared minus 2x plus 1.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.330
So this is good practice on
polynomial long division--

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.750
highest degree term going
into highest degree term.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.720
x squared goes into 2x to
the fourth 2x squared times.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.070
So let's put that in
the 2x squared spot.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.370
2x squared times x squared
is 2x to the fourth.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.650
2x squared times negative
1 is negative 2x squared.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.400
And now let's subtract
this from up there.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.510
So we'll multiply by it
negative 1 and then add it.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:07.550
And so this gives
us 2x to the third.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.770
Negative 3 plus 2, so it's
minus x squared minus 2x plus 1.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:20.360
And then x squared goes into
2x to the third 2x times.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.930
So this is plus 2x.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.730
2x times x squared
is 2x to the third.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:32.400
2x times negative
1 is negative 2x.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.370
And then we can subtract
this from there,

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.840
or you could say
add the negative.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.131
So let's just add the negative.

00:05:37.131 --> 00:05:38.760
It's easier to keep
track of things.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.900
So those cancel out.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.550
You get negative x squared--
these cancel out-- plus 1.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.790
x squared goes into negative
x squared minus-- or negative

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.020
1 times.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.310
Negative 1 times x squared
is negative x squared.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.830
Negative 1 times
negative 1 is positive 1.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.620
And indeed, we get no remainder.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.500
So we can write
this thing up here.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.610
We can write it as
the product of this.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.150
So it is equal
to-- so this thing

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.590
we can rewrite as 2x squared
plus 2x minus 1 times x

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.520
squared minus 1.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.890
So this times this is
equal to this, so times

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.690
x squared minus 1.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.660
So we just factored it.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.934
And so that simplifies
things a good bit.

00:06:22.934 --> 00:06:24.350
It doesn't make
it trivial, but it

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.880
simplifies things a good bit.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.200
So now we can cancel
that with that.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.940
And now at least we have
things in second degree.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.190
We got rid of these third
and fourth degree terms.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.990
So let's now rewrite things.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.480
So now let's multiply both
sides of this equation

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.300
by x squared plus x plus 1.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.980
So we're going to get
the square root of 3-- so

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.420
let me just write it out.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.420
So I'm going to get the
square root of 3 times

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.820
x squared plus the
square root of 3 times x

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.780
plus the square
root of 3 times 1--

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.170
so I just multiplied the
left-hand side by what we have

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.584
left in the denominator-- is
equal to what we have left

00:07:05.584 --> 00:07:07.250
in the numerator,
because if we multiply

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.320
the right side by this,
it obviously cancels out.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:18.440
So this is going to be equal
to 2x squared plus 2x minus 1.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:24.900
And now if we want to-- now
let's see what we can do here.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:30.130
Well, we can subtract the
stuff on the right side

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.230
from the left-hand side.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:37.170
And so we would get the
square root of 3 minus 2 times

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:50.530
x squared plus the square
root of 3 minus 2 times x--

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.780
just subtracting this
stuff from that side--

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:58.750
plus the square root
of 3 plus 1, right?

00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:59.860
Did I do that right?

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.270
Square root of 3, I subtracted
the x squared from that,

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.064
so square root of 3 minus
2, square root of 3 minus 2.

00:08:05.064 --> 00:08:06.480
And you have the
square root of 3.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.310
Subtracting a negative 1,
I get a plus 1 over here.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.310
And since I subtracted
all of this stuff

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.856
from both sides
of the equation--

00:08:12.856 --> 00:08:14.230
this is just the
left-hand side--

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.530
the right-hand side is now 0.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.680
I subtracted this from the
right-hand side to get 0.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.464
So now we have-- this almost
looks ridiculously simple.

00:08:22.464 --> 00:08:24.630
Even though I have these
ridiculous radicals and all

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:29.280
that, I have a straight-up
quadratic equation right here,

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.750
so I can use the
quadratic formula.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.400
So the roots here, so x is
going to be equal to negative b.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.740
This is b right here.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.640
So negative b, you
can swap those.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:47.092
So it's 2 minus the square root
of 3 plus or minus b squared.

00:08:47.092 --> 00:08:48.300
So let me just write it here.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:54.580
So the square root of 3 minus
2 squared minus 4 times a.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:59.350
So that's the square root
of 3 minus 2 times c.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.820
Well, c is the entire constant
term right over there.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:10.920
So it's times square root of
3 plus 1, all of that over 2a,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.650
so all of that over
this business over here.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.081
So that's 2 root 3 minus 4.

00:09:17.081 --> 00:09:18.830
So we thought we were
in the home stretch,

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.140
but now we have to do some
major radical simplification.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.990
So once again,
these test writers

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.740
are not pleasant people.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.520
So let's try our
best to tackle this.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.180
So let's go into-- let's
go inside the radical right

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.300
over here.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.840
Let's go inside of the
radical right over here.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.806
And you have the square
root of 3 minus 2.

00:09:41.806 --> 00:09:43.430
Actually, I'm going
to leave you there.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:44.950
I'm approaching 10
minutes, and frankly, I

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:45.870
need a drink of water.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.225
This problem is maybe the most
tiring problem I've ever done.

00:09:49.225 --> 00:09:50.100
I'll leave you there.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.690
We just have to simplify
this in the next video.
