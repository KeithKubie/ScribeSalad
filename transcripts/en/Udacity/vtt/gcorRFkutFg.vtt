Here's the answer. These are pretty easy functions.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We're returning every other one.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The states are the even-numbered positions, and the actions are the odd-numbers positions.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Starting at 0, going to the end, every other one.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Starting at 1, going to the end, every other one.
