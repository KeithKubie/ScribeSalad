00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.310
In the last video we took
essentially the length of y

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.620
equals x square, not the
length, but we went from zero

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.340
to 1 on the x-axis and you
can view it as this area.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.710
And we rotated around the
y-axis to get this figure here

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.470
and we figured out the volume,
I think our answer if I

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.330
remember was pi over 2.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.160
And we use what I called
and what everyone calls

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.470
the Shell method.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.090
I want to show you that
you could actually used

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.740
the disk method here.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.880
But then we'll just have
to switch the ys and xs.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.230
Instead of writing this the
function as a function of x,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.500
we'll just take the
inverse of it and write it

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.320
as a function of y.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.270
so this curve y equals x
squared, what it can also be

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.900
written as, we can just take
the squared root of both

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.620
sides as x is equal to
the square root of y.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.630
Just take the square
root of both sides.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.440
And now we can use this
information to do the disk

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.650
method, but everywhere where
we had an x in the past

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.500
we'll now have a y.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.560
So let's think about
how we would do it.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.240
Once again it's this area--
really the hardest thing about

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.110
all of these problems is
just the visualization.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.040
I think that's why they do it.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.230
Just to make sure that you know
how to visualize things and

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.560
maybe understand the calculus.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.490
It's more visualization
then calculus really.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.060
So we're still dealing with--
if we take a cross section, if

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.270
we were to cut this figure this
area would be the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.885
cross section.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.930
And we're still rotating around
the y-axis just like we

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:29.900
did in the last video.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.290
We're still rotation around the
y-axis, we get this figure.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.420
So how would we
deal with disks.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.266
Well a disk would look like
this at some point-- let

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.690
me pick another color.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.540
At some point we'd have
a disk like that.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.330
That would be the top of the
disk, and it would have some

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.520
depth like we did before.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.310
And its height, or the
radius of that disk,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.220
would be equal to x.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.230
It's equal to x.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.640
I know you're thinking it
looks like the shell method.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.980
But what is x equal to?

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.130
It's equal to the
square root of y.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.160
It equals the square root of y.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.810
And what would be the
width of that disk?

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.400
Now we are making everything as
a function of y, so the width

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.430
would be just a very small
distance d y, the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.420
differential y.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.500
That's essentially
all we need to know.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.870
So the volume of that disk
would be the radius squared

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.670
times pi times d y.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.070
Hopefully that makes a little
bit sense, but there's another

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.070
hitch on this problem.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.200
This is actually similar to
what we did two videos ago.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.750
Because when you view it in the
y-axis, from this y frame of

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.440
reference, what we're going to
do is we're going to take the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.660
volume, we take the volume
of x is equal to 1.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.190
So what would be the volume
of x is equal to 1 rotated

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.100
around the x-axis?

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.933
It would just be the
entire cylinder.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.410
It's really important
that you visualize this

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.780
right, what we're doing.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.400
We're going to figure
out this volume, volume

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.740
of x is equal to 1.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.990
Let me draw the axis just so
you know what we're doing.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.240
So this would be the y-axis,
that would be the x-axis

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.220
as best as I can draw.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.660
Originally, we can figure
out the volume of

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.240
the entire cylinder.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.740
This is x is equal to 1, x is
equal to 1 from what y points?

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.960
From the point,
well what is this?

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.760
This is y equals 1.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.930
y equal 1 to zero.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.230
So we would figure out this
volume from y equals 1 to zero.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.000
And how would we do that?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.750
What would be the integral?

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.390
Remember everything is in
y now, so it might seem

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.660
a little confusing.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.180
For each of these disks, this
is going to be made up of

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.860
a bunch of disks, let
me draw one of them.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.060
Let me draw the top one.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.170
The top disk, and it has a
width, it's not going to be

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.600
this entire cylinder, its
width is d y, its width

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.410
is just going to be this.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.560
d y, a very small sliver.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:32.160
d y, and its radius is x
or you could say f of y.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.040
What would be the
volume of that disk?

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.290
What would be the surface
area of the top?

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.350
It would be f of y squared.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.740
Remember we're dealing
everything with y. f of y

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.410
squared times pi, that
gives the area of the top.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.510
Put the pi outside of
the integral times d y.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.700
d y, and we said y is
going from zero to 1.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.800
y is going from zero to 1.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.130
So that's that entire cylinder.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.860
And what we'll want to do is
subtract out, essentially cut

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.010
out the volume of
the inner bowl.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.730
So minus.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.580
How would we figure
out the inner bowl?

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.410
That's where we will deal
with the x is equal to the

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.240
square root of y function.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.650
Because here, what's each disk?

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.830
Once again it's f of y.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.980
I wrote this generally, this
is f of y of the outside.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.890
I'm going to now do
it for the inside.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.980
I'm going to cut out the inside
volume and because I kept

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.160
it general I could do it.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.360
We're still going from
zero to 1, from y equals

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.640
zero to y equals 1.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.070
Remember we're
doing with y now.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:47.490
I will take f of the inside
f of y squared d of y.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.720
You can imagine in this case
the inside function, we're

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.850
going to take the volume.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.890
That original disk I drew is
actually one of the disks

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.260
for the inside function.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.640
Where the height of that disk
is d y, that should be d y.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.050
The radius of the
disk is f of y.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.260
And of course the area of
the top of the desk is pi

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.160
times the radius squared.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.840
How do we apply it to this
particular situation?

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.140
What is the outside function?

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.790
f of y, x is equal to f of y.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.370
We are just switching
the variables.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.840
We say that x is equal to 1.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.590
This is just a big
cylinder, right?

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.306
So f of i is equal go to 1 in
this function, so we get pi--

00:06:23.306 --> 00:06:28.420
let me switch colors--
times from zero to 1.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:35.530
1 squared d y minus pi,
and we're still going

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.170
from zero to 1.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.050
Remember, that's
the y boundaries.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.570
What's f of y?

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:51.540
Here f of y is square
root of y squared d y.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.440
Let's take the pi out.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.280
So pi times, well
1 squared is 1.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.060
What's the
anti-derivative of 1?

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.580
What function's
derivative is 1?

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.371
It's x, right?

00:07:11.371 --> 00:07:13.110
x, that's the
anti-derivative there.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.600
We can merge these.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.120
We took the pi out.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.210
This square root of y
squared, this is just y.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.880
Sorry, we have that
derivative 1.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.780
See, even I get quite
confused here.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.550
We're taking this with
respect to y, right?

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.200
The anti-derivative
of 1 now is y.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.930
We are setting up
a bunch of ys.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:32.960
I'm sorry.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.700
I find this even a little
perplexing when I start

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.580
switching x and y.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.980
The second function.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.540
Remember, we can merge these
because it's the same

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.520
boundaries and they're
both in respect to y.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.330
Square root of y squared is y.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.940
What's the anti-derivative of
y, the function y or y d y.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:57.320
Was y squared over 2,
minus y squared over 2.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.490
We are going to evaluate
that at 1 and zero.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.000
So what does that get us?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.680
We get pi-- we get 1 minus
1/2 minus zero minus zero

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.290
minus zero plus 0/2.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.600
Whatever these are zero.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.870
1 minus 1/2 that's
1/2 and times pi is

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.540
equal to pie over 2.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.930
Which is the exact same result.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.010
And I was worried, because you
never know when you might make

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.940
a careless mistake
as I often do.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.650
We got the exact same result as
I got in the previous video

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.850
when we used the shell method.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.050
The hardest thing here is just
remembering that you're doing

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.080
everything in terms of y.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.710
When we did the disk method
traditionally, the disks

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.050
were vertical disks.

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:45.930
Now they're horizontal disks
but it's the exact same thing.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.900
You just have to get your brain
around the idea that we're

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.780
dealing with the ys, that the
boundaries on the integrals

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.360
are now y values.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.630
We're taking the width of the
disks, or the height of the

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.890
disks are d y and the radius
is now the function of y.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.730
Hopefully I didn't
confuse you too much.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.890
My own brain malfunctioned
a bit when I took the

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.740
anti-derivative of 1 d y,
it should have been y.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.900
I will see you in the next
video where we will do even

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.290
more complicated problems,
where I'm sure I'll make

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:16.970
even more mistakes.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.710
See you soon.
