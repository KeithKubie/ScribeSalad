00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.700
this is Startalk so bill do you collect
stuff as a kid yeah would you collect

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.949
rocks and then in ninth grade we were
compelled to get an insect collection

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.650
yeah ah I can still give you order and
family of a lot of insects and you can

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.210
see evolution you know from your
Orthoptera to your hymen options for

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.300
example I would clearly clearly write
your locust to your four wing flies

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.750
gotcha and you can see it Chuck do you
ever collect anything I collect dung

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.079
beetles ah
do you really cuz it would be pretty

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.469
cool if you did that would be pretty
cool because quite frankly there is so

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.300
varied and the really depends on the
pond where they live when you speak of

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.660
dump you have to use in a British accent
oh yes it's much of fact I kill of dung

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.340
beetles there you go people don't know
but some Dominque you're going our metal

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:05.400
castle no I collect things as a kid I
didn't collect Jack not good no you know

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.400
what's funny I still okay I'm ashamed to
say what I collect right now but it's

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.970
hotel key cards don't ask me let's not
go into real that's where I collect

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.119
right now okay when I was older I
started clicking keys really you have a

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.409
key ring that has maybe 500 keys on it
okay yeah yeah well then I stopped I

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.890
said why the hell am I doing this and I
should stop it so one morning I wore my

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.082
door open every door you encounter it

00:01:25.082 --> 00:01:27.570
Neil: So Bill, Darwin was a big collector. He came

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.240
up with evolution by natural selection
could you give us like a three-minute

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.740
exposition of Darwin's theory of
evolution? Bill: the big idea is that living

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.800
things make more of themselves than can
survive. A troubling realization.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.260
But left to their own,
dandelions would take over the world.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.780
Left to their own... Neil: That's why there's so
many acorns on the ground under an

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.689
acorn tree. That's why there's
so many sperm right yes half a billion

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.040
last I counted yeah Wow that would take
you all afternoon

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.780
and so I estimated so that fundamental
idea damn it I lost count

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.060
start again daddy no go ahead well that
and you can't really tag them

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.260
it's probably where you stay there you
don't imagine I kept ticking but the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.400
Bill: But the thing is - species make more of themselves
than can survive so they compete for

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.360
places and ecosystems and then they
compete within their own species,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.239
that's sexual selection, and then here we all are.

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.110
Now, along this line, the conclusion that Darwin

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.530
reached and I think many naturalists
reach naturally is that we are all to

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.799
have a common ancestor. We're all
descended from the same thing,

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.150
whatever that thing is, and people throw
out the word single-celled organism

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.989
archaea with something like this, but
there's no evidence on Earth so far that

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.120
there's any other way to do it except
with DNA so the thing that is

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.680
fascinating is Charles Darwin wrote this
book where he has the theory and the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.780
experiments. He was quite a diligent
experimenter. In one volume, and he didn't

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.459
know about DNA! He didn't know about
genes, as such, genetics. He didn't know

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.260
what we think of as genes. Didn't know
chromosomes, really. He was just jamming, looking

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.690
at his collections and reaching amazing
conclusions. World-changing conclusions.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.540
Got to respect that! Chuck: Which have since
been confirmed via DNA.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.500
BIll: Oh man, every which way. Oh yeah.
Chuck: Chromosomes and genes and so forth.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.540
