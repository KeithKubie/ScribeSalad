Hey Mark!
Hey Mark!

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.240
&gt;&gt; What is it this time?

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.910
&gt;&gt; I've got my million dollar idea.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.855
Okay, you know what's
super hot right now?

00:00:07.855 --> 00:00:08.600
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.630
&gt;&gt; Match three games.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.110
So, I thought, what would be even
better then a match three game?

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.160
A match four game.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.090
I've got it all sorted out.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.050
I've got all of my matching
code in the main source set.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.399
And then I'm going to
add source sets for

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.350
each one of the extra games I'm going to
build with the matching engine right?

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.800
So I've got my source set for
my matching candies game.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.040
I've the got the source set for
my matching sushis game.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.230
I've got my source set for
my spider matching game.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but that's not really
what product flavors are for.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.050
They're for different versions
of what are really the same app.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.710
What you want to do is share
a code between different apps.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.180
So, you really want to
build a project library.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.620
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.800
You're a librarian and
you have to match four books.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.360
Perfect, Mark.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.969
You're a genius.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.390
&gt;&gt; Congratulations on learning how
to build apps with multiple flavors.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.520
That's just the start of how you
can make your apps bigger and

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.046
better while keeping them modular and
maintainable.

00:00:56.046 --> 00:00:59.680
In the next lesson we'll talk about
Java and Android library projects.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.180
See you there.
