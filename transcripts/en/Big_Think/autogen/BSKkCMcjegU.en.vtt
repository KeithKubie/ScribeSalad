me and even as a school you know when I

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
me and even as a school you know when I
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.290
me and even as a school you know when I
began to teach in the late 90s the

school itself actually had a computer

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780
school itself actually had a computer
 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.510
school itself actually had a computer
requirement you were required to take a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520
requirement you were required to take a
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.709
requirement you were required to take a
certain number of computer classes

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
certain number of computer classes
 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.139
certain number of computer classes
before you were allowed to graduate they

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149
before you were allowed to graduate they
 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.540
before you were allowed to graduate they
got rid of that requirement they got rid

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550
got rid of that requirement they got rid
 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.010
got rid of that requirement they got rid
of that requirement because at some

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020
of that requirement because at some
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.590
of that requirement because at some
point they felt like computer literacy

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600
point they felt like computer literacy
 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.510
point they felt like computer literacy
was so important that it ought to be

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520
was so important that it ought to be
 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000
was so important that it ought to be
integrated in all the other subjects so

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010
integrated in all the other subjects so
 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.439
integrated in all the other subjects so
it shouldn't be a thing in and of itself

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449
it shouldn't be a thing in and of itself
 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.450
it shouldn't be a thing in and of itself
so in the beginning I agreed with that

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
so in the beginning I agreed with that
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.630
so in the beginning I agreed with that
but after seeing how it played out I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
but after seeing how it played out I
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.719

don't think it was as effective as we

wanted it to be you know I think that

think when you when you teach kids
computer science you are touching on a

computer science you are touching on a

computer science you are touching on a
lot of principles of logic and and in

lot of principles of logic and and in

computer science there's this idea of
abstraction where you separate the
