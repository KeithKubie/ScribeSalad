00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One weakness of the encrypted key exchange is that passwords have to be stored.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
One possible improvement would be to encrypt using a hash of the password

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
instead of the password itself.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In the first step, the client sends some identifying information

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
along with the first part of the key exchange, but this time it's encrypted with the hash of p.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Likewise, in the second step, the server response is encrypted

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
with the hash of p instead of p.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We want to know does this work?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The options are, yes, it provides further protection against a dictionary attack.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Yes, but it doesn't provide much advantage since now an attacker who learns

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
the hash of p doesn't need to learn p.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
No, it prevents the client and server from establishing a shared key,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
since the server can't invert the hash.

00:00:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Or, no, it has a serious security vulnerability.
