00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.420
 My name is Tang Guango, founder and CEO of BabyBus 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.780
 Everyone calls me "Donald Duck" 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.620
 I hope that this happy title will bring happiness to the hearts of all children 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.880
 As a father 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.460
 I used to watch my children playing and having fun 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.320
 So I have to continue to find new ways to play 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.280
 Our team consists of young parents and educational experts 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.980
 Where we work together to try to reach the most educational application 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.140
 Convenience and enjoyment for each child within different age groups 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.220
 We hope that our bus (reference to part of the company name "bus") will have the same magical power 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.440
 Which roams the world and offers surprises and happiness to every child 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.440
 Just as Santa Claus does 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.320
 Now BabyBus's "magic" is much stronger 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.680
 Thanks to the strong support of the Google Play Store 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.720
 My name is Luis 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.100
 One of BabyBus's founding partners and application manager 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.640
 Currently, 80% of our international users use Android 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.640
 Starting in September 2015 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.240
 All of our apps have joined our "Family Applying Applications" 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.960
 So children and parents can easily find the app 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 According to their interests 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.860
 Our downloads have increased by 367% over last year 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.800
 Ice Cream &amp; Smoothies is our most popular app on Google Play 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.220
 It has been officially promoted on the Google Play homepage 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.860
 During that week, it received more than 1.36 million downloads 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.800
 The number of downloads of our other applications combined was more than 6.12 million times 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.460
 My name is Ling Ying, Product Manager at BabyBus 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.820
 We care a lot about our users around the world 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.260
 We have created 12 versions in different languages ​​for most of our applications 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.120
 Enabling them to meet the preferences of users at the local level 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120
 Thanks to the Google Apps translation service 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.380
 Users can read content in their native language 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.920
 The Admob network represents the basic way we use to invest applications 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.900
 Providing more than 90% of total income coming from overseas markets 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.280
 Collaboration with Google Play 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.560
 The main factor for our success in overseas markets 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.380
 We launched our first application on Google Play in 2012 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.640
 Now, we have 103 applications on the market simultaneously 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.940
 With total downloads exceeding 150 million times 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.380
 Thanks to Google Play support 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.380
 We believe that we will continue to deliver great educational products to children around the world
