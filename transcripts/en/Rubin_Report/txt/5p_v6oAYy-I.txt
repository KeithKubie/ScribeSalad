Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible] joining me today is the man that I have dubbed the Willy Wonka of politics. It even says so on the back of his book right here. Michael Malice. Welcome back to the Ruben report. Get to be back again. Dave, we have a lot to do, my friend. Uh, now most of it obviously is going to have to deal with your choice of wardrobe at general persona and being, you've really done it this time. If I read this jacket, pendant, this is the actually the same thing that Johnny Depp War, but it's a w for him and that's an m and now it's an m for Michael. Although if you flipped it upside down, it would be a w for William or Willy Wonka. There you go. Uh, that's actually the, the one that I didn't see that one. It's not that either one. What it is, it is the better one.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Yeah. So you're going to tell me the Charlie and the chocolate factory with Johnny Depp is better than Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory with gene wilder. And I'm not trying to be a contrarian and I'm trying to block it. If it's much better. I haven't seen it, but there's no way it's better. Well, it's pretty good. I'm telling you how could it possibly be better? You're telling me he was better. He was better than gene wilder. That's what you're telling me. I'm in a position to make this call, I suppose at some level because of the great honor that I've bestowed upon you by calling and either Willy Wonka go out, but I just, I mean, I just don't think anything could possibly be better than gene wilder as Willy Wonka. Watch it and tweet out the answer. This is a really disturbing start to this thing. Okay, so let's do this.

Speaker 1:          01:27          So first off, I'm going to do this interview completely in a different way than I've ever done before, which is that you may notice I have no notes here. Now my policy is that when it's a good interview, I don't have to look down once, but I thought, you're so bananas. Your political theories are so out there. I thought I'm just going to sit down and completely see what happens. I am literally not going to write down one thing beforehand. Uh, so the reason that I call you the Willy Wonka of politics, he's not just because of your, uh, high fashion style. Yeah. Uh, but you actually do strike me as a unique political thinker, which is pretty freaking rare these days. That's a huge compliment. Thank you. That's all I have for you. Okay. Good shot. Let's got to know. All right. So, but, but you really do.

Speaker 1:          02:15          And even the way you tweet, the way you use trolling, um, you know, you're, you're out there, political thoughts, all of those things. I mean, the way you present yourself, it's all like just this really bizarre package. So for people that didn't see our first interview, just give me Michael Malice one o one. Let's just get the history out of the way and then we'll, then we'll go into the new right. And the topics of the day, the Glib answer, he sees the ball. You hate to love. Uh, the longer answer is, my background is with North Korea was my last book with your reader. The New Right happen as a consequence of so many of my friends who were in to a trolls who are anarchists fell down these rabbit holes of what they were, what was called at the time and he and reaction and later became like the outright and dark enlightenment. So I watched the scene from build up from

Speaker 2:          03:00          the ground floor and then to have it culminate to some extent in the Trump presidency and contemporary cultural wars. I had a bird's eye view so I knew someone was going to have to write a book about the subculture. And I also knew that you know, any reporter is not going to be able to understand the scene cause at the very least they're going to be an outsider secondary, they're going to have their own prejudices. So since my job had been to make North Korea, you know, before I started, when North Korea work, the idea was they're crazy and crazy means I don't understand you. It does. It can mean, I don't understand your can mean that your random, but now everyone understands North Korea is not crazy. They have a very coherent logical approach to their evil dictatorship. And the same thing with this scene. Everyone would like to dismiss it.

Speaker 2:          03:39          Jump ever. Just loved everybody in. They're all nuts. They're all Nazis. And it'd be really convenient if you could paint everyone with the same brush. They'd be a lot less efficacious. A, it'll be a lot easier to dismiss. But that's not the way it is. And people understand that any subculture, even the, you know for the Republicans, they think, oh the less the same, the Hillary Clinton hate the Bernie people, they really hate them. So there's a lot of different groups in what I call the new right. And often though they're United in what they regard as their oppositions possess for progressivism between them, they do not have much agreement.

Speaker 1:          04:10          Okay. So with that as the backdrop to all of this, and this also explains why when buzzfeed and Huff Po and vox and the rest of them are writing about you guys, whatever that collective things here, they always get it all sort of wrong because as you said, they're not part of it. So they just look at the, Oh, they must be racist.

Speaker 2:          04:30          Well, they also have an agenda. Yeah. So racist means that which is against progressivism. And I have a list in the books of things that have been called racist, which includes moving into minority neighborhoods and moving out am I never did in our neighborhoods. Noticing races and not noticing races. Milk a certain time of dinosaurs. I mean picnics. Wait, what type of dinosaurs? Racist. Uh, there was the, in Jurassic Park, one of the dinosaurs was called racist. Uh, I'm not sure exactly why I didn't follow up meeting through the article. Yeah. So I dunno. Um, and possibly a, um, um, what's that? What's his name? Fred Flintstones. Pet. Oh, Dino. Yeah, he's a bit of a white supremacist. Just, just [inaudible]. It's unfortunate. Um, so I thought someone has to write this book. And also it's a dark space. So I wanted to have people be able to explore it in an interesting way and in a nonthreatening way.

Speaker 1:          05:19          Okay. So for people that know nothing about this and the couple groups that you just mentioned, they are dark and light and mint, the troll community, all of this stuff. Can you just kind of break down all of it? How did this start? How did you even start caring about it? Were you part of it? What the Hell is going on? I was on, cause even for me, and I have some basic understanding of this stuff, I'm actually not totally clear on all the sort of markers and where everybody is online and all that.

Speaker 2:          05:46          So it starts, I grounded in, uh, 1992 when Pat Buchanan who is regarded as a paleo conservative, we teamed up with Marie Rothbart who was regarded as a Paleo Libertarian. So between those two men, you basically have everything that is happening today within this scene. Meaning nationalism, a trolling, flirting with racism, um, you know, contempt for authority, skepticism toward the establishment. The two of them had many disagreements and at what point, you know, Pat Buchanan and turned on Murray Rothbard and later he asked Murray Rothbard's, um, executor for forgiveness, literally, um, getting on his knees and asked me for forgiveness. I broke that news in the book. And that has come down to contemporary terms where the Internet with social media allows, and this is both a positive and a negative, is back in the day, if you were that one person in your town with these rude fringe views, you're the freak.

Speaker 2:          06:36          But now that one person with their weird fringe views in that town can talk to the other person with the rouge printer using the other town or in Denmark or in Asia, or can put on a purple jacket and show up at the Rubin report. It's all very busy. They can't pull it off. Um, uh, you have to earn this jacket. So, but now they have a community and discussion and they can develop an ideology. So what I saw happening as a result of hanging out with the trolls is people falling into this group called what was called at the time near reaction or the dark enlightenment. And it was things like we need to return to monarchy. Uh, America is this decadent Weimer Republic that's on the verge of destruction and where was this happening on the Internet? So I'll need to know. I know, but like where, what do you mean w forums chat exactly for him through all these blogs.

Speaker 2:          07:22          You know, it's very HP Lovecraft things you're not supposed to know. It's especially, it was, it was blogs, uh, not really Twitter at the time and Facebook groups. Those are the big ones back then. So this would have been about like 2013, 2012. Okay. So now some of this stuff starts bubbling up, right? And you start seeing these communities that sort of don't really align but have some weird touchpoints. And what do you make of those touch and, well, what I knew from my, you know, I'm a big pop culture person obviously, and I knew how culture develops, which is it starts at the fringe with the Weirdos and then the edgy people, the cool people like, hey, have you heard about this thing? Then it becomes more mainstream and then like kind of the nerds get it. Then the corporations appropriated and kind of tone it down, right?

Speaker 2:          08:10          So all of the intellectual momentum I saw on the right was a result of this stuff. These are the people talking ideas, both nefariously and positively. These are the ones asking the big questions and basically the radical questions. And one of the big differences between conservatives than you, right is this conservatives take what is given and this isn't a slight against conservatives and regarded as all right, basically what we have, how do we fix it? Then you write often has a more radical approach. Meaning just because something exists doesn't mean it can't be destroyed completely and started from scratch. So these are two different approaches and we see it regarding the press. I got into an argument with Sean Davis who writes for the federalists. And his whole point is that, you know, the media, they're all there. They're all dumb. And my point is none of these people are very, very bright. And if they're all making the same mistake in the same exact way, that is not a function as to petty stupid people are all going to agree this is a function of something more nefarious. So that, so it's not a bug, it's a feature. Correct. Because they're, they do have a certain specific agenda and everyone has a certain specific agenda. So this is a big separation between conserves and you're right, is this a, uh, you know, part of society salvageable or is it inherently, uh, impure and, and beyond redemption?

Speaker 1:          09:19          So when Trump was being elected ahead, Eric Weinstein sitting in that seat, and what I said to him was, what most people seem to want is a panther in a China shop. We know something's wrong with the system, but we don't want to blow up the system. We want a panther to walk in there and knock something off with its tail. And Bang one thing off with the Ted, but then closed the door behind it and we'll, you know, a couple things we'll have broken, but we'll be okay. But there's no such metaphor as a, a panther to try and copy. It's a bull in a China shop, but you just can't get it. I sense that a lot of what you're talking about is these people want the bull

Speaker 2:          09:51          in the chain. No, these people want a bomb in a touch on the shop. They want the China shop to be destroyed. And the phrase China shop is pretty apps here because it's talking about foreign influence in America and that's China's not their big villain specifically. But basically the idea like this store needs to be torn down. We're not breaking some dishes this we're way past the point of breaking stuff,

Speaker 1:          10:12          but they want to blow up the whole store to [inaudible]. It's not just about breaking the China that's in the store. They actually want the entire structure and to change

Speaker 2:          10:20          and salted the earth. Yeah. To make sure nothing can be built there again.

Speaker 1:          10:24          But so, so where, where do you fall on that? Because I sense there is this weird thing of there's this weird thing on both the left and the right, the left seems to really want to destroy the whole thing too in a weird way. But then you're, you're talking about people on the new right that want to destroy the whole thing. They wanted to destroy it for different reasons. But what do you think the left wants to destroy? The left wants to destroy capitalism and they want to destroy the basic way our democracy has functioned and things like that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          10:48          Uh, I don't, I don't know that they want to destroy capitalists. And what should they think of it as something that can milk and harness? Um, Bernie, even Bernie, you know, has said, you know, vaguely positive things to say about capitalism, but, and I don't know that they would ever admit.

Speaker 1:          11:01          Well, I think it's a slow, it's a slow slope to get there. You don't just come out with day one and say you want to destroy capitalism. You just keep right. But undermining it over election after.

Speaker 2:          11:09          I agree with you, but what I'm saying is then you write is saying, yes, we want to destroy this chapter for this book is called the case against democracy. So in the scene there is a huge question of how is it that democracy is inherently good, let alone inherently legitimate. So lay out a case. Sure. So the base, the, you know, people say that communism works in theory, not in practice, right? Well that doesn't mean anything because everything works in theory. You know, theory means he practices how you figure out something actually works. Democracy is one of the few things that doesn't even work in theory. And here's why. If you have with, they talk about voter turnout being a good thing, well at what point does it become legitimate? If 70% of people vote, they can speak for the 30% who don't vote. What if it's 40% vote in 60%?

Speaker 2:          11:52          Don't at what point it that you can say, this group of the population can dominate this other group, uh, who haven't voted. That's one example. But even more technical terms, the purest, I use an example from this book called the Machiavellians, the purest, uh, exemplar of democracies. The town hall, you have a bunch of people, everyone's there to kind of speak their mind, put their point of view across. Even in the town hall, you're going to have to have limits on time. You're gonna have an agenda, what issues we're going to discuss. So even in the most democratic system a moment, you're going to have an elite setting the rules and boundaries. So one of the ideas behind the new right is this theory of this old school theory a hundred years ago called the circulation. The elites, meaning Hillary Clinton will always have more in common with George W. Bush, then she will have with the janitor, and you can't get rid of an elite. So much is replace it with another elite

Speaker 1:          12:40          [inaudible]. So this is a little bit of the way game of Thrones ended, sort of.

Speaker 2:          12:44          I, I, I'm not, I'm not

Speaker 1:          12:46          right. Okay. Okay. There's a funny moment at the end where they're trying to figure out how to rule and in the future, and one of the guys says, well, what about democracy? Let the people vote. And then there's a moment where you're like, oh, where are they going to end with democracy? And then everyone laughs. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          12:57          Well isn't there was another new right moment early on because didn't some person hold up like a PCP, a piece of paper that says you promised them they basically ripped in left. Right? So this idea that the constitution is somehow going to start working and save us is another thing that they're very skeptical of.

Speaker 1:          13:10          So what, what are you politically, if you had to give yourself

Speaker 2:          13:14          I am label. Sure. I'm an anarchist or that adjectives.

Speaker 1:          13:18          An anarchist without adjective. Yes, sir. Explain the adjective part of me.

Speaker 2:          13:24          There's different schools of anarchism. Yeah. Um, and I am more, uh, there's an arco capitalism this and [inaudible] and Arco. Communism. I like it all. My point is essentially is that government is not legitimate. It cannot be made legitimate. And you have to start with that recognition. Now, some people think, okay, if you take away government, everyone's going to be equal. You're going to have wage equality. Some people think, okay, it's going to be hyper capitalistic. Sure. I'm a lot more comfortable defending anarchy than I am defending capitalism or communism or cynical. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          13:52          Awesome. So I think most people here anarchist and they just think, well I mean I say this all the time, it's just you want to end up in Mad Max. You just want sort of warring factions, constantly trying to take each other out and that there is no sort of social cohesion. There's no way to build big projects and things like that because we don't have something that sort of bringing us all together that the government kind of sucky. I mean a lot of people think this is kind of Sucky, but it's the best we got.

Speaker 2:          14:21          It's the best criticism [inaudible] are actually descriptions of the status quo. Meaning what you're describing is the status quo. You have governments who are trying to take each other out. China has, you know, hacked our systems. Russia, you know, is interfering in our election. So other right now nations have a state of anarchy with regard to each other to some extent. Um, what Anik is and would do it provide more security because you wouldn't have to have a government monopoly. Uh, the idea that you need the government to kind of build a big project is really not necessarily true. Uh, and if anything the government is probably the biggest hindrance towards people working together because they have to run things through some bureaucrat who has no accountability.

Speaker 1:          14:59          Okay. But wait, want, I want to back up before we go to down that road. So just break down in a couple of these other groups that were sort of in this trolling community. And can you just explain like free for someone of a certain age that really doesn't even under, that's not on Twitter and then not on four Chan or wherever the hell is going on or discord. Sure. Like what is actually going on with the trolls? Like what is the goal of the,

Speaker 2:          15:20          the older people actually know trolling quite well. Cause the example I use in the book, the first trial was Andy Kaufman. So Andy Kaufman, right? He was the great troll of all gray trial of all time. He was on taxi as Laca, which is not what he's proud of stuff. And he would do things like, he had this character called Tony Clifton, who was basically, it's like old lounge singer and a pink salmon blazer. And he'd come down and sing terribly and just be rate the audience. And, and one most trolling moment is he had this, he was performing, I think in Atlantic city. And he says, oh, well, you know, my wife died a few years ago. And when I look at my daughter's eyes, I see my wife come on out here, honey. And she sits on his lap and they sing and her voice cracks any slaps her across the face.

Speaker 2:          15:59          And it goes with all you're doing, or I'm part of the audience is booing. And he goes, oh, don't go. You're just making her cry more. Well, not only was in his daughter, it wasn't even a child who is an actress. So trolling correctly is forcing a party, exploiting a party's weaknesses in order to turn them into an unwitting performer. So other examples of this, there was a little kid, it's a little autistic kid, was on the late show in the UK or Ireland and they asked him, Hey, what do you want to do Huey Huey, what do you want to do when you grow up? And he goes, um, I want to fly planes into buildings. And the guy goes, what? He goes, I want to fly planes, the skyscrapers. And he's like, okay, if you can't do that, what would you want to do?

Speaker 2:          16:34          I'll move to Iraq and be a terrorist. Now it's this little 10 year old boy and the host now doesn't know what to do. I think he's put on the spot that is trolling. Now trolling is often used on the internet to be like being a jerk. That's not, to me a definition of trolling. There's plenty of words for that and just go into the cell and saying, you know, you're this or you're that. That's not clever. Trolling is an art. So troll. Okay, so how is it the Trump understood this? Do you think that's because this is where people say, well, he's just an idiot. He just says whatever.

Speaker 1:          17:03          Free lunch. There's no filter that Tara, Tara, and it's like, if that really is the truth, if that really is the truth, then everyone else must be hyper idiots. You know what I mean? I just

Speaker 2:          17:13          can't accept plausible truth, which perhaps, let me give a great example of Trump trolling. Okay. Again, trolling, meaning you're forcing someone to become a performer by exploiting their weaknesses, which it seems like now all the media has become all with his enemies have become the, he'd get them to take any position on any, here's the perfect example. Yeah. For one year he's yelling at Elizabeth Warren, take a DNA test, take a DNA test, take a DNA test. She takes it in secret, doesn't even test for native American blood. It says she's at most 100024th she releases it and she goes, Huh, Mr President? I took the test and you know what? He goes, who cares? Yeah. So now she's made a fool of, he is not at all engaging with her and she's left. You can even hear the curb, your enthusiasm, music playing as she talks, and this moment has become a broken woman as a consequence of his clouding her so thoroughly.

Speaker 2:          18:00          What is it about him that you think made him understand this? How did this guy understand this psychological trick or whatever you want to scenarios, right? Scott Adams, who I know you've had on risk, describes the Lucky Hitler phenomenon, right? That somehow it's just he always manages to say that what he needs to to upset people. The other scenario is like there's some kind of rain man thing going on that he just sees people's weaknesses. He knows exactly what to say and despite him themselves, they lose their minds. Another example of this was I think it was pixelated, both. There's some Twitter account and they made this fakes a screenshot from Michael Wolfe's book fire and fury about how Trump watches TV all the time. And the staff at the White House made something called the guerrilla channel. And he talks to the gorillas on TV and he says, oh, that goodwill is good.

Speaker 2:          18:44          And people are, and it was clearly a joke. It was meant to be a joke. People repeated this like, oh my gosh, Trump is so dumb. He talks to television like, wait a minute, you can think he's as dumb as you want. You're telling me this man who is 70 who's had a TV show, doesn't understand that you can't talk to gorillas on a screen. But that is the level that he's driven them to. So it's hilarious to watch. And it's beautiful from the [inaudible] perspective because he's diligent organizing the political process and the presidency. So the reverence that people have for the presidency has deadly consequences because it allows them to get away with things like war. And if you think the guy in the Oval Office is a clown and that clown is getting ready to send your kids overseas to possibly die or possibly kill people, you're going to be a lot more skeptical.

Speaker 2:          19:28          God, there's a lock there. So you think it's the whole book worth. If only if only someone would write a book about this sort of thing. There's a lot there. So you think in an odd way, his behavior is delegitimizing the presidency, let's say the office of the presidency or more broadly government in general. And you ultimately view that as a good thing because you don't think that really has legitimate power to begin with. Right. One of the big views of the Murray Rothbard school is that the two political parties are literally rival gangs. And just like a gangster has the nice rings and the suits, they wear their suits, they go to the Senate. But these are at base murderers who are plotting, you know, fighting with each other. But it's in fighting. Um, so anytime the mask is dropped and you realize these people aren't stealing your money, they're trying to control your lives, they're causing massive, you know, harm around the world often.

Speaker 2:          20:19          Uh, that's a good thing. What's the ratio element that comes out of all of this? It's because for as much as I get a lot of this and I like a lot of the trolling, the good natured stuff that's really getting the, the people that I don't like to flip their lids. Like I love all that stuff. And then there's this other piece of it that, that strikes me as it's hard to tell it or they just intentionally inflammatory. Do they really believe this? What kind of power do these people have? Are they coordinating all of that? Yes. Jared Taylor is the head race realist, right? These are the people who you racism as the most important issue, the outright, and I interviewed him for the, for the book. I went to his house and you know, even he was confused and there's this great moment, he's got this very weird accent. He goes, are you telling me these people really believe this Hitler stuff? Like he couldn't wrap it and I go, yeah. And he goes, the idea in this day and age that Hitlerism would be a model for America is simply fantastic. And I go, you mean crazy, right? He goes, Oh yes, thank you for the clarification. So even in that group though, they're the racists, but he is your approach. You then you have the people who are full blown. Yes.

Speaker 1:          21:27          Well what does that mean? So there are the racist meaning there are just people who just full blown racism. They just actually racist. They want people based on the color is going to have different laws or not be in this country. You are

Speaker 2:          21:38          correct. And they say if you're not, if you don't see that as the most important issue, you're blind. So I, you know, had to engage with that, writing this book. Then they're the ones who are, everything's about the Jews, the Jews, the Jews, you, I was, I was in Charlottesville. I saw everything happening. I couldn't go to all the events because my contact was told don't bring the Jew to the party. I was not wearing the blazer. Uh, but uh, so there is this whole subculture and they disagree with themselves and it was important for me to engage with them and express what their point of view is and show how they're wrong. Because what happens is when you drive people to the margin, it's like telling an, especially when deal with young males, it's like when you tell kids if you smoke the principal, your parents and everyone's going to get upset and then you can't get a pall mall fast enough.

Speaker 2:          22:28          So that the same thing here, it's like if you talk to these people and say certain things people you hate are gonna get upset, it's like, sign me up. So the point I make in this book is you take one red pill, not the whole bottle. Because once they realized that the corporate press is often dishonest and has an agenda, they fall down this rabbit hole. And unless someone grabs him by the collar and said, yeah, you don't have to go all the way, uh, we, we can stop right here. Uh, there are often lost.

Speaker 1:          22:53          So this is, you would argue then the reason why sensoring these people in suspending people on Twitter and booting people off Facebook and the rest of it is actually the worst possible thing that you could do. I don't know if you become, you just feeding it,

Speaker 2:          23:05          I don't know if it's the worst, but if they're going to say there is an elite agenda designed to drive us underground and keep the truth from coming out, now they have evidence. Look, we're being blocked. They don't want to hear the truth. So that is a, and the fact that David Duke, for example, is still on Twitter, is very curious to me. And again, with the Internet and technology.

Speaker 1:          23:27          So, wait, what do you think that's about then?

Speaker 2:          23:28          Well, I think David Duke is a very useful foil for the left, uh, because when he endorses people at Keith Ellison or Johana Mar, it's crickets, right? But when he says something positive about somebody else, like, oh my God, David do about Trump. Yeah. I don't think he likes Trump too much cause Trump all Trump the kids married except for one marriage Jews. So, you know, I, I it's, it's uh, he's not that fond of the president. Uh, everything's about Israel. David Duke. Um, and I told him once on Twitter. So that was a fun moment. You took out the Duke, like I don't know if I, I know I did. He's still there and that's the problem. Like why is David Duke there while people like Laura Loomer art? I think that is very odd, uh, um, a situation.

Speaker 1:          24:04          And you would say that really is just because of the power dynamic within Twitter or, or within something bigger than,

Speaker 2:          24:10          I can't speak to why I'm not in the side. Jack's mind Jack Dorsey's mind. Yeah. I do think there's something here that's not adding up and I think the more transparency the better. Uh, and I think Jack and some level would agree with that. Yeah. What's your position on what to do with the tech companies at this point? Related to all of this in the censorship and everything. I think the solution is going to be just like back in the day we had cupid and now you have Tinder and and, and all these other sites and they separate out. You're going, there's no reason everyone has to be in one site. So the more, if Twitter wants to say we're a site for progressive ideas, they have that right? And, and that's perfectly fine. They're going to lose a huge market share because when you drive out fringe ideas, whether evil, fringe, you're also going to be driving out the good fringe idea. That's where innovation happens. So if you're going to have this bourgeois middle of the road, I don't want weirdness, uh, you're going to lose the interesting people also. So this is a very big double edged.

Speaker 1:          25:07          So then why hasn't this problem been fixed? There's enough people frustrated with it all over the political map. Good old classical liberals are just as frustrated as perhaps more nefarious characters and nobody has solved

Speaker 2:          25:18          this. But your frustration might be a feature because they say, look, we're obviously doing things right. We've got Dave Ruben upset. So if there, uh, if we live in a culture that's heavily dominated by the progressive ideology, so for them, if they are getting certain people upset, they can say, hey, we're doing our job. Right. The euphemism they currently use as the quality of the conversation. Right. So yeah, I mean this is the most Orwellian thing ever. Like you are going to be judging quality. So it's, it's, it's a very, it's very, and which is a very different thing from free speech, which is messy and ugly and, and, and you know, often reprehensible. [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          25:51          How do you think that the new right then is supposed to, I know you don't like boundaries and you don't like gate keeping in any of those things, but how do you think it anything,

Speaker 2:          26:01          I like gates. I'm a, I'm, I'm not an inclusionist person. I'm very much for freedom of association. If I didn't want to talk to someone, I'm not I black people liberally,

Speaker 1:          26:09          but how, but all right, so, but you know, in a wider group outside of just what's happening in your mind and your interactions with people, how do you think that this new sort of group of people that are all over the map politically, right? Um, how do they, how do they keep the fringe people, the truly bad people out of the way? This seems to be the biggest

Speaker 2:          26:29          yes. That nobody's solving. Uh, the Pr, I don't think you can because technology has made, it used to be you had three networks, right? ABC, NBC, CBS, and between the three of them, you get the news. Then drudge came along. I talking about in the book and the networks, like he's a lot legitimate. He's not legitimate. He's not legitimate. He breaks one of the biggest stories of all Todd Monica Lewinsky. They didn't know what to do. He still, he's not legitimate and illegitimate is like, he broke news. Who are you to say he's now Jim. And so this, this orthodox idea of legitimacy has no inherent meaning other than tribalism, right? So once you have technology and thanks to Twitter, Facebook, whatever, everyone has their own Mike and there are more and more mikes being built every day. I don't see how you're going to be able to put that genie back in the bottle so you just have to let it be.

Speaker 2:          27:12          Then you'd say there's just no option. It's just is correct and you have to engage with bad ideas if you want to diffuse them because you're not thanks to technology, you're not going to be able to censor anyone. Let me give you another example. I have this in the book. Let's suppose this is like 1990 right? And you're having an argument censoring books and one guy's like, we need to censor books like mine. Calm has bad consequences. Someone else like, no, you need to hear free speech. I come from 2019 teleport back in time and I say, look, someday you're going to be able to copy a book infinitely at no cost. You press one button, you send it anywhere on earth at the speed of light for free. I would sound like a lunatic, but that is the status quo. Oh, and also you could you say a magic word?

Speaker 2:          27:54          No, but orange and read it a password. Oh, okay. Crazy person. That's the status quo. And technology is only going to increase more and more and more to empower the individual at the expense of big conglomerates. It becomes cheaper and cheaper to make your voice heard. Back in the day. You'd have to be like, if you don't like it, make your own network. Well you did. Yeah. Now, now it's going to be, I mean, we're still using their pipes. I'm still dependent on, at least for the moment on, correct. There's tech, there's a great book called the goal and the point of this book is what's the goal there? Was to go for business and he says to make money. So how you do this is you look at the pipeline from conception to production and you look at what's slowing up your profits. So maybe you don't have enough shipping boxes, maybe you're not producing enough bottles, maybe you have too much inventory.

Speaker 2:          28:36          So you gotta have more marketing. Maybe youtube is not sending your videos out to your subscribers, right? So you look at what the issue is, the bottleneck, you fix that. Once that's fixed, there's gonna be another worst thing and you fix that. So Twitter in many ways is a rear guard movement right now because people are realizing it's paypal and it's the banks that, and it's the fact that there's domain registrars, those are the next three that people are going to build alternatives to. Cause that's where the banks are shutting down accounts right now. And that's what's being underreported. So Twitter is kind of a little bit of a distraction because you'll always be able to make some rival to Twitter, banking and paypal. That's what's something people have to look at now. And do you think the right people are looking at it, uh, I think in your world or are people looking at it? I don't think this is an ideological thing. I think it's just some entrepreneur who sees a market opportunity to be like, paypal is being arbitrary and I can compete with them on some level. All it takes is that one guy and then the battle was won and then it's going to be another battle. It's a, as some situation.
