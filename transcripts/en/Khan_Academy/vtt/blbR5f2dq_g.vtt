00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.420
In the last video, we began to
explore the IS curve, which,

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.970
as I think I mentioned,
stands for investment savings.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.210
And we really analyzed
it from the point

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.850
of view of investment.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.420
We thought of it as
real interest rates

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.110
driving the level of investment,
which drives the equilibrium

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.750
level of real output.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.910
High real interest
rates, low level

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.940
of investment, low
level of investment

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.870
leads to low equilibrium output.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.670
So this scenario is closer
to that right over there.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.850
If real interest
rates are lower,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.450
then that leads to higher levels
of planned investment, which

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.050
leads to a higher level
of equilibrium output.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.640
So that right over there.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.914
So that was more from the
investment point of view.

00:00:43.914 --> 00:00:45.330
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.230
explore the exact
same relationship,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.180
the exact same curve,
but think of it

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.124
more from the savings
point of view.

00:00:51.124 --> 00:00:52.540
And in this
situation, we're going

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.290
to have this exact
same thing, but instead

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.550
of viewing real interest
rates as driving GDP,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.890
we're actually going to view GDP
as driving real interest rate.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.110
So let me leave this up here.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.270
But let's just break down
the expenditure model of GDP.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.269
So we know that aggregate
income, or aggregate GDP,

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:13.560
or aggregate output-- however
you want to think of it--

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.660
is equal to, and you
could break it up

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.840
into its component
expenditures, it's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.030
equal to aggregate
consumer spending, which

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.600
is a function of
disposable income.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.820
y minus t is disposable income,
aggregate income minus taxes,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.845
plus investment plus
government expenditures.

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:36.420
And I could do net exports.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.490
But for simplicity
for this discussion

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.670
we'll just assume we
are in a closed economy.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.210
It makes good
conceptualizing saving

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.350
and investment a
little bit easier.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.820
Now what I want to do
is solve for investment.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.400
So if I solve for
investment I'm just

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.470
going to subtract this
piece and this piece

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.310
from both sides
of this equation.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.890
And I get aggregate income
minus total aggregate consumer

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.764
spending minus total
government spending

00:02:06.764 --> 00:02:08.639
is equal to-- on the
right hand side I'm just

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:14.350
going to be left with, with
investment right over here.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.250
And this thing right
over here is interesting

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.320
because this is total
income minus what--

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.750
and let me make sure that we,
I don't want to confuse you.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.060
Because that looks
like a lowercase c.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.550
And if we're talking about
aggregate consumption

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.170
it's usually an uppercase C.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.710
So on the left hand side, we
have total aggregate income

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.390
minus consumer spending
minus government spending.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.480
So you could really view this
as, this right over here,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.230
really is aggregate savings.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.880
This over here
really is savings.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.050
And as we see when on
one side of the economy,

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.580
when people are saving, that
goes into banks and it gets

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.900
lent out.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.200
And then it gets reinvested.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.150
Or you could save
directly by reinvesting.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.716
And so what we have here is
savings is equal to investment.

00:02:57.716 --> 00:02:59.340
And that's why it's
called an IS curve,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.380
because when you look at
the expenditure model,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.086
savings and investment
are really the same thing.

00:03:04.086 --> 00:03:05.460
They're really
just saying, look,

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.960
there's two ways
to view this curve.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.080
It's investment driven
or its savings driven.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.480
And when you think
of it this way

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.445
you have a slightly
different view of this curve.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.320
Because when you view
it from a savings point

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.320
you say, well, what's going
to happen if GDP goes up?

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.320
What happens if we have
a high GDP over here?

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.090
So if we have a
high GDP, or let's

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.000
say in particular
if GDP goes up,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.140
the consumer spending,
which is a function of GDP,

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.970
it will go up.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.950
But it won't go up as much.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.030
It's going to go up by
this expression right

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.350
here times, if we
assume a linear model,

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.390
times the marginal propensity to
consume, which is less than 1,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.920
it's between 0 and 1.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.347
So this is going to
go up less than that.

00:03:48.347 --> 00:03:50.180
And then we can, for
the sake of this model,

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.120
we'll assume right
now that happens

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.670
without any change in
government expenditure.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.260
So if total aggregate
income goes up

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.430
then savings are going
to go up, if we assume

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.620
government expenditures
holds constant.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.530
So then we have savings goes up.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.630
And if savings
goes up, that means

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.310
we have more loanable funds.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.040
There's more money to lend.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.550
And if there's
more money to lend,

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.350
what's going to happen
to interest rates?

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.190
Well interest rates
are just the price

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.547
of borrowing money,
the price of money.

00:04:22.547 --> 00:04:24.880
So if you have more of something
the price of that thing

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.240
goes down.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.587
So if savings goes up then
real interest rates go down.

00:04:31.587 --> 00:04:33.170
So if you have a
high GDP you're going

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.220
to end up with low
real interest rates.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.690
So once again, is looking at
it from a point of view of GDP

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.250
driving interest rates.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.400
We have high savings here.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.150
So we're going to have
low interest rates.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.980
And you view it the
other way around.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.260
If you have a lower
income this thing

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.440
is going to also decrease.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.900
But is not going to decrease
as much as this did,

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.620
because of the
marginal propensity

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.280
to consume is less than
1, we saw that up here.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.600
We saw that all the way
over here, right over there.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.140
And so in aggregate, the
savings are going to go down.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.850
Once again, we hold
government spending constant.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.250
So in this situation,
savings are going to go down.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.120
And if you have
fewer loanable funds,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.180
there's less
savings to lend out.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.271
Then if you have less of
a supply of something,

00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:19.770
what's going to
happen to its price?

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.060
It's price is going to go up.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.970
The price of borrowing
money is the interest rate.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.360
So in this situation
interest rates would go up.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.040
So that's going in this
direction, right over here.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.740
If aggregate income goes
down, loanable funds go down,

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.020
interest rates are
going to be higher.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.120
So once again, the same
exact curve, IS curve.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.900
But there's two takeaways here.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.616
One is to realize
why it's called IS,

00:05:43.616 --> 00:05:45.490
that investment and
savings, when you view it

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.710
from this point of view,
really are the same thing.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.607
One person's savings can be
another person's investment.

00:05:51.607 --> 00:05:53.940
And when we viewed it from
the investment point of view,

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.565
we were viewing r as driving y.

00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:58.440
Now we're looking at it
the other way around.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.870
y is driving savings,
which is driving r.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.072
But it gives us the exact same
relationship for this model.
