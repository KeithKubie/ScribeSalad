- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.010
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.530

Destitute Widows, and the
Remaking of American Law.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.710
Professor Witt, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.703
- Thank you, it's so nice to be here.

00:01:45.703 --> 00:01:47.580
- [Harry] Where were you born and raised?

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.054
- Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

00:01:49.054 --> 00:01:51.530
- And looking back

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.280
how did your parents shape
your thinking about the world?

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.520
- Well, that's pretty powerfully,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.850
I mean I might have tried
to avoid it, but inevitably,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.370
my father was a history graduate student

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.270
before he got drafted in the Vietnam War.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.640
He became a lawyer after serving

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.280
as a conscientious objector.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.800
And so in some ways, I'm
a lawyer, I'm a historian,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.850
I'm kind of following in his footsteps.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.520
My mother's influence is so pervasive,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.353
I can't even identify.

00:02:18.353 --> 00:02:20.400
- Mm hmm, but I tell
us something, I mean--

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.290
- So my mother is a, my
mother is a community maker.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.780
She makes community in and
around the neighborhood

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.280
called Germantown in Philadelphia

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.818
which is a fabulously
interesting neighborhood.

00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:32.830
And was a great place to grow up,

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.730
the greatest place I could've grown up.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.407
- And was there much discussion of the law

00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:40.400
and history around the dinner table?

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.850
- Oh yeah, to grow up in Philadelphia is

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.060
to be surrounded by history.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.330
So I think there was a photograph of me

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.330
in the Philadelphia Bulletin,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.970
a newspaper before, now-closed,

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.600
which on July 4th's 1976,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.520
on the Bicentennial was a big deal.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.460
And there's a picture of me,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.040
I think on my father's shoulders

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.490
wearing a red, white, and blue hat.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.350
And being part of the
celebration of the Bicentennial,

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.070
and to be surrounded by the Liberty Bell,

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.345
and Independence Hall, and
Betsy Ross, and the flag

00:03:10.345 --> 00:03:12.841
was an inspiration to do
history from the beginning.

00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:14.860
- Where were you educated?

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.460
- Quaker school, Germantown Friends School

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.393
here in Philadelphia right in
the neighborhood Germantown.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.710
And then I went to Yale College,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.250
and ended up at Yale for a while.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.350
I got a graduate degree, PhD in history

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.000
and a law degree there as well.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.240
- When you went to Yale
as an undergraduate,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.130
were you already committed
to the law and history?

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.490
Was it something that you
knew you wanted to do?

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.950
- You know, not when I not when I arrived,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.783
not when I arrived.

00:03:38.783 --> 00:03:42.120
I spent a lot of time thinking
I would be an economist.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.880
But then maybe the gravitational pull

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.920
of the influence of parents,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.940
for whatever reason I ended
up majoring in history.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.560
And then at the end of
college, tried to choose

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.970
between history graduate
school, and law school.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.390
And then decided I couldn't
choose between them,

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.397
so I did both, I just did both.

00:03:57.397 --> 00:03:59.486
- And which did you do
first or both at the same?

00:03:59.486 --> 00:04:00.510
- [John] I kind of did
them at the same time.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.343
- I see.

00:04:01.343 --> 00:04:02.650
- Yeah, I alternated.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.980
Yale's a very flexible place.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.860
The law school's small, the
history department's small,

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.860
and so I was able to work out

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.790
moving back and forth across the street.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.790
- And any particular
mentors that stand out

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.075
as an undergraduate,
graduate student, or end law?

00:04:21.075 --> 00:04:25.390
- I was really lucky to have
really extraordinary historians

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.480
and lawyers to work with and learn from.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.710
David Brion Davis in
the history department

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.020
as an undergraduate and then
and then a graduate student was

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.220
an intellectual inspiration,

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.970
an incredibly nice man as well

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.788
which I'm sure was a large part of it.

00:04:38.788 --> 00:04:41.120
But David Brion Davis has written books

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.120
that you know will last and
will survive the test of time.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.420
And then in the law school,

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.670
a man named Bob Gordon,

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.714
Robert Gordon who's now at Stanford.

00:04:50.714 --> 00:04:53.590
And any number of other other figures,

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.140
Akhil Amar, any number of other people

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.160
I worked with pretty closely.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.940
- And what was your dissertation on?

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.230
- The dissertation was
on industrial accidents.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.360
A century ago, a lot of
people don't know this,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.070
but a century ago there was a
crisis in industrial accidents

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.470
in the United States unlike anything

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.400
the world had ever seen.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.100
And it transformed American law,

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.700
it helped give rise to
to much of what we now

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.550
know of as the modern
state in the United States.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.880
It was the response to
industrial accidents.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.853
It was a great project,
turned out to be fabulous.

00:05:24.853 --> 00:05:26.765
- And this actually
became your first book.

00:05:26.765 --> 00:05:28.440
- That's right, so this
is The Accidental Republic

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.887
is the name of this book.

00:05:29.887 --> 00:05:34.400
- And what you're tracing is
a movement from free labor

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.370
which was the center of the conversation

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.510
and about how to treat labor,

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.490
and were moved to accidents,
insurance, security

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.290
which is a kind of a major transformation

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.550
of the economy then reflected in the law.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.430
- Right, so if emancipation
was about free labor,

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.680
if the very definition of
freedom after the Civil War

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.170
became the freedom of
the worker to work freely

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.880
and choose, make his own way.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.490
And it was him, it was very gendered

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.354
which is interesting too.

00:06:05.354 --> 00:06:08.040
Once the workers are
being maimed and killed

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.700
in extraordinary numbers,

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.720
there's a crisis for
that whole way of life,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.380
that whole system of thought

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.680
that freedom had given birth to.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.360
And so what the book does,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.950
it traces out the experiments
of an entire generation

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.390
around the turn of the 20th
century to try to figure out

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.730
how to restore some version of free labor,

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.970
or how to alter free labor,

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.120
or how to remake free labor
for the world of risk,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.150
and the world of the of the 20th century

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.893
which is the world that
we're familiar with with now.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.277
- A theme emerges in that
book which is a theme

00:06:38.277 --> 00:06:41.300
that you're very interesting,
comes up begin again,

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.230
which is there're critical
periods in our history

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.380
and there're alternative
paths that the law can take,

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.090
and this was your first example of that.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.610
- Yeah, no that's true, so
contingency is one of the things

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.720
that I'm most interested
in finding as a historian.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.190
I think it's one of the
distinctive contributions

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.520
that historians can make

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.070
is to reveal the existence
of alternative possibilities,

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.190
that the world we live
in now isn't inevitable,

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.900
that it could have come
out quite differently.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.570
And of course what that means
is that we can make things

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.893
happen differently into
the future as well.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.790
- And what led you to this interest,

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.203
this early interest in tort law?

00:07:24.993 --> 00:07:26.260
Where did that come from?

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.230
- Yeah, well, so one of
my teachers at law school

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.150
at Yale Law School was Guido Calabresi,

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.930
who's this judge on the Second Circuit,

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.530
United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit,

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.342
still teaching torts at Yale now.

00:07:38.342 --> 00:07:40.610
You know, has has taught
torts at Yale for decades.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.100
And in Guido's torts class,
Calabresi goes by Guido,

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.160
in Guido's torts class,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.580
you spend the first several
weeks on a single case

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.590
involving an injured
railroad worker in 1911.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:53.940
It ends up in the New
York Court of Appeals,

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.600
the high court for the state of New York,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.860
and that 1911 case,

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.770
or to get my mind wrapped around that,

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.510
I needed a lot more time
than my classmates did.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.470
So I spent a couple years on that case,

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.610
writing a dissertation
about it essentially.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.300
Whereas most of my
classmates got done with it

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.653
just after a couple weeks.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.030
- And this by the way is
another theme that emerges,

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.480
you're very interested in storytelling

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.550
and narratives of people,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.900
'cause people are very important as actors

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.940
in your analysis.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:26.773
- Yes, I was--

00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:29.277
- Not to say the only thing
that's important to you, yeah.

00:08:29.277 --> 00:08:31.960
- Right, so stories are another thing

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.000
that historians can bring to the table.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And I think of them as
incredibly supple and subtle ways

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.200
to tell, to draw an account
of the human experience.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.380
So, you know when I was
flirting with being an economist

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.130
as an undergrad, one of
the great thrills of it was

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.390
the ability to draw up
models for human behavior

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:55.490
and focus on a few perspicuous dimensions

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.550
that could allow you to
get some access and insight

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.750
into how human beings behave.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.601
And I admire that and enjoy
doing it still sometimes

00:09:02.601 --> 00:09:05.260
as a teacher in law school classes.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.040
But you lose so much of the texture

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.270
and the fine-grained account
of how human beings behave,

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:15.510
and so the story allows you to tell things

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.350
in their full complexity.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.937
I just find that hugely appealing,

00:09:18.937 --> 00:09:20.700
and I also just like stories.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.780
I also just like stories,
I just own up to that.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.890
- And so I'm curious
about the origins of that.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.940
I should mention here that
your books are extremely lucid

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.870
and well written for an outsider

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.180
who's not a lawyer or a historian.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.010
And so the question is

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.960
where did you learn to write so well?

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.414
And what got you interested in stories?

00:09:44.414 --> 00:09:47.460
Was it law case studies?

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.340
- Well, yeah, law school works,

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.711
and the law works around
cases and particular stories,

00:09:51.711 --> 00:09:53.550
that's for sure, that's for sure.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.240
And I think that may be part of it.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.510
I think it's just maybe
an effort to understand

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.050
how human beings tick.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:09:59.989
What makes them tick?

00:09:59.989 --> 00:10:02.190
Where do their motivations come from?

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.990
Where do their projects come from?

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.840
And stories are one of
the ways you get at that.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.600
I'm a novel reader and a film watcher,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.890
and all those things organize
themselves around stories.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.299
I'm just not creative enough
to generate stories of my own.

00:10:17.299 --> 00:10:18.630
(both laugh)

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.940
And so history helps me with that

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.688
by giving me things
that actually happened.

00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:23.900
- I like to ask my guests

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:29.960
what are the skills and
temperament required

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.799
for the work that they do?

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:37.799
And you wear two hats, a
historian and a lawyer,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.710
so talk a little about that.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.200
In other words, are the skills

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.610
and temperament very
different for the two?

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.863
Or are they not that different?

00:10:48.863 --> 00:10:51.670
- Well, they're different
and they're the same

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:52.610
in a number of ways.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.710
But I think lawyers are
principally interested

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.010
in trying to figure out
how to take the past,

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.330
to take the accumulated body

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.893
of legal materials that we have,

00:10:59.893 --> 00:11:02.920
whether it's statutes
or cases from the past,

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.390
and make the best that we can make

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.990
for the future out of those materials.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:09.630
Historians are dealing with the past too,

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.900
but they don't have an
obligation to make the best

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.770
we can make of those materials.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.261
They have an obligation to try to tell it

00:11:16.261 --> 00:11:18.730
the way it really was,
the way it really was.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.970
And so, there are some similarities there,

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.840
but also some really
important differences.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.398
And to me the excitement is

00:11:25.398 --> 00:11:27.780
to be in both of those disciplines

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.020
at the intersection of those two things.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.720
I just find that you know super,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.060
super interesting and exciting.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.780
- And in terms of temperament,

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.800
I mean, you, you really, your,

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.790
especially your historical studies,

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.970
you're really in the archives.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:47.417
It really is a question of
patience, perseverance--

00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:52.210
- Yeah, well, I learned about
this one in my accident book.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.530
You know, I commuted to Brooklyn, New York

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:56.760
from New Haven for a good
while writing that book.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.240
And I bought a frame backpack

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.710
and carried the collected annual reports

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.650
of the New York state
insurance commissioner

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.030
in the 19th century

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.400
back and forth along
the Metro-North train.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.880
And now those are boring
books, they're just boring.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.920
And so the the project was
to try to tell a good story

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.280
out of these other
seemingly boring materials.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.000
And I think there were
good stories to tell.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.777
There were the, you know
lives and misfortunes

00:12:19.777 --> 00:12:21.850
of thousands and thousands of people

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.010
in those insurance reports.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.530
That's what the insurance is about,

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.920
is protecting against misfortune.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.810
And so that's what I do
when I'm in the archives,

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.446
is I look for stories that I can tell

00:12:30.446 --> 00:12:32.700
that people don't know about,
people don't know about.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.830
And I think you know lawyers
do something that are the same,

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.450
that as lawyers have to read
very carefully to draw out

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.957
the salient facts, and so
there're some parallels there.

00:12:39.957 --> 00:12:41.040
- And what about writing,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.250
did you get that those skills at Yale?

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:45.083
- That's interesting.

00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:46.530
I think I get those skills

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.420
the way I imagine most writers get them

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.640
which is from reading,

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:54.640
just reading voraciously and
then wanting to produce things

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.930
as beautiful as the things
that I've been able to read.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:06.053
- As a historian of the law

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:12.190
you are drawing on tasks that lawyers do.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.590
So lawyers as you just
said, lawyers do history.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.920
They, you know, it's a
different kind of history,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.100
it's the history of precedence,

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.180
of what happened before
what other courts have.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:33.150
Whereas as a historian,
there's a difference.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.810
What exactly is that difference,

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.430
if I could draw that out of you,

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.640
between a historian of the law

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.263
and lawyers who are by the
nature of their work historians?

00:13:43.263 --> 00:13:45.370
- Well, there's a saying for this

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.700
that it's the lawyer does

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.197
what's called law office
history, law office history.

00:13:49.197 --> 00:13:52.950
And that, that's sometimes said
pejoratively by historians,

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.330
but I don't think of it
as in a pejorative sense.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.670
What they're doing is that the lawyer

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.540
who does law office history is
doing history for a project,

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.800
for a purpose, trying to
accomplish a particular end,

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.770
help a client decide a
case in the here and now,

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.200
something along those lines.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.440
The historian by temperament maybe,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.750
but by professional obligation is supposed

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.750
to look at the past and
take it on its own terms.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.320
Now the historian chooses
which topic to look at.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.150
That is often driven
by presentist concerns,

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.680
things in the here and now,

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.289
but once the historian
gets to those materials,

00:14:24.289 --> 00:14:27.621
the project is to think about
them for their own sake,

00:14:27.621 --> 00:14:31.460
and to try to make sense
of them on their own terms.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:36.460
- I'm interested in what
are some common themes

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:41.550
that emerged in your
work that would tell us

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.740
what being a historian
of the law is about.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:50.740
And I found a very revealing
quote in the Lincoln book,

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.140
the Lincoln's Code which
we'll talk about a minute,

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.967
you say, "Law of any kind
does not develop independent

00:14:59.967 --> 00:15:04.967
"of its context or untethered
from the needs and interests

00:15:04.977 --> 00:15:08.380
"of the most concerned parties."

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.160
So it's about a larger context,
talk a little about that.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.750
- Well, absolutely, so I think sometimes

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:14.760
there are people who imagine

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.980
that law must come down from the heavens,

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.910
or be in the heavens, that
has some magical property

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:25.900
that makes it live in the world of reason

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.510
rather than the world of experience.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.277
There's a famous line from
Oliver Wendell Holmes Junior,

00:15:30.277 --> 00:15:33.240
"The life of the law has not been logic,

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.650
it's been experience."

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.273
And Holmes was obviously right about that.

00:15:37.273 --> 00:15:39.810
The life of the law comes from

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.540
what human beings bring to it,

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.080
the projects, the goals, the
aspirations, the interests,

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.400
sometimes base interests,
sometimes glorious ideals.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.990
And it's that mix of all those things

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.240
that comes to make what the law is.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.980
And the effort to to treat it

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.590
as a domain of pure
reason and principle is

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:02.210
to miss what really makes it tick,

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.993
and really why we'd want to
have it in the first place.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.960
- And so your skills
as a historian provide

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.960
that sense of texture
that enriches the context

00:16:16.047 --> 00:16:19.030
and makes one aware of
all the different things

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.760
that are going on because in your books

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.760
there is a sense of
interest group behavior,

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.230
of the importance of ideas,

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.120
the importance of individuals,

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.990
and the importance of institutions

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.060
and the history of those institutions.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.790
- Well, that's right and all
those parameters seem to me

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.960
to be critically important in developing

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.590
the sufficient accounts
of the way the past works.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.980
And now if you get too
granular in these stories,

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.280
well, it's just one
damn thing after another

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.780
and you haven't revealed
any internal logic,

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.410
or any structure, any recurring patterns.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.790
So, the balance is to find ways

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.295
to take advantage of
the capacity of stories,

00:16:59.295 --> 00:17:02.350
to tell things as they really were,

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.400
while also pulling out
some generalized patterns

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.540
and some lessons at least for
understanding the material,

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.370
maybe even sometimes lessons

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:13.323
about how we ought to behave today.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.300
- I wanna go over a point that
we talked about a minute ago

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.800
because another thing that emerges is

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.350
these critical turning points

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:27.060
where alternative paths present themselves

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.480
and a decision is made one way or another.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.290
So, this rich understanding of the context

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:38.290
really helps you see the paths
that we may no longer see

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.820
because those paths were
the roads not taken.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.590
- Yeah, right and the job of the historian

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.140
as I understand it in these moments,

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.210
is to draw out the paths and
describe them as plausible.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.130
That it's easy to say,

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.900
oh, look, somebody thought of something

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.960
which didn't come to pass,

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.520
but that doesn't mean you've
been able to describe it

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.360
as something that could
actually have come about.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.991
And so especially in the accident book,

00:17:58.991 --> 00:18:01.440
what I did there was I tried to lay out,

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.050
you know, almost a half dozen
alternative ways of organizing

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.570
a system of accident law and insurance.

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.670
Each one of which could have been models

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.810
for the social insurance
state of the 20th century.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.240
But I didn't wanna just identify them,

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.530
I wanted to build them out

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.600
and describe the ways in
which they were being built,

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.500
being made, being developed on the ground,

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.730
so that the reader gets a sense,

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:23.910
this is actually a plausible path

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:24.830
that might have been taken.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:26.760
Sometimes there're paths
that are taken elsewhere.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.150
I mean history is a little bit like,

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.040
the past is a little bit
like a foreign country,

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.240
and so it's a kind of, it's
a form of comparativism.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.090
That is the experience of other countries

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.740
can sometimes show us
how things might work

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.077
in a different way and soak
in the experience of the past.

00:18:41.077 --> 00:18:43.900
- Your two recent books the Lincoln's Code

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.630
which we'll talk about in a minute,

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:47.880
and the Patriots and Cosmopolitans:

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.673
The Hidden Histories of American Law,

00:18:55.090 --> 00:19:00.090
can be seen as responses to
the events of events of 9/11,

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.236
not in the sense that those events

00:19:02.236 --> 00:19:04.600
over-determined what you did,

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.600
but in the sense that
they shaped your sense

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.030
of what the problems were
that you wanted to look at.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.290
Talk a little about that.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:19.050
- Well, 9/11 had a big impact
on my thinking about the law.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:22.780
I lived about a 1/2 mile
north of the Trade Towers

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.030
on Greenwich Street in New York on 9/11.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.860
I was actually in a voting booth

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.860
when the first plane hit

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.710
right on the West Side Highway there,

00:19:32.461 --> 00:19:34.470
and that day and the days that followed

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:35.810
left a big impression on me.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.789
We were very fortunate that we were safe

00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:40.363
our close, our loved ones were safe.

00:19:41.399 --> 00:19:44.360
A lot of people weren't
as fortunate as we were,

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.540
but I wanted to think more
about international law,

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.730
the kinds of controversies
that quickly followed

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.390
as the United States began to respond

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.490
in the months and years thereafter.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.920
So a lot of it was motivated
by thinking about the way

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.980
in which the United
States was in the world,

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.019
and thinking about the
international influences

00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:03.610
on American law.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.640
It's also true that in the
field of legal history,

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.580
I think one of the next
big questions for us is

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.940
the history of international law.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.320
And it's a field that's booming right now

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.530
independent of developments on the ground.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.500
Although, of course,
always engaged with them,

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.950
but because the field is
set up now to want to know

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.410
about the history of international law,

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.500
we've got a lot of literature

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.802
on the history of domestic law.

00:20:24.802 --> 00:20:27.653
And international law is a
kind of unwritten frontier.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:33.590
And in pursuing these
interests on your part

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.737
there is a focus inevitably
on national identity,

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:50.960
nationalism, what that means
as American law responds

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.280
to external influences
say in international law

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.657
or international examples

00:20:59.657 --> 00:21:04.657
and how they impact us and
lead to a reassertion really

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.300
of American nationalism
and national identity.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.110
- Yeah, well so the, my second book,

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.969
the one just before this most
recent one, Lincoln's Code is

00:21:15.969 --> 00:21:19.020
entitled as you said
Patriots and Cosmopolitans.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.660
And what I wanted to take
up was these twin impulses

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.310
that run through American history,

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.941
an impulse to a kind of
nationalism or patriotism,

00:21:26.941 --> 00:21:29.680
and I certainly felt that
in the days after 9/11.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.050
I think almost everybody,

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:33.770
maybe everybody in New York City did.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.740
And then on the other hand,
a kind of cosmopolitanism.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.010
That is the United States
has sometimes aspired

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.880
to be bigger than just itself,

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.240
has aspired to stand for
ideals and principles

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.270
that are global, that are
the right thing to think

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.550
independent of where you
happen to be in the world.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.692
We're a beacon on the hill,

00:21:49.692 --> 00:21:51.710
as it were, for the for the entire world.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.820
And so those twin impulses,

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.910
I wanted to explore them
in the history of the law.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:00.120
I definitely felt them
inside myself, still do.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.650
Nation states do wonderful things,

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.410
and there're also obstacles
to the accomplishment

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:05.243
of lots of other good things.

00:22:05.243 --> 00:22:07.060
And so I wanted to pursue that

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.070
through the history of American law.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:12.047
- And you went about doing that

00:22:12.047 --> 00:22:17.047
and in tell the lives
of several individuals

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.610
throughout American history

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.530
in different periods of American history.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:25.430
And I wanted to focus on
the last two chapters.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:29.550
And in telling the story of individuals,

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:34.550
and in the earlier chapter
you focus on a woman attorney,

00:22:37.311 --> 00:22:42.311
and I have her name here.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.520
And I'm gonna find that name, remind me--

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.353
- Crystal Eastman yeah, yeah.

00:22:45.353 --> 00:22:47.630
- Yeah, yeah, sorry, Crystal Eastman

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.813
That's terrible that I lost that name.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:54.270
And in telling about her life,

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.720
it's a fascinating account.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.300
And tell us a little about her

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:03.450
and the themes that she was
interested in as a lawyer.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.738
- Well the reason I picked
up her story, first of all,

00:23:05.738 --> 00:23:08.450
she gets started in
industrial accident reform.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.788
I met her in my first book,

00:23:10.788 --> 00:23:13.160
and then noticed that she made a turn

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.160
right around 1908, 1909,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.120
and became much more interested
in questions of world peace,

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.620
and internationalism was the word

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.230
that she used to describe it.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.670
And Crystal Eastman is
a lawyer trained at NYU

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.600
in the first decade of the 20th century

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.730
at a time when there weren't many lawyers.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.848
She couldn't find a job practicing law,

00:23:30.848 --> 00:23:34.656
not even liberal law firms would hire her

00:23:34.656 --> 00:23:36.120
because she was a woman.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.880
And so she found, what she
did was she found ways,

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.400
she found ways to be in the
law and to work in the law

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.580
that didn't require her to go

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.280
through the old boys' networks.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.550
- And they were very few lawyers,

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.407
women lawyers at that yeah--

00:23:47.407 --> 00:23:48.880
- Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.800
And the thing that she saw that I admired,

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.360
and admire still to this day,

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.185
and it's the reason why she's
the center of that chapter

00:23:57.185 --> 00:23:59.810
is that she saw that nation-states

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:00.650
aren't themselves inevitable.

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:04.221
There're a particular way
of carving up the planet,

00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:06.020
creating governance structures

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.470
allowing us to engage in
democratic self-government,

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.100
and do lots of good things.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:10.960
But she thought,

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.470
and a whole bunch of
people in her generation

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.790
thought so along with her,

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.770
that the rivalries among nation-states

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.140
were terribly dangerous.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.980
That they produced
things like World War I.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.860
And that the nation-state form itself

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.420
was was really problematic
and needed to be transcended.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.810
And this is an idea that lots of people

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:28.900
in the 20th century had.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.360
We used to have the League of Nations,

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.940
we have the Charter of the United Nations,

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:33.773
all of which are trying

00:24:33.773 --> 00:24:36.350
to find supranational,
transnational structures.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:40.690
And she's part of the early
cusp of that 20th century idea

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:42.400
that the nation-state is the problem.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.520
And so exploring her story was a way

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.240
of thinking about these funny
containers of human life

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.834
called called nation-states.

00:24:49.834 --> 00:24:51.146
- And interestingly enough,

00:24:51.146 --> 00:24:54.780
and I demonstrated that by
not remembering her name,

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.860
she's not well-known.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:56.750
- No, not at all.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.170
Her brother Max Eastman is
a little bit better known.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:00.830
He was an editor of
something called The Masses

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.602
which is an important World
War I radical magazine.

00:25:04.602 --> 00:25:06.158
He becomes an important literary figure

00:25:06.158 --> 00:25:08.250
in the middle of the 20th century.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.090
She gets sick in the 1920s

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:13.136
and dies tragically, tragically young.

00:25:13.136 --> 00:25:16.340
- It's interesting because
the evolution of her career is

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:21.340
really indicative of these
cosmopolitan influences.

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:24.950
So she was in industrial accidents,

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:28.062
and she studied at Columbia or NYU.

00:25:28.062 --> 00:25:28.895
- Yeah, yeah.

00:25:28.895 --> 00:25:32.600
- And learned about looking
at large scale problems

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.210
which ultimately,
sociological analysis leads

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.320
to a European way of studying problems.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.890
And she moved from that back
to emphasizing the individual

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:48.330
when the war brings to America concerned

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:52.082
with national security
and the Espionage Acts.

00:25:52.082 --> 00:25:55.120
- Right, she's a fabulously
interesting intellectual person.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.540
She has an intellectual journey

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.350
through a bunch of different ideas

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.100
in the early part of the 20th century.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.730
She's a progressive for a little while,

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:02.850
she becomes a radical,

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:05.200
she moves through different places

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.440
along with the intellectual
currents of the day.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.490
And her own experience
really helps her see things

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:13.500
and add to those ideas.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.850
So as a woman she marries
a British national.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.030
And she marries a British national

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.550
at a time when doing so strips her

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.110
of her American citizenship,

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:25.570
just automatically by a
statute enacted by Congress.

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:28.710
And so she sees up front and personal

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:31.610
the consequences of the way
nation-states are organized

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:35.170
in her personal life through this moment.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.554
And it's part of what motivates her.

00:26:36.554 --> 00:26:40.890
- And interestingly enough
because of the Espionage Acts,

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.330
civil liberties became more important.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:47.370
But someone like Crystal
saw civil liberties

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:51.900
as a means to the end of
these cosmopolitan ideas

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.170
about world government and so on.

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:58.240
But in the end she loses out
to a man who is well-known,

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.270
Roger Baldwin who ultimately

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:03.660
creates the American
Civil Liberties Union,

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:08.130
but is really focused on domestic issues.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.380
His background was in domestic law,

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:16.380
and so cosmopolitanism
becomes civil liberties

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.480
because of this assertion

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.721
of national identity and
nationalism in a way.

00:27:24.721 --> 00:27:26.240
Is that an oversimplification?

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.387
- No, that's a great
way to tell the story.

00:27:28.387 --> 00:27:30.403
I mean Crystal Easton was a dreamer.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.890
She has an aspiration,

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:37.740
and she sees an ideal
far off in the distance.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.810
And a lot of people who are
more successful in the world

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.650
really in the end, you compromise with it.

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.150
And Roger Baldwin is
someone who compromised

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:49.830
with the world in order to
accomplish really amazing things.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:52.390
But he makes big compromises in order

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:53.380
to accomplish those things.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.780
He's an organizer who
insists on practical reform.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.300
And abolishing nation-states
is not a practical reform.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.068
It wasn't gonna happen then,
it's not gonna happen now.

00:28:03.068 --> 00:28:05.290
We see that in Eastern Europe right now

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:06.663
with the refugee and migrant crisis

00:28:06.663 --> 00:28:09.490
with the nation-state reasserting itself.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:10.800
So Crystal Easton was a dreamer

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.420
and it's useful sometimes
to think about dreamers

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.830
to focus on them 'cause
they highlight things

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.020
that we don't see otherwise.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.409
- And I guess the virtue of
this history as I read it,

00:28:21.409 --> 00:28:26.409
you understand the origins
of what we see these days.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.550
People who believe that the UN could

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:32.920
solve all of our problems
when in reality it doesn't.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.360
- Right and there is no
UN for her to claim on

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.820
to try to appeal to at that moment.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:37.950
And so what she does is

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.530
she invents this idea of civil liberties.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:41.540
She invents civil liberties

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.530
as a way to hold off the nation-state,

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.380
to create some space for
voluntary organizations,

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.410
to develop ideas of internationalism,

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.340
and to create an internationalist spirit

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.373
in the first two decades
of the of the 20th century.

00:28:54.373 --> 00:28:59.040
- The next chapter in that
book pairs Roscoe Pound,

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.713
a famous Harvard dean who was favorable

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.280
to administrative law in
the beginning of his career,

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.470
but then became a spokesman

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.490
for the Association of Trial Lawyers.

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:14.690
And you pair him with Melvin Belli,

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.693
both men, both well-known.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:22.300
And it's a fascinating account

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.380
of how the trial lawyers became a way

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:30.700
through interest group
politics to essentially

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:35.320
reassert national identity in America,

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.400
sense of its own institutions,

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:42.210
and to use those institutions
to essentially benefit

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:43.610
the self-interest of lawyers,

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:45.500
and presumably their clients.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.505
- Well, one of the interesting questions

00:29:46.505 --> 00:29:48.525
in the history of American law is

00:29:48.525 --> 00:29:51.750
why is it that certain
features, certain experiments,

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.670
certain structures get
seen as un-American?

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:55.670
How does that come to be?

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:58.450
It's a little bit of a mystery.

00:29:58.450 --> 00:29:59.810
And so one of the things I wanted to tell

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:02.610
in this story was the self-conscious use

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:06.490
of the lobbying power
of the legal profession

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:07.950
in the middle of the 20th century

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:11.270
to hold off the growth
of the New Deal state,

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:14.280
to hold off the growth of bureaucracy,

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.700
administration, and end the New Deal.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.730
And to do it in order to
protect the common law courts

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.203
and the jury trial, in part,

00:30:23.203 --> 00:30:25.280
it's appealing about the common law courts

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.113
and the jury trial.

00:30:26.113 --> 00:30:27.580
We know there're pathologies

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.810
in the welfare state, absolutely.

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:31.430
What was interesting to
me was the way in which

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:32.787
the lawyers who started
to tell these stories

00:30:32.787 --> 00:30:35.900
about the un-American
nature of the New Deal,

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:36.960
we're doing something on behalf

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.610
of the self-interested project

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:41.350
of keeping the contingency fees flowing.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:45.380
And so that was a story that
I had a great time telling.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.150
And the relationship between Pound,

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:48.720
who had himself once been one

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.570
of these bureaucratic reformers.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:54.010
The story of the relationship
between him, an aging Pound,

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:57.650
and Melvin Bell was just was
just too good to pass up.

00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:02.650
- And the politics of both
Baldwin, and Pound, and Belli,

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.630
although very different
in terms of the you know,

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:10.120
on the liberal conservative spectrum,

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:15.120
in the end it's about falling
back on American institutions,

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:20.660
American identity to assert the importance

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.360
and the dominance of a
particular sector of the law.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:29.180
So it's American and it's
embedded in our sentiments,

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.370
you call it, and our institutions

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:35.330
to take this path to the law.

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.160
- Right, this has been
one of the ways in which

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.590
the nation-state asserts
itself in our history,

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:43.290
and comes to to play such a
powerful role in our history is

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:46.290
by creating institutions that
people like Crystal Eastman

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.790
can't actually get around.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:48.630
They can alter them,

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.270
they can introduce something
like civil liberties,

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:51.780
a really important tradition,

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.200
but those institutions have
such gravitational force.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.680
And so one of the things
that the Belli/Pound chapter

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.700
was designed to bring out, their story,

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.160
is the way in which those
institutions and those traditions

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.186
bring people back to the
nation-state time and time again.

00:32:06.186 --> 00:32:09.540
There's power to be had by making,

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.141
by calling on the
traditions and institutions

00:32:12.141 --> 00:32:15.450
that the nations of the
world have have created.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:18.430
- An interesting theme that I discovered

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:21.380
which reminds me now that you having said

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.280
you were considering economics

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:28.280
because the people who
lose out in these stories,

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:33.700
essentially, have a sociological approach

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:36.940
to the problems that are being addressed.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:41.200
That they want to look at
what the data tells them

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:45.150
about the large scale
project and which way to go.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:48.070
And that was true of
the administrative law

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:52.410
that Pound supported in the
beginning of his career.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:57.410
And it's true in the case of
the woman we just talked about.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.433
- No, that's true, yeah.

00:32:58.433 --> 00:33:00.450
So one of the things
that I hope to bring out

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:02.480
in the Pound/Belli chapter is that

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.260
it's not clear to me that one version,

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:09.270
the sociological was better
or worse than the common law.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:10.730
In some ways, the common law,

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:12.740
and this is was the genius of Belli,

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.120
not so much Pound's work,
but the genius of Belli,

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.700
was to recreate in the common law,

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.120
private administration as a substitute

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.230
for public administration.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:24.020
So it turns out that in the
tort system we have now,

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.240
the trial is a rare event.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.890
What really happens in the tort system is

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:30.860
settlement in boardrooms,
between insurance companies,

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.950
and sophisticated plaintiff's lawyers,

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:36.427
who create the same kinds
of grids for settling cases

00:33:36.427 --> 00:33:39.810
that the bureaucrats and the
public side have as well.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:43.210
And so, I was interested there
in showing the way in which

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:45.700
particular kinds of
ideas about Americanists

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.190
have these unintended consequences

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:50.190
of keeping with administrative bureaucracy

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:52.300
which after all just
saves us too much money.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.300
I mean it's too efficient to not have it,

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.670
and yet we have it in the private side

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:57.720
rather than the public
side in the United States.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.021
- And this is not just true in tort law,

00:34:00.021 --> 00:34:01.640
it extends to other
areas of the law, yeah.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.800
- Oh, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.060
You think for example of Obamacare

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.130
which runs through private
insurance companies.

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:09.770
The use of private mechanisms
for delivering public goods is

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:12.310
a central theme for American
political scientists

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:16.080
who study the the provision
of the American welfare state,

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.960
and also is a theme that
comes out in American law.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.710
- And so, in that, that's
an argument for history

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:22.950
if I ever heard one.

00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:26.640
So that it gives you a,

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:31.005
if you wanted a single-payer,

00:34:31.005 --> 00:34:35.740
your history, not to say you're
taking a position on this,

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.620
but by understanding the
complexity of the past

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:43.510
and where we are today, you can understand

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:46.860
the difficulty of
implementing a single-payer.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.400
- Yeah, you'd want to know this
history to make a strategy.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.410
No matter what you wanted,

00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:51.630
you'd want to take this into account.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:52.550
Yeah, that's for sure.

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:55.410
- Your most recent book for which you won

00:34:55.410 --> 00:34:59.303
the Bancroft Prize is Lincoln's Code.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.880
What was Lincoln's code
and how did it come about?

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.320
- So Lincoln's code is a text

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:09.000
that the Union Army
issues in April of 1863.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.070
And it's the modern
world's first restatement

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:16.678
of the customary rules of
international armed conflict.

00:35:16.678 --> 00:35:18.860
It has 157 articles.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.710
It's got rules about
torture, prisoners of war,

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.920
legitimate targets and
illegitimate targets,

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.640
the whole array of things that we think of

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.464
as being the laws of armed conflict

00:35:28.464 --> 00:35:31.890
which since 9/11 have been
really salient for us.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:34.530
They're all they're in this text

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:37.047
that the Union Army issued in '63.

00:35:37.047 --> 00:35:40.790
- And as your history tells us,

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:45.790
America had paid lip
service to the rules of law

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:49.160
even though we had individual leaders

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.340
who might have done
particular things in wars,

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.760
one thinks here of President Jackson

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.490
and his fight with the Indians,

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:59.327
or George Washington in the
early part of his career,

00:35:59.327 --> 00:36:02.510
that they may have done
things that did not abide

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:03.760
by the rules of law.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.760
But overall, we embraced
the the rules of law

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:12.280
with one important exception,

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:16.880
and it is that insight on your part

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.690
that really is eye opening.

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:25.500
What was the problem that the US had

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:30.040
with the rules of war, one
particular element of it,

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.880
before the Civil War?

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.790
- Well, I think the thing that causes

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:36.940
the Lincoln administration to
need to issue this pamphlet is

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.910
that since 1775 the
American position had been

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.229
that the laws of war don't
allow civilized states

00:36:44.229 --> 00:36:47.060
to free enemy slaves in wartime.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.100
This is something that
the last royal governor

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.237
of Virginia did, Lord
Dunmore, on his way out.

00:36:51.237 --> 00:36:54.470
You see, announced that he'd
free the slaves of rebels

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:56.400
who made it to British lines.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.970
And from that moment on
the American planter class,

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:02.160
and then the American government
is committed to the idea

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.530
that you can't free slaves in wartime.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.700
And that commitment which
John Quincy Adams carries on

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.890
in the War of 1812,

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:11.280
and then later as secretary
of state and president,

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.230
that that project to
protect slavery from wartime

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:17.530
which is hugely important
for the strategic interests

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:18.363
of the United States,

00:37:18.363 --> 00:37:21.200
to keep war if a European
power had invaded,

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.820
to keep it away from
the slave plantations,

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.470
which might be like a tinderbox.

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:26.750
That was the worry.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.580
- And the worry, let's emphasize this,

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.320
the worry was that if you freed the slaves

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.481
there would be mass insurrection,

00:37:33.481 --> 00:37:38.481
and all sorts of terrible events

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:43.450
with examples from history
like the Haiti rebellion.

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:45.640
- Right, exactly, the
Haiti, the specter of Haiti

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.360
looms over much of the early
part of the 19th century.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.266
It comes to stand for,

00:37:50.266 --> 00:37:53.640
it was misunderstood in
large ways by the planters,

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.870
but nonetheless, in
there misunderstanding,

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:59.050
it comes to stand for the
risk of freeing slaves

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:00.290
in a moment of armed conflict,

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:03.330
and the kinds of race wars and atrocities

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:05.130
that might arise out of it.

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:08.410
So that fear is something
that really helps

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:10.230
to shape the military
strategy of the United States

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:13.250
during the entire Antebellum period.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:17.430
- So this is a perfect
example of what you're saying,

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:19.580
so before the Civil War

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:24.110
here is an international body of law

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:29.110
that essentially we embrace in
all respects except for one.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.120
And in this particular case,

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.440
namely the rules about
freeing slaves in war,

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:41.800
there is absolute total resistance

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:46.800
by all of our founding fathers
and the elites that we have

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:50.340
through our history up until Lincoln.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:54.720
- Yeah, I mean the Americans
push really hard to establish

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.730
a rule about slavery in wartime.

00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:59.560
And you know when John Quincy Adams goes

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.479
to his British counterpart to
negotiate the Treaty of Ghent

00:39:02.479 --> 00:39:05.210
in 1814 to end the War of 1812,

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:06.225
his British counterpart says,

00:39:06.225 --> 00:39:09.300
you know John that that's not the rule.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.670
So it's the United States
that really gets out

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.940
at the forefront of trying
to make private property

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.260
and private property,
and slaves in particular,

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:20.610
immune from wartime,
from the violence of war.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:23.870
And that then comes back to
haunt the Lincoln administration

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:25.540
come the fall of 1862.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.580
You know, once Lincoln
decides on emancipation,

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.460
his administration then
needs to figure out

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:34.120
what to do with this
long-standing tradition

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.824
of insisting that this
rule is a cardinal rule

00:39:37.824 --> 00:39:39.700
in international law.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:44.700
- And if we get into the details
of the conduct of the war,

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:49.630
not freeing the slaves
becomes a real problem.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:53.660
So whatever humanitarian ideas Lincoln had

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.700
about that the slaves should be freed

00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.700
as a matter of principle,

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:03.400
it's really the particulars of the war

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.550
that are giving him that final push.

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:08.700
Well, give me some examples
of those particulars.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:12.460
Why did the slavery
become such a conundrum?

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.380
- Well, it becomes such
a conundrum in large part

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.520
because the slaves make it a conundrum.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.130
So you know right from
the beginning of the war

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:19.910
in the spring of 1861,

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:23.420
slaves roll across to
Fortress Monroe in Virginia

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:26.500
leaving Confederate lines
and coming to Union lines.

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.730
And Union commanders, right
there it's General Butler,

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:33.440
have to decide what to do
with these slaves who arrive.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.540
And the the initial solution,

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:38.420
or the initials are patched
together a framework,

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:39.630
is to call the slaves

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:42.000
that make it to Union lines contraband.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.830
Now contraband is a term
from international law.

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.525
It's just not a term
that had anything to do

00:40:46.525 --> 00:40:48.500
with the situation to
which it was being applied.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:52.410
It's a term that has to do
with the property that's useful

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:55.904
in war found on a neutral
vessel on the high seas.

00:40:55.904 --> 00:40:57.280
And what Butler does,

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.760
is he appropriates that term

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:02.260
from the international
law of the sea context,

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:06.740
and applies it in this new
place to try to begin to grapple

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:09.850
with what to do with
the slaves in wartime.

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:13.020
And from there, it just gets
harder as the months go by.

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.447
- You make a distinction
in American history

00:41:16.447 --> 00:41:21.447
and American ideas
between notions of justice

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.720
and notions of humanitarianism.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:27.459
Explain that distinction,
and then how that

00:41:27.459 --> 00:41:32.400
in a way helps us understand
Lincoln's decision process.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.900
- Well, you know, one of the
things that legal history does

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:37.111
is it helps us highlight
the moral structure

00:41:37.111 --> 00:41:40.630
of the legal institutions,
legal rules we have today.

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:42.160
And here's a really good example.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.030
So the the the moral
structure of the laws of war

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:47.890
in the middle of the
19th century and today

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:50.920
is a structure that tries
to set justice aside.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.150
The question when we deal

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.790
with the international
laws of armed conflict

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:58.420
is not which side is
right, which side is wrong,

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.210
which side is just, which side is unjust.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:01.540
The questions are,

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.384
assuming both sides are right

00:42:03.384 --> 00:42:05.570
for the purposes of regulating,

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:07.347
how do we regulate this armed conflict?

00:42:07.347 --> 00:42:09.760
And so you don't ask who's in the right

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.810
and who's in the wrong.

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:13.169
And that was true in the
middle of the 19th century too.

00:42:13.169 --> 00:42:17.220
It was the 19th and 18th
centuries' great advance

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.790
on the early modern law
which actually had asked

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:21.750
who's in the right and who's in the wrong.

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:24.460
So it was a law that was
focused on humanitarianism

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.120
at the expense of justice.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.240
And what the American Civil War does is

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.090
put justice back on the table

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.940
'cause emancipation is
a project for justice.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:34.773
Lincoln says that,

00:42:34.773 --> 00:42:37.220
he says when he issues the
Emancipation Proclamation,

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.890
he says this is an act
of military necessity,

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.630
and an act of justice.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:43.181
So he's put justice back on the table

00:42:43.181 --> 00:42:46.974
in a way that potentially
could have unbalanced

00:42:46.974 --> 00:42:49.770
the humanitarian rules of the laws of war.

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:51.960
That's the tension that runs through

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.033
between justice and
humanity in the laws of war.

00:42:55.033 --> 00:42:57.833
- And interestingly enough,

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:02.730
to go back to the themes
that you're pursuing

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:06.090
in this particular case,

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:11.090
the international principle
of freeing slaves is embraced

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:17.510
by America when the necessity of war

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.260
pushes Lincoln to make that choice.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.290
And philosophically, as you've just said,

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:28.470
he decides that well, we don't
know whether the Confederates

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:30.030
are right or are we right,

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:33.260
well, we have to believe
that we are in the right.

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.910
- There's this great
moment in the fall of '62,

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:38.330
as Lincoln's trying to
come to a conclusion

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:40.180
about whether or not to do emancipation,

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:42.010
he takes some notes, you
know he takes some notes.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:44.380
And what he does is he recapitulates

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.337
the intellectual history of
the international laws of war.

00:43:47.337 --> 00:43:50.640
And he does this, it's not like
he'd been to graduate school

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.350
in in just war theory, what he's done is

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:56.950
he's read some law books
by William Blackstone,

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:58.600
and he's read Shakespeare,
he's read Henry V.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:02.660
And with those things and
with his natural genius,

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.790
he's able to recapitulate the history.

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:09.570
He says, I know that that we
Union folk are praying to God,

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:11.040
and we think we're in the right.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.693
I know that the Confederate
soldiers pray to God as well.

00:44:14.693 --> 00:44:18.660
And so I know that we're
supposed to do in the laws of war

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:21.820
is assume that we don't
know who's in the right.

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:25.010
But how can I have that
posture, if I've committed

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:27.890
hundreds of thousands
of men to harm's way?

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:30.030
And as the Lincoln sees that tension,

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:31.980
and sees that tension
better than anyone else

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.240
who thinks about the laws of war

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.670
in the middle of the 19th century.

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:39.420
- And his administration commissions

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:43.320
a Columbia law professor
named Lieber to draft these.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.120
Lieber's had become known

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.930
because his lectures at
Columbia had been printed

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:50.500
in The New York Times.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.010
And Lieber's background
is very interesting

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:55.260
because he's a German of origin,

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:59.520
he's a European, he knows Clausewitz,

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.660
he's actually witnessed war, as I recall.

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.730
So he is, in a way, a draftsman

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:11.730
that is bringing the European
sense of the rules of war,

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:16.450
but also the necessity of what you must do

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:18.050
in war to the table.

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:19.070
- Yeah, well, Lieber is just,

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:21.970
is one of the great forgotten characters

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:23.880
of the of the American Civil War.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.880
And what he helps us see
is that the laws of war

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.209
don't get adopted in order to constrain

00:45:30.209 --> 00:45:33.040
the people who adopt
it or in order to hide,

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.224
in order to tie behind the back

00:45:35.224 --> 00:45:38.380
the hands of powerful states.

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:40.100
The laws of war get
adopted by powerful states,

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:42.360
the multilateral treaties beginning

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.530
in The Hague Conventions of 1899,

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:47.780
moving through to the Geneva
Conventions of our own time are

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.740
conventions/treaties that get
adopted by powerful states.

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.532
And Lieber sees that, he's a Prussian.

00:45:52.532 --> 00:45:56.090
He comes of age in the
era in which the Prussians

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:57.800
are trying to overthrow Napoleon,

00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.880
kick him back out of Berlin.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.480
He's shot on the way back to Paris

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.330
chasing Napoleon back to Paris.

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:05.970
But it doesn't make him a pacifist,

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:08.870
instead he sees war as the kind of thing,

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:12.040
which though tragic, is
occasionally necessary.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.710
And it's necessary to sustain

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:16.260
the moral virtue of free people.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.270
So his code is not the code

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:21.520
of what he would have called
a mawkish humanitarian.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.040
He has disdain for the
mawkish humanitarian,

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.450
who he thinks is secretly a pacifist.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.790
And instead he has a code that's fierce,

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:33.790
it's a code designed to allow
the Union Army to win a war.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.957
- And in this code in addition to saying,

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.920
making it the code compatible

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:47.740
with Lincoln's intention
to free the slaves,

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:50.623
there is a rule against torture.

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:56.890
There is insights about well,
who is an enemy combatant

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:58.136
and some what?

00:46:58.136 --> 00:47:02.030
- The central organizing
principle of the code,

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:04.490
and this is why I think
it's Lincoln's code properly

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:06.460
rather than Lieber's,
although international lawyers

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.650
have always called it Lieber's.

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:09.070
But the central organizing principle is

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:12.020
the military necessity idea
that Lincoln had a vote

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:14.260
in September of 1862 when he announced

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:17.410
the Emancipation Proclamation,
the preliminary Proclamation.

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:20.300
And that organizing idea
runs through the entire code.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:23.010
And so when Lieber brings up a question

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:26.361
like prisoners of war,

00:47:26.361 --> 00:47:30.090
or legitimate targets,
civilians, and soldiers,

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:32.140
he's always got in the back of his mind,

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:36.020
a carveout for situations of necessity.

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:37.842
And so the code says you may not kill,

00:47:37.842 --> 00:47:40.270
we may not execute prisoners of war,

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:42.660
but then it says unless
you really have to.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.650
And he too may have been
thinking about Henry V

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:45.810
right there, Shakespeare's Henry V

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:47.165
in which a famous order is given,

00:47:47.165 --> 00:47:49.090
not clear whether it's carried out,

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:51.584
but is given in a moment
of extremists in the battle

00:47:51.584 --> 00:47:55.270
to kill prisoners behind the front lines.

00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:58.130
So there are always these
carveouts for military necessity.

00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:00.880
Except one, except in the case of torture.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.130
And torture, Lieber says,
is simply not permitted.

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:04.370
There's no carveout.

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:06.950
It's not something that
civilized states can do

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:08.480
and remain true to themselves.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.290
He's not worried, I don't think,

00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:13.030
about the moral status
of the enemy soldier,

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:15.249
nearly so much as he is
about the moral status

00:48:15.249 --> 00:48:18.610
of his guys, of the people who'd have

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:21.860
to perform the torture in question.

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:25.429
- Now in the other, so in the end,

00:48:25.429 --> 00:48:30.429
we embrace a humanitarianism,
but at the same time

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:32.900
there's an understanding of the conflict

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.530
with this principle of justice.

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:38.142
Namely, that we have to
believe our cause is right,

00:48:38.142 --> 00:48:40.260
you know, or we're not
gonna win this thing.

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:45.260
And we see the the effect
on humanitarianism,

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:51.090
in the whole prisoners of
war and exchange business,

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:55.270
where because the South,
once slaves were freed,

00:48:55.270 --> 00:49:00.270
would not allow captured
black soldiers to be freed.

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:06.370
Then we, all negotiations
about the exchange

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:10.180
of soldiers broke down,
making the the Union soldiers

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.310
who were not black really suffer.

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:13.480
- Yeah, this is one of the places

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.313
where you can really see

00:49:14.313 --> 00:49:16.600
the justice/ humanitarianism tension.

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:20.090
So, the reason Lincoln
needs to issue this code

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:24.330
is not just to reverse
the 85-year tradition

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:28.130
starting in 1775 of insisting
that the laws of war

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:29.990
don't allow you to free enemy slaves,

00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:33.170
it's also to deal with the
consequences in the management

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:35.700
of the conflict, of
moving to emancipation,

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.250
and of arming black soldiers.

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:39.950
So Jefferson Davis and James Seddon,

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:42.070
the Secretary of War of the Confederacy,

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:44.097
and Davis, of course, the
President the Confederacy,

00:49:44.097 --> 00:49:47.010
have announced, in no uncertain terms,

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:49.170
that black soldiers in Union uniform

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:51.340
will not be treated as soldiers,

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:52.620
they'll be treated as criminals.

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:55.260
They're either black free
abolitionists from the North,

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:57.070
who are stirring up a slave insurrection,

00:49:57.070 --> 00:49:59.940
which is unlawful in the law
under the law of Georgia,

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.070
South Carolina, Mississippi, and so on.

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:05.640
Or they're black slaves who
have escaped from a plantation

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:08.930
and are themselves a
criminal for having done so,

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:10.710
and then stirring up an
insurrection as well.

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:12.310
So the idea is that southern state courts

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:16.140
are gonna hold trials and
punish, often by execution,

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:18.910
black soldiers enlisted in the Union army.

00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:21.970
And what the code does is it
insists that the laws of war

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:24.880
don't allow for discrimination
on the basis of race.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.060
That they require that states recognize

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.922
the privileges of soldiers for everybody

00:50:28.922 --> 00:50:32.090
in the in the enemy uniform.

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:36.020
And so that problem helps
propel the code forward,

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:37.220
and what it does is it causes

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:39.010
a breakdown in prisoner exchanges.

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:40.750
Once the Union insists on following

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:43.530
the international law
rules set out in the code,

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:45.000
the prisoner exchanges break down

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.893
'cause the Confederacy's not
willing to trade black soldiers

00:50:47.893 --> 00:50:50.540
as part of part of prisoner exchanges.

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:52.370
And what we get is things
like Andersonville.

00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:53.830
So Andersonville is the result,

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:54.980
the terrible prison in Georgia

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.130
where your tens of thousands die,

00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:59.230
that's the result of the
end of prisoner exchanges.

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:01.250
And what the Lincoln
administration is doing there

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:03.170
is insisting on what's right,

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:06.500
insisting on what's right
at the expense of humanity.

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.803
And you see that tension there again.

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:14.930
- How does your study help us

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:20.870
evaluate the response to 9/11,

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:23.450
to think more clearly about it?

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:25.380
- Well, one of the things
I wanted to understand

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:27.620
when I jumped into this was

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:29.690
where did the response to 9/11

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:32.220
and the controversial pieces of it,

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:36.378
they enhanced interrogation
and the torture,

00:51:36.378 --> 00:51:38.850
in particular, or also now drone strike

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:39.830
and things like that.

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.690
Where did those things fit

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:43.840
in the long tradition of American history?

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:47.060
And there was a sense that we
were in uncharted territory,

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:49.370
that we were in unprecedented territory.

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:52.920
And I think that what Lincoln's
code is essentially designed

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.240
to do is to show that
that's just not right.

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.620
Every generation of American
soldiers and statesmen

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:02.810
has had its own crisis in the
laws of war, it's pervasive.

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:05.707
And what's pervasive is moral challenge,

00:52:05.707 --> 00:52:07.400
and the law is trying to keep up

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.780
with the basic moral
structure of armed conflict.

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:13.630
So what we see actually in
our struggles now with Isis,

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:17.480
and the like, is the reproduction
of a series of problems

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.330
about how to deal with the laws of war

00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:21.410
that we've had since
the founding and before,

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:22.880
since the Seven Years' War,

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:26.500
20 years before the Republic get started.

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:29.570
- And in my sense in reading your book is

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:33.470
both the cosmopolitan book
and the Lincoln book is

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:37.080
that you then see what's going on today

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.410
kind of in a different light.

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:41.557
It doesn't necessarily mean
that you change your position,

00:52:41.557 --> 00:52:46.557
but you wind up saying, oh,
that's where this comes from,

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:48.910
and, oh, this was handled

00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:51.340
in a somewhat different way in the past.

00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:54.510
- Yeah, I mean the effort
to bring al-Qaeda members

00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:57.550
to justice at Guantanamo is part

00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:00.560
of the long struggle over
whether or not justice

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.410
should be a part of armed conflict.

00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:04.790
And it reproduces some of the
same debates that were had

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:06.882
in the second half of the 19th century

00:53:06.882 --> 00:53:09.530
in Indian wars on the frontier.

00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:10.930
It reproduces some of the debates had

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:13.800
about military commissions
during the American Civil War.

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.790
And each one of those instances has been

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:18.270
an instance in which the
effort has been made,

00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:20.080
the impulse has been felt

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:22.070
to bring justice back into the equation,

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:24.680
since after all, who
can leave justice out?

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.330
Right and wrong ought
to be front and center,

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:27.530
and if you violate the rules,

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:29.180
if you act in a wrongful way,

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:32.710
often times with terrible,
terrible consequences as on 9/11,

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:34.790
then surely justice should
be front and center.

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:37.920
And punishment should be
the language that we use,

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.560
and the the project that we're engaged in.

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.094
But the laws of armed conflict have tried

00:53:42.094 --> 00:53:44.860
to get people to pull back from justice

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.540
out of fear that fighting
for justice will just produce

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:52.140
a downward spiral, and just
make things worse, not better.

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:53.030
So we can see for example

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:55.670
that tension just running
through our history,

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:57.823
and reproduced now again, today.

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:01.580
- When I think about your writings,

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:06.130
and how they help us
understand the context

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:07.513
of critical moments,

00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:13.040
I'm struck by the relevance
of the kind of work you do

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.980
to the kind of problem we face today

00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:18.850
with the sharing economy, for example.

00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:21.770
And so, I'm not asking you to come up

00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:23.960
with a solution to that problem.

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.490
What I wanna ask you is

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:31.490
what are the sorts of things
that a historian would

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:36.670
wanna look at in understanding the future

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:41.810
of technologies like Uber in the context

00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:46.950
of long established rules about
municipal rights of taxis,

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:52.730
of labor rights of employment, and so on.

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:56.651
So I'm not asking for a
solution to the problem,

00:54:56.651 --> 00:55:01.590
but in other words, think
out loud about a historian

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:03.210
of the law would think about this.

00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:05.990
- Yeah, I think it's a good example.

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:08.827
I mean it's seems to me that
we're in a hinge moment.

00:55:08.827 --> 00:55:11.150
I'm thinking out loud here with you,

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:12.840
but I think it's a hinge moment.

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.620
And it's a hinge moment
because as I understand it,

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:19.140
outfits like Uber, Airbnb, are challenging

00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:21.810
the existing legal regulatory structure.

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:22.880
They're essentially saying,

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:27.170
we think that that
crowdsourcing and ratings,

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:31.300
customer ratings are a better
way to do safety in taxis,

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:35.150
better way to rate the experience
and regulate the safety

00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:40.150
of the experience in
hotels and quasi hotels.

00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:42.810
And is a challenge to the old model

00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:44.710
of an inspector with a license.

00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:46.880
And that's the model that we have now.

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:51.019
And so we're seeing a battle
between those two forms

00:55:51.019 --> 00:55:53.160
and it'll be really interesting to see

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.350
how that how that plays out.

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:58.660
I'm sure that the sharing economy
institutions have shown us

00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:01.480
new ways to do some things
that we haven't known

00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.600
how to do nearly as well before.

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:06.150
And I'm also sure that
they're in some other ways

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:07.940
skirting some rules that
we're gonna have to try

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:09.770
to figure out how to reimpose.

00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:12.440
- And then in the end it's really gonna be

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.810
about interest group behavior,

00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:17.831
who's gonna get mobilized to either be

00:56:17.831 --> 00:56:19.330
for or against this.

00:56:19.330 --> 00:56:24.330
It's also about the lawyers
who can help us understand

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:29.630
how this fits into what
you call the institutions

00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:33.260
and the sentiments that
define American nationalism.

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.150
- Yeah, and it's a good thing.

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:37.350
I mean, I think you know,
one of the things that might,

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:40.010
we might see here is
that the hotel industry

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:41.450
and the taxicab industry,

00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:44.640
there're gonna be interests
pushing back the other way.

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:45.880
And they're gonna be pointing to things

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.812
like the fact that I
think many Uber drivers,

00:56:48.812 --> 00:56:50.758
I don't really know what I'm
talking about here, right?

00:56:50.758 --> 00:56:51.591
(Harry laughs)

00:56:51.591 --> 00:56:52.900
So I'm gonna say to be irresponsible.

00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:56.290
But many Uber drivers, I
imagine, aren't properly insured.

00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:58.190
I think this must be pervasive, right?

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.530
And as that kind of thing comes out,

00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:03.450
as accidents happen,

00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:05.881
and people aren't able
to recover on policies,

00:57:05.881 --> 00:57:08.300
as insurance companies
keep getting surprised

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:11.880
to learn that their
insureds are Uber drivers,

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:15.383
we're gonna see the law
have to come to terms

00:57:15.383 --> 00:57:18.680
with that kind of thing.

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:22.520
- Well, with their set of
problems like that before us,

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.850
and having walked you
through some of the problems

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:27.036
that you dealt with,

00:57:27.036 --> 00:57:28.960
my last question will be this,

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:32.810
How would you advise students
to prepare for the future,

00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:35.640
especially, if they wanna go into law?

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.800
And should they become historians too?

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.320
- Well, they absolutely
should become historians.

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:41.090
One of the great virtues
are being a historian,

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:42.190
well, two virtues, you know,

00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:45.150
one is you haven't ruled
out any methodology.

00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:47.020
You can do economic history,

00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.673
you can do the history of sociology,

00:57:48.673 --> 00:57:51.010
you can do the history of
English literature, right.

00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:53.610
So history is a way of not
ruling out a methodology,

00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:56.820
it's in some ways it's kind of
a cheat as a result of that,

00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:58.366
but the real reason to study history is

00:57:58.366 --> 00:58:01.000
that otherwise you're like an amnesiac

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.920
walking through time and space.

00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.220
And so having some sense

00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:07.710
of the kinds of features
of the human experience

00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:09.074
allows you to make sense of the meaning

00:58:09.074 --> 00:58:12.940
of the kinds of things we do
today, and hopefully tomorrow.

00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:14.170
- Well, on that note I wanna

00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:15.590
thank you very much for being here.

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:18.480
Let me show the two
books that we discussed

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.700
'cause I think they're really great reads,

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:25.700
and our audience will want
to go out and get them.

00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:28.640
Professor Witt, thank you very much

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:31.360
for this really engaging conversation,

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:33.640
and being with us here today, thank you.

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.840
- Thank you, my pleasure,
my pleasure, thanks.

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.730
- Thank you very much, and thank you

00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:40.818
for joining us for this
Conversation with History.

00:58:40.818 --> 00:58:44.485
