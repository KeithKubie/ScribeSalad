00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.925
So I'm going to use my little friend on the right.

00:00:01.925 --> 00:00:03.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the quick access menu.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.219
&gt;&gt; I haven't used him in a while.

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:05.219
&gt;&gt;

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:04.461
[LAUGH].

00:00:04.461 --> 00:00:05.680
&gt;&gt; That's nice. Okay. new field.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.420
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.910
&gt;&gt; because the object already exists. It's a relationship.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.780
&gt;&gt; It's a relationship, and it's going to be a lookup. And, mainly because

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.450
you can't actually do a master detail to a user object, that's just one

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.386
of the requirements in sales force. But also, we already have all of those

00:00:21.386 --> 00:00:24.371
records created, so we couldn't even do a master detail if we wanted to.

00:00:24.371 --> 00:00:28.886
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, it's related to, user.

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:29.760
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.190
&gt;&gt; And, of course, the next ritual.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.160
&gt;&gt; So, you want to change that to say Stage Manager instead of User.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.640
&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense. Okay, so we've added our user field.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.530
&gt;&gt; Right there, yeah, sweet. Stage manager, look up to the user. Great.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.700
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.310
&gt;&gt; So, let's go back to the Udacity stage and make you the manager.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah! OK, Udacity stage.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.335
&gt;&gt; So there's the Stage Manager field, you can just double-click it.

00:00:58.335 --> 00:01:02.020
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, I can double-click here. Use my magnifying glass friend.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.250
&gt;&gt; Sweet.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.340
&gt;&gt; And, it already knows, I'm a user. That's, that's creepy Sam. I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.440
don't like when, Sales force creeps me out. How do they know that?

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.280
&gt;&gt; Well, you're the logged in user right now, and you're

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.050
the only user in your organization because you just created it today.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.440
&gt;&gt; Okay. And I don't have a role, but presumably I could. Okay.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.690
Save.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And we even could have created a filter to

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.440
only show people by certain roles to show up in this lookup.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.190
&gt;&gt; Cool. Okay. So, we've done it.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.870
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.460
&gt;&gt; I'm managing stages.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.885
&gt;&gt; You're the manager of the stages now.

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.910
[LAUGH].
