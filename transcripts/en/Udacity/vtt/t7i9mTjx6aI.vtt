00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.960
Let's check out where and
how to configure build types.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.720
Since build types are only relevant to
the android component of this build,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.140
we need to check out the build.gradle
file in the app folder.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.442
Build types are declared in
the build types script log.

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:17.200
Here we can see that android studio
has already added some additional

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.200
configuration to the release
build type for us.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.270
Take note, although debug isn't listed
here, the debug build type still exists.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.870
In this case,

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.710
we are disabling packaging optimizations
by setting minifyEnabled to false.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.470
Also, we are configuring where
the android plug in should look for

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.635
proguard configuration.

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.780
We'll talk more about
proguard in lesson four.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.320
If we open up the gradle pane to
look at the available tasks for

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.780
our project we see that we have assemble
tasks for each one of our build types.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.980
So we have assemble debug and
assemble release.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.240
Another way to pick which build type we
want to build is by opening up the build

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.410
variance pane.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.470
And then we can select between debug and
release.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.640
Let's say we were building a game and
wanted to make a build for a QA testing

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.970
that's exactly like the release build
except it bundles in sheets for

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.640
infinite gold or
to skip levels or whatever.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.610
We can easily declare a new build
type by adding it to the build types

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.235
block like cell.
