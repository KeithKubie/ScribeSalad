00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.280
You think you're happy?
I'm happy. I'm very happy.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.570
What we will do, today is wrap up
phase diagrams,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.850
make some comments about the final
exam, and then we're going to get

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.140
some people that aren't associated
with class are going to come in,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.420
they will pass out paperwork and do
the course evaluations.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.710
And, we'll get you out of here at
11:55. Before I go any further,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:01:04.220
draw your attention to another IAP
subject.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:53.570
If you're looking for something to
do during January,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.150
and this will be offered by myself
and my postdoc,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.730
Patrick Trapa. We are going to
offer a lab subject without a lab.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.310
It's part of an experiment that we
are conducting for the National

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.890
Science Foundation to see if large
classes such as these that don't

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.470
have a lab experience can get much
of the lab experience,

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.050
that is to say, planning for
discovery, preparation of the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.630
background information,
and then mining the data from data

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.210
sets that are in the public domain,
and then analyzing the data and then

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.760
presenting the data.
All of that you get without turning

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.300
the knobs. And,
that's about three quarters of a lab

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.840
experience. So,
I think three quarters is better

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.380
than none. That's what we want to
try to do. It's a limited

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.920
enrollment of 20 people,
and it's going to run for two weeks

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.460
during IAP in the mornings,
and you can go to the IAP website.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:02:04.386
And, it's worth six credits as well.
So, OK, enough said about that.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:50.780
My office hours,
I'll have a little bit of extended

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.570
office hours Friday 4:00-6:00,
next Tuesday 4:00-6:00. And, there

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.360
will be a question and answer
session on the evening of Tuesday,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.150
the 14th of December. Professor
Ballinger is going to run that in

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.940
54-100. All of these,
and I know the TAs, some of them are

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.730
going to run review sessions.
All of these are optional. They

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.520
have strict instructions not to
teach new material.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.310
If you don't want to go to those,
you don't have to. If you want to,

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.100
bring your questions, and I just
want to make it totally

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.820
value neutral.
OK, last day we talked about phase

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.460
diagrams. I want to continue the
discussion today.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.110
We looked at type one,
which involves very nearly similar

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.760
materials. So,
that gives a lenticular phase

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.400
diagram shown here.
And, then we looked at type two

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.050
where we have a phase separation
without change of phase,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.700
giving us a miscibility gap.
Remember, whenever you're in a

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.350
two-phase regime,
two-phase regime, queen of diamonds,

00:02:50.350 --> 00:03:09.233
bingo, that means tie line, lever
rule.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:57.730
So, phase separation will give us a
single phase, whether it's a

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.460
homogeneous solid solution breaking
into two phases,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.190
or a homogeneous liquid solution
breaking into two phases.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.930
Those two phases have different
compositions, and the compositions

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.660
of each of those two phases is given
by the end members of the tie line.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.390
And the relative amounts of the two
phases is given by the lever rule.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.130
Today I want to look at type three.
And type three is characterized by

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.680
sort of a mix of the two.
And on the left,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.050
we have change of state,
and on the right, we have no change

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.420
of state. On the left,
we have perfect solubility.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.780
On the right we have partial
solubility. So,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.150
we're going to take the solubility
characteristics of type two,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.520
and the change of state from type
one, and put them together.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.890
And that's what we end up with as
the overarching features here.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.260
And, this is what the phase diagram
looks like, where we have something

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.630
that's similar to,
you see the bottom here?

00:03:50.630 --> 00:04:09.926
The bottom here looks like that
syncline.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And the top here looks like the
beginning of the lens.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So, we have liquid, and then beta
here. Beta is a solid solution,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
alpha is a solid solution. So,
let's designate those.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Alpha is a solid solution of A and
B, only it's A rich.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
It's very near pure A,
but it's not exactly pure A.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So, this is homogeneous solid
solution just as you'd have in a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
lenticular diagram.
And, beta is a solid solution of A

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:26.150
and B, only it's B rich.
And L, that's a liquid solution.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.460
That's a liquid solution of A and B.
So, these are all single phase.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.760
These are all single phase. Let's
put that up here.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.070
This is P equals one,
single phase. This is P equals one,

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.380
single phase. And, this is P equals
one, single phase.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.690
Now, if I want to go from one
single phase to another single phase,

00:04:47.690 --> 00:05:05.980
I have to go through
a two-phase regime.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:55.860
So, this is slush,
liquid plus solid alpha.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.730
This is slush, liquid plus solid
beta, and now I have a solid

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.590
solution on the right.
I have a solid solution on the left,

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.460
and I can't go from one single phase
regime to another single phase

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.330
regime. I had to go through a
two-phase regime.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.190
So, this is alpha plus beta.
And, now I've got two phases down

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.060
here, one phase here.
Look at this point here that I've

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.140
indicated in purple. What is this?
This is a special.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.420
This is alpha, beta,
and liquid in equilibrium.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.710
And, this is called the eutectic.
It's the equilibrium between solid

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.990
alpha, solid beta,
and liquid. And, this type of

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.280
diagram is called a eutectic diagram.
It's a eutectic diagram,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.570
and it has some remarkable
properties that make it advantageous

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.850
in processing.
Look at here in the type one

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.070
diagram.
There's no point on the type one

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.210
diagram where we see all liquid
below the melting point of the lower

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.350
of the two components.
We essentially have a lens

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.490
extending from the lower melting
point to the higher melting point.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.640
If you look here, if I add A to B,
the melting point drops. We go down

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.780
this liquidus.
That's not surprising.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.920
What's surprising in the case of
the eutectic is when you add B to A,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.370
the melting point drops.
So, we get freezing point depression

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.120
from both ends with the result that,
you see this whole liquid zone in

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.870
here? This whole liquid zone has
liquid lying at temperatures below

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.620
the lower melting point.
So, this gives us a much,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.370
much greater range in which to
process. So, we have a depressed

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.120
liquid region.
So, let's call this the

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.870
characteristic is freezing point
depression of both components,

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.620
of both A and B, which is something
we didn't see in the case

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.750
of the lenticular.
And this eutectic point is the

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:06.250
equilibrium of alpha,
beta, and liquid. And,

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.750
it's unique. It exists at only one
value of temperature and composition.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.250
So, that's unique to every
particular system.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.880
So, let's look at some examples.
So, here's one apropos of the coming

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.660
winter. This is water and ethylene
glycol. And, we talked about water

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.440
ethylene glycol in the coolant
system with reference to controlling

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.220
boil over. And,
as the winter is coming,

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.990
we want to avoid freezing of water
in the channels of the engine block

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.770
because the water is going to freeze
from the outside in.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.550
That means the last water to freeze
will already be plugged by ice at

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.330
the ends. And,
as you know, when water freezes,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.110
it expands. How do you know? You
know for the negative slope

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.730
on the PT diagram.
And, that expansion is so

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.190
energy-laden that it'll crack the
iron of the engine block.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.660
So, you have to keep the water from
freezing. So,

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.130
what we can do is we can add a
second component and give ourselves

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.590
a eutectic type system.
So, here's pure water on the left.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.060
Here's pure ethylene glycol on the
right. It's a double alcohol.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.530
There is the chemical formula for
it. And so, pure water,

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:36.526
which we see the melting point of
pure water is 0¡C.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:24.120
And, what this is showing is that
this alpha region of ethylene glycol,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.240
and water is so narrow that for all
intents and purposes this appears as

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.370
a straight line.
That's why you go automatically

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.490
from seemingly pure water to this
eutectic regime.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:40.620
So, if we add, typically,
about 50 volume percent ethylene

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.740
glycol, that's the recommended
mixture, what do we see?

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.870
We see we get freezing point
depression down to about -35 or so

00:08:48.870 --> 00:09:08.340
Celsius which ought to take care of
most driving needs.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:57.420
Now, if you want,
you can get maximum freezing point

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.850
protection by adding about two
thirds. In other words,

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:06.280
68 volume percent glycol gives you a
eutectic at -69¡C,

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.710
or -92¡F. That ought to take care
of everybody in this room.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.140
I don't know anybody here that's
driving when it's more than -92¡F.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.570
So that should be OK. But, if you
want to be an enthusiast and decide

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:39.073
I'm not a cheapskate; I'm going to
use pure ethylene glycol.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:27.250
Why dilute it with water?
Well, pure ethylene glycol freezes

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:47.666
at about, here it is.
This is the Fahrenheit scale here.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:33.750
We are talking about cars after all.
So, it freezes at,

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:54.300
what is it, about 10¡F,
all right? And then, adding water

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:40.250
to glycol gives you the freezing
point depression here.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:10:00.133
So, actually if you go beyond two
thirds glycol,

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:46.750
one third water,
the freezing point is actually

00:09:46.750 --> 00:10:06.166
rising. So, that's not
such a smart idea.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:54.120
The second thing is,
here are the chemical properties of

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.240
some of these.
And, you see here is glycol -13¡

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.370
Celsius is the freezing point.
But, look at here. The viscosity

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.490
of water is roughly one in units of
centipoise. And,

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:10.620
the viscosity of ethylene glycol at
20¡C is 21. It's 21 times the

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.740
viscosity of water.
And, you know the viscosity is a

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.870
transport property much like
diffusion. And so,

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:37.540
it has an Arrhenius temperature
dependence.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:27.120
So, if we get the temperature down
to, say, -10¡C this is so highly

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.240
viscous that you run the risk of
burning out your water pump.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.370
So, bottom line is don't do
something stupid and run high

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:39.490
intensity glycol.
Here, I've plotted both the

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.620
solid-liquid equilibrium and
liquid-vapor equilibrium.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.740
And, this is one of the few times
when nature has been kind to us.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.870
When we add 50% glycol to water,
we get the freezing point depression

00:10:51.870 --> 00:11:11.473
down to about -35¡C.
And we get boiling point elevation.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:11:00.720
So, what we've done is we've taken
this interval of liquid water which

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.450
is at purity is 100¡C.
I haven't put the pressure cap on.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:10.180
If I just use 1 atmosphere pressure,
water freezes at zero Celsius and

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.900
boils at 100 Celsius.
If I add 50% glycol, it freezes at

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.630
-35 Celsius and boils at about 106¡C.
So now, I've widened

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:23.860
the liquid regime.
And then, if I put the pressure cap

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.590
on, then this line is going to move.
These lines don't move at all for 1

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.330
atmosphere pressure.
That's why we can throw away the

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.060
pressure variable.
So, by changing pressure and

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.790
composition we are able to widen the
liquid range and thereby protect

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.530
against boil over and protect
against freeze out.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.260
Remember, boiling, we want to make
sure we have good heat transfer.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:12:06.720
Here's one that's used in keeping
things safe in the wintertime.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
This is ice, and this is the
water-sodium chloride phase diagram:

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
again, a eutectic diagram.
And, if you add sodium chloride,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
you will extend the liquid range.
And so, we sprinkle salt on walkways

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and roadways in order to melt the
ice and make the roads and sidewalks

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
safe in giving us some traction.
And what I've done is I've

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
color-coded all of these so that you
will know liquidus,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
solidus, and, oh, we've got a new
one here. This is

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:22.110
called the solvus.
This line here is called solvus.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:26.350
You already know this is liquidus.
We met liquidus last day and we met

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.580
solidus last day.
There are old friends.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.820
But here's a new friend,
solvus. So, I've got all these

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:39.050
diagrams. I've color-coded them the
same way and I've written the

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.290
equilibrium for you.
So, if you add salt to water,

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:47.520
you can get down to about -21¡C.
And, notice that it's an almost 0¡F.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.760
In fact, Daniel Fahrenheit
determined the baseline of the

00:12:51.760 --> 00:13:11.053
Fahrenheit temperature scale by
putting salt in water.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:13:00.330
He used ammonium chloride.
And, ammonium chloride in water

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:04.660
gave a minimum at what he calibrated
as 0¡F. And then,

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.990
he took body temperature by putting
his thermometer,

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:13.330
he was a maker thermometers in
Amsterdam, very good glassmaker who

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.660
could put mercury in glass
thermometers, he put the thermometer

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:36.653
under his wife's armpit, and
she came out at 96¡F.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:25.170
She was running a little bit cool,
all right? And so, he said, OK,

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.350
that will be 96 units,
and then water is 32. And the

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.520
boiling point of water is 212,
and so on. And then subsequently we

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.700
went to the Celsius scale.
We don't use sodium chloride on the

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.880
walks. We use calcium chloride.
And you can see why. Calcium

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.050
chloride gives us a greater freezing
point depression.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.230
Sodium chloride in many instances
would not be that effective.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.410
So, most of the stuff you see
thrown on the roads is calcium

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.830
chloride, potassium chloride.
If you are hypertense and you want

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.490
to use potassium chloride and avoid
sodium, is not going to help you

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:58.160
much. You won't get hypertension,
but you'll fall down because the

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.830
walks will be slippery.
So, you'll have other problems to

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.490
worry about, but that's the way you
take your mind off the hypertension.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.160
You've got a broken hip. Oh, he's
mean. Why is he saying that?

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.820
OK, the holidays are coming.
Here's zirconia.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.490
Zirconia, remember zirconia at room
temperature is monoclinic.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:20.160
And that's no good. Cubic zirconia
is stable only at very high

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.780
temperatures. But look at this.
If we add calcium oxide to zirconia,

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.360
we have this huge range. It's a
eutectic system.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.940
There's the eutectic.
But en route, we stabilize the

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.520
cubic form all the way down to room
temperature. So,

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.100
when you are buying a stabilized
zirconia, meaning that the cubic

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.670
form has been stabilized,
that's the one that's got the high

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.250
refractive index.
And again, liquidus,

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.830
solidus, solvus. And,
look, it's a single phase regime.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.410
It must be bounded by two phase
regime. So, if I look to the right,

00:14:52.410 --> 00:15:12.686
it's cubic zirconia, solid solution
plus calcium zirconate.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:59.460
If I go to the left,
it's a zirconia calcia solid

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.930
solution with another tetragonal
form. So, again,

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.390
the model is, if you're moving
across a multicomponent,

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.860
two component phase diagram,
single phase bounds dual phase,

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.330
bounds single phase, bounds dual
phase, bounds single phase,

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.790
bounds dual phase. This is really
fantastic stuff.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:20.260
Oh, this is good.
Aluminum magnesium: this is the

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.550
beverage can.
This is the beverage can.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:26.660
So, we're looking at it. It's a
eutectic system.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.770
So, we're going to add a few
percent of magnesium into aluminum,

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.880
which is going to put us here: alpha
solid solution.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.990
If we have too much,
we end up in a two phase regime,

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:39.100
and that's no good because when we
go to deform the can,

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.220
it will tear. The metal will tear.
So, we have to have single phase,

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.330
freezing point depression.
And then, this is important in

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.440
metal recycling.
We want to be able to process this

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.300
stuff, and energy is costly.
So, if we can process at lower

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.920
temperatures, it's advantageous.
This is a very important one for

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.530
microelectronics.
This is lead 10. Lead melts at 327.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:06.150
Tin melts at 222 Celsius.
And, there is a eutectic down at

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:10.760
183. I learned this in high school.
We had this industrial arts class.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.380
It was 374¡F is the eutectic point
of soft solder.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:34.560
I'll know that on my deathbed.
So, what does this tell us?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:23.520
It tells us that if you are building
a micro device,

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.050
whether it's a cell phone or
computer, you've got to solder in

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:30.580
all the lead wires.
And, when you solder,

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:34.110
you have to energize the system.
You have to melt the solder, and

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:37.640
then it has to bond to the metal and
then freeze. And every time you go

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.170
in with that energy source,
you heat not only the solder but you

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.700
heat everything else.
And, you know, if you're making a

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.230
P-N junction, you want it sharp.
But, what happens if you heat a

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.420
sharp positional gradient?
Diffusion will occur,

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.280
and diffusion increases as
temperature rises.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.140
So, you are looking for a solder
that has the lowest melting point

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:18.813
possible so that you can get in and
out doing minimal thermal damage.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:17:03.660
In fact, when you design one of
these large devices,

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.330
you have in your design scheme a
thermal budget.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.990
And, you look at processing routes
that consume less energy not only

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.660
because you want to be energy
efficient from a manufacturing

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.330
standpoint, but because every time
you put joules of energy in,

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:37.993
you run the risk of having more and
more diffusion.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.500
And, those sharp P-N junctions will
become diffuse P-N junctions.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.000
And, as our feature size is getting
smaller and smaller,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.500
the diffusion distances are shorter
and shorter and you've got less time

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.000
before you've blurred those
interfaces and then the device is

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.500
useless. So, right now,
there is a huge effort to look at

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.000
lead free solders.
Lead, mercifully, has this low

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.500
melting eutectic below 200¡C.
That's the good news. The bad news

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.000
is its lead. And so,
now we've got two alternatives.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:53.520
And that's something you're going to
be faced with.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.050
Either we have something that is
lead free and very costly,

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.580
more costly than the device itself,
or we have something that is not

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.110
terribly effective.
It cold freezes in the joint and

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.640
the joints pop off,
and so on. So, this is a eutectic

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.170
diagram indicating the value of
freezing point depression in

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.700
processing. Last day I showed you
how to use compositional variation.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.230
Let's look at how we make silicon.
This is the iron-silicon

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.880
phase diagram.
Iron-silicon phase diagram is a

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.660
little bit messy but I draw your
attention to the top right corner.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.440
Unfortunately, this one is drawn
the other way around; it's got iron

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.220
on the left and silicon on the right.
And, I want to draw your attention

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.990
to dilute concentrations of iron in
silicon. So, we've normally been

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.770
looking at things from the left.
But I think you're capable of

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.550
flipping that around in your mind.
And what do you notice? You notice

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:48.330
that the alpha region of iron in
silicon isn't present there.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.110
That is to say that there is only a
tiny, tiny solubility

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.920
for iron in silicon.
So, if we want to purify,

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.780
remember, we are starting with
something really cheap.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.640
We are starting with beach sand,
and we need to go to five nines,

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.490
that is, 99.999% purity.
And, iron is death to a silicon

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:11.350
microdevice. We've got to get the
iron out. One of the ways to get

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:15.210
iron out is to start with something
in the liquid.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:19.070
So, this is pure iron over here,
pardon me, this is pure silicon over

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.860
on the left side.
So I've turned that phase diagram

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.590
around: pure silicon,
and this is percent iron.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:30.330
And, I want to get the iron out.
And, I'm not going to boil the

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:34.060
stuff off and use fractional
distillation. These things are too

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.790
high melting. They melt at such
high temperatures.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.530
They boil at such high temperatures.
I don't know what I contain them in.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.260
So, what we can do,
so this melting point of silicon.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:20:05.586
It's the melting point of pure
silicon which is about 1,430¡.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:53.130
What I could do as I could take some.
Let's say this is C naught; the

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:57.260
original impurity level of iron in
silicon. What I can do is I can

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.390
cool this melt down into the
two-phase regime and hold.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.530
And, what happens if I hold it in
the two-phase regime?

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:09.660
This is alpha. This is liquid.
So, this must be slush. Alpha plus

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.790
liquid: it's going to phase separate.
And, what do I see?

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:17.930
The solid phase here has a value of
iron at CS, which is

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:22.380
less than C naught.
So, the solid has less iron in it.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:27.150
It's a higher purity silicon. And
the liquid has C;.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:31.920
And, what do we find?
We see that CS is less than C

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.690
naught is less than Cl.
And, this is the lowest value of

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:41.460
iron. So now,
I can take this stuff out,

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:46.230
throw it into another furnace,
melt it, and cool it. And, what

00:20:46.230 --> 00:21:05.526
happens? As I did with the
distillation, I keep chasing it up.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:56.630
Now, granted, I lose a lot of
material. But,

00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:02.270
I'm gaining material that has very,
very low levels. So, again, what's

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:07.900
happening is that this phase
separation leads to compositional

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:13.540
differentiation.
And, that's the paradigm:

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:19.180
compositional differentiation.
So, we can do it with

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:24.150
differentiation.
We can do this with liquid vapor and

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:28.460
do a distillation,
or we can do it this way,

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:32.760
which is a solidification.
So, this is the impurity. The iron

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:37.070
is a solute impurity,
and we say what is happening in this

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:41.380
process is the iron impurity is
being rejected up into the liquid

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.690
phase. So, when we are holding here,
what we have is,

00:21:45.690 --> 00:22:04.780
remember, the silicon is less dense
than its liquid.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
So, this is high purity silicon,
high purity, and this is low purity

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
silicon liquid.
Now, if I take this,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
throw it into another furnace,
melt it, I can do it over and over

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
again. So, this is called zone
melting. I'll show you how that

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
works, where people speed the whole
thing up. You take a giant salami

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
of silicon, which now the standard
is 12 inches in diameter.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:23.360
So, this thing is a single crystal
of silicon, 12 inches in diameter,

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.730
and several meters long. So, we're
not going to take that single

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.100
crystal and remelt it.
What we can do instead is put some

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.470
induction coils around it.
We put induction coils around it

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.840
and send a current through it,
what will happen as this will get so

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.200
hot that it will melt.
And by surface tension forces,

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.570
I can contain the molten zone here.
And, what happens if I hold this

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.940
long enough? I eventually drop the
temperature and I get phase

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.310
separation. So,
on one side, I'm going to get

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:53.640
accumulation of the impurity.
And then, I can drag this through

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.940
and sweep all the impurities down to
one end and chop that end off.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.230
And, then I could do it again.
I say, well, why do it again? Why

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.520
don't I just have another set of
coils like this,

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.820
and then another set of coils like
this? And so,

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.110
this stuff melts,
freezes, melts, freezes,

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.410
melts, freezes. All the garbage
gets sent down to the end,

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.700
chop this off, and now we have five
nines silicon exploiting the

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:37.000
compositional differentiation in
that two phase regime.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:24.660
So, that's really good,
yeah. So, this is used in scrap

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:29.330
metal processing.
It's used in making high purity

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:33.990
silicon. If you ever find yourself
in the North Atlantic,

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:38.660
you could use this for desalination
because you know that it's,

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:43.330
if you looked at that phase diagram,
what you have is the composition of

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:47.990
ice and salt water is very nearly
pure water. There's very little

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:52.660
salt content. So,
this is called zone melting or zone

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:57.070
refining.
Zone melting is the technique.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:01.210
Zone refining is the result. We
get the purity up.

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:05.350
OK, so now let's look at another
use of this. Let's look at a use of

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:09.490
this in the context of champagne,
and at the same time honor an

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:13.630
inventor. So,
the person I want to talk about is

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:17.780
Madame Nicole Barbe Ponsardin.
And, she was a young lady who

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.920
married Francois Clicquot of the
Clicquot family that owns a large

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.930
champagne winery.
And she was widowed at the age of 27

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:29.790
in an act that was atypical of
French women in her day.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:33.660
Instead of just receding and being
a silent partner,

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.530
letting the winery go about its
business, she took control of the

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:41.390
winery and really became very
aggressive about how this one should

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:45.260
be made. So, she did all these
things, which was unheard of by

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.130
anybody at the time marketing
champagne to the courts of Europe

00:24:49.130 --> 00:25:09.193
and making the myth that champagne
is this magical beverage.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
It was drunk only in pretty much
France at the time,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
bought lands in the best vineyards
to control the chemistry.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
This is all about chemical control
the product, fought fiercely against

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
counterfeiting,
used the court system to prosecute

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
people who sold wine masquerading as
champagne, strict quality control

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
procedures, all of the sort of thing,
making sure that the chemistry is

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
under control,
produced the first Rosé champagne,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
again, good chemistry, leaving the
skin on the juice and then oversaw

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
this invention of a new technology,
which brings together phase diagrams.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:32.690
That's what I'm talking about it.
You think I'm talking about it just

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.380
because I want to talk about
champagne. This is an application

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.070
of phase diagrams.
So, first of all: the problem.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.760
The problem is that back in the
late 1700s, champagne was cloudy.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.460
Champagne was cloudy. That's why
the champagne glasses have all the

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.150
cut facets on them,
so you obscure the cloudiness of the

00:25:51.150 --> 00:26:11.900
beverage. It was actually ugly.
It bubbled, but it was very cloudy.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:58.390
Why? Well, we need some chemistry.
To make champagne, or to make any

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:01.990
wine, you start with sugar and you
react with yeast.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:05.590
Yeast attacks the sugar,
liberating CO2, and converting sugar

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:09.190
to alcohol. And,
it's a one-stop shopping.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.790
Everything is on the grape.
The sugar is in the grape juice and

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:16.390
the yeast is in the grape skin.
So you just press it and stand back.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:36.513
OK, but there are some other
byproducts of this reaction.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:23.750
And these are various insolubles.
So, when this stuff is sitting in a

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:44.200
big barrel and CO2 is bubbling out
and alcohol is being created,

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:31.250
there is all this solid stuff that's
coming out of the grape pulp.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:50.900
And so, some of it sits to the
bottom automatically.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:38.750
And some of it is suspended.
And so, if we want to treat this

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:59.200
stuff, you've got to either use
chemical coagulants to get these

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:46.250
fine particles that are in
suspension to grow too large enough

00:26:46.250 --> 00:27:05.633
size that they'll gravity
settle. Or you siphon.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:53.330
And this is the typical way with
wines. Well, you can't siphon a

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.660
champagne or you will lose all the
bubbles because you keep the lid on

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.990
the barrel and that's what traps the
CO2. So, if you open the barrel to

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:03.320
siphon, you lose all the gas and now
you end up with flat champagne.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.660
So, up until 1800 people would just
put the stuff in a bottle,

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.990
put the cork on, trapp the CO2,
and then when you went to pour the

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:13.330
champagne, all the sediment would
come off the bottom,

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:16.660
which explains why the bottle looks
like this. It's got these deep ruts

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:37.053
so that you can keep as much of the
sludge on the bottom.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:25.160
But, it's gassing,
and this stuff gets churned up and

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:30.330
so on. By the way,
while I'm talking about this,

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:35.490
I can't do this without teaching you
how to chill champagne using heat

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:40.660
transfer. So: how not to chill
champagne. How not to do it: this

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:45.830
is how most people do it,
but you're 3.091ers, so you know how

00:27:45.830 --> 00:28:03.660
not to do it. You do not
simply put ice on it.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:59.560
This is lousy heat transfer because

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.680
what do we have here?
Here's the glass of the bottle and

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.810
here's chunks of ice.
So this is probably, I don't know,

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.930
-5¡C, and there's all this air in
here. And, the air is at room

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:12.050
temperature. So,
this is sloppy. So what should we

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:15.180
do instead? Will we are going to do
instead is we're going to use the

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.310
ice-water phase diagram.
We are going to flood this with

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:21.430
water. And now,
I'm going to have intimate liquid

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:25.750
solid contact.
And this thing will be thermostatted

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:31.250
(sic) at 0¡C because that you know
from the P-T diagram.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:40.766
That's where it is.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:47.350
And that's how you chill anything.
You chill your soda, your fruit

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:51.700
juice, heat transfer.
So, she had the idea: how are we

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:56.050
going to get rid of all this sludge?
She says, turn the bottles upside

00:28:56.050 --> 00:29:00.400
down. And in fact she knew the
optimum angle was 45¡.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.760
And then, have people turn the
bottle so that the sludge spirals

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:09.110
its way down into the underside of
the plug of the bottle.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:13.460
And, this is called remuer,
to turn. And, there are people that

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:17.820
spend their lives doing this,
quarter turn, quarter turn, quarter

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:36.040
turn, quarter turn.
And then you say,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
well, that's really dumb.
How is she going to get the sludge

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
out from underneath the cap of the
bottle? Well,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
look at this phase diagram.
If you mix salt with water,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
you get a brine that freezes at
-21¡C. And, if you intersect that

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
with the phase diagram of alcohol
water, there is about 10% alcohol in

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
champagne. That will freeze at a
temperature a little bit higher.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
So, what will happen is you will
make an ice plug in the neck of the

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
bottle by immersing the bottle
upside-down in brine.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:57.410
So, it's the marriage of this and
the knowledge of the phase

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:00.820
separation in the liquidus regime.
You form solid ice starting at 0¡C.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.230
So, you form an ice plug here in
the neck of the bottle.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:07.640
And then, all you do after the ice
plug has formed,

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.050
what you can do is turn this right
side up. You undo the cork.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:14.460
It heats from the outside in.
As soon as you get a skim coat of

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.880
water on the outside,
the pressure blows the cork out,

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.290
takes all the sludge. You quickly
recap it, and now you have

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:24.930
clarified champagne.
And that's how every bottle of

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:28.810
champagne is made to this day thanks
to her invention.

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:32.680
It's positively brilliant.
So, here's the summary of it.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.550
You contain the lees in the plug of
ice just before disgorgement and let

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:40.430
this go. Now,
the French are very traditional.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:44.300
They still have people turning
quarter turn, but there are a few

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:48.180
wineries that have given in to
mechanization.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.060
And they have this large device
that actually shakes all the bottles

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:56.630
that are set at 45¡ angles.
And they call this gyropalette.

00:30:56.630 --> 00:31:01.900
In the California champagne
wineries, they also have such a

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:07.180
thing. It's called VLM,
which stands, I kid you not,

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:12.450
this is California, very large
machine. [LAUGHTER] Dude,

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:17.720
very large machine, dude. All right,
so if you understand this phase

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:35.106
diagram you know what's
going on in here.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:26.040
All right, now let me say a few
words about the final exam.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:29.080
I'm going to let this thing chill,
and then what I'm going to do, I'll

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.120
make a few personal observations.
Once I open that bottle, the class

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.160
is over. So that's the way it's
going to work.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.210
Right, so the final exam is on the
15th in the morning,

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:41.250
Johnson Athletic Center.
Be there at nine o'clock.

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:44.300
Don't show up late. Three hours:
but not three times the work of a

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.340
monthly test. Intensive coverage
since test three,

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.380
and extensive coverage of everything
else. You get one aid sheet,

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.430
not one and a half, not two, one.
One 8.5 x 11, bring your periodic

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:56.470
table, your table of constants,
calculator, and something to write

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.750
with.
So, there's the five items: aid

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:03.250
sheet, periodic table,
table of constants, calculator,

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.750
and pen, always the same five items.
I'm not going to do anything

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:10.250
different from the monthly tests,
about comparable difficulty. It's

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:13.750
redemptory. I want you to pass.
You got to show me you've learned

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.250
something. Read the entire exam,
show your work, solve algebraically,

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.750
try not to waste time on
intermediate calculations.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:24.250
Remain confident; don't give up
because you feel your first couple

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.780
of questions aren't going your way.
Just stay there.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:31.360
You've paid your price of admission.
Sit there for three hours.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.940
It's warm. Academic honesty:
there's going to be 600 of us in the

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:38.520
Johnson Athletic Center.
Keep your eyes on your own work.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.100
I do not want to have any episodes
involving academic dishonesty.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.680
And, believe me, several years ago
I had a couple fellows that decided

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.260
that the strength of two is greater
than one. And,

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.830
I ended up having to bring him
before the committee on discipline,

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:56.410
which took a huge amount of my time,
which I was not happy about, and one

00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:16.353
of those people did not return for
his sophomore year.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:33:03.810
It's a dumb price to pay for a class
that's a pass-no-record class.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:07.630
Do your best, but do your own.
Overall grade scheme is based on

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:11.450
many factors including trends.
So, those of you who have a hard

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:15.270
time at the beginning,
if I see an emergence, and I'm not

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:19.090
saying you have to write a 95 on the
final to compensate for

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:22.590
a 30 on the first test.
But if I see that you've made the

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:25.770
effort, and learning is happening,
your TA can vouch for you, I'm

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.950
inclined to pass you.
Look, if I take the batteries out

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:32.130
of this watch,
it's right twice a day.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:35.310
Give me something to point to.
Give me some thing to point to.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:38.490
But you can't tell me that you
understood the material but you

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.680
never passed one thing.
And if you're going to pass one

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.860
thing, I'd recommend it be the final.
And, by the way,

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.040
I'm looking at the other trend,
too that if I see people who think

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.220
that, hey, I only need a two on the
final and I'll get a 50,

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:54.400
and you somehow don't make the 50
even though you had a passing grade

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.730
going on the final, you're gone.
You are gone because that says to me

00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:01.190
you gave up; you stop learning at
around Veterans Day.

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:04.660
So, I think it's brinkmanship to
decide you're going to go on the

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:08.130
final and maybe just answer one or
two questions and leave.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:11.590
But, I leave the choice up to you.
I don't tell people how to live

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:15.060
their lives, but I will make you
aware of the consequences of a

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.530
really bad final.
It doesn't look good.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:39.193
You can have your exam papers back.
We should have them graded.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
And you should have them available
to you by Friday afternoon.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Don't come and see us before then.
We are busy grading. We are busy

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
tabulating grades.
There will be a grades meeting on

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Friday morning.
We'll discuss all the cases.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
I go through everything. There's
no time limit for appeals,

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
but I assure you, if someone is
going to get a grade that's not

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
going to pass them,
I'm going to personally go through

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
that paper, make sure there's no
clerical errors,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
check the grading,
work with the TA's; we're not going

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
to fail somebody because,
gee, I thought that was a three.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:56.420
It looks like it's an eight.
Oh, too bad. No, we're going to

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:00.850
make sure it's done right.
So, we will be very careful.

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:05.280
And you can bring them back in the
regrades if you want but I will put

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.710
some security measures in place.
The practice of erasing answers and

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:14.140
rewriting them is not a smart thing
to do because what happens is,

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:18.570
you have terrible taste. You have
terrible taste.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:37.073
I'm drinking champagne.
[LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:27.760
Now, I case of champagne,
I would have said, quel finesse,

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:32.530
but this, sauvage. OK, so, to deal
with the possible eventuality that

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:37.300
somebody in a moment of weakness
might erase something,

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:42.070
we're going to indiscriminately
photocopy about 5% of the exams.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:46.840
So, if you decide you want to erase
something and bring it in and get it

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:51.610
regraded, the question you've got to
ask yourself is, do you

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:55.860
feel lucky? [LAUGHTER]
Do you? All right,

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:59.590
so this is 3.091. We've gone a long
way, you know?

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:03.330
We started a long time ago,
bonding structure and went through

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:07.060
the different types of bonding
structure properties.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.790
A lot of learning went on in this
class. Stability,

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:14.530
instability, chemical reactions,
diffusion, phase transformations,

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:18.260
and now phase diagrams. So, I want
to make a few personal observations

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:38.186
and say that you should be proud of
what you've learned.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:25.520
This was an ambitious syllabus,
and I'm convinced that people are

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.050
going to have something that they
can move on to their majors with

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:32.580
next year. Secondly,
I want to wish you much success on

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:36.110
the final. I'm not out to fail
anybody. I love to pass everybody,

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:39.640
but you've got to give me something
to point to. And I've given you as

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.170
much information as I can about how
to succeed on the final.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.700
But, if worse comes to worst and
you don't make it,

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:50.230
what's the worst thing that happens?
You are required to withdraw from

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:54.140
the Institute. So what?
Remember one thing: that no grade

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:58.420
that anybody gives you here is a
commentary on your value as a human

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:02.710
being. Look, I have no degrees from
this place. I feel great.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:06.990
The third thing I want to say is
I've been teaching at MIT for 27

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:11.280
years. This is my 27th year,
and I'd never enjoyed teaching as

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.570
much as I had this year.
You've really been a joy to teach.

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:19.850
I can't believe I said that with a
straight face. [LAUGHTER]

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:38.033
[APPLAUSE]
I want to thank my staff,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
my TA is, my tutors, administrators.
I had Hillary and Lori helping,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Professor Ballinger who subbed for
me when I had a chance to go up to

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Halifax and give a lecture about 3.
91. The audiovisual texts and the

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
fellows outside from the academic
media production group that takes

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
the videos and gets them up on the
web so that you can avoid coming to

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
class, I mean,
review what you failed to catch the

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
first time round as
you paid attention.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:55.760
And, I guess the last thing I wanted
to do before we can get to the

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.520
champagne and the course evaluation
is Dwayne Daughtry is here from my

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.290
department's academic office.
Actually, Dwayne, you're free to

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:07.050
start distributing those forms.
There is one more chemistry lesson

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:10.820
that we had to get to,
and that is, we talked about four

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:14.580
types of primary bonds: ionic,
covalent, metallic, and van der

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.350
Waals. Well, there is a fifth type
of primary bond,

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:22.110
and that's the kind of bond that's
been forming in this room

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:26.360
for the past 14 weeks.
As a bond between people,

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:31.080
and it's a very special kind of bond
because it has the property of,

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:35.810
can never be broken. And, so you
say, well that sounds kind of sappy

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:40.540
and so on. Yeah,
it does, because a student came up

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:45.270
with it. I didn't come up with it.
I've been teaching a core graduate

00:38:45.270 --> 00:39:03.606
class in materials science
for about ten years.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:53.330
I was at a conference and I saw
these two people standing.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:56.660
One of them was from industry,
and one of them I taught here at MIT.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:59.990
It was an alum.
I go up and say hello,

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:03.320
and the fellow from industry says,
hey, do you know so and so? And I

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:06.660
said, yeah, of course.
He was a student of mine at MIT.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.990
I was his kinetics professor. And,
the student says, excuse me,

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:13.330
Professor Sadoway,
it's true. You taught me kinetics,

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.660
but please don't say you were my
kinetics professor.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:35.986
You will always be my kinetics
professor.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:23.660
And I went, whoa.
[LAUGHTER] I mean,

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:27.330
he came up with that.
So, now the tables are turned,

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.990
and now it's time for you to move on.
So, I know that you're going to do

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:34.660
something remarkable in your
professional lives.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:38.330
I hope it's remarkably wonderful
and not remarkably stupid,

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:41.990
but, you know, at some point people
might ask you,

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:45.660
where did you learn your chemistry?
You'll have to say Sadoway at MIT.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:49.330
So, whether you like it or not,
I will always be your chemistry

00:39:49.330 --> 00:40:09.993
professor. And now I want to find
out what's going on inside here.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:59.800
So, first, we have to open this.
So, take the wire off, the mesh off,

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:06.590
[LAUGHTER]. Tenure means never
having to say you're

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:17.313
sorry. [LAUGHTER]

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:23.160
27 years I've been doing this.
Now, how many turns in a wire

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:29.330
basket? One, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:35.490
always six. Six turns of the wire
basket. There's Vive Clicole.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:41.660
Her image is on the top in honor.
We'll put it at a 45 degree angle

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:47.830
and turn it ever so slightly.
Beautiful. Soft, not this,

00:40:47.830 --> 00:41:05.326
vulgarity. That's what goes on in
football locker rooms.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.500
So, now, I've been waiting 14 weeks
for this. So,

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:43.000
this is the CO2 out gassing,
you know that phase diagram. It's

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.500
all about phase diagrams,
put that back on ice. So,

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:52.000
when Dom Perignon first drank
champagne, he said,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.500
I feel as though I'm drinking stars.
He's right. Okay, the class is

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.566
over. [APPLAUSE]
