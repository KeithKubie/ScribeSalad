&gt;&gt;commentator: Tonight's speaker is Professor
Ruut Veenhoven who's the Emeritus Professor

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.500
of Social Conditions for Human Happiness at
the Erasmus University of Rotterdam, which

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.810
he reminded me tonight is also the university
from where Commissioner Cruz comes from.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.810
[applause]

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.520
&gt;&gt; Professor Rutt Veenhoven: Well great.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.679
Let's start with the question what happiness
is. That's the most difficult one.

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:35.880
Once we establish that we can assess how happy
we are and grasp at what makes us happy. And

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.540
then even can give an evidence-based answer
on whether we can get happier than we are.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:52.200
Well and if we can get happier, what can policymakers
do about that? Do we have a special role next

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.480
to the psychiatrist?

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.440
So happiness; one word; many meanings.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.670
And if we use happiness in this context, it's
typically related to quality of life, which

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.439
is another word with also many meanings. And
when we speak about quality of life, we typically

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:17.460
 -- we can think of chances for a good life
and the outcomes of life. And you can be born

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:26.180
in a nice loving family, good chances and
that was a direct problem that outcomes.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.600
There are qualities in your environment; there
are qualities in yourself; and that gives

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.049
us four qualities of life which all have been
named happiness at some point. But I give

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.479
them other names: chances in the environment,
that's the livability of the environment;

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.920
chances in yourself; that's your life-ability.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.749
So the best possible life-ability is in heaven,
but some people are so neurotic, so low ability

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:07.490
that even in heaven they would be displeased
and quarrel with the angels.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.140
When turning to the outcomes of life, you
can say, "Well what is a good life?" Well

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.650
if you judge that on the contribution of your
life through the environment that is the utility

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.530
of your life, which is not the same as your
satisfaction with life.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.470
You can have a very useful life. For instance,
Florence Nightingale had a very useful life,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.170
but we know from her biography that she was
not very satisfied. Actually she was a bit

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.560
depressed.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.700
Well, policymakers typically focus on this;
this is their business. And so people want

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.610
to improve society and define quality of life
this way. People who want to improve your

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:03.180
abilities, your teacher and your psychologist,
they define quality of life and happiness

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.490
in this way.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:11.010
And well, if you ask your priest, "Father
what is a good life?" Then the priest will

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.090
probably say, "Well, what you do in God's
garden." And if you have a real priest, they

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.460
say, "Well and it's even better if you don't
have satisfaction." [laughs]

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.460
[laughter]

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:28.180
And here you see a problem. All of these meanings
are backed by institutional interests and

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.040
this is not. But you see I underlined it.
If I speak about happiness I speak about happiness

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.280
in the sense of life of satisfaction; which
begs another question because there are different

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.320
kinds of satisfaction.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.970
There's partial satisfaction, satisfaction
with life as a whole, and passing and enduring,

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.750
which give these four which also have been
named happiness.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.420
And there is the partial passing pleasure:
the glass of wine, the sensoric pleasure.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.660
And this lecture, I hope, intellectual pleasure.
[laughs]

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.660
[laughter]

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.850
But it's passing. [laughs]

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.620
There's also partial domain satisfaction:
satisfaction with your job; satisfaction with

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.150
your country, which is not the same as life
satisfaction. And some people are very satisfied

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.099
with their job; and work all weekends; then
discover some day that the spouse has gone

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.039
and they're still very satisfied with their
job, but not with their life.

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:36.259
Here we have another thing called happiness.
When poets talk about happiness, they typically

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:42.520
talk about that one sublime moment where they
had an oceanic feeling.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.680
And there is passing experience of life as
a whole, also called happiness, but not the

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.150
same as life satisfaction. And actually there's
a negative relationship.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.430
People who experience these talks, are open
for these talks, are typically not the ones

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.580
who enjoy life as a whole.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.300
You see I underlined it. If I speak about
happiness, I speak about happiness in the

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.770
sense of life satisfaction, enduring satisfaction
with life as a whole.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:22.460
It appears also from research that happiness
is beneficial. Happy people are more active;

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.360
they are more sociable; they are even better
citizens in political sense. They pay their

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.729
taxes more, they read the newspapers more,
they vote more, they don't drive fast.

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.819
[laughter]

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:43.999
And what is behind, and well, the most interesting
thing is that they live longer. And they really

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:49.060
live longer. The effect of being happy or
not on how long you live is comparable to

00:05:49.060 --> 00:06:00.259
smoking or not. Why is that? Well, basically
it is because if you feel happy that is because

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:07.520
your needs are gratified and it means that
as an organism biologically you're [trifling].

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.909
And well [trifle] organisms tend to be healthier
and then to be more active.

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:21.759
And then in the case of the health effects,
which is mostly in that there is a lower chance

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:32.059
that you fall ill. If you're chronically unhappy
that triggers the fight/flight system, and

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:38.800
well if that takes years, then you're more
susceptible for flu. And that's why unhappy

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.740
people die earlier.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.909
And so in that respect I would say that happiness
fits most of the things we want anyway. We

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:55.300
want good health, we want participation, and
it's not an alien political goal.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.949
Well that kind of happiness is something we
have in mind.

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:02.059
[pause]

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:03.569
And that's something you can simply ask.

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:06.050
[pause]

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:13.409
And you can do it with simple questions such
as this one: "Taking all together, how satisfied

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:21.789
or dissatisfied are you with your life as
a whole these days?" Always have a time reference.

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:27.999
And well, if you are very dissatisfied you
say 1, if you're very satisfied, you say 10.

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:30.419
[pause]

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:35.590
It's a very simple question, and the beautiful
thing is that it's so simple that everybody

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.909
understands.

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:45.949
In surveys, there is less than one percent
who say "don't know." So most people answer

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:51.520
this question and they answer it instantly
which means that's actually something that

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.659
is on their mind.

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:54.659
[pause]

00:07:54.659 --> 00:08:01.249
And if you use this question in well a general
population survey, you see for instance in

00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:02.249
Switzerland --

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:03.249
[pause]

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:04.369
this;

00:08:04.369 --> 00:08:05.639
[pause]

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:09.099
twenty five percent 10, 9, 8;

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:11.159
[pause]

00:08:11.159 --> 00:08:19.119
well most people in Switzerland are very satisfied
with their life. Not everybody is. There are

00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:25.669
also 4 and even people who score 1, but it's
a minority.

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:30.969
And when my colleagues, sociologists, who
earn their living in social problems when

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:35.349
they see this they are displeased. And they
don't believe.

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:36.349
[laughter]

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:44.039
And they say, "Well there's social durability."
And the [Marxists] say it's false consciousness."

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.940
[laughs]

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:52.810
But then I show another picture. The same
question, the same time, another country.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:53.810
[pause]

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.320
Here we have Zimbabwe.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.680
[pause]

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.750
Thirty percent scoring 1.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.790
[pause]

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.690
Most people below 5.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.440
[pause]

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:11.850
And yes, there are a few very happy persons,
possibly you can imagine someone --

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.290
[laughter]

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.980
And here we are talking about the people who
are still in Zimbabwe, [laughs] because a

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.589
quarter has already left the country because
it's so miserable.

00:09:23.589 --> 00:09:26.860
And so you see there is quite a difference.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.829
[pause]

00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:36.670
And well, using these distributions, you can
compute an average from 0 to 1, and we have

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.350
that here on these magnificent Google Maps.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:41.550
[laughter]

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.870
Even more beautiful than I have it here.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:48.720
So you always wanted to know how happy people
were in Kazakhstan --

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.720
[laughter]

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.720
Well 6.1.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:10:05.779
In Africa, so the lighter the color, the less
happy. So here is Zimbabwe and here is Iceland,

00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:07.930
data from before the crisis.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.880
[laughter]

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:18.089
But surprise, surprise, the data after crisis
are hardly different. They dropped from 8.2

00:10:18.089 --> 00:10:26.060
to 8. This correlates with another finding
that in rich countries you can live with economic

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:31.430
recessions. And we can live with the illnesses
of capitalism.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.430
[pause]

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:42.170
Okay, once you know to what extent people
differ, you can try to get a look at the determinants.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:49.240
In thinking about the determinants, this scheme
which I showed you, this conceptual scheme,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:55.620
makes sense because you can say, "Well how
happy people are will depend on the livability

00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:04.350
of their environment and also on their life-ability."
And in doing so, you think actually the way

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.769
biologists think about survival.

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:12.810
Because biologists, if they want to know whether
a species survives, they say, "Well there

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:20.490
must be a suitable biotope, but the animal
should also fit." And they use the term "fitness"

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.399
rather than "life-ability."

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:28.930
And in using the term "fitness" they say,
"Well you can be very able, but it should

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.340
be functional in the biotope."

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:37.880
Hey if a frog can play the violin, which is
a remarkable achievement, but it's hardly

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.260
any use. [laughs]

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.260
[laughter]

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:48.649
So our problem here is when we study life-abilities,
is to see which abilities are not only beautiful

00:11:48.649 --> 00:11:56.470
and a piece of civilization, but are also
actually functional in present day society.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:08.970
Well, if we follow this scheme it's difficult,
as yet, to get it to fit. But we can make

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:17.879
at least correlations between aspects of livability
and aspects of life-ability. And if we look

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:24.920
at the kind of society where policymakers
head -- that's their main business -- then,

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.980
for instance, you can say, "Well is there
a correlation between happiness and the differences

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.960
we see here and happiness?"

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.589
But we already see African nations are unhappy
and we know they are poor.

00:12:37.589 --> 00:12:43.449
But here you see a more systematic picture.
And here are these African nations; here is

00:12:43.449 --> 00:12:44.449
Denmark;

00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:46.220
[pause]

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.100
well here is Luxemburg, but that's black money
[laughs]

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.100
[laughter]

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:54.910
doesn't really count. This is oil money [laughs].
There's also oil money.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:13:01.010
But actually you see that there is a pretty
linear relationship. The only exception here

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:08.910
is Latin America which you see here that the
Latin Americans are happier and they are,

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.459
actually some of them are happier than the
U.S.

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:13.459
[pause]

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:19.290
And that's something you can't explain by
their wealth, because they're pretty happy

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.879
but not too wealthy.

00:13:21.879 --> 00:13:30.110
Let's look at not the amount of wealth, but
at the distribution of wealth in countries.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:36.370
And so now we are looking at income inequality.
What do you see? No correlation, yes.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.370
[laughter]

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:41.730
And this is another thing that my colleagues
find hard to believe. [laughs]

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:47.959
Actually I had a problem believing it myself
in the beginning. I thought I had made a mistake

00:13:47.959 --> 00:13:54.550
so I recalculated it; I used other indicators,
but I kept on finding the same thing.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:14:02.209
There is no correlation, which doesn't say
that income inequality doesn't affect happiness

00:14:02.209 --> 00:14:10.800
at all. But it probably means that it affects
happiness both positively and negatively.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800
[pause]

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.399
And so that in the end the effects balance
out.

00:14:15.399 --> 00:14:16.490
[pause]

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:23.029
Another thing that is quality of governments
and I think that is something that appeals

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:34.920
to you. And well here you see, here are the
African nations, miserable and very bad government.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:43.439
I use here the World Bank measurement of government
effectiveness, which is actually the technical

00:14:43.439 --> 00:14:48.899
quality of government and not so much the
democratic, but just is there a smooth bureaucracy,

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:53.350
is it responsive, is it not corrupt?

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.550
And you see there is a very strong relationship.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:56.550
[pause]

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:03.790
Well, then you can compute correlations and
then you see that good governance is up on

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:13.579
top, but very closely economic affluence and
democracy; gender equality; yes, that's positively

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:15.450
correlated, but income equality not.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:24.930
And here in this graph you see a positive
effect with state welfare, but that disappears

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.250
once you control economic wealth.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.430
[pause]

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:36.660
And this explains three-quarters of the huge
differences in happiness around the world

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.339
which you see here.

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:40.339
[pause]

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:45.600
So we are pretty close in understanding why
these things differ.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.930
[pause]

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:57.459
There is what's the livability, but now the
life-ability. And now actually we move to

00:15:57.459 --> 00:16:05.509
that first diagram of Switzerland. And now
the question is: why are people within a country

00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:15.329
not equally happy? Why score some people in
Switzerland 10, but others 7 or even 1?

00:16:15.329 --> 00:16:26.209
And to make a very long story short, in modern
societies such as Switzerland, these differences

00:16:26.209 --> 00:16:30.660
which you have seen are about 30 percent – it's
genetic.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.920
[pause]

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:41.259
Which doesn't say that the happiness as such
is genetic, but that things that predispose

00:16:41.259 --> 00:16:49.560
to the abilities required for getting happy
are genetic; part is physical health, a big

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.590
part is mental health.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:54.209
[pause]

00:16:54.209 --> 00:16:59.439
Even in countries like Switzerland, you can
have good or bad luck. And so in such countries

00:16:59.439 --> 00:17:07.140
good or bad luck explains 10 percent. In Zimbabwe
it's probably 40 percent.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.940
[pause]

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:20.390
Social position, the concern of my colleagues,
sociologists, is actually very small. And

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:27.140
social economic position, how much money you
have, how high you are on the social ladder,

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.520
explains less than five percent; most is in
social networks.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.760
[pause]

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.220
Now this is what we know fairly well.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.330
[pause]

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.330
Here are my guesses.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.260
[pause]

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:46.140
I guess, but I don't really know, because
it's difficult to measure, that, well, part

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.789
is in learned abilities.

00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:50.360
[pause]

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:57.950
And because we live in a multiple choice society,
I think that also part is in choice.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:58.950
[pause]

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:06.980
And we are happy in these countries actually;
this whole Western world. But in that situation,

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:11.980
your happiness depends on whether you make
the right choices; have the partner that really

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:15.890
fits you and not the partner that fits the
preference of your mother,

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:20.230
[laughter]

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.770
which a problem in Japan.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.570
Now to the question: is greater happiness
possible?

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:32.290
And then there are a lot of theorists who
say, "No, that's not possible."

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:35.529
But now we can test these theories.

00:18:35.529 --> 00:18:43.130
One theory is a favorite theory by psychologists,
most of which are in the business of measuring

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:50.460
traits, and they say everything is a trait
and happiness is also a trait. And, genetically,

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:57.010
you're more or less predisposed to be so happy.
And in the first year, if your mother mistreats

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:00.060
you, too bad -- you will be unhappy for the
rest of your life.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.110
[pause]

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:10.110
So according to this theory, even if you create
a better society, everybody will remain as

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.809
depressed as they were before.

00:19:11.809 --> 00:19:20.720
Another theory, and quite common among economists,
is that happiness is a matter of comparison.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:26.960
And that you are happier if you are doing
better than the Jones'. And according to this

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.440
theory, you can make people happy by depraving
the Jones'.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.440
[pause]

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:39.480
Comparison theory; and according to this theory
there is no sense and this is also the hedonic

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.840
treadmill theory.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:48.179
But there's also a theory that says, "Well,
humans have innate needs. We want food, we

00:19:48.179 --> 00:19:56.590
want sex, we are social animals. We want contacts
and like all animals, we also have an innate

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:03.279
need to use our potentials." Some people call
that the need for self-actualization.

00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:10.380
And according to that theory, well, if a society
fits these human needs, then they are happier;

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.830
actually also live longer.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.690
Well that's the theories. What are the facts?

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:17.690
[pause]

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:24.750
Well the facts are, first of all, that some
countries are much happier than the others.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:30.310
Still you could say, "Well Russian unhappiness,
its Russian genes or at least that they drink

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:38.870
too much vodka. But you see even Russian happiness
is not a stable cultural trait because they

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:46.780
got much less happy during the ruble crisis
and they're now recovering pretty well.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.440
[pause]

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:55.860
And, actually, if we look in Europe other
countries and we compare the first Euro barometer

00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:04.210
then with the one in 2006, then we see that
the Italians gained about one full point.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.299
Okay, they started pretty low [laughs]

00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:07.299
[laughter]

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:13.460
but still there's no immutable trait. And
even the Danes who are the champion, they

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:19.299
are the happiest country in the world, but
they still in the last 38 years gained half

00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:25.350
a point. And Belgium is a strange thing.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.350
[laughter]

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.990
I think someone has messed up the data. [laughs]

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.990
[laughter]

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.990
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [unintelligible]

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:38.029
&gt;&gt;Professor Ruut Veehoven: Yeah. Well actually
Flemish in Flanders is happier than Valognes

00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:44.919
and that is typical in the whole European
pattern. From north to south, happiness sinks.

00:21:44.919 --> 00:21:48.179
Sun rises, happiness sinks.

00:21:48.179 --> 00:21:49.380
[laughter]

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:54.929
Okay, so it's possible to get happier than
we are. And what can policy makers do?

00:21:54.929 --> 00:21:57.110
[pause]

00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:02.710
Well, they can improve the livability of the
environment which is their prime job, but

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:10.179
they could also improve the life-ability of
individuals at least indirectly. If we do

00:22:10.179 --> 00:22:18.390
it this way then you can focus on society
as a whole, but you can also focus on institutions

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.260
in societies.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:27.100
Let's first look at society as a whole. And
well, what we have seen that you should invest

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:33.990
in good governance, democracy, and gender
equality because that are the strong predictors,

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:41.919
and not in income equality. Too bad for the
Socialists and even the welfare state doesn't

00:22:41.919 --> 00:22:52.130
really add. Which is not to say that income
inequality is not unfair and so, for other

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:57.529
reasons, you can say, "Well I want to reduce
income inequality" and because it doesn't

00:22:57.529 --> 00:23:03.929
hurt happiness, I can do my ideal." But if
you focus on happiness in the first place,

00:23:03.929 --> 00:23:10.289
you should seek it here. And I guess nobody
is against good governance.

00:23:10.289 --> 00:23:11.640
[pause]

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:19.470
But what you can also do is focus on more
livable institutions and I'll take the example

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.679
of care homes.

00:23:21.679 --> 00:23:23.070
[pause]

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:32.039
Because what is the product of a care home?
Well, that is few happy life years. If you

00:23:32.039 --> 00:23:39.890
look for a good care home for your dementing
mother, what do you see? Well you see a nice

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:47.029
building, you are received, you have nice
prints and advertisements, but you don't really

00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:55.370
know how long and happy the people live there.
The quality assessment of these kind of institutions

00:23:55.370 --> 00:24:02.830
is very much dictated by professional interests:
so how well the staff is paid; how many hands

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:11.220
there are on the bed; whether the right procedures
are followed; but not how the patients feel.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.919
[pause]

00:24:12.919 --> 00:24:18.150
And because there is no measurement of that,
there's no competition. And competition is

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:24.340
rather on the marketing rather than on the
product. Well and I think that is something

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:32.000
that politicians can change. And that they
can create, well, more visibility in the market.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.269
And that's not only the case with care homes,
but that's also the case with schools.

00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:37.529
[pause]

00:24:37.529 --> 00:24:43.980
If you look for a good school for your children
you also would like to know whether they have

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:50.700
a good time there and whether they learn also
the abilities that will give them a happier

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.140
life later.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:25:00.700
So I think if politicians press for happiness
monitoring, this will enable citizens to make

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:06.169
more informed choices. I would say if you
would strengthen the life-ability of individuals;

00:25:06.169 --> 00:25:09.480
invest in preventive mental health care.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:15.809
I've just done a study and looked at the size
of the mental health budget in the health

00:25:15.809 --> 00:25:22.890
budget, and I found a sizeable correlation.
So this really works.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:27.769
Another option is invest in professional life-coaching.

00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:33.279
And lastly this is a project where I am involved
 -- is support life choices.

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:40.780
We do a large scale follow up study which
now covers 30,000 people on the Internet.

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:49.720
We follow how happy they are and we follow
what happens when they make choices. For instance,

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.490
having a child or taking earlier retirement
 --

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:55.230
[pause]

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:58.029
or moving to Brussels.

00:25:58.029 --> 00:26:04.220
And what we want to see in the long run, and
it will take about 10 years, is what kind

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:10.450
of people get happier from having a child
and what kind not. We know that most people

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:15.050
get less happy when they get children. You
lose about half a point. [laughs]

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:16.050
[laughter]

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:18.200
But that's the average.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.200
[laughter]

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:25.070
You would like to know how it works out for
people like you. What is your risk?

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:31.980
Likewise, some people who take early retirement
get depressed; other people who flourish.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:38.140
For the case of greater happiness, you shouldn't
invest in schooling because there is no correlation

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:45.250
with level of education. Actually university
educated people tend to be slightly less happy.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:50.760
[laughs] And also not a correlation at all
with I.Q.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.000
[pause]

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.549
Conclusion. Greater happiness is possible
and it can be achieved at three levels: the

00:26:57.549 --> 00:27:03.730
macro level of society, for instance, better
governance; the meso level of organizations;

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:11.140
and the micro level of individuals. And in
each gauge, effect-research is required.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.140
And that's it.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:21.200
Well most of this wisdom comes from the World
Database of Happiness where I gather well

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:28.070
all scientific research on happiness and present
the findings in an easy or viewable way.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:31.090
The map you saw is but a part of this World
Database of Happiness.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.270
[applause]
