fine but that's a good illustration of
 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.040
fine but that's a good illustration of
this issue with regards to truth and

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050
this issue with regards to truth and
 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.870
this issue with regards to truth and
success in the strange land because I

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880
success in the strange land because I
 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.029
success in the strange land because I
was in the strange land when I was

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039
was in the strange land when I was
 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:59.529
was in the strange land when I was
talking to my neighbor my landlord and

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539
talking to my neighbor my landlord and
 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:03.339
talking to my neighbor my landlord and
and I managed to say what was true

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349
and I managed to say what was true
 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:05.499
and I managed to say what was true
carefully enough so despite the fact

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:05.509
carefully enough so despite the fact
 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:08.080
carefully enough so despite the fact
that he was a very violent person and

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090
that he was a very violent person and
 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.839
that he was a very violent person and
that he was a very intoxicated person

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:10.849
that he was a very intoxicated person
 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:12.820
that he was a very intoxicated person
and then he had every reason to be

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830
and then he had every reason to be
 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.649
and then he had every reason to be
suspicious of me and we couldn't

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:14.659
suspicious of me and we couldn't
 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:16.959
suspicious of me and we couldn't
communicate very well and I didn't do

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:16.969
communicate very well and I didn't do
 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:21.640
communicate very well and I didn't do
what he wanted that he took it and he

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650
what he wanted that he took it and he
 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.670
what he wanted that he took it and he
left and there was no problem and life

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680
left and there was no problem and life
 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.499
left and there was no problem and life
went on just fine after that and so we

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:29.509
went on just fine after that and so we
 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:31.600
went on just fine after that and so we
don't want to underestimate the utility

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610
don't want to underestimate the utility
 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.019
don't want to underestimate the utility
of establishing this bounded

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:35.029
of establishing this bounded
 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.990
of establishing this bounded
relationship with the ideal and

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000
relationship with the ideal and
 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.119
relationship with the ideal and
attempting to live

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:39.129
attempting to live
 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:42.029
attempting to live
with some nobility in truth while aiming

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039
with some nobility in truth while aiming
 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:44.399
with some nobility in truth while aiming
at the highest ideal there's nothing

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:44.409
at the highest ideal there's nothing
 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:48.499
at the highest ideal there's nothing
about that that's anything but

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:48.509
 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:52.439
strengthening and positive and it's

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:52.449
strengthening and positive and it's
 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:56.129
strengthening and positive and it's
exactly what you need to set against the

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:56.139
exactly what you need to set against the
 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:00.029
exactly what you need to set against the
catastrophe and uncertainty of life
