00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
So I went down to one of the  local firework store and I found this thing. This is a pull tab smoke grenade

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.120
Now, normally you would light your fireworks by holding an open flame to a fuse but not with this thing. You just pull the string, it automatically lights the fuse and smokes for about a minute.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.260
So for this video I thought why don't we try taking some of the matchbook fuse lighters we made in a previous video and try making some improvised smoke grenades of our own.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:30.300
Now most smoke generating compositions are made with potassium chlorate which I don't have right now. So for this experiment i'm going to go back to my solid state rocket fuel we made in a previous video.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.720
This stuff is basically a mild solid state rocket fuel which burns very very vigorously but I think it will still be a good proof of concept of what we are trying to do here today.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.760
I spent a little bit of time this morning putting together some new pyrotechnic pull tabs

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.760
And I made one small modification. If you look down here on the bottom, you can see there is a knot in the end of the fuse as well

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.960
And that is because the composition we are going to be using is going to be cast which means we are going to pour it into a tube and let it set.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.220
as the composition sets it'll grab on to that knot

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.780
making it very difficult for that

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.320
fuse to come out when we tug on our

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.940
igniter. I'm not going to spend a lot of time

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.590
telling you how this composition is made

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.030
you already know that from another video

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.280
But it's a 60:40 mix of potassium nitrate

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.380
and sugar. let's get cooking!

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.860
update guys our composition is

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.000
thoroughly mixed we're just about ready

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.680
to put it on some heat and melt it down

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.600
and caramelize it. But before we do

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.800
that it's a good idea to have some

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.390
simple containers we can pour our

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.890
composition into before it's fully

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.540
melted and this is what I just threw

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.700
together. I started off with the handle

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.320
of a broom and disconnected it from the

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.880
broom head then took a piece of printer

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.290
paper and wrapped it around the handle a

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.060
few times until it was nice and tight.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.770
I taped that off to keep the tube together

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.300
and then slowly pull it off the end of

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.800
the handle and you can see that gives us a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.720
nice long tube. From there I simply took

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.160
a pair of scissors and snipped it up

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.630
into different lengths and then tips of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.280
hot glue and glued it to a cardboard

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.770
base. It is pretty thin paper so I'm not

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.720
exactly sure how well they'll hold up

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.040
but we're going to find out aren't we!

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.700
All right let's turn up the heat

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.560
starting to look delicious like pie

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.040
there we go starting to get to a workable consistency.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.880
so our rocket fuel is melted down into a

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.569
nice gooey consistency that looks a lot

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.980
like peanut butter and we've got our

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.420
tube set and standing by so let's go

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.950
ahead and pour the mixture in

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.300
and set our fuse !

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.360
so let's let this cool down in the fridge for a minute

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.420
I've got a lot of this stuff left over

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.700
so just for kicks I'm gonna try

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.980
pouring this into a glass

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.560
hope the glass doesn't break though

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.100
beautiful it's very

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.180
pretty! That right there is what I call

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.670
an energy drink! So looking back on the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.379
situation I think I mixed up way too

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.700
much to begin with. I should have done

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.379
this in smaller batches and poured

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.090
smaller amounts. this is a very flammable

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.769
pyrotechnic material and I got it

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.620
everywhere! Do NOT do what I just did!

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.620
dang you can see how that's crystallized

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.079
like candy! I'm literally chiseling

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.140
rocket fuel off my workbench. Kind of

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.280
looks like peanut brittle.

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.000
It's got a bit of a bite to it. Let's check this out guys

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.440
surprisingly our paper tubes held up I

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.209
made quite a bit of a mess but the paper

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.459
tubes themselves did hold up now a lot

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.600
of these are still really really warm

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.739
I've had been sitting in the fridge for

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.480
20 minutes to cool down but they're

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.440
still going to need a little bit of

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.750
extra time to fully set so we're going

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.130
to light these off tomorrow but before

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.660
we do I'm going to cut the cardboard so

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.639
it forms individual pyrotechnic tubes

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.709
that we can light off one by one. And we

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.239
even refilled the tube for the actual

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.040
smoke grenade itself so we can put that

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.230
together and light it off as well.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.459
And with all the stuff we had left over I

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.049
just poured into a glass stuck a

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.400
pull fuse in the top we're going to light

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.750
this sucker off with the rest of them

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.700
tomorrow. So is this idea even going to

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.810
work at all or did we just spend the

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.190
whole morning rigging up a system that's

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.959
going to be a complete fail. I'm just as

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.970
curious to know as you are so until we

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.440
find out thanks for joining me for this

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.789
video guys so i'll be looking for you in the

next one! talk to you then you know that

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.250
lingering sensation it's like my finger hurts oh

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.550
it's on fire don't worry I'm not going

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.840
to leave you empty-handed we still got

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.000
all those scraps we gotta go burn here we go!

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.500
here it goes

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.320
Hahaha! And that right there is how we do the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.740
dishes king of random style. Yeah! Hey
