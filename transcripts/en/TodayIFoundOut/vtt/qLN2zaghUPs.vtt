00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.860
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.420
In the video today, we're looking at why it
is that witches are so commonly depicted flying

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.740
broomsticks.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.070
You may have heard that the reason witches
are commonly depicted flying on broomsticks

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.070
is to get high!

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.189
But more than just a corny joke, this is essentially
true.

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.070
It's thought the idea of witches flying around
on broomsticks came from the practice of concocting

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.710
hallucinogens, and then using a broomstick
to administer the drug to certain sensitive

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.150
regions, thereby bypassing some of the negative
side effects these hallucinogens cause when

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.150
taken orally.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.649
But let’s backup a little.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.120
Until quite recently, rye was the primary
grain from which bread was made.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.710
Susceptible to a disease known as ergot, caused
by the fungus, Claviceps purpurea, rye was

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.210
so commonly infected with it that until the
1850s, people thought the purple ergot that

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.809
grew on the rye was actually a part of the
plant.

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.670
Notably, ergot contains a number of compounds
including some hallucinogens.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.199
Thus, when a supply of rye became contaminated
with ergot, those who consumed it sometimes

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.750
also got a strong hit of the LSD-like fungus.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.930
Not everyone who experienced ergot poisoning
minded, and in fact many people, including

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.980
women, actively worked with a variety of plants
for the express purpose of inducing hallucinations.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.520
Popular plants experimented on included several
tropane alkaloids like henbane, jimsonweed,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.080
mandrake, and nightshade.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.580
Together, these intrepid researchers discerned
a variety of poisons that, in lesser quantities,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.400
could produce a desirable hallucinogenic effect.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.650
Most of these hallucinogens also produced
unwanted side effects when ingested, including

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.390
rash, nausea and vomiting.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.700
Fairly early on, the pioneers of getting high
realized they could bypass this discomfort

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.330
by simply absorbing the drug through the skin.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.400
Many well-respected members of society were
investigating the properties of these potions,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.640
including court physician Andres De Laguna,
who in the 16th century studied such a substance

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.990
after taking it from the home of a woman accused
of being a witch.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.240
He then tested it on another woman with the
following result: "No sooner did I anoint

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.390
her than she opened her eyes wide like a rabbit,
and soon they looked like those of a cooked

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.610
hare when she fell into such a profound sleep
that I thought I should never be able to awake

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.610
her...

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.910
However ... after the lapse of thirty-six
hours, I restored her to her senses and sanity."

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.430
He also revealed that the substance was composed
of "soporific herbs such as hemlock, nightshade,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.590
henbane, and mandrake," and that the woman
was not at all pleased about being woken up.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.230
She reportedly said, "Why did you awaken me…
at such an inauspicious moment?

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.170
Why I was surrounded by all the delights in
the world."

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.200
Laguna then noted that, "From all this we
may infer that all that those wretched witches

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.030
do and say is caused by potions and ointments
which so corrupt their memory and imagination

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.040
that they create their own woes, for they
firmly believe when awake all that they had

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.280
dreamed when asleep."

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.500
Yet another account by Giovanni Della Porta
in the 16th century also affirmed that the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.750
application of this witches salve had the
result of a woman he saw use it adamantly

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.150
claim that "she had passed over both seas
and mountains."

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.470
Back to the absorption method- it was quickly
discerned that two of the most effective places

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.820
on the body to rub an ointment for maximum
hallucinogenic effect were the mucus areas

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.440
of the genitals and sweat glands of the armpits.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.140
This topical means of drug delivery gave rise
to thicker potions, balms and salves.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.120
For ladies who wished to partake, since brooms
were readily available, it was a no-brainer

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.020
to dip a broom handle into the ointment, and
then straddle it.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.700
Contemporary accounts indicate that as the
balm began to have its effect, riding the

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.410
broom became even more fun.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.440
For instance, Raphael Holinshed noted concerning
the accused witch, Lady Alice Kyteler, in

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.050
1324: "In rifleing the closet of the ladie,
they found a pipe of ointment, wherewith she

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.490
greased a staffe, upon which she ambled and
galloped through thick and thin."

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.569
In a 15th century account, Jordanes de Bergamo
notes, "But the vulgar believe, and the witches

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.400
confess, that on certain days or nights they
anoint a staff and ride on it to the appointed

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.400
place or anoint themselves under the arms
and in other hairy places."

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.100
Confessed witch Antoine Rose claimed that
it was the Devil who gave her the concoction

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.810
and that to use it, she would, "smear the
ointment on the stick, put it between her

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.900
legs and say ‘Go, in the name of the Devil…!’"

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.020
So how did we get from salve covered broomsticks
to flying around on them?

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.580
After all, most of the early artwork depicting
witches and their broomsticks tends to just

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.110
show them on the ground and using the broomsticks
(often in the nude) as previously described.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.470
In the 16th century book On Witchcraft, Johann
Weyer noted that once one of these ointments

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.599
was applied to the genital area, it produced
"a sensation of rising into the air and flying,"

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.730
which caused many to believe this was done
in order to "meet for devil worship...."

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.980
About a century earlier, in 1453, the French
male witch Guillaume Edelin confessed to this

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.570
practice of flying on broomsticks, including
mentioning watching his "aged mother straddle

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.560
a broomstick and whisk up the chimney and
out of the house."

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.340
Needless to say, in this instance his aged
mother likely wasn't the only one partaking

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.530
in the hallucinogens.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.440
And, as Andres De Laguna noted, people under
the influence of these drugs seemed to firmly

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.210
believe what they were seeing in their hallucinations
was real, even after it was all over.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.040
This "rising" effect mirrors the more modern
exploits of Gustav Schenk, who described his

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.920
experience with one of the seemingly common
witches flying ointment ingredients, henbane,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.880
in the 1960s: "I experienced an intoxicating
sensation of flying . . . I soared where my

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.070
hallucinations . . . were swirling along."

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.910
He didn't say how the drug was administered,
or whether or not a broom was involved...
