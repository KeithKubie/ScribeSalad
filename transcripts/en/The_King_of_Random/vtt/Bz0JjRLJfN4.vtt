00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.260
For this project I’m going to show you how
to quickly and easily make a set of Sky Balls.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.200
They’re called Sky Balls because if you
throw, or launch one high into the air, you’ll

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.519
see a little parachute opens up, bringing
them safely back to the ground. Which might

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.079
add a whole new dimension, to the fun you
can have outdoors.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.300
Let’s start this project with a pack of
latex party balloons. It’s nice to have

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.640
a variety of different colors, and I found
a bag of 25 at the dollar store.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.890
We’re also going to need some rice, and
a small plastic parachute. These parachutes

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.550
are made from dollar-store tablecloths, and
I ended up with 8 of them, for about $1. So

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.650
watch for how to make these in another project
video.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.820
Now the construction of our Sky Balls are
going to be very similar to the Ninja Balls

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.510
we made in another video. You’ll probably
remember in that project, we used balloons

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.700
and flour to make a batch of seamless, superhero
stress balls, that are customizable and fairly durable.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.930
Now, we’ll be making our Sky Balls pretty
much the same way, but instead of flour and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.720
juice bottles, this time let’s try
rice, and a 2 oz baby bottle. And if you don’t

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.300
have rice, you could use popcorn kernels,
sugar, or just anything else you can think of.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.760
Now one bottle, full of rice, is all we need,
and you should find the mouth is the perfect

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.860
size for making the transfer.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.560
Ok, let’s dig through our pile of balloons
for one white balloon, and 3 others, the same color.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.780
Blow up a green one and twist the end so the
air doesn’t leak out, then stretch the mouth

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.510
over the top of the bottle. Turn everything
upside down, you should be able to see all

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.240
the rice flowing out of the bottle, and dropping
into the bottom of the balloon.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.250
Give the bottle a little shake, then pinch
the neck of the balloon and carefully pull

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.650
it off. If you slowly and carefully let all
the air out, then tie a knot in the neck to

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.909
seal the rice inside, you should end up with
a cool little squishy ball.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.240
Now to make it a little tougher it’s a good
idea to add at least 2 more layers for durability,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.740
so go ahead and cut the excess off the top
of the knot, then grab another balloon and

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.590
stretch the mouth wide enough that it will
fit over the entire ball.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.939
Do it one more time, and you’ll have a simple
homemade stress ball with 3 layers of protection.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.110
And of course you can add as many layers as
you want.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.390
Now to give the balls a little character,
let’s cut 3 half circles around the edges

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.549
of a white balloon, and make a hole through
the center as well.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.540
Stretch it around the outside of the ball,
and smooth out any wrinkles, to finish it

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.080
off and make it look really cool.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.100
Alright it’s time for the squishy ball and
the parachute, to join forces.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.970
Look for the two loops at the end of the parachute
cord and carefully thread a piece of string

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.430
through both of them and tie them together.
The other end needs to be tied to the balloon

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.680
as tightly as you can, making sure the string
is attached, underneath the knot at the top.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.319
Now go ahead and cut off the excess string,
and your para-ball is finished. Ready for

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.909
you to head outside, to see if it works.

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.439
All you need to do is toss the ball high into
the air, and the parachute should open and

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.079
float gently back to the ground. I’ll show
you how to pack them so they do that, in just a second.

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.459
Now of course the tighter your pack your chute,
the longer it will take for it to open. Which

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.299
means the higher you can get them.

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.790
I spent 2 more hours and made 8 different
colored, Sky Balls, each with their own white

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.549
jackets. Which kind of makes them look like
a nest of flying Yoshi’s eggs. They’re

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.079
soft and squishy like stress balls, and the
rubber skins make them really easy to handle.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.969
Now just for fun, let’s try using a hand-held
water balloon slingshot to see just how high

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:56.719
we can get them before they open. Impressively,
you can see it does a pretty descent job.

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.689
I like this method because the slingshot is
powerful, and looks awesome. And it really

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.599
doesn’t take much effort to get the parachutes
way into the sky. But if you don’t have

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.349
one, remember that throwing the balls by hand,
can be just as fun as well.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.949
Now to pack our parachutes, simply hold them
at the top so you can pull the strings straight,

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:15.879
then squeeze all of the air out of the material.
Fold them in half, and begin rolling the parachute

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.389
up toward the ball, and when you get to the
strings, carefully wrap those around the parachute

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.819
as well. This will help keep the bundle together,
but’ll also unravel fairly easily when we throw it.

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.059
The tighter you can get your parachute, the
longer it will take for it to open, and if

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:32.159
you wrap the strings in a “cross” pattern,
it’ll add a slightly longer delay. By the

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.370
way, you’ll probably notice that your parachute
opens a lot faster when the wind is blowing

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.400
as opposed to when it’s calm outside, so
make sure you take that into account as well.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.120
If you notice the lines start twisting up
after a bad throw, it’s not hard to unravel

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.809
them, but if you want to go one step further,
try adding some elastic cord and a barrel

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:51.109
swivel, to your balloons. I found these swivel
clips in the fishing isle of a local super

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.549
center, and you can see the clips make it
really easy to untangle the lines, then clip

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.529
them back together when you’re in a hurry.

00:03:56.529 --> 00:04:00.129
To finish up, I took my kids to the park and
tried loading a ball into the Candy Cannon,

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.959
pressurized to 120 PSI with a bike pump. This
way, even my kids can shoot them sky high

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.150
with the simple press of a button.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.609
And since the parachutes only take a few seconds
to repack, they can be ready to launch again

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.219
as soon as you are.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.500
Now check this out. For one last experiment,
I went ahead an loaded all 8 of my Sky Balls,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.900
into the Candy Cannon at the same time, to
see what would happen if we fired them off at once.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.820
The result, is unexpectedly awesome. They
kind of look like a team of mini skydivers,

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.110
out for a good time.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.840
Well now you know how to use rice, balloons,
and a plastic tablecloth parachute, to make

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.610
a cool set, of high flying Sky Balls. And
chances are, you already have the materials

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.500
to make them hiding somewhere around your
house.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.920
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
project perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
