What we're gonna do tonight,

00:00:01.868 --> 00:00:03.336
Kevin and I are
gonna take you on

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:06.305 align:start size:88% position:13%
an unusual and somewhat
remarkable journey

00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:10.209 align:start size:88% position:13%
through a remarkable
place, the Grand Canyon.

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.410
But before we do that,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.579
we felt it's important

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.982
to get a little
bit of an idea of

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:18.685 line:0%
how we know each other,
and I think that might

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.452 line:0%
reveal who we are a little bit.

00:00:20.452 --> 00:00:22.121 line:0%
- Yeah, and I should say that

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:23.990 line:0%
this is probably the moment,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.592 align:start size:84% position:16%
those of you who have
come here tonight

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:28.962
expecting to get a window into

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:32.866 align:start size:97% position:3%
the sort of deep, symphonic
emotional resonance

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.201
that sets up between

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.270 line:0%
a professional
photographer and a writer,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.474 line:0%
this is the moment where I
disabuse you of that delusion,

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:43.476
because the pattern that

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.778
unfolds between Pete and
I basically consists of,

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:47.046
it's extremely simple.

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:48.681
Pete comes up with

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:51.251
an apocalyptically bad idea.

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.219
(audience laughing)

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.588 align:start size:94% position:6%
And in the course of
attempting to convince him

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:57.056
of what a bad idea this is

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:58.724
and why we should not do it,

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:00.960
he somehow, through
a mysterious alchemy

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.729 align:start size:84% position:16%
that involves
intellectual seduction

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.132
manages to drag
me into the idea,

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:08.434
and I find myself in yet
another part of the world

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:10.169
that I didn't want to be
in in the first place.

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:11.704
(audience laughing)

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:14.474 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Alright, the
first bad idea was

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.943
to convince Kevin to join me

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:19.612
in the Caucasus Mountains
in the Republic of Georgia.

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:22.749 align:start size:94% position:6%
Now, I grew up in the
mountains, I love skiing,

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.718 align:start size:88% position:13%
and this place is
where the border patrol

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:28.821
that patrols the Chechnya
border operates on skis,

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:30.289
and I was like, I want
to follow these guys,

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.191
I want to understand
this part of the world,

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:33.392
great idea.

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:34.928 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Would've been a great
idea, two problems.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.629
(audience laughing)

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:37.463
These guys were very--

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:39.198
(audience laughing)

00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:41.467
Very heavily armed.

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:42.468
Second problem was that Pete

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:44.404
didn't check the weather report.

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:47.640
(audience laughing)

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.442
And the avalanches
that resulted from

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:52.378 align:start size:94% position:6%
the massive series of
snowstorms that descended

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.747
across the Black Sea and all
of the Republic of Georgia

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.616
shut the entire country down.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.350
And we spent the next week

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.486 align:start size:88% position:13%
holed up in what
should've been a hotel,

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:02.388
except it was a bank...

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:05.758
Eating food like this.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:09.195
(audience laughing)

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:10.362
Alright, so that wasn't,

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:12.432
maybe not such a good idea.

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.833
The next idea I had

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:17.970
less guns, higher
chance of success,

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.108
was to go to the north
of Canada, to the Yukon,

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:24.310
to one of the most remote
areas up in the Arctic

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.079 align:start size:88% position:13%
to follow the
Porcupine Caribou Herd.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.015
And we had this thing dialed.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:32.485 align:start size:94% position:6%
We're gonna take the Firth
River north on rafts,

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:33.720
and we're gonna to time it,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.988
not only to see the
greatest migration

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.456
of the caribou herd
move across there,

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:39.959 align:start size:94% position:6%
but we're gonna float
with them as they travel.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.660 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah, and you'd think
that two National Geographic

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.029
journalists would
be able to locate

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.798
the Porcupine Caribou Herd.

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:49.368
(audience laughing)

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:52.538
The largest collection
of charismatic megafauna

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:55.474
on the face of North America.

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:57.309
But no, after two
weeks of searching

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.078
we did not manage to locate

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:00.880
a single live animal.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.883
(audience laughing)

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:07.553
- Alright, alright, so.

00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:08.921
Third strike, I figured,

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:10.990
this one's gonna be a home run.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.558 align:start size:81% position:19%
How could this
possibly go wrong,

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:14.060
I convinced Kevin that

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.895
there's this story on the
south side of Mount Everest

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:19.331 align:start size:88% position:13%
that is totally unusual
and it's unique,

00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:20.666
and it's not about the circus

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:22.535
of trying to get to the
top of the mountain,

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:24.437
it's about these guys

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:26.439
that live, let me get
that clicker to work,

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.074
that live inside
the Khumbu Icefall

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:30.709
and basically build the route

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.278
for everyone else to
climb the mountain.

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.213
These are the unsung heroes.

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:35.981
And they do this remarkable job

00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:38.717
of building and engineering

00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:40.752
the route through this icefall

00:03:40.752 --> 00:03:43.456
that goes from 18,000
feet to 22,000 feet.

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:44.990
This is their office,

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.326
and most people don't
know even who they are.

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:48.560
- And here's the problem,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.497
if your office looks like this,

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.766 align:start size:84% position:16%
things like this
tend to happen in it.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.201
A giant chunk of ice,

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:57.102
about the size of
an aircraft carrier

00:03:57.102 --> 00:03:59.805
may break off of a cornice,

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:02.341
plummet 600 feet onto
the top of the glacier

00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:05.044 align:start size:84% position:16%
and detonate,
creating a giant cloud

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:06.678
of vaporized ice crystals

00:04:06.678 --> 00:04:10.183
which hurdles towards you at
about a hundred miles an hour.

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:11.784
Now, at this point,

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:14.286
I'm on the left side
of this photograph

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:15.521
running for my life--

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:16.756
(audience laughing)

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:17.590
And this other guy with us

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.825
is doing the same thing,

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:20.560
it's a testament to
Pete's commitment

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.928
to the art of photography

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.197
that he managed to stand
there and keep shooting.

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:27.200
(audience laughing)

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.137 align:start size:94% position:6%
- The reality is I didn't
know what else to do,

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:32.805 align:start size:97% position:3%
I thought that the avalanche
was gonna basically

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:34.874 align:start size:94% position:6%
snuff us out, so I figured
I'd give some evidence

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:37.409
of what happened to us.

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.478
At this point, however,

00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:41.547
I basically realized
that maybe that chasing

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:43.749 align:start size:84% position:16%
these magazine stories
all over the world

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:46.986
is maybe not, maybe
we need to change,

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:49.121
maybe I'm ready to go home.

00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:51.223
And it had been a long journey

00:04:51.223 --> 00:04:52.724
and as you might detect,

00:04:52.724 --> 00:04:56.229
Kevin and I have a little bit
of a different personality.

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.730 align:start size:94% position:6%
I have a tendency, in
part, because of what I do

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.800 align:start size:84% position:16%
to look for the
light in the world,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.634 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm a photographer,
I make films,

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:04.536
I'm constantly looking for
the bright side of things,

00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:06.105
I'd say I'm more optimistic.

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:09.808 align:start size:97% position:3%
And Kevin, he sometimes
thinks a little differently.

00:05:09.808 --> 00:05:11.477
- Yeah, that would
be an understatement.

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.846
(audience laughing)

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:15.848
Look, I'm a dark person.

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:20.920 align:start size:88% position:13%
The word itself is
woven into my last name.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.421
And part of what
that means is that

00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:24.189
I sort of specialize in

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:26.225
and my ethos as a human being

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:28.394
is rooted in the idea that

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:31.130
it's necessary and important

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.332 align:start size:88% position:13%
to take the worst
possible interpretation

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:35.067
of pretty much every situation.

00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:36.769
(audience laughing)

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.170
If the sun is shining,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.906
it is raining somewhere.

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:42.341
(audience laughing)

00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:45.544
Now it's a very sort of complex

00:05:45.544 --> 00:05:48.614
psychological matrix that
I don't fully understand.

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:50.215
The simplest way I
can explain it to you

00:05:50.215 --> 00:05:52.518
is to put it into,

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.854 align:start size:97% position:3%
well, let's just put it into
terms of Winnie the Pooh.

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.023
Basically, Pete is Tigger,

00:05:58.391 --> 00:05:59.659
and I'm Eeyore.

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.628
(audience laughing)

00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:04.497
- So at this point,

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:07.433 align:start size:97% position:3%
Tigger and Eeyore basically
had a small breakup.

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:09.802
I think we had a
little fatigue of

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:12.204 align:start size:88% position:13%
going in these
misadventures together.

00:06:12.204 --> 00:06:14.473
We both returned home, I
returned home to Colorado,

00:06:14.473 --> 00:06:16.375
this is basically
my backyard river,

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:18.210 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I decided to do
something a little different,

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.545
I was getting a little tired of

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:21.413
chasing these short
magazine stories,

00:06:21.413 --> 00:06:23.448 align:start size:88% position:13%
I wanted to do something
a little longer

00:06:23.448 --> 00:06:26.552
and sink in my heels
in a little bit more.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.787
So I followed my, what I
call my backyard river,

00:06:28.787 --> 00:06:30.322 align:start size:84% position:16%
the Colorado River,
I followed it

00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:33.292
from the mountains in
the source of Colorado,

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:36.194
basically 1,500 miles
to try to understand,

00:06:36.194 --> 00:06:37.930
where does the western water,

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.699 align:start size:84% position:16%
where does this
lifeline that supports

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:42.568
40 million people
in the Southwest,

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:43.903
where does it go when
it travels through

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:45.504
this desert landscape,

00:06:45.504 --> 00:06:47.273
and what happens at the end,

00:06:47.273 --> 00:06:49.175
and does it reach the end.

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:50.776
And to my amazement,

00:06:50.776 --> 00:06:52.044
the Colorado River doesn't.

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:54.547 align:start size:84% position:16%
It gets dried up in
this place right here.

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:57.183 align:start size:97% position:3%
The Sea of Cortez a hundred
miles shy of the sea.

00:06:57.183 --> 00:06:59.318 align:start size:84% position:16%
We dried it up roughly
two decades ago,

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:01.420
it ran to the sea for
six million years,

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.754
and we turned it into

00:07:02.754 --> 00:07:06.158
basically this desert wasteland.

00:07:06.158 --> 00:07:08.127 align:start size:84% position:16%
And what I realized
at this point

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:10.062
is that there are
a lot of stories

00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:12.531
around rivers and water,

00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:15.935
that's the arteries of
our planet, so to speak,

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.170
that are getting untold.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.105
And so I became very
committed, I think,

00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:23.108
to try to document these
stories on some level.

00:07:23.108 --> 00:07:26.445
- And I may have had some
notion of your commitment

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:28.047
had I not decided that I had

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:31.550 align:start size:97% position:3%
temporarily stopped speaking
to Pete at this point,

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.019
and so I was completely unaware

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:36.054
that he was engaged
in this very sort of

00:07:36.054 --> 00:07:39.791
comprehensive project
that was focused on,

00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:40.992
as it turns out,
the very same thing

00:07:40.992 --> 00:07:42.694
that I was focused on, it's just

00:07:42.694 --> 00:07:44.463
the only difference was that

00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:47.199
I had my eye on one
particular section

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:48.434
of the Colorado River.

00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:50.102
I'm talking about
the most storied

00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:51.504
and legendary section of all,

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:55.041
the 277 miles that runs
through the Grand Canyon

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.708
in Northern Arizona.

00:07:56.708 --> 00:08:00.880
The section of river that
is defined by exceptional

00:08:02.314 --> 00:08:04.950
sections of gorgeous light

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.119 align:start size:84% position:16%
and beautiful,
beautiful tranquility,

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:10.556 align:start size:84% position:16%
punctuated by moments
of unholy chaos

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:12.658
that are known as rapids.

00:08:13.825 --> 00:08:16.262
And it's inside of those rapids

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:19.431 align:start size:84% position:16%
that some of the
real sort of savagery

00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:21.167
unfolds inside the river

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.335 align:start size:84% position:16%
and the river really
gives you an idea

00:08:23.335 --> 00:08:25.237
of how powerful it truly is

00:08:25.237 --> 00:08:27.006 align:start size:84% position:16%
and what it's capable
of doing to you.

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:28.975
(man yelling)

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:31.677
(waves crashing)

00:08:36.448 --> 00:08:38.684
- [Pete] That's you
paddling, right?

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:39.885
- That was not me paddling,

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:42.154
but there's some
truth to it because

00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:43.422
I'd become obsessed,

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:45.124
I'd become obsessed with
the world of the river,

00:08:45.124 --> 00:08:47.025
and I'd become obsessed
with the particular story

00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:48.827
attached to a particular man.

00:08:48.827 --> 00:08:50.996
This guy's name is Kenton Grua,

00:08:50.996 --> 00:08:52.898 align:start size:84% position:16%
he's a legendary Grand
Canyon river guide,

00:08:52.898 --> 00:08:56.435 align:start size:97% position:3%
in 1983, as Peter Gwin
mentioned a few minutes ago,

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:57.970
he set the speed record,

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.971
the standing speed record of
the fastest boat in history

00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:01.374
to race though the Grand Canyon,

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:04.509
but Kenton Grua had
achieved something

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:06.845
six years earlier
that was arguably

00:09:06.845 --> 00:09:08.514
an even greater accomplishment.

00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:10.616 align:start size:84% position:16%
It was an incredibly
bold vision.

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:13.685
The idea was, what
he wanted to do,

00:09:13.685 --> 00:09:15.287 align:start size:84% position:16%
was he wanted to start
at the eastern end

00:09:15.287 --> 00:09:18.557
of the Grand Canyon
and walk on foot

00:09:18.557 --> 00:09:21.059
all the way through to
the western terminus,

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:22.961 align:start size:88% position:13%
where the canyon goes
through something called

00:09:22.961 --> 00:09:25.597
the Grand Wash Cliffs and ends.

00:09:25.597 --> 00:09:28.934 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now he was following
in the footsteps

00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:30.402 align:start size:84% position:16%
of the man that
Peter just mentioned,

00:09:30.402 --> 00:09:33.705 align:start size:97% position:3%
John Wesley Powell, the
one-armed Civil War veteran,

00:09:33.705 --> 00:09:37.009 align:start size:97% position:3%
who accomplished one of
the most extraordinary acts

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:38.811 align:start size:84% position:16%
in the history of
American exploration

00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:41.046
in the summer of
1869 when he led

00:09:41.046 --> 00:09:44.183
an expedition consisting
of 10 men in four boats,

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:47.352 align:start size:88% position:13%
including himself, down
through the Colorado River.

00:09:47.352 --> 00:09:48.854
I want you to think for a moment

00:09:48.854 --> 00:09:52.458
about the 108 years,
that gap between 1869,

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:56.862 align:start size:88% position:13%
John Wesley Powell's
pioneering river voyage,

00:09:56.862 --> 00:10:01.033 align:start size:84% position:16%
1977, Kenton Grua's
first traverse through
the Grand Canyon.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.702
And I want you to ask yourself

00:10:03.702 --> 00:10:05.204
what that gap says

00:10:06.338 --> 00:10:09.108 align:start size:84% position:16%
about the brokenness
and brutality

00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:11.877
and complexity of
this landscape.

00:10:13.078 --> 00:10:14.746
It suggests that
it is a place that

00:10:14.746 --> 00:10:16.983
does not invite and indeed,

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.920
ferociously resists
human intrusion.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.559
- So I came back to
this broken landscape

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:27.826
three years ago.

00:10:27.826 --> 00:10:28.994
I was invited by
the national park

00:10:28.994 --> 00:10:32.164
to do a talk about my project on

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:33.966
the river itself.

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:37.002
And I suddenly, I had
this kind of epiphany,

00:10:37.002 --> 00:10:40.639 align:start size:97% position:3%
I hiked down into the
canyon, and I had this idea.

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:42.942 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Please don't be
seduced by the rainbow.

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:46.378
(audience laughing)

00:10:46.378 --> 00:10:49.848 align:start size:84% position:16%
Worst idea in the
history of journalism.

00:10:49.848 --> 00:10:51.951 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Alright, well that's
Eeyore saying that,

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start size:94% position:6%
but fortunately, National
Geographic agreed

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.289
that this might be a
good idea, actually.

00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:59.057
And they agreed to sponsor us,

00:10:59.057 --> 00:11:01.660
and eventually I was
able to convince Kevin

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.164 align:start size:94% position:6%
to follow in the
footsteps of Kenton Grua.

00:11:10.202 --> 00:11:11.871
I'm gonna be honest.

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:17.376
I'm not sure I really
like hiking that much.

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:19.512
With a heavy pack, no trail,

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:22.548
and no guarantee of
water, it's hard,

00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:24.550
stressful and very slow.

00:11:27.552 --> 00:11:31.189
Sure, hiking can lead to
some zen-like moments,

00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:33.425
but not so much if you're lost,

00:11:33.425 --> 00:11:35.761
really tired and dehydrated.

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:39.464
Yet there's something
about the Grand Canyon

00:11:39.464 --> 00:11:42.600
and its rocky, secret world.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.004
It is alluring, magical even.

00:11:47.439 --> 00:11:50.208
So in the fall of 2015,

00:11:50.208 --> 00:11:53.279
my friend and author
Kevin Fedarko and I

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:56.381 align:start size:97% position:3%
set out to walk the
entirety of the Grand Canyon

00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:57.883
from east to west.

00:11:59.718 --> 00:12:02.921
In order to understand the
insanity of this venture,

00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:07.093 align:start size:97% position:3%
you first have to know a
little bit about this place.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.929
In stretches, it
is 18 miles wide

00:12:10.929 --> 00:12:12.731
and over a mile deep,

00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:14.199
so deep, in fact,

00:12:14.199 --> 00:12:16.534
you could stack five
Empire State Buildings,

00:12:16.534 --> 00:12:19.238
one on top of the other inside.

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:20.973
It is 277 miles long,

00:12:22.207 --> 00:12:24.543
if you're floating
the Colorado River.

00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:27.145
But on foot, by the
time you've gone up

00:12:27.145 --> 00:12:29.982 align:start size:84% position:16%
and back down the
numerous side canyons,

00:12:29.982 --> 00:12:32.084
it's more like 700 miles.

00:12:34.686 --> 00:12:36.521
Oh yeah, and for
more most of it,

00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:37.923
there's no trail.

00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:40.392 line:0%
How far are we going?

00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:44.129 line:0%
- I don't think we've
gone five miles yet.

00:12:44.129 --> 00:12:46.197 align:start size:84% position:16%
- This is really
hard hiking, it kinda

00:12:46.197 --> 00:12:48.200
demoralizes you a little bit.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.069
- As a result, more
people have stood

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:51.803
on the surface of the moon

00:12:51.803 --> 00:12:54.306
than have completed a
continuous thru-hike

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:56.475
of the Grand Canyon.

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:58.410
Unlike those intrepid few,

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.179
Kevin and I decided to
do a sectional version,

00:13:01.179 --> 00:13:05.684
chipping off a hundred to
150-mile chunks at a time.

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:08.053 align:start size:94% position:6%
Just 30 hikers have
completed sectional lines

00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:09.654
through the park.

00:13:09.654 --> 00:13:13.392
And for some, it took
them decades to finish.

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:16.861
Tragically, others have
perished attempting it.

00:13:16.861 --> 00:13:19.398
Kevin and I would be
the first journalists

00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:23.068 align:start size:84% position:16%
ever to tackle
this hiking lunacy.

00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:26.171
We plan to complete our
mission over a year,

00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:28.140
watching the seasons change

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.643 align:start size:88% position:13%
and teaming up with
hardened canyon veterans

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:33.812
to help us find our
way and our legs.

00:13:33.812 --> 00:13:35.648
But beyond that challenge,

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:38.850
something else drew
us on this quest.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.353 align:start size:84% position:16%
Many claim the Grand
Canyon is facing

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:44.589
an unprecedented
array of pressures

00:13:44.589 --> 00:13:47.793 align:start size:84% position:16%
from all four points
on the compass.

00:13:47.793 --> 00:13:50.128
Development projects
are poised to change

00:13:50.128 --> 00:13:51.729
the integrity of
perhaps the most

00:13:51.729 --> 00:13:54.400
monumental landscape in America.

00:13:56.935 --> 00:13:59.004
And we believe walking the park

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:00.539 align:start size:81% position:19%
might give us a
unique perspective

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:02.674
on this secret world

00:14:02.674 --> 00:14:05.276
and what's at stake to be lost

00:14:05.276 --> 00:14:07.780
between the river and the rim.

00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:10.448
So like I said,

00:14:10.448 --> 00:14:11.883
I think I was quickly reminded

00:14:11.883 --> 00:14:15.020
how I don't like
hiking that much.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.355 align:start size:84% position:16%
So the real purpose
of this project

00:14:17.355 --> 00:14:19.457 align:start size:88% position:13%
from the beginning,
from the genesis of it,

00:14:19.457 --> 00:14:21.726 align:start size:84% position:16%
was to actually
shine a spotlight on

00:14:21.726 --> 00:14:22.994
what's happening in the park

00:14:22.994 --> 00:14:25.497
as it approaches its
hundredth birthday.

00:14:25.497 --> 00:14:27.298
And the reality of
what's happening,

00:14:27.298 --> 00:14:28.633
and we're gonna walk you through

00:14:28.633 --> 00:14:30.168
some of these issues,

00:14:30.168 --> 00:14:32.036 align:start size:94% position:6%
is that it is getting pressure
from all four points

00:14:32.036 --> 00:14:34.239
on the compass, from all sides,

00:14:34.239 --> 00:14:36.808
east, west, north and south.

00:14:36.808 --> 00:14:39.444
And we figured that
this walk would,

00:14:39.444 --> 00:14:41.313
basically we could
walk through it,

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:43.781 align:start size:97% position:3%
the walk would be the
backbone to talk about this.

00:14:43.781 --> 00:14:45.317
We did know when we started that

00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:47.118
alright, this was maybe

00:14:47.118 --> 00:14:48.653
a place we knew the river better

00:14:48.653 --> 00:14:50.689 align:start size:97% position:3%
than we knew the area
between the river and the rim

00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:52.124
and so we needed some help.

00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:55.627 align:start size:97% position:3%
So this guy wearing the
Star-Spangled Banner gaiters,

00:14:55.627 --> 00:14:58.731 align:start size:88% position:13%
Rich Rudow is one of
the gurus of the canyon,

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:02.167 align:start size:88% position:13%
he spent over 700
nights below the canyon.

00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:03.602
When we started I asked him

00:15:03.602 --> 00:15:06.538 align:start size:97% position:3%
what the hell were these
Star-Spangled Banner thingies.

00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:08.407 align:start size:84% position:16%
They're maybe the
most important little

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:10.275 align:start size:97% position:3%
item you can have if you're
a Grand Canyon hiker,

00:15:10.275 --> 00:15:12.877 align:start size:88% position:13%
they're these gaiters
that keep the ferocious,

00:15:12.877 --> 00:15:15.047
angry cactus and everything else

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:16.681
that wants to get into
your feet, ankles on,

00:15:16.681 --> 00:15:17.949
of course, we didn't
know what they were,

00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:21.553 align:start size:88% position:13%
so we were a little
clueless on some level,

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.089 align:start size:88% position:13%
but we basically
latched onto these guys.

00:15:25.089 --> 00:15:27.426
He agreed to let us follow them

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:30.295
on their 57-day thru-hike.

00:15:30.295 --> 00:15:33.532 align:start size:97% position:3%
They were gonna start
hiking in September of 2015

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:34.600
and not stop.

00:15:37.402 --> 00:15:40.371
- This is basically
what a special forces

00:15:40.371 --> 00:15:42.708
Grand Canyon A-Team looks like.

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:44.309
(audience laughing)

00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:46.044
The level of experience

00:15:46.044 --> 00:15:48.113 align:start size:81% position:19%
that's captured
in this photograph

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:49.648
extends back into decades.

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:51.082
These are men who spent

00:15:51.082 --> 00:15:52.450
an enormous amount of time,

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.553
they've invested time and energy

00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:56.821
learning this environment.

00:15:56.821 --> 00:15:58.857
This is what it looks
like through their eyes

00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:01.860 align:start size:97% position:3%
when two yahoos from
National Geographic show up.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.063
(audience laughing)

00:16:05.063 --> 00:16:06.998
Prepare to tie themselves

00:16:06.998 --> 00:16:08.100
onto the back of their bumper

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.169
like a couple of tin cans,

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:11.737 align:start size:84% position:16%
which raises an
interesting question,

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:14.039
why in the world
would these guys

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:16.174
allow us to come along?

00:16:16.174 --> 00:16:17.275
The answer's interesting,

00:16:17.275 --> 00:16:19.410 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it says
something about them.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.546
Their commitment to the canyon

00:16:21.546 --> 00:16:23.581 align:start size:84% position:16%
and their concern
over what's happening

00:16:23.581 --> 00:16:27.353
to this environment is
so great that basically

00:16:30.388 --> 00:16:32.257
they were aware of the fact

00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:35.294
that we were capable
of telling a story

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:38.964
that they thought was
incredibly important,

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:40.866 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they were equally
aware of the fact

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:44.870
that this environment is
so difficult physically

00:16:46.237 --> 00:16:49.508 align:start size:94% position:6%
that we would be incapable
of moving through it

00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:51.877
without their assistance.

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:55.514
And so we embarked on
this journey with them

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:58.283
starting off through the
first part of the canyon,

00:16:58.283 --> 00:17:00.819
a section known
as Marble Canyon.

00:17:00.819 --> 00:17:02.821
- And since Kevin and I had,

00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:04.322
we'd been down the
river a few times,

00:17:04.322 --> 00:17:05.757
we both rode the river

00:17:05.757 --> 00:17:08.393
successfully, unsuccessfully,

00:17:08.393 --> 00:17:10.695
I, however, had this

00:17:10.695 --> 00:17:12.231
idyllic view that we would do

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:15.667 align:start size:84% position:16%
basically a raft
trip in hiking boots.

00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:18.370
We'd be walking and we'd
enjoy the tangerine light

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:20.505 align:start size:81% position:19%
and maybe we'd
have a little swim

00:17:20.505 --> 00:17:22.107
after six hours of hiking,

00:17:22.107 --> 00:17:23.741
Kevin might pen some poetry,

00:17:23.741 --> 00:17:27.245 align:start size:88% position:13%
I might do some
time-lapse photography.

00:17:27.245 --> 00:17:28.814
Wrong.

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:30.748
We quickly started
realizing, alright,

00:17:30.748 --> 00:17:31.816
it was a little more complex,

00:17:31.816 --> 00:17:33.018
we knew it was gonna be hard,

00:17:33.018 --> 00:17:35.620 align:start size:88% position:13%
but when you start
looking at the 22 layers

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.222
of rock inside the Grand Canyon

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:39.691 align:start size:84% position:16%
and the endless
number of tributaries

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:41.159
that puncture this landscape

00:17:41.159 --> 00:17:43.028
and that you have to
walk around and leave,

00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:44.962
you quickly start
realizing like,

00:17:44.962 --> 00:17:47.366
this is no raft trip on foot.

00:17:48.466 --> 00:17:49.701 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Right, and that's
just the first

00:17:49.701 --> 00:17:51.302
of a whole series of problems

00:17:51.302 --> 00:17:54.172
that start coming at
you like a fire hose.

00:17:54.172 --> 00:17:56.207 align:start size:84% position:16%
And all of them
are rooted, really,

00:17:56.207 --> 00:17:57.943
in one basic fact, which is that

00:17:57.943 --> 00:17:59.978
there's no trail, right?

00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:02.981 align:start size:94% position:6%
And so what that means
among so many other things

00:18:02.981 --> 00:18:05.984
is that every single
step that you take

00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:07.352
in this landscape

00:18:07.352 --> 00:18:09.921 align:start size:88% position:13%
is a careful
negotiation between you

00:18:09.921 --> 00:18:11.723
and the terrain itself.

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:13.325
It's an act also
that's complicated

00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:15.260 align:start size:84% position:16%
and made infinitely
more difficult

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.063 align:start size:84% position:16%
by the heat, by
your level of energy

00:18:18.063 --> 00:18:18.996
and by the fact that you are

00:18:18.996 --> 00:18:21.332
carrying on your back 50 pounds

00:18:21.332 --> 00:18:22.968
and so when you have to perform

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:25.637 align:start size:97% position:3%
a dynamic and energy-draining
full body move

00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:27.205 align:start size:84% position:16%
in order to maintain
your balance,

00:18:27.205 --> 00:18:29.307
you do that over and over again.

00:18:29.307 --> 00:18:32.643 align:start size:84% position:16%
Minute after minute,
hour after hour.

00:18:32.643 --> 00:18:34.746
It's so destructive to the body

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:37.082
that by the end
of the first day,

00:18:37.082 --> 00:18:39.084
you basically end up
looking like this.

00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:41.152
(audience laughing)

00:18:41.152 --> 00:18:42.888
Pete, where's Tigger
at this point, huh?

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:44.823
(audience laughing)

00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:46.758
- Yeah, I think
day one, day two,

00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:51.063
Tigger crawled into a
dark cave with Eeyore.

00:18:51.063 --> 00:18:53.932
Pretty much wanted to just

00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:55.934 align:start size:94% position:6%
crawl under the cave
permanently at this point.

00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:57.469 align:start size:84% position:16%
This looks like a
nice, idyllic scene,

00:18:57.469 --> 00:18:59.838
I was expecting this,

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:01.139
sit around and tell stories

00:19:01.139 --> 00:19:03.542 align:start size:81% position:19%
under the spray
of stars at night.

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:07.011 align:start size:94% position:6%
Au contraire, this is
September, late September,

00:19:07.011 --> 00:19:09.313
an unusual heat wave rolled in.

00:19:09.313 --> 00:19:11.016
I just don't do well with heat.

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:13.952 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's 110 degrees consistently
throughout the day.

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:16.154
This is about 98 degrees,
we're trying to sleep,

00:19:16.154 --> 00:19:17.755
this is a furnace.

00:19:17.755 --> 00:19:18.990
And this is a total nightmare.

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.026
By day three or day four,

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:23.561
I'm starting to
feel really weird

00:19:23.561 --> 00:19:26.498
and sick, I'm not
thinking clearly.

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:30.134 align:start size:94% position:6%
Day four or five, I
realized we are completely

00:19:30.134 --> 00:19:31.336
in over our heads.

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:32.604
I'm not eating anymore,

00:19:32.604 --> 00:19:35.607
Kevin's having a hard
time with his ankles.

00:19:35.607 --> 00:19:37.075
We're in a bad spot.

00:19:37.075 --> 00:19:38.309
- We're in a bad spot,

00:19:38.309 --> 00:19:42.447
and most of it really
is related to the heat.

00:19:42.447 --> 00:19:44.982 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's difficult to overstate
just how difficult,

00:19:44.982 --> 00:19:47.486
just how awful 105 degrees is.

00:19:48.953 --> 00:19:49.888
But to give you an idea,

00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:51.189
one of the things it did,

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:54.392
was so hot that the
heat was literally

00:19:54.392 --> 00:19:57.528 align:start size:84% position:16%
melting the bottoms
of our shoes.

00:19:57.528 --> 00:19:59.731
And so the story of the impact

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:01.399
that that process had

00:20:01.399 --> 00:20:03.634
was written in our feet

00:20:03.634 --> 00:20:05.771
for the first couple of days.

00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:08.006 align:start size:84% position:16%
But there was another
story unfolding

00:20:08.006 --> 00:20:10.341
invisibly inside of our body

00:20:10.341 --> 00:20:12.644
that was less evident.

00:20:12.644 --> 00:20:14.379
By the third day,

00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:18.016
I had descended into
what seemed to me to be

00:20:18.016 --> 00:20:20.786
a bottomless well of
despair and death.

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:24.422
(audience laughing)

00:20:24.422 --> 00:20:26.258
And as bad as that may sound

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:27.525 align:start size:81% position:19%
what was happening
inside of Pete

00:20:27.525 --> 00:20:29.861
was far more alarming, I think.

00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:32.097 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So by day three
I'm starting to have

00:20:32.097 --> 00:20:34.766 align:start size:94% position:6%
this weird sensation,
I'm not thinking clearly,

00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:37.002
and I'm starting
to get body cramps.

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:40.372
I got to a point where my
tongue cramped and my hand,

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:43.074
I was like, this is weird.

00:20:43.074 --> 00:20:45.009
Something ain't right,
so I must be dehydrated,

00:20:45.009 --> 00:20:46.178
I wasn't peeing all day.

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:48.079 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I started consuming
a lot of water,

00:20:48.079 --> 00:20:50.114 align:start size:81% position:19%
I'm drinking salts
and serum, too,

00:20:50.114 --> 00:20:52.517
but basically, I sweat a lot,

00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:53.952
I sweated so much,

00:20:53.952 --> 00:20:56.121 align:start size:94% position:6%
I sweated all of my
natural sodium system out,

00:20:56.121 --> 00:20:57.588
and I became hyponatremic,

00:20:57.588 --> 00:20:59.358 align:start size:84% position:16%
this is the opposite
of dehydration,

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:01.392 align:start size:94% position:6%
you deplete your salt
levels so low in your body

00:21:01.392 --> 00:21:03.895
that you start to vomit water,

00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:05.230
you can go unconscious,

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.031
go into seizures
and then a coma.

00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:08.666
I was, at this point,
feeling like I was

00:21:08.666 --> 00:21:10.034
headed towards unconsciousness,

00:21:10.034 --> 00:21:12.537
we realized we gotta evacuate.

00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:15.173
So we hike out, we
call in a friend.

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:16.775
This great guy JP

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:18.610
comes in, brings
us in salty stuff,

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.079
I'm drinking soy
sauce desperately,

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:22.647
and we're able to hike out

00:21:22.647 --> 00:21:24.182
a hike that should've taken

00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:25.984 align:start size:84% position:16%
three hours in
normal temperatures,

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:26.918
under normal conditions,

00:21:26.918 --> 00:21:28.386
it took us about seven hours,

00:21:28.386 --> 00:21:31.889
we limp out and crawl
back to Flagstaff,

00:21:31.889 --> 00:21:33.958 align:start size:84% position:16%
where I get, really,
the first glance

00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:35.660
of Kevin's ankles and realize

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:39.163
that they're totally
blown out and sprained.

00:21:39.163 --> 00:21:41.432
And at this point,

00:21:41.432 --> 00:21:44.869 align:start size:97% position:3%
we're basically staring
down the barrel of failure.

00:21:44.869 --> 00:21:47.539 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I'm embarrassed
on one level,

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:50.508 align:start size:94% position:6%
these amazing thru-hikers
have us let join them

00:21:50.508 --> 00:21:53.011
and we've screwed their plan up,

00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:56.013 align:start size:94% position:6%
they kept going, but we
delayed them a little bit.

00:21:56.013 --> 00:21:57.582
I've brought Kevin
in on this mission

00:21:57.582 --> 00:22:01.219 align:start size:88% position:13%
where he's miserably
depressed at this point.

00:22:01.219 --> 00:22:04.555
And then what am I gonna
tell National Geographic,

00:22:04.555 --> 00:22:06.724 align:start size:84% position:16%
my friend Sadie
Quarrier, the editor

00:22:06.724 --> 00:22:07.659
who's here somewhere,

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:08.860
what am I gonna tell her,

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.094
we're just total clowns

00:22:10.094 --> 00:22:12.497
and how are we gonna
pull this out because

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:16.100 align:start size:84% position:16%
not only was I messed
up, I was sick,

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.337
but I was frankly scared
to go back into this place.

00:22:19.337 --> 00:22:21.172
It was daunting.

00:22:21.172 --> 00:22:23.875
It had really, really
beaten it out of me.

00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:26.945
- Yeah and I felt the
same way, no surprise.

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:30.381
(audience laughing)

00:22:30.381 --> 00:22:34.519
Which brings me to kind of a
difficult moment right now,

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:36.588
because as it turns out,
we were on the threshold

00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:38.856
of a turning point
in this journey.

00:22:38.856 --> 00:22:42.593
And it therefore forces me
to say something positive,

00:22:42.593 --> 00:22:45.430
because much to my surprise

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.165
and unbeknownst to Pete,

00:22:48.165 --> 00:22:51.035
a miracle was about to occur.

00:22:51.035 --> 00:22:54.272
And that miracle had to
do with the fact that

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:55.907
Flagstaff is a very
small community,

00:22:55.907 --> 00:22:58.009
but it sits on the edge
of the Grand Canyon,

00:22:58.009 --> 00:23:00.978
and there's a very tiny
but incredibly passionate

00:23:00.978 --> 00:23:02.947
group of people who are deeply

00:23:02.947 --> 00:23:06.117
committed to the Grand Canyon.

00:23:06.117 --> 00:23:09.453
And because it's a small town,

00:23:09.453 --> 00:23:11.722
word travels very, very quickly.

00:23:11.722 --> 00:23:14.926
So word got out that these two

00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:16.561 align:start size:84% position:16%
idiots from National
Geographic--

00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:19.964
(audience laughing)

00:23:19.964 --> 00:23:23.801 align:start size:94% position:6%
Had basically tailspinned
out of control,

00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:25.970
retreated back to Flagstaff

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.405
with their tails
between their legs

00:23:27.405 --> 00:23:29.641 align:start position:0%
and were considering abandoning
this very important story

00:23:29.641 --> 00:23:30.675
about the Grand Canyon,

00:23:30.675 --> 00:23:31.976
and so what these people did

00:23:31.976 --> 00:23:34.979
was they decided that
they were gonna rally.

00:23:34.979 --> 00:23:36.748
They showed up my house,

00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:38.516
whole group of them.

00:23:38.516 --> 00:23:41.218
And over the next
two to three weeks,

00:23:41.218 --> 00:23:42.921
they redid our entire program.

00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:45.623
They redialed our gear,

00:23:45.623 --> 00:23:48.359
they re-engineered
our food system,

00:23:48.359 --> 00:23:51.262
and they basically embarked on

00:23:51.262 --> 00:23:52.963
a process that resulted in

00:23:52.963 --> 00:23:55.433
a Grand Canyon hiking makeover

00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:58.836
that was designed to get
us back into the canyon,

00:23:58.836 --> 00:24:00.371
back in gear

00:24:00.371 --> 00:24:03.475
and enable us to
resume the mission

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:07.712 align:start size:94% position:6%
which was to get our butts
continuing downstream.

00:24:07.712 --> 00:24:08.546
- And that we did.

00:24:08.546 --> 00:24:09.547
They brought us back in,

00:24:09.547 --> 00:24:11.716
and one challenge for me is that

00:24:11.716 --> 00:24:13.017
usually when you do
these assignments

00:24:13.017 --> 00:24:14.252
for National Geographic,

00:24:14.252 --> 00:24:16.220 align:start size:84% position:16%
you're really afraid
that if you go in

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.822
with one camera and
that camera breaks,

00:24:17.822 --> 00:24:19.757
you can't be like, well
I didn't have a camera.

00:24:19.757 --> 00:24:22.427
But it is so challenging
that they convinced me

00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:24.696
that I had to drop
all my extra lenses,

00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:26.131
all of my extra cameras,

00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:27.399
all of my extra batteries,

00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:29.600
I did the whole thing on
one camera and one lens.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.102
And then they brought
us back into the canyon

00:24:31.102 --> 00:24:32.670 align:start size:81% position:19%
and showed us ways
to get through

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.472
following the sheep trails.

00:24:34.472 --> 00:24:35.707
Don't be near the river, follow,

00:24:35.707 --> 00:24:36.874
look for the hoof prints,

00:24:36.874 --> 00:24:39.344 align:start size:84% position:16%
look for the little
black pellets.

00:24:39.344 --> 00:24:40.945 align:start size:84% position:16%
They brought us
through ancient ruins,

00:24:40.945 --> 00:24:43.414
they brought us through
some recent impacts,

00:24:43.414 --> 00:24:45.283
you can see some old markings

00:24:45.283 --> 00:24:47.752
that people have carved their
names a hundred years ago.

00:24:47.752 --> 00:24:49.654
And they basically
got us back on track

00:24:49.654 --> 00:24:51.590
to our initial mission.
