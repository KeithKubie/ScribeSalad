00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:02.663
- [Voiceover] So we have these
nine balls right over here.

00:00:02.663 --> 00:00:05.694
We're going to assume that
they are completely identical.

00:00:05.694 --> 00:00:07.504
At least they are identical in appearance.

00:00:07.504 --> 00:00:11.812
But one of the nine
balls is heavier, just a

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:16.280
little bit heavier, is heavier
than the other eight balls.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.329
And my question to you is:

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.387
What's the minimum number of times that

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:23.717
we can use this scale in order to know,

00:00:23.717 --> 00:00:26.273
definitively, which is the heavier ball.

00:00:26.273 --> 00:00:29.478
So there's some number of
weighings using the scale,

00:00:29.478 --> 00:00:31.543
that after that number of weighings I know

00:00:31.543 --> 00:00:34.231
for a fact that I've
found the heavier ball.

00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:35.960
We're not going to do
something based on luck that

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.579
you just happen to pick the
right ball when you weigh it.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.136
It has to be 100 percent
chance after this number

00:00:41.136 --> 00:00:43.290
of weighings that you have the ball.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.236
And so what is the minimum
number of those, what

00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:48.183
is the minimum number of
weighings using the scale?

00:00:48.183 --> 00:00:50.640
And I encourage you to pause the video and

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.844
think about it as long as necessary to

00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:53.786
come up with your own conclusions.

00:00:54.985 --> 00:00:56.841
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it, so

00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:58.401
I'll give you a couple of hints now.

00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:00.628
So my first hint is that you can do it in

00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:02.966
exactly two weighings of the scale.

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.352
If I do two weighings of the scale, I know

00:01:05.352 --> 00:01:09.128
for a fact that I can find,
not just through luck,

00:01:09.128 --> 00:01:11.770
I can find definitively the heavier ball.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.138
So that's my first hint and if that

00:01:13.138 --> 00:01:14.867
helps you, pause the video.

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:17.104
I'm about to give you another hint.

00:01:17.104 --> 00:01:20.451
So my second hint is that
with each weighing of

00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:23.188
the scale you should be able to rule out

00:01:23.188 --> 00:01:25.732
2/3 of the balls that are essentially

00:01:25.732 --> 00:01:28.404
still candidates for the heavier ball.

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:30.994
So if that helps you, once
again, pause the video.

00:01:32.224 --> 00:01:33.958
So now I'm assuming you've had a go at it

00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.279
and maybe you were able to figure it out.

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:36.437
Maybe you weren't.

00:01:36.437 --> 00:01:38.277
So now let's work through it together.

00:01:38.277 --> 00:01:40.242
So I mentioned that in each weighing

00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:42.507
you can rule out 2/3 of the balls.

00:01:42.507 --> 00:01:43.910
So how do we do that?

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.526
So in the first weighing,
what we essentially do is

00:01:46.526 --> 00:01:51.526
take our nine balls and put
it into three groups of three.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.423
And we take two of those groups

00:01:53.423 --> 00:01:56.462
of three, so we take this group.

00:01:56.462 --> 00:01:58.579
Let me actually do that
in a different color.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.528
So we can take this group
of three right over here.

00:02:02.528 --> 00:02:04.705
Put those three balls on
that side of the scale.

00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:06.613
And then we can take these three balls,

00:02:06.613 --> 00:02:09.870
and put it on that side of the scale.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.710
And so you're essentially weighing

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.510
three versus three balls.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.537
Now, there's a couple of outcomes here.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.829
You're either going to have a balance,

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.869
you're going to have the left is heavier.

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:24.269
So let me write that.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.965
Say it's going to tip down,
so the left is heavier.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.408
Or the right is heavier.

00:02:32.408 --> 00:02:37.408
Or the right is heavier.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.309
Now what does each of these tell you?

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.735
Well if this, if they
balance, that tells you

00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:45.523
that the third group has the heavy ball.

00:02:45.523 --> 00:02:47.256
So, actually let me write it this way.

00:02:47.256 --> 00:02:51.038
If this is group one,
group two, group three,

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:56.038
then this tells you that
group three has heavy ball.

00:02:57.116 --> 00:03:01.098
Has heavy ball.

00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:02.860
If the left is heavier, then we know

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.619
group one has the heavy ball.

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:10.151
Group one has the heavy ball.

00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:11.753
And then finally, of
course, if the right is

00:03:11.753 --> 00:03:16.753
heavier we know that group
two has the heavy ball.

00:03:19.223 --> 00:03:21.255
Now just like that with
one way, we have narrowed

00:03:21.255 --> 00:03:22.603
it down to one of the three groups.

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:24.360
We have essentially narrowed it down.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.559
We now know that our heavy
ball is one of three balls.

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:28.862
It's either one of these three,

00:03:28.862 --> 00:03:30.709
one of these three, or one of these three.

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.113
And so I just repeat the process.

00:03:32.113 --> 00:03:35.521
But instead of doing it
with three balls at a time,

00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:37.337
I now do it with one ball at a time.

00:03:37.337 --> 00:03:39.199
So if I'm taking three balls.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:44.199
If I have three balls, what
I could do is, I will now...

00:03:44.718 --> 00:03:48.785
So my step two, I guess
I could say, my step two.

00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:52.719
I now weigh one versus one.

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.562
And once again I have the outcomes.

00:03:54.562 --> 00:03:57.629
So if they are balanced, if they are

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.610
balanced, then that means the...

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.974
So once again, if we're taking, say, this

00:04:01.974 --> 00:04:03.659
group of three, we're in the balanced

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.192
situation from the first weighing.

00:04:06.192 --> 00:04:10.807
And so if we put, if
we put this ball here,

00:04:10.807 --> 00:04:14.321
and this ball here, if
they are balanced then

00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:16.445
we know that this must be the heavy ball.

00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:18.251
Because these two are the same.

00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:22.807
If the left goes down,
if the left goes down

00:04:22.807 --> 00:04:24.835
then we know this is the heavy ball.

00:04:24.835 --> 00:04:27.678
And likewise, if the right goes down,

00:04:28.816 --> 00:04:31.297
if the right goes down, we know that

00:04:31.297 --> 00:04:34.700
this is going to be the heavy ball.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.119
So this is actually a little bit of

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:37.337
a brain teaser that you see.

00:04:37.337 --> 00:04:38.446
It's a pretty common one.

00:04:38.446 --> 00:04:39.547
It's actually even, sometimes you'll

00:04:39.547 --> 00:04:40.796
hear it in some job interviews.

00:04:40.796 --> 00:04:43.176
But you can see, it comes
out of the idea that through

00:04:43.176 --> 00:04:46.533
each weighing you can
rule out 2/3 of the balls.

00:04:46.533 --> 00:04:47.917
And so you could use this principle,

00:04:47.917 --> 00:04:49.290
if you want, to drive other brain teasers.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.127
What if you had 27 balls?

00:04:51.127 --> 00:04:52.144
How many weighings would you need?

00:04:52.144 --> 00:04:53.922
What if you had 81?

00:04:53.922 --> 00:04:55.804
And sometimes when you
see this brain teaser,

00:04:55.804 --> 00:04:58.213
instead of giving you
a nice clean, I guess

00:04:58.213 --> 00:04:59.896
you could say, power of
three right over here,

00:04:59.896 --> 00:05:01.346
they might give you something off.

00:05:01.346 --> 00:05:03.143
So they might give you eight balls.

00:05:03.143 --> 00:05:05.082
But the exact same principle holds.

00:05:05.082 --> 00:05:07.706
If you had eight balls,
you could split it up

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:10.200
into two groups of
three, and then two more.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.875
And then do the same, and then
do the exact same process.

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:15.402
But I think people like
to do the eight balls

00:05:15.402 --> 00:05:17.251
because it takes you
a little away from the

00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:18.771
idea of maybe you have to divide it into

00:05:18.771 --> 00:05:20.664
groups of three, or something like that.

00:05:20.664 --> 00:05:24.474
Anyway, hopefully you have enjoyed this.
