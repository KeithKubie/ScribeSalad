(Amy)
Roy had the kids,
so me and Trev--

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:05.371 align:start size:31% position:69%
Oh, great.

00:00:05.404 --> 00:00:06.372 align:start position:0% line:85%
We hit the road.

00:00:05.404 --> 00:00:06.372 align:start size:31% position:69%
Fun.

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:07.440 align:start position:0% line:85%
Antiquing.

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:07.440 align:start size:22% position:78%
Fun.

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:08.441 align:start position:0%
Heaven.

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:10.643 align:start position:0% line:0%
Oh!

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:10.643 size:88% position:56% line:14%
Welcome back, home shoppers.

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:14.680 align:start position:0% line:0%
Over the break, we sold 600
Steve Irwin commemorative coins.

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:15.748 align:start size:13% position:88% line:0%
600.

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:16.883 align:start position:0% line:0%
Now, this is the perfect
gift for someone

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:19.452 align:start position:0% line:0%
who does not have
a Steve Irwin coin.

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:20.520 align:start size:56% position:44% line:0%
God, I miss Steve,
you know?

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:21.554 align:start position:0% line:0%
Yeah, oh yeah.

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:22.588 align:start size:50% position:50% line:0%
You know what's
great about him?

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:23.623 align:start size:34% position:66% line:0%
He, he--

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:23.623 align:start position:0% line:14%
Everything.

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.091 align:start size:53% position:47% line:0%
Everything and...

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.091 align:start position:0% line:14%
Yeah?

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:27.260 size:78% position:61% line:0%
He had the kind of body
where he didn't work out,

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:28.928 align:start size:56% position:44% line:0%
but it looked like
he worked out.

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:29.929 align:start position:0% line:0%
Sure!

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:31.531 align:start size:50% position:50% line:0%
Got one of these
for my wife.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.232 align:start position:0% line:0%
Your what!?

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:34.233 align:start position:0% line:0%
Okay.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.601 align:start position:0% line:0%
Oh, next up,
what do we have?

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:36.936 align:start position:0% line:85%
Oh!

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:36.936 align:start size:25% position:75%
Oh, boy.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.204 align:start position:0% line:85%
Okay, okay.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.204 align:start size:25% position:75%
Stop.

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:39.472 align:start position:0%
Now, speaking of
perfect gifts,

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:42.075 align:start position:0%
now, this is a
no brainer, all right?

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.743 align:start position:0% line:0%
Now, this is a gun.

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:46.179 align:start position:0% line:0%
Just your regular,
run of the mill,

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.914 align:start position:0% line:0%
meat and potatoes
handgun.

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:48.915 align:start position:0% line:0%
Now, how cute is that?

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.149 align:start size:38% position:63% line:0%
I love that.

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:51.184 line:0%
How cute-- we can pick it up?

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:51.184 align:start size:44% position:56% line:14%
Look at this.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.585 align:start position:0% line:0%
Oh, heavy, oh...

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.585 align:start size:63% position:38% line:14%
Ooh, can I see this?

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:54.120 align:start position:0% line:0%
You can hold it, sure.

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:54.120 align:start size:31% position:69% line:14%
Oh, wow!

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:55.922 align:start position:0% line:0%
Look at that.

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:55.922 align:start size:66% position:34% line:15%
Wow, look at that.
(imitates gun firing)

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.390 align:start position:0% line:0%
Wow!

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.390 align:start size:53% position:47% line:14%
Bam-bam, bam-bam!

00:00:57.423 --> 00:01:00.226 align:start size:75% position:25% line:0%
It's like a toy,
but it's extremely real.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:02.195 align:start position:0% line:0%
Yeah, and now here is
what's great about this.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.997 align:start position:0% line:0%
Now, pretty much anyone
can purchase this.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.532 align:start size:22% position:78% line:0%
Mm-hmm.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.532 align:start position:0% line:14%
Okay?

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:08.668 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
Oh, my God, this is so fun,
I love this.

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:08.668 align:start position:0% line:21%
It's fun.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.404 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
Hey, lady, give me all your
money and your makeup!

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:12.605 align:start position:0% line:0%

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:14.207 align:start position:0% line:0%
(laughing)

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:14.207 align:start size:59% position:41% line:14%
Oh, my God, so fun,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.408 align:start size:66% position:34% line:0%
and it's on sale now.

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:16.709 align:start size:25% position:75% line:0%
Call in.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:18.344 align:start size:63% position:38% line:0%
Oh, we got a caller.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:18.344 align:start position:0% line:14%
Oh, caller!

(man on phone)
<i> Hey, did I miss
 the Steve Irwin coins?</i>

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:21.414 align:start size:56% position:44% line:0%
Uh, yeah, you did.

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:21.414 align:start position:0% line:14%
You sure did, honey.

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:22.782 align:start size:41% position:59% line:0%
I'm sorry.

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:22.782 align:start position:0% line:14%
But that's okay.

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:23.850 align:start size:47% position:53% line:0%
You want a gun?

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:25.518 line:0%
<i> Oh, no,
 I could never get a gun.</i>

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:26.652 line:0%
<i> I have several

00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:27.653 line:0%
(both chuckling)

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:28.921 align:start size:22% position:78% line:0%
Oh, no.

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:30.790 align:start position:0% line:0%
Caller, you bite your tongue,
you silly goose.

00:01:30.823 --> 00:01:32.291 align:start position:0% line:0%
You can absolutely
get a gun

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:33.960 align:start position:0% line:0%
if you have
several felonies,

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.162 align:start position:0% line:0%
as long as you buy
it on the Internet...

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:38.097 align:start size:25% position:75% line:0%
Right.

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:38.097 align:start position:0% line:14%
...or at a gun show,

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.267 align:start position:0% line:0%
and caller, guess where
you are right now?

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.035 line:0%
(siren blaring)

00:01:43.068 --> 00:01:45.037 size:81% position:41% line:0%
Bam! You're at a gun show!

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.506 align:start size:66% position:34% line:0%
You're at a gun show.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.608 align:start position:0% line:0%
Yes, if you go to a gun show you
can get an unlicensed seller

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.177 align:start size:63% position:38% line:0%
to sell you a gun,
no<i> questiones</i> asked.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.880 align:start position:0% line:0%
That's right, not one question
for you, caller.

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:56.182 line:0%
<i> Great, I'll get one for me
 and my mouthy cunt wife.</i>

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:57.216 align:start size:44% position:56% line:0%
Ooh, one's for
your wife.

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:58.217 line:0%
<i> In a way.</i>

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.519 align:start size:19% position:81% line:0%
Great.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:01.420 align:start size:78% position:22% line:0%
You know the guns my wife
can't get enough of?

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:02.822 align:start size:19% position:81% line:0%
These.

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:04.423 size:78% position:39% line:0%
You are really committing
to the whole wife thing.

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:05.458 align:start size:34% position:66% line:0%
She's real.

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:06.492 align:start position:0% line:0%
What's her name?

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:07.693 align:start size:19% position:81% line:0%
Ben...

00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:09.195 align:start size:47% position:53% line:0%
...ita, Benita.

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:10.596 align:start size:66% position:34% line:0%
(with Spanish accent)
From EspaÃ±a.

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:11.797 align:start position:0% line:0%
That's fantastic,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.333 align:start position:0% line:0%
and just a reminder
to all the parents at home,

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:16.502 align:start position:0% line:0%
these make perfect
stocking stuffers.

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:17.570 align:start size:28% position:72% line:0%
Oh, yeah.

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:17.570 align:start position:0% line:14%
Right?

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:19.071 align:start position:0% line:0%
For-- for as young as--

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:19.071 align:start size:34% position:66% line:14%
Beautiful.

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:20.840 align:start position:0% line:0%
It doesn't matter,
okay?

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:23.509 align:start position:0% line:0%
These are great
for any age group.

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:24.877 align:start size:63% position:38% line:0%
It's like the bottom
of the stocking.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.045 align:start position:0% line:0%
It is, it's shaped...

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.045 align:start size:59% position:41% line:14%
It's like the foot.

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:27.480 align:start position:0% line:0%
...very stocking-like.

00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:28.681 align:start size:72% position:28% line:0%
It's like a metal foot.

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:30.550 line:0%
Very stocking-like shape, okay?

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:30.550 align:start size:41% position:59% line:14%
Fantastic.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.351 align:start size:75% position:25% line:0%
My wife's in the states,
by the way.

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:34.220 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
I said she's Spanish,
but she is from the states.

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:35.321 align:start position:0% line:0%
Let's keep these
calls coming.

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:38.257 align:start position:0% line:0%
We only have
65 million left.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.692 size:81% position:41% line:0%
And here's some good news.

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:43.162 size:84% position:42% line:0%
Even a blind person can see
what a great deal this is

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:45.731 align:start position:0% line:0%
and take advantage of this
deal by buying a gun.

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:47.200 align:start position:0% line:0%
Totally legal!

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:51.070 align:start position:0% line:0%
So, if you're Stevie Wonder,
you don't have to wonder

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:52.505 align:start position:0% line:0%
if you can get a gun.

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:55.074 align:start size:78% position:22% line:0%
Uh, caller, I, I hope you
just called to say

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:56.209 align:start size:47% position:53% line:0%
you want a gun.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:57.210 align:start size:75% position:25% line:0%
Stevie Wonder reference.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:57.210 align:start position:0% line:14%
(chuckling)

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:58.544 align:start size:75% position:25% line:0%

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.750 align:start size:9% position:91% line:0%
Oh.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.750 size:84% position:42% line:14%
Oh.

00:03:04.783 --> 00:03:06.052 align:start size:25% position:75% line:0%
Ooh-ooh.

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.587 line:0%
You're fine, sweet potato fries.

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.587 align:start size:44% position:56% line:14%
You're fine.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.088 align:start position:0% line:0%
The no-fly list.

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:11.224 size:75% position:38% line:0%
No one can tell you that
you don't have a right

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:14.060 align:start position:0% line:0%
to buy a gun in this country
you're trying to destroy.

(bell ringing)

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:16.462 align:start size:59% position:41% line:0%
You're funny today.

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:16.462 line:14%
Uh-oh, uh-oh!

00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:17.563 align:start size:59% position:41% line:0%
Whoa! What is that?

00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:17.563 size:78% position:39% line:14%
You know what that means.

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:18.731 align:start size:44% position:56% line:0%
Mass shooting.

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:19.865 align:start size:50% position:50% line:0%
We've had
a mass shooting.

00:03:19.898 --> 00:03:21.434 align:start position:0% line:0%
Which means the government
could be coming

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:23.236 align:start position:0% line:0%
for your guns soon,

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.138 align:start position:0% line:0%
like they never have,
but always might.

00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:27.273 align:start size:19% position:81% line:0%
Scary.

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:28.808 align:start position:0% line:0%
Now, we're gonna go
to commercial.

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:31.143 size:75% position:38% line:0%

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:34.847 align:start position:0% line:0%
we'll be selling United States

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:38.351 align:start position:0% line:0%
for much cheaper

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.486 align:start size:53% position:47% line:0%
