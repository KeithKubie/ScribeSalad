Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible] so what do you make of what's the, the onslaught against Christians? Because I talk about it, I talk about it pretty frequently on, on Twitter and here, and I'm not Christian, but I see what's going on. And this is now the state sanctioned bigotry. Yeah. That's okay. Not quite state, but like, yeah. If you care about what the media is allowed, you know, you can always attack white Christian man and they're all homophobes in, they're all big gates and all of this nonsense. Yeah. And I go to events with these people all the time and I find them to be decent and respectful and willing to disagree and walk away without punching you. Yeah. And everything else. But what do you make of just like the focus?

Speaker 2:          00:41          Yeah. On that. Well, it's part of, it's part of intersectionality. You posted the quiz the other day that it was like, what's your intersectionality score? Intersectionality scores. And one of the things that you could slide was whether or not you're a devout Christian. The more devout of a Christian, you are, I guess the more privileged Dui or the lower you are in the intersectionality scale or something like that. And so I think it's just associated because America and the West, uh, why is driven by, uh, by Christianity and what's driven specifically by Protestants. I mean the revolutionary war was seen as a Presbyterian rebellion and a lot of those people line anything with anything that is aligned with Americanism is white nationalist is wrong, is imperialist Christianity gets tied up in that. Now for Evangelical Christians, we also know because the Bible tells us that the Church of Christ is going to be pushed to the margins and tell the world comes to an end. And so we will be persecuted, we will, uh, be more and more marginalized am yes, we can continue to fight for Christian values. We continue to fight for being left alone really is what we're really fighting for. Just kind of leave us alone. That's what Protestants pretty much have always done. Um, but yeah, I mean at the, at the end of the day, we know that it's not going to end well for us probably.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Yeah. It's really crappy situation. Like every day, just another tweet and another story, this nonsense, you know, they'll do Chris Pratt church and they'll try to make it seem like, oh, he's a homophobe and he goes, he's homophobic church and it's like, guys, you want to do a lot Omar's mosque, now you want to do that. But they don't want to do that because actually they're the bigots. Right. That really is the truth.

Speaker 2:          02:21          Yeah. And that's the thing is that they're fine. They're really fine. The left is fine with you being a Christian, as long as you don't actually believe what the Bible says. So as long as you believe the staff about feeding the poor, as long as you believe that kind of stuff. But that has to mean the government, they got rid of it, feeding the floor. You have to do it their way. Right, right. Is longer. You're down with that, but you have to take away the wrath of God. You had to take away Jesus be the only way, truth and life you have to take away the biblical marriage stuff. You have to take away the abortion stuff if to take away the hard work that proverbs talks about that even the apostle Paul talks about kind of take all that away. As long as you're the Christian that believes in well three distribution. You're good.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Yeah. Huh. All right. So let's dive into some of the topics of the day. You mentioned the uh, the wage gap. Yeah, it was recently. It was, what was the gender

Speaker 2:          03:09          pay gap day or Hashtag e you're saying she don't even let her know our day,

Speaker 1:          03:14          even though I just made sure to pay all my female plays less that day. Oh, just really drive it home. Yeah. Is it a myth? What's going on here?

Speaker 2:          03:21          It's a myth because, well, it's partly a math. What they don't tell you is the entire story is this whole uncontrolled gap through our versus the controlled gap. And actually heard about this originally on a more left leaning site. That's an organization up in Seattle that fights for equal pay. And they actually taught me on their site the difference between an uncontrolled gap and a controlled gap. The encore

Speaker 1:          03:44          toward a great Twitter thread on this by the way, which we'll link to in the description.

Speaker 2:          03:46          Yeah, yeah. It was the control the gap account or I'll start with the uncontrolled gap, does not account for job title, doesn't account for experience as an account for hours work. It really doesn't put any factors in. It's just the median, uh, what women make versus the median, what men make, which is 79 cents to a dollar. That is true, but it doesn't account for any choices or an experience that controlled gap accounts for all of those things. So it accounts for job title hours worked, all of that. It doesn't account for, uh, like negotiating a raised as an account for end of year bonuses or anything like that. But it does account for the big factors and that is 99 cents on the dollar. So women make 99 cents to every dollar that a man makes. But again, you're not accounting for a few factors there. And that could be within the margin of error. So no matter what, there is no proof that there is systemic sexism that is causing women, uh, to make less money.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Well, it also doesn't account for the fact that men and women choose different careers. Yeah. At the most simple level. I mean, the best example of this is Sweden where they have been, you know, completely egalitarian for ever basically, I guess what, there is still more male engineers and there's still more female versus, yeah. So now they want to like force people to do things that they don't actually want to do so they can get it 50 50 which yeah, that's really how freedom work.

Speaker 2:          05:05          No. And there's, I mean, there's a million different programs to try to get women into stem because they've said for so long that the reason why there are so many more men in stem is because women feel intimidated and because there's this patriarchal attitude in the stem field, while so they've tried so hard, they put so much money behind it and still, I mean men are outpacing women or there are so many more men in stem that, I mean just as many as there's ever been. And so it's probably not 80 outside factor. It's probably because women in general are different.

Speaker 1:          05:37          How much of this do you think is just misguided sort of confusion. So for example, you're pregnant now, your husband's here in the green room, your career is there going to be a little bit different because if you're going to probably take some time off to child rear, yeah. Maybe he will take some maternity time. Maybe not. But yeah, just physiologically we just are different. They don't like talking about that. Yeah. Um, but that is just the nature of reality.

Speaker 2:          06:00          I saw a study the other day that it was like breaking news and it was some study out of the UK that showed that there is a difference between boys and girls brains inside the womb. That is, uh, is it early as you know, however many weeks gestation that a child's brain is developing and they start going in these divergent paths of women. Um, the, just the, how the neurons connected, women kind of being grown into these interpersonal creatures, whereas men are more focused in general on objects and data and things. Women are more focused on ideas and words and people that starts in the womb. And I'm like, I'm so glad science is finally catching up to God and finally catching up to the things that we've known for thousands of years. And so you do wonder if that's going to happen, if, okay, we're trying all of these cool social experiments right now. Like maybe, oh, maybe it'll be fine if we draft women. Like maybe it'll be fine if we just pretend we just are totally gender neutral with our kids and pretend like no binary definition of gender exists. Um, but I do wonder if science will catch up with us and be like, actually all these things that conservatives were saying that the left dot, we're social constructs, they're just biological reality.

Speaker 1:          07:12          Well, they also made find out what if they found out that there was a gay gene one day? Yeah. Now they're pro choice, would you, you have to be okay then with a woman deciding to abort that baby

Speaker 2:          07:23          because they don't want the child to be gay. And that does put them in this kind of ethical conundrum. I mean, but it's the same thing with, with race. I mean I guess you would know what race your child is obviously before you had an ultrasound or anything like that. But uh, you have, I mean there is a racial aspect to abortion and that the majority of abortions happen in minority communities. And so when you ask a pro choice or about that, they don't typically have any kind of answer though.

Speaker 1:          07:48          All right. Wage gap. Uh, you briefly mentioned the trans situation or gender roles. Yeah. The trends issue for considering it's, you know, 0.01% of the population or something. And I have complete sympathy. Yeah. Uh, with the issues that they're dealing with a little overblown in our national discussion.

Speaker 2:          08:06          Yes. And I think that the left does that a lot. Maybe I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt maybe with good intentions because people with gender dysphoria, it truly is a struggle. I know someone with gender dysphoria and it is a struggle. They didn't want this. They didn't, they don't like this kind of struggle of feeling like they don't belong in their own body. It really is a psychological struggle, but you treat it as a struggle. You treat it as something that, okay, we don't just say while live what you want to live because they actually, the rates of suicide are pretty much equal afterwards. Um, it doesn't actually reconcile anything when we say, okay, just do what you want to do because it truly is a disorder in a dysphoria. Um, and I think maybe in an attempt to be compassionate to the people that are dealing with this and to help them not feel ashamed that left to said, you know what?

Speaker 2:          08:54          We're just going to who you are. I personally don't think that's the compassionate thing to do, to lie to someone. And I know a lot of conservatives feel the same way. Um, but then you do start finding yourself getting angry and defensive about a subject that we should have a lot of sympathy for because people force you to use gender pronouns that you don't want to use a, they force you to have conversations that you don't want to have. And that's where things just get really sticky. And that's when unfortunately, conservatives, including me, we get really dogmatic about it and the sympathy and compassion is thrown out the window.

Speaker 1:          09:23          Yeah. So what do you do to fight that? Cause that I get that it's tough if you just keep being called to transfer over or any of these phobes well eventually you're just like, all right then enough of this, I'm gonna go for the destroys tweet and scatter of the compassion tweet.

Speaker 2:          09:37          Well the tweets are difficult because the tweets, it's like you only have so many characters and putting out the nuanced compassionate tweet is typically not what comes to mind. I think when you're just trying to put your, put your idea out there, you don't have time to add. The new ones are like, I'm just going to get to the point I want to say that's right. But that's typically my tendency and our tendency and I don't think that's a good thing. But in conversations I always think it's really important to define your terms. If you have a same leftist who was saying you're a trans phobe. Okay, well we need to define phobia and we need to define what I believe in what you believe and maybe we actually agree on a lot of the same things. We just disagree on the facts. We just disagree on the variables. So I think defining the terms is important. It starting with what you agree is important. Uh, and then working out from there. How often do we do that? Maybe not enough.

Speaker 1:          10:24          So would you, do you think it's fair to say that the average conservative, well, first off, you know, the, when they keep putting fold at the end of a word, phobe is an irrational fear. So I assume you don't think that the average conservative has an irrational fear of trans people?

Speaker 2:          10:36          No, I don't think so.

Speaker 1:          10:37          Okay. So what, what do you think the average, do you think the average PR, uh, conservative has the thoughts that you laid out earlier, which is sort of a sympathy for this, but then we don't want that to override or thinking brain,

Speaker 2:          10:50          something like that. I think some people are saying you don't want, I really don't care if you dress like a girl or you dress like a guy or you want to call yourself something. Um, I just don't want you to force that on me. I don't want you to take away, for example, my religious liberty in lieu of like I, I, I don't know, they don't want their rights trampled upon in favor of this small group. Uh, however, I do think there are people that kind of see where this line of reasoning goes, that if, okay, we deny biological realities, we deny what science is telling us, and we buy into this delusion that a man can just wake up one day and say that he is a woman, then okay, we kind of lose, we kind of lose all truth. What is truth anymore? It's just what you feel. We lose identity. It's just who you say you are. Or are you actually defined in any way by biology? And I think they see the kind of slippery slope did that goes down and they say, okay, stop right there. I'm not down with this. Okay. And

Speaker 1:          11:45          it all sounds crazy to just wake up and you know, middle age and be like, well now I'm a female. But it's like at that point, I mean this is, this sounds bananas, but if you were a washed up male NBA player couldn't play in the league anymore. You can be like, yeah, I'm a woman today. I identify as woman, right? Yeah, I'm jumping in then WMV and I'm going to be the MVP, watch this. And then the feminist would have to say,

Speaker 2:          12:07          yeah, your lived experience. Yeah. Well that's the other problem with it is that you're kind of seeing some feminists pushback on this and say, hang on. Well, old school feminists have been kind of saying, okay, we fought for the uniqueness of women, the empowerment of women because women are women and now men are beating us at our own. Gay Men are better at being women than women are. That's not fair. And so I do think you see feminist pushing back on that, who truly do believe that. Okay. The reason why we fought for the empowerment of women is because women are unique. Only women can have children. Only women can do certain things. Women are better at some things that men are. As far as leadership goes, as far as organization goes, things like that. And they fought to bring those things to the forefront. And now none of those things matter anymore because you can be a man and be a woman. So there is just, I'm just so glad I'm not on the lot. It just seems so confusing.

Speaker 1:          12:54          It's quite miserable. It is. All right, so your Prager u video make men masculine again. Why did they have a man do that? Why did they have a, what was the idea? We're going to have a woman. Yes. Talk about male, a male masculinity.

Speaker 2:          13:07          I think it's because you're seeing a lot of women talk about how terrible toxic masculinity is and say, Oh man, they just, they don't even know how hard today's and David Presta us for so long. We just need them to take a back seat and so we can kind of step up and do our thing. And so I think they wanted the perspective of a woman to say, hang on just a second. Women actually do, not only do we like masculine men, um, or it not even necessarily traditional masculinity. I'm not talking about like riding a four wheeler, I'm talking about taking responsibility for your actions and taking care of your family. I'm taking care of that provision and protection that men are so good at it. And I think better at than women are. Um, so you could still wear a nice shirt, let's say.

Speaker 2:          13:51          Yes, you should be able to take care of your family. Yeah. It's more internal traits than anything else. And the actions and the habits that you have, the responsibilities that you take. Women do care about that. And actually the complimentarian relationship that men and women have had for ever, um, has, has worked really well. It's worked really well. Not always. I mean, sometimes it goes over to a patriarchy and that's not good. I don't think oppression of women is good, but the, the ying and the Yang, the back and forth and uh, the complimentarian relationship that we've had has worked. And I think you kind of needed to hear a woman say that. So why do you think the left trying to destroy that? Because they think a gala Tarion is and will equal equality. So it's equality through homogeny, which is part of why abortion is a really big thing that they fight for.

Speaker 2:          14:35          If a man can physically walk away from an unwanted pregnancy, oh woman should be able to too. I mean, pregnancy, the ability to get pregnant is really one, not one of the only things, but probably the biggest thing that makes a woman different. And so if we get rid of that through abortion and that maybe men and women really well be the same and maybe they really will be equal, then there'll be no abuse, no oppression, no patriarchy, things like that. But I mean men are always going to be physically stronger than women and there's always going to be bad men and that women. So oppression won't stop, abuse won't stop. Egalitarianism is just going to make or not shouldn't say egalitarianism, but sameness is going to make things more confusing, not better.

Speaker 1:          15:16          So I know you do a public speaking too, and when you go to colleges, do you find you have any tricks on how to wake up, say some of the lefties that are, you know, at least open to some of these ideas, but they're kind of like, oh, she must be the bad guy, but I'll at least go and sit in the back of the room.

Speaker 2:          15:32          Well, what I tried to do is I try to, my messages typically when I can usually speaking to mostly conservative is that okay, you're hearing that you're crazy for believing and things like border security for being prolife, for being pro capitalism. But here's where these ideas come from and here's how they have worked. And really only over the past 10 to 15 years have we heard all of this crazy intersectionality, identity politic stuff that they are acting like his main stream. And so you're not the extremist, you're not the radical, you're not the one that's out there. You're not the Nazi and the big that you believe things that Americans have believed since our founding. Yeah. And they have a really good history and a really good basis. And so I don't know if that has necessarily ever changed a leftist mind, but it is something that's different than just talking points and saying the is stupid.

Speaker 2:          16:21          It saying, hey, we have good ideas and you have a right to believe they're good ideas and you have a right to defend these good ideas. Um, really the, the most disrespectful or the craziest. I always get very respectful, great liberal students that come and listen and ask awesome questions. I think the only time that has been like, oh my gosh, I can't even get a word out without these people screaming is when I was at UC Berkeley and I spoke to yes. And I spoke to a class and the professor was awesome for asking me and I actually thought when I went in there, I was like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be really tame, really tame with what I say. I'm not going to say I'm not gonna throw any flames or anything like that. Oh my gosh, I couldn't even, it was like they had never heard a conservative idea. They'd never heard, uh, someone who wasn't a liberal, utter a word and it was irrational. It was irrational. That was really my only experience where I was like, this is crazy. They've abandoned thought.

Speaker 1:          17:16          Do you in a weird way, blame the baby boomers for this cause it's their kids, right? Like, or it's the end of there. The young end of their children, like weird way. You can't blame the, the 16 year old who now gets into college, you know, a couple of years go by, he's been indoctrinated in high school, gets to college, gets slammed with more of this up. I have sympathy for him. Well, when they're yelling at me, I don't have that much sympathy for it. Yeah. But like I have sympathy for that condition because they were just thrown into that. Yeah. Um, we're not that you're looking to blame somebody, but if you had to sort of figure out where this whole thing started. Yeah. Where would you go?

Speaker 2:          17:48          Well, the baby boomers

Speaker 1:          17:50          really liked to talk about how terrible millennials are and I agree with them to some degree. I mean a lot of the stereotypes that people have of us stare entitled and apathetic or true, but I remind them like we were raised, like we were raised by someone, we weren't raised by wolves and I don't think it's so much that parents probably told their kids to be entitled or told their kids to be spoiled. I don't know if it was a lack of values that were taught in the family, but also there was a significant change from the time our parents were kids. Like my mom for example, was you know she was driving to the liquor store to get her dad beer when she was like 13 years old. I mean car seats, like that just wasn't even a thing. I mean everything was a lot more free to the time where we were kids.

Speaker 1:          18:34          I remember there was like a new law that said you have to be in a car seat until you're like in second grade or something like that. Everything changed. Everything became more safe and everything shifted from like the latch key kids who were coming home and fending for themselves. That's mostly generation x because both their parents had jobs to kind of these helicopter parents and these, everybody gets a trophy or this, everybody gets a trophy mentality that we had in school. It's not like we didn't have competition, but it was the, everyone gets some kind of reward. I would know. I'm terrible at running. I'm so slow and yet in every race I thought I got honorable mention, honorable mention, I got something and that's how we were raised. I swear to God. So I'm, I'm Gen x so I'm a little yes, but I swear to God, I remember being in third or fourth grade field day and I was, I was a scrawny little kid.

Speaker 1:          19:24          I was not a good athlete. I became a good athlete later and I remember getting a slip a field day. I did not place, I didn't get a medal and I remember getting some sort of participation thing and I'm not kidding. I remember as a third or fourth grader thinking this is nonsense. Like why would you give me this? I felt shitty. I felt bad, I sucked it. Whatever. We were doing like a slow bike race and I sucked. So why that, yeah, we've, we've sold this as if this is how it's supposed to be.

Speaker 2:          19:52          Yeah, I think, I mean it's parenting, it's technology, its values, its purpose. It's so much, I mean you do also, you can't deny just the effect of personal technology hat on millennials. And I mean we had iPhones from the time that we were probably 15. We had cell phones. Even before that we had my space. Zenga if anyone remembers that you had a Facebook, oh, I think it was before my today. I didn't have it, but I remember some people did. You had AOL instant messenger. So you had personalized technology from a really young age that told us that everything is about you. Um, everything is focused on you. And then the older that we got, we got Netflix, we've got Uber eats, we got all of these things that made life really convenient. Instant gratification. Always. We don't know anything other than Amazon. I don't know how to read a map. Like I don't, I remember my dad tried to teach me how to read a map in high school. I was like, yeah, dad. Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:42          Do you remember Dennis had to refold it. Yeah. The rest it's like whatever, but then you can just fold it back in the way it came out.

Speaker 2:          20:49          Well, I don't even know how to do that. So, and I think most millennials don't, and so this instant gratification things should be easy for me as they are in the technological world has really affected our politics too.

Speaker 1:          21:00          Do you feel that the technological part of this is actually really screwed up a generation then like that? There's obviously a lot of goodness and we're doing this on youtube. Yeah, yeah. All of that. But that it really like we have, we handed everybody, it didn't matter what age you are. We all got handed this incredible technology to open the world, our heads, but especially if you're a 15 year old being handed that. Yeah, that's, that's a lot to give a kid.

Speaker 2:          21:24          Yeah. I want to hesitate to blame all of all of it on technology. I also see a loss of values and that we're not only the most progressive generation, but we're also the most irreligious generation where the biggest generation of religious nones in o n e s and I do think a lot of us are wandering, looking for truth, not really knowing what that is. Not me, but a lot of people in our generation. I don't know if that comes with technology at all or if that's connected, but it certainly a factor in why you think millennials just don't have any center. They don't have any grounding and they just think that their centers themselves, they were told this all the time on social media. I mean your favorite fitness blog or your favorite self help author is just love yourself. If you just look in the mirror in the morning, you tell yourself you're awesome, that you're enough, then you're going to be fine and that's what you need to do.

Speaker 2:          22:13          Everything's about my happiness. So you cut out the toxic people in your life. You cut out the things that you don't like, the things that make you sad and you just do you be pretty lonely? Yeah, I mean there's right and w I mean, what do you do when the self love runs out? What do you do when the self esteem runs out? What do you do when you wake up in the morning and you're like, okay, I'm not that awesome and I haven't accomplished that much. Should you just continue to coddle yourself or should you do something about it? In the millennial is told cuddle, you'll be flying and then you have someone like AOC saying, well, we're going to provide economic security for people who are unwilling to work. And so if you just want to be, uh, a watercolor painter, even if you suck at it, you should just keep doing it.

Speaker 1:          22:55          Yeah. So that's where a lot of money in watercolor paint in general.

Speaker 2:          22:59          I wouldn't know because I'm not good at it, but, um, I can imagine

Speaker 1:          23:04          gay marriage, let's talk about it. Oh, okay. From a Christian perspective. So when we're posting this, uh, we're holding this video for a couple of days, but I just had a Shapiro in here and we've talked about gay marriage and he talks about his feelings from it Orthodox Jewish perspective. And we can, we've basically gotten it to the place where we agree to disagree and we agree to disagree on the, on the fact that he's not okay with it through a religious perspective, but he's not trying to legislate my life and I as a citizen of this country, I'm completely okay with that. Yeah, I suspect that's probably similar to yours.

Speaker 2:          23:38          It is similar now as a Christian, there is a little bit of, um, I would say a second layer to that. So he obviously believes that homosexuality is wrong because the old testament says it. We believe it, not just because the old testament, but it's reiterated in the New Testament. And then there is this crazy picture in metaphor that is given to us in Ephesians five that says, okay, marriage is a reflection of what Christians call Christ in the Church as Christ is the head of the church. So the husband is the head of the wife. And so it's this, um, husbands are to love their wives as Christ loves the church and wives are supposed to submit to their husbands as to the Lord. So there's this spiritual component, this gospel component to marriage being between a man and a woman. So there really is no theological way for any Christian. They try, but to get out of the dynamic that God set up, not just biologically and physically, but also spiritually. And so that's where I stand as far as religious perspective. Now I've heard both sides of it. I have heard conservatives and even libertarians that I respect saying, you know what, I, I just can't get behind a, I just can't get behind gay marriage from even a civics perspective or from a legal perspective.

Speaker 1:          24:52          You heard Libertarians make that argument? I've heard it. I've heard liberty.

Speaker 2:          24:55          I would say not anyone famous. I would say friends who probably have libertarian views still saying maybe that was, maybe they don't feel that way anymore. But just say it's so hard for me to separate the personal from the political, but where I stand politically is probably the same. I would say probably the same place as been dies. I mean, one gay marriage is here to stay. There's nothing that's going to be done about it. And I don't think I, or probably any other evangelical in the political world is going to fight against it. But I think

Speaker 1:          25:23          what does that tell you quickly about the delicacies in general? Because I think this is important. I've, I've said this many times, but it's like nobody cares about gay marriage anymore really in the big picture. Like I get your, your theological, yeah. Personal belief, but in the public political space, yeah. Something that was an Athema to this group of people for a long time now has become normalized pretty quickly I think. I think by and large, Christians have realized that their communities are, and getting worse, that the neighbors next door have kids and they're the same as everybody else. That you don't even hear Mike Huckabee going on about it anymore. Or, or, um, uh, Rick Santorum or any of these guys, they've sort of moved on. And I think this is where I would love the progressive's have a little humility. Yeah. Like just a little bit of, you know what me, maybe you guys were wrong, right? You were wrong, but then something happened and you did you let it go? Yeah. Basically. And that would show a little humanity and humility and they just refused to do that. And again, this is where then I can find myself, be building bridges with you guys all the time because, yeah. Because there's a place to build a bridge to.

Speaker 2:          26:26          Yeah. I think that a lot of evangelical conservatives realized, okay, yes, America was founded on Christian values and we should continue to perpetuate those Christian values. But the state does not define marriage. God defines marriage. And I think that, uh, churches it be free to say, sorry, we're not gonna, we're not gonna marry two men. You know? And I agree. Right. And Yeah, and I knew that you did. Um, and I think that we kind of made that separation and it say and said, okay, God defines marriage in the Bible. If I don't want to get on board with it because I am beholden to God and God above the state, then that's fine in churches shouldn't be beholden to the state in that regard either. And I think that we kind of decided, okay, that's fine. If they want to get married according to the state's definition of marriage, that's okay. But I and my congregation are not going to change our views on it and we just kind of want to be left alone in that regard.

Speaker 1:          27:19          Yeah. So what would you, what do you make of when, when churches do perform gay marriages? Like, yeah, just sort of skirting their theological, yeah. The, or integrity.

Speaker 2:          27:30          Oh yeah. I mean, this is a huge thing in the United Methodist church is that they've kind of almost had a split because they voted on this so called traditional plan saying, okay, if you're a Methodist church, if you're under the United Methodist Church umbrella, this denomination, you can't perform gay marriage or you can't. Yeah. You can't perform, you can perform these marriages. And there were a lot of people who are really upset about that. And, but from a Christian perspective, you just can't get around it. There's no way to get, there's no way theologically to get around it without making some serious, not just physical concessions, but spiritual concessions. And so my question for anyone, and it's not just about gay marriage, it's about anything in the Bible. My question is, if you don't take the Bible as God tells us to take it, why are you a Christian? Find a different hobby. Like there's that you can, you know, you can be a moral person. You can, yeah, you can be a good person and you can believe in feeding the poor without following Christ. But Christ tells us to deny yourself, take up our cross and follow him. And part of that is adhering to the word even when it's inconvenient and not culturally cool. So I'm just a little bit confused by those theological concessions. Um, but yes, to answer your question, I do think that it's compromising on what the Bible says.

Speaker 1:          28:47          Yeah. What do you think that would actually in practice, what does that mean? You know what I mean? Like, so in practice, gay people start getting married now doesn't matter. Outside of the church, what do you think the practice of that would lead to in society? That would be

Speaker 2:          29:01          all right. Are you talking about Oh, okay. Outside of the church.

Speaker 1:          29:03          So like I understood. Yeah. Outside of the church. Did you see that some sort of problem?

Speaker 2:          29:08          Well, I, I, I of course do you think that God's way is better than Nan's way? And I do believe that God's setting up marriage as a union between a man and a woman is better. I think that it's better for, uh, I think it's better for the family. I think it's better for children. And I think because it's better for the family, it's better for society now. Do I think it's going to be the degradation of society? Do I think that we're, our whole thing is going to hell in a hand basket because of that? Uh, no I don't. But of course, I think that the way God set up marriage and family and the Bible is better than how secular society does it. Um, and so that's where I feel that, I feel like we are, I feel like we'll probably be going. However, homosexuality isn't different or are necessarily worse than other sense. It's a different kind of sin because it's a sexual sin according to Christianity, but it's not worse. We don't believe that it puts us in a worse place than all of the other sense that American. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          29:59          Dot. Well, I know what's going to happen now, so people are going to clip this and they're, they're going to go out. See, there's Reuben sitting with another homophobe right to his face sitting in his house where he lived. You like hanging out with homophones. It's just like, I don't, I mean, I said it to Ben, so I'll say it to you like, as long as you're not trying to legislate my life, I don't care. Yeah. Maybe there's a part of me that I'm like, maybe I should care more. Should I be more offended? Or something like that.

Speaker 2:          30:24          Don't, well, I think part of it too is one, you want to be left alone like so many people like Christians due to go live your life. Yeah, you want to be left alone. And I think also, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but a lot of the problem that especially Christians see on the left is that they conflate sexuality with identity. And so if I disagree with your relationship from a Christian perspective, um, then that must mean that I hate you, but I don't hate you. I think that you're a great person. I think you're a smart person and your husband's awesome. And so they, a lot of people on the left seem to not be able to separate those two things. That I can love you as a person and respect you and admire you as a person and not agree from my own Christian perspective with your relationship.

Speaker 2:          31:05          Now I also think it's important to say though, it's not. If I were to what Christians would say witness to you, if I were to share the gospel with you, it would not be, hey Dave, you're gay. And that's wrong. That would not be the message. What we believe that unbelievers, people who are not Christians are repenting from when they come to Christ is unbelief. It is not your primarily your primary San is that you're gay or that you are a thief or that's your anything else. It's that you don't believe in Christ. And so that's what we believe, that we are preaching the Gospel to unbelievers to be saved, not a gay people, to make them straight. Now we do believe that through sanctification, uh, that we all have to repent from our sense. But, uh, I think it's important also to distinguish that, that what we're talking about salvation and sharing the gospel with people. It's not necessarily saying, uh, our primary message isn't that you're gay and that's bad.

Speaker 1:          31:58          Yeah. What do you think people could just stop being gay if they repented and stuff?

Speaker 2:          32:03          Well, I know two different stories. There is a really good book by someone who I totally disagree with and so many ways in so many ways, but, uh, she, she wrote a good book. Now, she probably wouldn't say that, oh God makes people straight, but it's called gay girl. Good God. It's by Jackie Hill Perry. And she did live life as a gay person and then she kind of had an awakening. She came to God and she's married and she has kids. There are stories like that, but I also know stories of people. Um, there is another amazing story and I don't want to say the title because I'm a, I don't want to say the title, but there is another story of, of someone who became a Christian. He lived life as a gay person. He actually was in prison, um, and he lived life as a gay person and he at became a Christian and he lives, as far as I know, he loves to sell a bit lifestyle. And so he is not married. He is probably never going to be married. He might not ever be attracted to women, but because he is a Christian and Jesus has called us to deny ourselves whatever our desires are that are simple, uh, he loves the celibate lifestyle. And so I think

Speaker 1:          33:11          this strikes me as deeply sad. Like I can get it. Yeah. You know, like I really like, you know, I'm pretty tolerant about this stuff. Obviously that one just strikes me as he, he is gay. He, there is this religious piece of him in there that, so the answer is then live alone and don't have kids and don't have a family.

Speaker 2:          33:30          Yeah. But that is where you start completing sexuality with identity and romantic relationships with the ultimate fulfillment. And that's not what the Christian beliefs actually Paul says for everyone, it's better to be single than to be married. Um, he says, I wish you were all like I was. So you can be fully dedicated to the Lord and we believe that if you're straight or gay straight or you're same sex attracted, then the gift of celibacy is truly a gift that you can dedicate all of your passions to God. Um, so we don't see celibacy as this sad, awful lonely thing. We believe that in Christ you have full fulfillment, full satisfaction, whether you are attracted to the opposite sex or the same sex. And so I think he would tell you, great person had on, I'll tell you his name, but, uh, I would think he would tell you that he finds full satisfaction and full of joy and his relationship with Christ. Now that does not mean it's easy.

Speaker 1:          34:19          Right? Well, I was gonna say he would also sort of have to say that to rationalize his existence, right? Like

Speaker 2:          34:24          may I, I don't know. I'd be happy to have the conversation. I'm not sure that he would, I don't think he would have chosen because he was living and actively gay lifestyle. His name's Christopher. You won. And I think he's incredible. I don't think he would have chosen to be a Christian or I don't think he would have become a Christian. Um, if he didn't think that there was something to it, if he didn't think that it was worth it. I mean, he's seeing the two alternatives and he chose one direction. So he obviously thinks that one is more satisfying than the other. I mean, he got nothing out of, at least hand to bully in this life saying, okay, I'm going to give that up. And become a Christian.

Speaker 1:          35:02          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          35:03          So it makes you wonder, it does make you wonder. It should make you wonder about Christianity. What is it about Jesus that would make someone give up what they thought their identity was? Where the world says, well, that's where love is, is just being yourself and loving who you want to love. What kind of God, what is their degree.
