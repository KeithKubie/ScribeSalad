00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.890
A [inaudible] Jad here.

2
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:06.840
This is WNYC's radio lab.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.040
Prior to the station Id we were listening to a conversation between two Roberts,

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.960
Robert Number one is right here with me,

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.060
Mr Krulwich [inaudible] and Robert too is a what we'll hear from him morning

6
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:21.460
moment. Robert's Polski, Stanford University professor.

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.380
The topic of that conversation and of our show is stress,

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.810
stress then and stress. Now

9
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.990
as we heard stress then would count is something like being chased across the

10
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.310
Savanna by a saber tooth tiger stress now standing in the wrong line at the

11
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:39.144
supermarket.

12
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.650
Very different kinds of stress separated by thousands of years of human

13
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:44.191
experience,

14
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:49.191
but to the body they are the same and too many false tiger alerts will make you

15
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:54.930
sick. Now that right there, the connection between stress and sickness,

16
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.790
how that connection was made is an interesting story which involves lots of

17
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:03.080
people. Let's start with one Dr. Paul j Roshan,

18
00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:07.550
president of the American Institute of stress and I've been involved in stress

19
00:01:07.551 --> 00:01:12.551
research for well over 50 years and it was around 50 years ago that Dr. Rush and

20
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:15.290
a few colleagues meet an interesting discovery.

21
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.740
They took a bunch of rodents and did some well,

22
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.120
not so nice things to them like sewing back the eyelids of mice and shining

23
00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:27.140
lights in their eyes and definitely noises. When we put them on treadmills,

24
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.380
I left them out on the roof of the medical school in the cold wintery Canadian

25
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:34.124
blizzards.

26
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.440
We throw the animals into water so they would have to constantly swim.

27
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.180
You would do that for hours or days until they were too weak and then measure

28
00:01:44.181 --> 00:01:45.560
their hormonal secretion.

29
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.690
Anything that would be a severely noxious threat or challenge.

30
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.610
If there's any justice in the world,

31
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:57.530
this guy's going to rat hell is going to be some rodent named Alice stitching

32
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.340
his eyeballs, but let's go on. But in the name of science,

33
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:06.260
what Russian company noticed is that every different type of cruel torture

34
00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:09.980
technique they did to these poor runs resulted in the same outcome.

35
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.990
They got sick and sick in the same way, sort of a flu like symptoms.

36
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.490
Furthermore,

37
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.350
we quickly learned that it wasn't necessary to do these horrible things to get

38
00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:22.640
almost the same effect.

39
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
Now they could get the same effect by merely frustrating the rats,

40
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.870
put their food out and then before the Ras get it taken away,

41
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.630
then put it out again. Then Ooh, thought you had it. Take it away again.

42
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.730
Just by doing that over and over,

43
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:38.330
that would make some of the rats and some of them could cope and right. The Cup.

44
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.240
Yeah. Well, this is Robert. Supposedly the professors has been helping us along,

45
00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:44.180
says that human beings break down and pretty much the same categories.

46
00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:49.181
There are some people who can be challenged by all the daily experiences and

47
00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:54.551
they just kind of glide through it and there are other people like you who get

48
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:59.060
furious. Just furious. Key thing really is the hostility.

49
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.460
It's the hostility

50
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.460
<v 1>and it's a particular style that may seem very familiar to our New York</v>

51
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:08.800
metropolitan area listening ship. And I see this as a native New Yorker,

52
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:13.801
but it's the style called toxic hostility where just everything in the world

53
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:16.510
around you confirmed they're out to get you.

54
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.760
They're out to get you preferentially.

55
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.900
Every elevator door that closes before you get there is proof.

56
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:27.880
The person inside who could've stopped it but chose not to is out to stab you in

57
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:31.000
the back. And this is a really, really hostile world out there.

58
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.250
And this is the way of life. This is two which everyone says it is. It's true.

59
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.630
That is how the world is. Um, and some people have this,

60
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.360
it DIYers sort of in a dire sort of way.

61
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.900
And I suppose his point is that the people who do have it in a dire sort of way,

62
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.850
you get sick. Yeah. There's a,

63
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.080
a kind of anger and style that is so bad for your nervous system that's like

64
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:57.790
worse than smoking. I mean, literally with me,

65
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.000
this is what is famously called type a behavior.

66
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.590
Type A was first described by these two cardiologists, Friedman and Rosenman.

67
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.880
That's my Friedman Ray Rosamund and they came up with this idea in the 1950s

68
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.910
their original version was your hostel time pressured and patient low self

69
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:17.680
esteem, joy, less striving.

70
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:22.520
All you live for is to check things off your to do list and you know,

71
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.100
this is what they were originally saying greatly increases your risk of heart

72
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:32.020
disease and cardiologists hated these guys for this simple reason.

73
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:35.770
Your son like Ozzie and Harriet Eisenhower era cardiologist and all,

74
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:39.310
you think about his like heart valves and blood lithics and here's these guys

75
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:40.150
saying no,

76
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.940
you got to sit down your patients and talk to them and find out if they've

77
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:44.650
picked the wrong line in the supermarket.

78
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.790
Did they go berserk at that point and it took decades for it to become clear

79
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:50.150
that this really is for real. Yeah.

80
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.890
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

81
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.981
<v 1>well,</v>

82
00:04:52.981 --> 00:04:56.880
here are two cardiologists proposing that you are more likely to get a heart

83
00:04:56.881 --> 00:04:57.540
attack,

84
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.780
not based on the size of your veins or whatever's passing through your butt,

85
00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:04.950
but on the kind of guy or kind of gal you are. Exactly.

86
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.510
How did they come to this peculiar insight? Okay, this is,

87
00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:13.080
this is where this great story comes from and I wouldn't have believed it except

88
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.230
it was told to me by Friedman himself and appropriately sheepishly.

89
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.310
Um, so this was back in the 50s,

90
00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:23.520
and they've got this cardiology practice and everything's going great,

91
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.210
except apparently they had this one problem which they were having to spend a

92
00:05:27.211 --> 00:05:31.590
fortune reupholstering the arm chairs in their office, in the,

93
00:05:31.591 --> 00:05:34.590
in the office, in their waiting room. What's this about?

94
00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:36.240
They had no idea that they paid no attention to it.

95
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.970
It's part of the overhead thing at this upholstery who comes every month.

96
00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:42.210
It's got to fix a couple of chairs every month. Every month. Yeah.

97
00:05:42.211 --> 00:05:46.140
So one month you pollster is out on vacation, replacement upholstery comes in,

98
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.710
takes one look at the chairs and discovers type a personality,

99
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.190
<v 3>presenting great moments in will. Never come up post spreads.</v>

100
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.740
<v 1>He says, what the Hell was wrong with your patients? Nobody wears ax.</v>

101
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.990
Here's this way and the guys absolutely right.

102
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:09.050
They still have one chair which I hope they are going to give to the Smithsonian

103
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.160
and what it is is the front two inches of the seat Christian and the front two

104
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:17.450
inches of the armrests are totally shredded and the rest of the chairs fine. Mm

105
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.880
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

106
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.120
<v 1>I do. My shredded is like ripped. That's where the tears are.</v>

107
00:06:22.121 --> 00:06:25.240
It's not evenly distributed and their nails and do it or something.

108
00:06:25.241 --> 00:06:28.840
Well basically what you've got there is the type a profile.

109
00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:33.430
The person literally sitting on the edge of their seat and squirming and fussing

110
00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:37.750
with the arm chairs and clawing and none of this were on the chair distributed

111
00:06:37.751 --> 00:06:41.500
over the entire budget range of weight, displacement of it.

112
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.690
People are sitting there on the edge of their seats.

113
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.210
So the upholsterer says to the cardiologist,

114
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.300
there's something wrong with the people in your waiting room. Exactly.

115
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.853
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

116
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.160
<v 1>and what's supposed to happen at this point?</v>

117
00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:57.160
This is supposed to be this epiphanal moment and one of these winds up in the

118
00:06:57.161 --> 00:06:57.730
textbooks.

119
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.380
If like midnight conferences between upholsterers and cardiologists or like they

120
00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:05.230
do these huge surveys in young, idealistic,

121
00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:08.680
upholsters sweep across America and discover, you know,

122
00:07:08.681 --> 00:07:12.490
you don't see chairs like these and a podiatrists office owning the cardiac.

123
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.120
That's what's supposed to happen. Here's where Friedman says,

124
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.660
get this guy out of my face. I need to see patients. I'm this important guy.

125
00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:22.690
Give him his damn check. He was to type Adal, listen to the guard.

126
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.970
So he threw the balls to her out. He but give him this check,

127
00:07:27.971 --> 00:07:29.710
get them Outta here. In five years later,

128
00:07:29.711 --> 00:07:33.100
they're doing these studies with these psychologists and out pops the type a

129
00:07:33.101 --> 00:07:37.360
profile and they say, oh my God, the upholster he was right. To this day,

130
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.890
they have no idea who the man was.

131
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.460
And I'm willing to bet that like there's this 95 year old upholster guy in some

132
00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:49.420
bar in San Francisco right now who's droning on about how he discovered type a

133
00:07:49.421 --> 00:07:51.460
personality and it's absolutely true.

134
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.673
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

135
00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.160
listen what search have yet to reveal the identity of that replenishment uphold.

136
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.943
Okay.

137
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:09.300
This story has been brought to you by the American upholstery association

138
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:14.100
dedicated to find clock fine furniture under healthier America.

139
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.360
<v 4>My name is Charles Young and I do a pulse rate,</v>

140
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.380
which you're working on here. Well, I'm doing a rocker.

141
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.110
It's a nice gesture actually. It just,

142
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.960
they water seed all the way down to the wood.

143
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.480
Sometime the things are so bad that they said,

144
00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:37.210
oh please cover it before you take it.

145
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.540
Cause I don't want people in the building know how bad my furniture room.

146
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.610
But I'm saying, how could you live like this in your own house? It's a mess.

147
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.910
It's a mess. We couldn't find the guy, the Taipei guy.

148
00:08:54.911 --> 00:08:55.990
But in the process of looking, you

149
00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.540
<v 0>ran across Charles Young and in this messy stressful world,</v>

150
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.200
his lower east side studio is a window onto calmer times.

151
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.050
<v 4>A long time ago there was um,</v>

152
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:13.110
Straw inside of the dual stuff. Hold on from the SIF.

153
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.043
So stuff,

154
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.320
this is a photograph of an old chair like was made about a hundred years ago.

155
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.430
I don't remember if you can see that, but there's Straw inside there.

156
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.100
All stuff is a class to it and you don't mind working on it. The new stuff

157
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:38.560
is not that big and little stuff is all badly put together,

158
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.780
stapled together so we can't fix it.

159
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.433
<v 5>Oh,</v>

160
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.140
<v 4>because everything we do with throw away and go buy a new,</v>

161
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.573
<v 5>okay.</v>

162
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.740
<v 1>It's not the glamorous job in the world, but it's a job.</v>

163
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.013
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

164
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.900
<v 4>People don't want to learn how to do a pulse for it.</v>

165
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.300
<v 1>It's a dying art,</v>

166
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.050
<v 0>so I don't know what they gonna do.</v>

167
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.093
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

168
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.940
<v 0>do you want to know about upholstery?</v>

169
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.300
Visit Charles Young owner of CYA upholstery company on the lower east side.

170
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.220
He's been doing it for decades.

171
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.560
My best customers are adults and they chew up people far too,

172
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.260
which is absolutely one. Charlie spoke with producer Ellen Horn.

173
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.580
You've got to go Chad here with Robert Krulwich.

174
00:10:41.581 --> 00:10:45.030
Today on radio lab. We are looking at stress,

175
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:49.410
the effects of stress on chairs and on us

176
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.780
<v 1>to get back to our bodies for just a second.</v>

177
00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:54.420
Remember before we said that when you get scared and you're going to make a

178
00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:55.021
presentation,

179
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:58.620
your mouth goes dry because your digestive system is beginning to shut down.

180
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.120
It's also true that if you're very, very nervous that you wouldn't know this.

181
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.770
You stop growing

182
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.243
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

183
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:13.710
<v 1>and this is even for a very little bit of time, a short spurt of panic.</v>

184
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.490
We'll create a short spurt of nun growth that's on one end.

185
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.870
But just professor Robertson [inaudible] supposedly expose someone to a lot of

186
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:24.330
continuing stress and add an extreme.

187
00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:27.090
You got one of the truly bizarre outposts in medicine.

188
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.720
This disease of kids who stopped growing for reasons of psychological stress,

189
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.900
meaning they are so nervous about whatever it is that their system doesn't is

190
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.720
spends all the time pumping and palpitating and doing all this again,

191
00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:42.330
no growing saying grow tomorrow, grow tomorrow, tomorrow.

192
00:11:42.331 --> 00:11:46.520
This has no time for it. And it's well documented. This is not Ooh,

193
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.610
fourth grade teacher who is mean and yells at the kids.

194
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.600
This is like nightmare police and the social workers breaking down the door of

195
00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:58.750
the apartment, sort of nightmare stuff. Um, and amazingly,

196
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:01.930
you get the kids out of those settings and often they will start growing again.

197
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:03.041
Okay.

198
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:08.041
So you read up a lot about this and there's this weird pattern I had noted in a

199
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:09.970
lot of these unreadable chapters,

200
00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:12.430
which is they would make reference to Peter Pan

201
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:16.020
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

202
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.590
<v 1>They would start with a quote from Peter Pan or some snide comments about</v>

203
00:12:19.591 --> 00:12:22.410
Tinkerbell. And I'd seen this for years. I had no idea what this was about.

204
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.940
To one day I finally found the next

205
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:25.663
<v 5>shit,</v>

206
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.580
<v 1>eight year old kid growing up in Victorian England.</v>

207
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:34.170
One day he sees his beloved 12 year old brother killed in front of them.

208
00:12:34.171 --> 00:12:36.960
Horrible accident. This destroys the family.

209
00:12:36.961 --> 00:12:39.120
And this was the mother's favorite child who dies,

210
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.540
takes to her bed in this Victorian swoon for the next 10 years.

211
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.320
Totally ignoring this child, growing up in this emotional isolation,

212
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.180
these horrible scenes.

213
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.940
The boy comes in with a tray of food for his mother and she's going on, oh,

214
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:55.440
David David, is that you, David? If you come to me, David, the dead son.

215
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.620
So the second has left standing in the door doors like, Gee, it's only me.

216
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.880
It's me. It's me. Sorry, I'm not David. Sorry, I'm not David. Sorry.

217
00:13:02.881 --> 00:13:04.200
It wasn't me. Instead of him.

218
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.890
Only thing she apparently ever spoke to him about was this crazy idea she

219
00:13:07.891 --> 00:13:12.570
grabbed on to, which was if David had to die, at least he was still a boy.

220
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.960
He's not one of these boys who grows up and doesn't need his mother anymore.

221
00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:18.510
He'll always be my perfect little boy cause he didn't grow up.

222
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.830
He didn't grow up in to grow up.

223
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:28.170
This kid hears this with a vengeance and stops growing. At that point,

224
00:13:28.171 --> 00:13:32.670
he lives to be 60 years old, under five foot tall, unconsummated marriage,

225
00:13:32.671 --> 00:13:36.780
complete maturational arrested. He hit puberty. He did.

226
00:13:36.781 --> 00:13:39.060
He grew facial hair. Um,

227
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.780
but most indications are not a whole lot of other secondary sexual

228
00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:45.390
characteristics. And as an adult,

229
00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:48.810
this was the author of the much beloved children's classic Peter Pan.

230
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.470
This was Jim Berry, the guy who wrote Peter Pan, who was a very,

231
00:13:55.471 --> 00:14:00.471
very troubled man who among other things just endlessly turned out plays and

232
00:14:01.231 --> 00:14:05.640
novels and whatevers about boys and Diane come back as ghosts and marry their

233
00:14:05.641 --> 00:14:08.070
mothers and all sorts of adipose stuff like that.

234
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.910
Sadomasochistic fantasy stuff with the little boys. All,

235
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.540
all through his writings, his private writings. This was a very,

236
00:14:15.541 --> 00:14:20.310
very troubled man who did not deal very well with the consequences of this for

237
00:14:20.311 --> 00:14:21.144
the rest of his life.

238
00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:43.210
<v 5>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

239
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:48.210
<v 6>coming up the therapeutic benefits of screaming naeing and beating the crap out</v>

240
00:14:49.051 --> 00:14:49.500
of someone.
