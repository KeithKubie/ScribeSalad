00:00:02.575 --> 00:00:03.450
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.830
Lecture 17 was about folding
polygons into polyhedra,

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.520
and today we will do it
with real pieces of paper.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.697
But before we get
there, I want to talk

00:00:12.697 --> 00:00:14.030
about some things we could make.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.320
In lecture, I demonstrated
this perimeter having technique

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.360
where you take
any convex polygon

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.580
and you pick any point
on the perimeter.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.040
Then you measure out the
perimeter halfway on each side.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.890
You get the antipodal point, y.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.940
And then just
glue-- locally, you

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.210
glue everything
around x and around y.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.420
So I mean, you just start.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.920
We call this zipping where you
don't glue any extra material

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.490
in here, you just start
zipping these guys together.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.590
I guess these circles or when
you happen to hit this vertex,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.842
well, then you just keep
going-- zip, zip, zip, zip, zip.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.600
So that's one thing we could
make with convex polygons.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.430
Slightly more general
is called a pita form.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.810
This is defined in the textbook.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.700
And the idea is instead
of a convex polygon,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.760
you could take any convex body.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.760
It could have some corners
or it could be smooth.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.980
So this is what
we call a convex,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.480
or what I'm going to call
today a convex 2D body, meaning

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.255
it can be smooth in
addition to polygonal.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.170
And then you pick any
point on the boundary

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.470
and you measure out the
perimeter halfway, x and y,

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.040
and you glue in
exactly the same way.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.970
Now, it does not follow
from Alexandrov's theorem

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.540
that this will make
a convex thing,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.220
but it follows from a
slightly more general form

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.080
of Alexandrov's theorem called
Alexandrov-Pogorelov theorem.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.040
So Pogorelov was a
student of Alexandrov

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.740
and he edited some things
that Alexandrov wrote,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.960
but then also Pogorelov
wrote his own papers

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.540
and proved some
stronger versions

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.040
of Alexandrov's theorem that
hold for smooth bodies, not

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.220
just polygonal folding.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.760
So Alexandrov's
theorem, you recall,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.940
if you have a convex
polyhedral metric homeomorphic

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.200
to a sphere, then it's realized
by a unique convex polyhedron.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.940
So the Pogorelov's extension
is that if you have everything

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.520
except the polyhedral
part-- so if you

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:03.880
have a convex metric
homeomorphic to a sphere-- so

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.444
topologically it's a sphere,
but we omit the polyhedral part.

00:03:08.444 --> 00:03:10.735
So polyhedral was that you
have finitely many vertices.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.850
In some sense, I have
infinitely many vertices,

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.920
infinitesimal curvature
at every point here.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:39.410
Then it's realized by a
unique convex 3D body.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.793
So same concept of
a convex object.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.153
Well, I should say this
is really the surface of.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.150
So a convex body, I should
probably define that.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.390
Convex body is one where
you take any two points

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.890
and you draw a
straight line and you

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.050
stay within the body for
the entire straight line.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.290
So that's convex.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.704
You take any two points,
like this one and this one,

00:04:08.704 --> 00:04:10.620
draw a line between them,
and you stay inside.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.660
The body is the piece of
paper we're gluing up.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.480
Here we have a 3D
body, but then we

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.580
just look at the surface
of it, the boundary.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.950
And that's going to be
the surface we make.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.704
Technically, that
surface is not convex.

00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:32.120
It's the interior that's convex
because you can draw lines

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.411
through it and you stay inside.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.140
This is exactly the same thing,
but instead of polyhedron here,

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.680
we have body because we didn't
have finitely many vertices.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.660
And I'm not going to
prove this theorem.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.390
But existence is
basically the same proof.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.460
You just take a limit.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.020
So you can polygonalize
with lots of little edges

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.340
here, add little points,
and take the limit

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.150
as that approximation gets very,
very close to the actual curve.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.770
At all times you
have a polyhedron,

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.780
it's easy to show you will
converge to a convex body.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.850
The uniqueness is the
harder part, I believe.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.020
I haven't read the proof,
but it was more challenging.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.210
I think that took 20 years
or so to settle uniqueness.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.020
Alexandrov's like 1950.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.750
This theorem I think is
1973 the final version.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.230
But the version without unique
was proved back in 1950.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.820
So that's something
else we can do.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.410
Instead of cutting
out a polygon,

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.585
we can cut out a nice smooth
thing or you can add some kinks

00:05:36.585 --> 00:05:37.820
and be smooth elsewhere.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.540
As long as it's
convex, then you're

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.370
guaranteed that-- we're
only gluing together

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.535
two convex points.

00:05:45.535 --> 00:05:48.620
It could be flat or it
could be strictly convex,

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.210
which means we'll have at most
360 degrees of material at any

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.780
point because it's always
doing two at most 180's.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.820
And so we will have
a convex metric,

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.100
meaning always at most 360
of material everywhere.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.820
So then this theorem applies
so we'll get a unique thing.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.380
Another thing we could
make is called a D-form.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.350
And I have some examples
of D-forms here.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.494
So the idea with the D-form is
you take two convex 2D bodies--

00:06:21.494 --> 00:06:23.660
so here they have some
straight parts and some curve

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.500
parts-- of the same perimeter.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.470
I pick one point from one
body and I pick another point

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.750
from the other body.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.290
I attach them there.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.230
And then I zip.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.014
So it would be zip,
zip, zip, zip, zip.

00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:42.950
Wherever my fingers
were at the same time,

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.120
those are points that
get glued together.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.750
And this is with the
convex body you get.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.260
Again, Alexandrov-Pogorelov
applies because we're still

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.844
only gluing two convex
points together at any point.

00:06:54.844 --> 00:06:56.760
As long as these guys
have matching perimeter,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.700
we'll be OK.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.060
And so we will get a
unique convex 3D body.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.370
In this case, we get
this fun kind of shape.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.390
So this is what I
suggest you make.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.350
D-forms tend to look a
little bit cooler somehow

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.910
because they have two polygons.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.680
And the one that's
particularly easy to build

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.534
is two copies of the
same shape, but then you

00:07:20.534 --> 00:07:22.200
don't want to glue
corresponding points.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.445
Like if I glued this
point to that point,

00:07:24.445 --> 00:07:26.320
I would just get a flat,
doubly covered thing

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.334
and that's boring.

00:07:27.334 --> 00:07:28.750
But you just pick
some other point

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.920
and glue it to
non-matching points,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.170
then it acts like you have
two very different convex

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.770
bodies which is kind of cool.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.390
I have some images
of D-forms here.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.780
There's actually a whole book
on D-forms by John Sharp.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.160
They're invented by this guy
Tony Wills who's an artist.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.720
At the top, the
quote is, "there is

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.940
no such thing as
an ugly D-form."

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.400
So we are guaranteed
success here.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.650
And also it says, "they
surprise, confuse,

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.580
can be addictive.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.830
They're an intellectual virus.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.950
Beware."

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.510
So you've been warned.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.420
This is Tony Wills,
the inventor.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.300
Now, from the
artistic perspective,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.470
you don't have to start
from convex polygons.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.690
We're going to start
from convex bodies

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.230
because they're
guaranteed to work.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:19.210
If you're careful to satisfy
Alexandrov-Pogorelov,

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.072
you can have a convex
metric even though you

00:08:21.072 --> 00:08:24.940
start from nonconvex bodies,
although in this case,

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.050
he's actually getting
nonconvex shapes as well.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.285
More typical D-form is
something like this.

00:08:29.285 --> 00:08:33.600
This is made from two ellipses
and he builds them out

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.299
of metal.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:40.520
This is a simulation by
this guy Kenneth Brakke

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.530
who has this software
called Surface Evolver.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.230
And it's usually used for
computing minimal services,

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.800
soap bundles and
things like that.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.270
But here it's computing
what D-forms look like,

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.750
approximately.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.160
And so this is an example
of taking two ellipses

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.090
and instead of-- if you
glue at matching points,

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.770
they would be flat-- but
then you change the rotation.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.080
So here, they're rotated by 22.5
degrees, rotated by 45 degrees,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.830
rotated by 90 degrees, so
you get this nice continuum

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.780
of different things that
you could zip together.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.750
So I propose we make some.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.180
And so you have your
scissors and tape.

00:09:20.742 --> 00:09:25.470
If you don't have two sheets of
paper, get some from the front.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.112
And so everyone have
scissors, tape, everything?

00:09:28.112 --> 00:09:29.570
We're going to have
to share a bit.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:37.830
So what we want to do is make
two identical convex shapes.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.460
So you have some here.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.270
Two rectangles are
valid convex shapes.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.000
You could cut not all.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.990
Everyone should do
something different.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.800
I'm just going to make sure
they're nicely aligned.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.190
Hold on tight because you
don't want them to let go,

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.110
and then just cut.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.420
Always turn left
with your cutting.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.750
You can be smooth.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.708
You can have some corners,
what you want to do.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.115
Just always turn left.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.702
And once you have your two
shapes, you pull them apart.

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:20.660
Make sure you do not glue
corresponding points.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:27.330
Pick some other points and
attach them together with tape.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.000
Here's where it gets a
little bit challenging.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.590
With smooth curves, it's little
harder to tape them together,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.030
so you're probably going to
have to use a bunch of points

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:44.955
of tape, so to speak,
not literal points.

00:10:44.955 --> 00:10:46.516
And I just tape, tape, tape.

00:11:25.296 --> 00:11:26.796
Before you get all
the way, you want

00:11:26.796 --> 00:11:29.295
to make sure you can still
pop it up and be convex.

00:11:29.295 --> 00:11:30.190
I think we'll be able to
do that by [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.582
inside the limit.

00:11:37.038 --> 00:11:38.030
Give me some scissors.

00:11:48.942 --> 00:11:50.450
All right.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.440
There's my D-form.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.114
Mostly convex, kind of fun.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.200
So a funny thing you'll
notice about D-forms,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.980
if you made yours
smooth-- so if you don't

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.760
have any kinks on the
outer boundary-- then

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.640
the surface looks smooth,
which is kind of nice.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.900
The other thing is there's
this noticeable seam where

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.381
you taped things.

00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:23.880
There, you're not
smooth, obviously.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.530
You've got a crease
along the seam.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:31.640
But also it looks like all
that the surface is doing

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.790
is kind of taking
the convex hull,

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:37.339
the envelope of that seam.

00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:38.880
So there's two
properties we observe.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.850
One is that it looks
smooth, except at the seam.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.160
And the other is
that the hull surface

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.040
is the convex hull
of the 3D seam.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.910
And I want to prove
both of those things.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.200
Those are both true facts.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.500
But first I need to
define some things.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.300
So we're going to
prove that D-forms

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.780
are smooth and
other good things.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.710
This is a paper
that was originally

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:12.485
a class project in this
class, I think in 2007.

00:13:12.485 --> 00:13:13.640
Sounds about right.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.955
Submitted during class, it looks
like, or just after semester

00:13:16.955 --> 00:13:19.030
with Greg Price.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.560
D-form have no spurious creases.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.080
So what's a D-form?

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.340
You take two, for
us, it's going to be

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.900
two convex shapes
of equal perimeter.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.810
You glue two points, two
corresponding points P and Q

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:36.341
together, and then
you zip from there.

00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:38.590
We can actually talk about
something even more general

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.230
which we'll call a seam form.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.890
A seam form, you can have
multiple convex shapes.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.130
It's a little harder
to imagine, but you

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.820
can join multiple
points together.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.150
Maybe you join all three
of those corners together.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.650
As long as you have at most
360 of material everywhere,

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:06.780
it'll be fine.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.594
Maybe do some zipping.

00:14:09.594 --> 00:14:12.010
I'm not going to try to figure
out exactly how this gluing

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.843
pattern works, but you
find a gluing pattern

00:14:13.843 --> 00:14:15.540
where you don't
violate anything.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.451
So it looks like
if I do this one,

00:14:17.451 --> 00:14:19.200
I better have these
guys also a little bit

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:25.522
sharp so that they don't add
up to too much angle there.

00:14:25.522 --> 00:14:27.480
So these three points
would also join together.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.410
This would be like three
petals in like a seed pod

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.510
or something, like those leaves
that wrap around little fruits

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.880
or something.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.860
I won't try to draw it but--
I guess I will try to draw it.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.190
Something like this.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:51.980
So that's a thing.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.190
This could even fold
not exactly a sphere,

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:55.590
but something like a sphere.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:58.594
So seam forms, you could have
any number of convex shapes

00:14:58.594 --> 00:15:00.260
and glue them together
however you want,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.020
provided at all points you
satisfy Alexandrov-Pogorelov,

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.450
so you only have at most
360 degrees of material

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.310
and you are
topologically a sphere.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:10.482
Then you have a seam form.

00:15:10.482 --> 00:15:12.690
So most of the theorems I'm
going to talk about apply

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:16.120
to general seam forms, but we're
interested in D-forms and pita

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.110
forms in particular.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:25.200
So let me tell you some
theorems about seam forms.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:35.560
Theorem 1 is that
a seam form equals

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:45.330
convex hull of its seams.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.330
So the seams in
general are these parts

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.740
where you did gluing,
wherever you taped stuff.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.550
The boundaries of the convex
polygons, those are the seams.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.607
They map to some curves in 3D.

00:15:55.607 --> 00:15:57.190
If you take the
convex hull, the claim

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:00.129
is you get the entire seam form.

00:16:00.129 --> 00:16:01.670
That's actually
pretty easy to prove.

00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:09.540
Then the second
claim is there aren't

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:13.010
many creases other than
the seams of course.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.885
The seams are usually
going to be creased.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.305
And these creases are
going to be line segments.

00:16:25.956 --> 00:16:28.080
And not just any line
segments, but their endpoints

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.871
are pretty special.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.070
So the claim is that
the creases have

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:07.530
to be line segments basically
connecting strict vertices.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.930
What do I mean by strict vertex?

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.829
Something like these three
points which come together,

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:17.380
provided the total angle here
is strictly less than 360.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.760
I call that a strict vertex.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:24.540
Whereas these points
connecting from here to here,

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.290
those don't count
as strict vertices.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.530
They do have curvature, but
only infinitesimal curvature.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.610
Because this is essentially
180 degrees of material,

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.100
just slightly less
because it's curved.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.050
So only where I have
kinks can I potentially

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.770
have strictly less than 180.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:45.580
And if I join them together
to be strictly less than 360,

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.060
that's a strict vertex.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.254
So potentially, I have a
seam coming from here, also

00:17:50.254 --> 00:17:51.170
at the other endpoint.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:56.264
So in this picture, I might
have a crease like this,

00:17:56.264 --> 00:17:57.680
I might have a
crease like this, I

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.990
might have a crease
like this, potentially.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.460
But in something like a D-form,
there are no strict vertices.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:12.190
If these are smooth-- so I'll
assume here these are smooth.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.370
We could call it a smooth
D-form if you like.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:18.690
Then there's no vertices,
no strict vertices,

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:22.630
only these sort of
barely vertices.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.670
So there could be no creases.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.310
There's one other
situation which

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:32.059
is creases could be
tangent to seams.

00:18:32.059 --> 00:18:33.850
This should seem
impossible because the way

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:35.630
I've defined things
it is impossible.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.380
You're tangent to a seam, that
would be you're like this.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.810
How am I supposed to have
a crease inside that's

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.065
tangent to the seam?

00:18:42.065 --> 00:18:43.640
The answer is you can't.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.930
If these regions are
convex, you can't have them.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.170
This statement is actually
about a more general form

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:56.090
of seam forms where you
can have a nonconvex piece.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:59.980
So in general seam form, you
have a bunch of flat pieces

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.130
and you somehow search
for them together so

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.820
that you satisfy
Alexandrov-Pogorelov.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:09.803
And now you could
have a tangent.

00:19:09.803 --> 00:19:13.191
I could, for example, have a
crease that emanates from there

00:19:13.191 --> 00:19:14.940
or have a crease that
emanates from there.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.630
But right now, it
has nowhere to stop.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.060
The only way for these
creases to actually exist

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:23.860
is if there's a
kink here, then this

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.410
could go from there to there.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.947
So this is starting at a
vertex and ending tangent.

00:19:28.947 --> 00:19:31.280
You could, of course, also
start tangent and end tangent

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.280
if there's another bend.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.810
But the claim is,
all crease look

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.250
like that, which
means if you carefully

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.380
designed your thing
or vaguely carefully

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.460
such as a smooth
D-form, then you're

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.020
guaranteed there are no creases
which is what we observe.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.885
So this is justifying our
intuition from these examples.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:56.280
One other case is the pita form.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.430
So pita form does
actually make vertices.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.720
This point x is going to be
a strict vertex because it

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.350
has less than 180 of
material, so definitely

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.050
strictly less than 360.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:07.460
Same with y.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.090
So pita form is
potentially going

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.135
to have a seam from x
to y, but that's it.

00:20:14.135 --> 00:20:15.800
Sorry, a crease from x to y.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.290
It has at most one crease.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.390
I think most examples
we've made do

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.800
have such a crease from x to y.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:36.860
Let's prove these theorems,
or at least sketch the proofs.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.410
Don't want to get
too technical here.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:50.050
So to prove the first
part that the seam form is

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:54.680
convex hull of its seams, it's
helpful to have a tool here

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.794
which is a theorem by Minkowski.

00:20:57.794 --> 00:20:59.210
We'll call it
Minkowski's theorem,

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:00.209
although he has a bunch.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.060
Hermann Minkowski.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.660
It relates convex
things to convex hulls.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.980
It says, any convex
body is the convex hull

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.440
of its extreme points.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.460
What are extreme points?

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.610
Extreme points are points
on the surface where

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.982
you can touch just that
point with a tangent plane.

00:21:46.982 --> 00:21:48.440
So if you think of
polyhedra, these

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.087
are vertices of the polyhedra.

00:21:50.087 --> 00:21:51.920
But I want to handle
things that are smooth,

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.790
so they may might not
really have any vertices.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:57.430
In general, I have
some convex body.

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.770
If I can draw-- imagine
this is in two dimensions--

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.450
if I can draw a
tangent plane that just

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.095
touches at a single point,
then I call that point extreme.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:13.420
Let's look at an example here.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.350
Here I believe
every seam point is

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.200
going to be an extreme
point because I

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.200
can put a tangent plane.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.910
It just touches at that point.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.160
What am I distinguishing from?

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:27.390
Well, for example, this point,
this surface is developable.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:28.317
We know it's ruled.

00:22:28.317 --> 00:22:29.650
So there's a straight line here.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:34.030
You can see it in the
shadow, in the silhouette.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.510
If I said, is this
point extreme?

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.750
I try to put a tangent
plane on, the only way

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:42.100
to get a tangent plane is
to include this entire line.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.760
So it's impossible to
just hit this point

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.460
or any point along that line.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.570
In fact, every interior
point, I claim,

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.300
you cannot just hit that point.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.920
You've got to hit
an entire line.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.590
Whereas at the
seam, I can do it.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:59.360
I can angle between
this and this.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.240
There's a tangent
plane, because this

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.070
is curving, that only
hits at one point.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.630
If I had a straight
segment, then

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.859
the endpoints of the
straight segment of the seam

00:23:06.859 --> 00:23:09.400
would be extreme, but the points
in the middle of the segment

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.050
would not be extreme.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:12.850
So that's the
meaning of extreme.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.120
And we're going to
use this because I

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.445
claim that these interior
points can never be extreme.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.640
It can only be the seam
points that are extreme.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.650
And therefore, we are the
convex hull of the seam points

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:35.340
because we are the convex
hull of the extreme points.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.740
How do we argue that?

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:54.870
So I claim an extreme
point can't be locally flat

00:23:54.870 --> 00:24:03.120
and at the same time be convex,
because convex in 3D, that's

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:03.800
what we need.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:08.130
If you had a point and it
just meets a tangent plane

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:10.780
at that single point,
that means locally

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.376
you're kind of going
down from that plane,

00:24:13.376 --> 00:24:15.000
if you think of that
plane as vertical.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.700
So this is a situation.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.326
I want to prove this.

00:24:24.326 --> 00:24:26.450
To prove it, I need to
introduce another tool which

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.033
is a generally good
thing for you guys

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:29.960
to know about, so
kind of an excuse

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:35.900
to tell you about the Gauss
sphere, which I don't think we

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.350
actually cover in lectures,
but might come up again.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:40.900
Gauss sphere is a simple idea.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.770
For every tangent
plane-- let's just think

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:46.070
of this single point.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:48.400
I want to look at the-- it's
called the tangent space.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.050
Look at all the tangent
planes that touch this point.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.680
Because this
particular tangent plan

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.710
I drew only touches that one
point, it has some wiggle room.

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:01.210
I can pick any direction
and just wiggle

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.132
and rotate the plane
around this point

00:25:03.132 --> 00:25:04.840
and it won't immediately
hit the surface.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.340
I've got a little bit of time
before it hits the surface.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:12.270
So there's a two-dimensional
space of tangent planes

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.334
that touch just this point.

00:25:15.334 --> 00:25:16.750
Because there's
at least one, I've

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.070
got to have some wiggle room.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.840
So I want to draw that space.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.050
And a clean way to draw the
space is for every such plane

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:27.830
to draw a normal vector
perpendicular to the plane,

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.600
take the direction of
that normal vector,

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.650
and draw it on a sphere.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:33.670
It's a unit sphere.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:34.565
So this is a sphere.

00:25:37.049 --> 00:25:39.340
This one looks pretty vertical
so that would correspond

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.501
to the north pole of the sphere.

00:25:41.501 --> 00:25:43.500
So that direction becomes
a point on the sphere.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.030
Think of it as this vector
from the center of the sphere

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.950
to the north pole.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:50.760
But we'll just
draw it as a point.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.770
And because I've got a
two-dimensional space

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:55.550
of maneuverability or
rotatability of this plane,

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.490
I'm going to get some
region-- which maybe I

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:01.620
should draw like
this-- of the sphere.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:08.270
Those are all the
possible normal vectors

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:12.550
of tangent planes at that point.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:15.600
So this is called the Gauss map
where you map all these normals

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.080
to the Gauss sphere, which Gauss
sphere is just a unit sphere.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.010
Fun fact.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:29.870
The area of that thing,
which is the map of all

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:34.687
the tangent normal directions,
equals the curvature

00:26:34.687 --> 00:26:35.270
at that point.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.060
You may recall at
some point curvature

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.180
is actually Gaussian
curvature, so that's

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.710
why Gauss is all
over the place here.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:47.710
Now because I claim this
is a two-dimensional space,

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:49.410
this thing will
have positive area.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.890
Therefore, at this
point, that vertex

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:55.210
has positive curvature
on the surface.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:27:00.170
And yet, it was supposed
to be in the middle of one

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.150
of these flat shapes.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:03.890
That's supposed to
have zero curvature.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:05.500
Contradiction.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.720
Or stated more
positively, if I have

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.332
a point that is
an extreme point,

00:27:10.332 --> 00:27:12.040
it's only touched by
one of these planes,

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.124
I have this flexibility.

00:27:13.124 --> 00:27:14.040
Therefore, I get area.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.880
Therefore, it is
not locally flat,

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.330
so it must be a seam point.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.180
It could be one like this
where I'm barely non-flat,

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.040
but I am non-flat.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.290
There's kind of
infinitesimal curvature here.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:30.900
Or it could be one of these
points where I'm very non-flat,

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:35.890
or I guess X and Y here
are other examples of here

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:36.730
I'm very not flat.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.790
I've only got 180 degrees
of curvature roughly.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.080
So it's got to be one
of those if you're

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.360
going to be an extreme point.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.900
Therefore, all the extreme
points are seam points.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:51.120
Therefore, convex hull
of the extreme points

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:55.520
is the convex hull of the seams,
and that is your seam form.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.350
So that's part one.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.470
It's pretty easy.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:01.390
Let me tell you about part two.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.230
Part two builds on part one.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:06.780
It's one reason
why we care about.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.870
So part two is that there
are no spurious creases.

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:12.772
Unless you have strict
vertices, then you

00:28:12.772 --> 00:28:13.730
could connect those up.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:27.940
So let's look at a
locally flat crease point.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.840
Actually, at this point,
I should probably mention.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:39.660
This paper, I think of as a
forerunner to the "How Paper

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.260
Folds Between
Creases" paper which

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.500
is that hyperbolic
parabolas don't exist.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.110
You may recall there were
theorems about what creases

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.020
look like, what ruled
surfaces look like,

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.214
and so on between creases.

00:28:52.214 --> 00:28:54.630
In that setting, we've proved
things like straight creases

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.806
stay straight and all
these good things.

00:28:57.806 --> 00:28:59.180
Here, it's a little
bit different

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.190
because we have kind of
two levels of creases.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:03.570
There's the seam
which is special.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.180
And then we're imagining
hypothetical creases

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:06.960
between the seam.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.620
And could you have
a curved crease?

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.670
Claim is no.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.250
Claim is all the creases
in between the seams

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:15.236
have to be straight.

00:29:15.236 --> 00:29:16.860
And in fact, they
can't look like this.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.700
They have to be at
corners somehow.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.200
So that's what we're
going to prove.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.820
But a lot of the
same techniques,

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.650
most of the same definitions.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.155
This paper was
kind of a warm up,

00:29:25.155 --> 00:29:26.930
I feel like, for
the nonexistence

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:28.605
of hyperbolic parabolas.

00:29:28.605 --> 00:29:31.570
Although they use a
lot of the same tools.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:33.270
They have two of
the same authors,

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:35.547
but there's no
theorem that really

00:29:35.547 --> 00:29:36.630
is shared between the two.

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.960
They're not identical.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.894
So we're looking
inside a flat region.

00:29:40.894 --> 00:29:42.810
We're imagining, let's
look at a crease point.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:46.440
It lies on some crease locally.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.130
And it's a fold crease.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:53.430
So I'm going to wave
my hands a little bit.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:54.709
But imagine a folded crease.

00:29:54.709 --> 00:29:55.500
Maybe it's a curve.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.680
We don't know.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.090
It's folded by some
angle, some nonzero angle.

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:01.610
Otherwise, it's not a crease.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:06.750
So locally, it looks like
two kind of planes, at least

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.040
to the first order they're
going to be planes.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.087
Maybe something like this.

00:30:13.087 --> 00:30:14.670
I'm going to draw
the creases straight

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:17.270
because to the first
order, it is straight.

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:20.770
But it might be slightly curved.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.230
So we're looking
at a point here.

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:26.290
And my point is, it's
bent by some angle.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:28.130
So I'm going to draw
the two tangent planes.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.200
There's a tangent
plane on the right.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.190
Whatever the surface
is doing on the right,

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:33.390
there's a tangent
plane over there.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.250
Whatever the surface is doing
on the left of the crease,

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:36.090
there's a tangent plane there.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:38.480
They're not the same plane
because we are creased.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.560
Whatever the crease
angle is, that's

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.018
the angle between
these two planes.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.460
I want to look at this tangent
space again a little bit.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.410
You can think of it,
the tangent space

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:51.700
at the least it has
this tangent plane.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.880
For this point, you have
at least this tangent plane

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.540
and at least this
other tangent plane.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:31:00.180
And so in particular, you have
to have the sweep between them.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.780
So you get at least a
one-dimensional set there.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.420
Now, this can happen.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.240
So we're not going to
get a contradiction.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.740
We're not going to
suddenly discover

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.330
there's a two-dimensional area
and get that it wasn't flat.

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:12.950
But at least we've got
a one-dimensional arc.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:17.560
On the Gaussian sphere here,
we've got something like this

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.060
so far.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:21.050
This is one extreme
tangent plane on the left.

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:25.850
This is extreme tangent
plane on the right.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:28.430
These two points
correspond to those two.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.860
And then we've got
the arc of-- you

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.770
can sweep the tangent
plane around and still

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:37.740
stay outside the surface,

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.790
Well, that's interesting.

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:43.660
It's interesting because
all of those tangent planes

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:51.350
share a line, which is going to
be this line that I drew here.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.610
I mean, you look at
these two planes,

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:55.350
there's a line that they share.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:58.260
And if you rotate the
plane through that line,

00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.760
you'll still pass
through this point

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.345
and you won't hit the surface.

00:32:01.345 --> 00:32:03.770
So in fact, all those tangent
planes share this line.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:05.436
I think we actually
just need these two.

00:32:05.436 --> 00:32:07.420
So if you don't see
that, don't worry.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.860
There are these two planes.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.190
There's a line there.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.660
They're tangent,
which means that line

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:17.180
is on or outside the surface
because tangent planes don't

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:17.940
hit the surface.

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.640
I mean, they touch
the surface barely,

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.765
but they don't go interior.

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:37.900
Well, I claim that in fact the
surface must touch this line.

00:32:42.283 --> 00:32:54.750
I claim the surface,
at least locally,

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:59.060
has got to follow
along that intersection

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:08.520
line of the left and
right tangent planes.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.010
Why?

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:23.890
It comes down to this
Gaussian sphere thing.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.801
We know that the surface
lies inside these two planes.

00:33:26.801 --> 00:33:27.800
There's this wedge here.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.100
The surface must be below.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.150
We also know the surface comes
and touches it at this point.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:37.220
Could it, from here, kind of
dip down away from this line?

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.430
I claim no.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:43.980
If it dipped down, then there'd
be a third tangent plane.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.560
The tangent plane could
follow and dip down as well.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.710
And then we've got not
just a one-dimensional arc,

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:52.730
but we're actually going to get
a whole triangle in the Gauss

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:53.540
sphere.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.040
Once you have a whole triangle,
that means you weren't flat.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.562
You have positive curvature.

00:33:57.562 --> 00:33:59.520
So we're looking at a
locally flat crease point

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.120
somewhere in the middle
of one of these polygons.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.724
So in fact, you can't afford
to dip down because then you'd

00:34:05.724 --> 00:34:07.640
have at least a little
bit of curvature there.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.197
Because you have zero curvature,
you've got to stay straight.

00:34:11.197 --> 00:34:12.780
So that means that
the surface locally

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:18.860
has to exist along the
segment in both directions

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.030
until something happens.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:22.489
Now, we assumed
that our point was

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:24.420
locally flat and a crease point.

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:30.670
So the surface must
continue in this direction

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.820
until we reach a point that
is either not locally flat

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.290
or not a crease point.

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:39.659
I claim it's got to
remain a crease point.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:41.909
Because look, you're following
along this intersection

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:43.284
line of these two
tangent planes.

00:34:43.284 --> 00:34:44.490
These remain tangent planes.

00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:46.489
These are not only tangent
planes at this point.

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:48.197
They're also tangent
planes at this point

00:34:48.197 --> 00:34:50.280
and potentially any
point along this segment.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.710
As long as the surface is
here, they are tangent planes.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.670
Therefore, you are creased here.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:58.820
I mean, you can't be
smooth if you're butting up

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.500
against these two
tangent planes.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:06.180
So crease must be preserved, so
the only issue is locally flat.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:10.090
It could be at some point
you become not locally flat.

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:11.540
And that indeed happens.

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.120
That's when you hit the seam.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.010
When you hit the seam, then
you're no longer locally flat.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:18.580
So this proves the
creases must be

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:23.660
line segments between
two points on the seam.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:28.440
There's a little bit more to
prove which is it either hits

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:32.610
a strict vertex or
it's tangent to seams.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:34.810
And this basically
follows the same argument

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:39.620
that if you hit something other
than a strict vertex or a seam,

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.200
you would have positive
curvature where

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.992
you shouldn't, basically.

00:35:43.992 --> 00:35:46.331
So I'll just leave it at that.

00:35:46.331 --> 00:35:47.830
I think that's
enough for the proof.

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:51.430
You get the idea why
creases can't exist.

00:35:54.298 --> 00:35:55.760
Any questions about that?

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:06.040
I have few more questions.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:13.160
One question is, can we see
more examples of rolling belts?

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:18.700
And in some sense,
this example is

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.470
an example of a rolling belt.

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:24.340
So D-forms, you take
two, say, ellipses.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:27.010
And the seam that connects
them is a rolling belt.

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.950
And this is an illustration
of the rolling action.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:34.216
As you change, which point
glues to which point?

00:36:34.216 --> 00:36:35.340
Let's say I fix this point.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.420
I can glue to this one or
to this one or to this one

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.045
or to this one.

00:36:38.045 --> 00:36:39.370
And then I zip around.

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:42.190
That's the rolling of the belt.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:44.835
More generally,
I'll draw a picture.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.950
More generally, a rolling
belt from the viewpoint

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:57.330
of a gluing tree is that
you have basically it's

00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:03.910
like a conveyor belt
like at the airport

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:05.240
or on a tank or something.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.310
You've got treads here
and it's going to roll.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.630
So if I mark a point, let's
say I mark this point.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:13.300
And I roll it around
this way a little bit,

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.890
this point maybe
stays stationary

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:19.390
and I end up with
something like this.

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:22.230
And what that means is whatever
this guy glued to over here

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:23.490
is now over here.

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:25.960
So we're changing the gluing.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:30.880
This guy's now getting glued
to some point like this

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.520
because it kind of rolls around.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.980
So in general,
you're rolling this,

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.600
but then you're always just
gluing across this path.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.640
For this to work, every angle
out here must be less than

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.170
or equal to 180,
like the material

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:45.910
that's out on the outside.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:48.000
Remember, the gluing
tree has the outside

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.226
of the polygon in here.

00:37:49.226 --> 00:37:50.600
The inside of
polygon's out here.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.270
So all the material's
on the outside here.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.950
All of these things must be
less than or equal to 180.

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:57.885
If you can find a path
in your gluing tree

00:37:57.885 --> 00:38:00.592
where you've got less than
180 material all around you,

00:38:00.592 --> 00:38:01.800
then you can do this rolling.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.470
And no matter how you roll,
and then just glue across,

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:07.620
you will still have a valid
gluing, a valid Alexandrov

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.480
gluing.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.270
So that's what rolling
belts look like in general.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:15.890
We see them all over the
place with these D-forms.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:17.390
The simple example
I showed in class

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:22.480
was when you take a rectangle,
you glue into a cylinder.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.800
And now up here, I've
got a rolling belt.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.680
Because if you look
at the sides here,

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.680
I've got actually exactly
180 degrees of material

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.620
all around the belt.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.530
And so I could
collapse it like this

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:38.406
or I could collapse
it-- let me tape it.

00:38:38.406 --> 00:38:39.780
A little hard to
hold everything.

00:38:47.307 --> 00:38:49.640
If you look at this belt, I
could collapse it like this.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.560
Or I could roll it a little
bit and classify like that.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.990
Or I could roll it a little
bit, collapse it like that.

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:56.360
Roll it a little more.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.420
Collapse it like that.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.586
All of these are valid
gluing because they're always

00:38:59.586 --> 00:39:01.126
gluing 180 to 180.

00:39:01.126 --> 00:39:03.190
And that's what
rolling belts are.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:15.660
Does the broken applet work now?

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.420
I don't know why
it wasn't working.

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.007
Probably some conflict
with suspension

00:39:20.007 --> 00:39:21.590
or just the Java
installation was bad.

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:22.215
But here it is.

00:39:22.215 --> 00:39:24.250
It's freely available online.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:27.370
You draw your graph.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:29.550
It's a little hard to just use.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.290
It's hard to draw
an exciting example.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:33.780
Here I'll a draw a tetrahedron
because that's simple.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.900
In this case, it's abstract,
so all of these edges

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:37.670
are unit lengths.

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:38.836
It's kind of like TreeMaker.

00:39:38.836 --> 00:39:40.510
You separately
specify the lengths.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:42.100
Then you say Compute.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:47.230
And it will find, in this
case, it's a tetrahedron,

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:48.310
an equilateral.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:50.000
A regular tetrahedron
is a little hard

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.570
to see because we've got
either a weird field of view

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:55.974
or a lot of perspective here.

00:39:55.974 --> 00:39:57.390
But this is a
regular tetrahedron.

00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:01.586
You can verify that by say
making some of these lengths

00:40:01.586 --> 00:40:02.085
longer.

00:40:02.085 --> 00:40:05.810
I'll make three of them five.

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:10.010
So then this is like a pyramid.

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:11.760
Of course, we're just
essentially applying

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.460
Cauchy's rigidity theorem here
and say, oh, this uniquely

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:19.390
assembles into this
spiky tetrahedron.

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:22.480
You could, in principle,
drawn an across here

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.889
with the appropriate gluing.

00:40:23.889 --> 00:40:25.680
It's a little tricky
to draw in because you

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.270
have to also triangulate.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.010
It'd be hard to do from
scratch to compute gluings.

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.210
But in theory, especially
if you use software

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:34.001
to compute the gluings
and compute shortest

00:40:34.001 --> 00:40:36.820
path in a glued
polygon-- which we'll

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.680
be getting more to next class.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.400
Next lecture is about
algorithms for finding gluings.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.010
Then computing shortest paths.

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:47.460
Then you could use that as
input to this software which

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:51.390
will then compute what
the 3D polyhedron is.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:54.440
So that's the Alexandrov
implementation.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.410
This is by, I think, a student
of Bobenko and Izmestiev.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.440
One quick question
about-- running out

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:07.460
of time-- about
the nonconvex case.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.350
So we're doing all this work
about making convex surfaces.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:13.350
I said nonconvex
case is trivial.

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:15.690
In a sense, the decision
problem is trivial.

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:17.980
It's not an easy
theorem to prove.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:22.040
And aha, taped it up.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:26.430
It follows from what's called
the Burago-Zalgaller theorem.

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:30.320
And it says that if you tap
any polyhedral metric-- so that

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:34.190
means you take a polygon,
you glue it however you want.

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:35.409
You could even add boundary.

00:41:35.409 --> 00:41:37.950
Pick any polyhedron metrics, so
you take any polygon and glue

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:39.280
it however you want.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.750
It could have handles.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.390
It could be a doughnut.

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:43.820
It could be whatever.

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:49.290
Then it has an isometric
polyhedral realization in 3D.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.614
So there is a way-- so
we're doing it abstractly.

00:41:51.614 --> 00:41:52.780
We're gluing stuff together.

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:53.905
It's kind of topologically.

00:41:53.905 --> 00:41:55.290
We don't know what we're doing.

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:57.190
But then there is a way
to actually embed it

00:41:57.190 --> 00:42:00.790
as a polyhedral surface
in 3D without stretching

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:02.120
any of the lengths.

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.120
So it's a folding of
the piece of paper.

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.330
It could have creases in
it, will have actually

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:09.310
tons of creases in it.

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:12.622
And it has exactly the
right-- it connects

00:42:12.622 --> 00:42:14.580
all the things you want
it to connect together.

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.640
It's kind of crazy.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:21.800
Furthermore, it could
be self-crossing.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:26.020
But if your surface
is either orientable--

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:32.840
so it doesn't have any cross
caps or Mobius strips in it--

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.070
or it has boundary,
then there's even

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:38.250
a way to do without crossings.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:40.640
So that's basically all
the cases we care about.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.630
You could glue this together
into a sphere or into a disk

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:48.789
or into a torus or
two-handled torus or whatever.

00:42:48.789 --> 00:42:50.330
No matter what you
do, there is a way

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:53.930
to embed it in 3D as a
presumably nonconvex very

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:56.440
creased surface.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.830
This is a hard to prove.

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:00.570
If you're familiar
with Nash's embedding

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:02.650
theorem about embedding
Riemannian surfaces,

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:05.510
it uses a bunch of techniques
from there called spiraling

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:07.250
perturbations,
which I don't know.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.620
And one description I read
calls the resulting surfaces

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:14.730
"strongly corrugated," which
I think means tons of creases.

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:16.280
It is finitely many creases.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.220
That's the theorem.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.262
There's no bound on them.

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:19.845
As far as I know,
there's no algorithm

00:43:19.845 --> 00:43:20.860
to compute this thing.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.734
I've never seen a picture
of them, otherwise,

00:43:22.734 --> 00:43:23.750
I'd show it to you.

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:27.270
So lots of open problems
in making this real.

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:29.810
But at least the decision
problem is kind of boring.

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:30.920
You do any gluing.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.044
It will make a nonconvex thing.

00:43:33.044 --> 00:43:34.960
To find that thing is
still pretty interesting

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.430
question though.

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:38.280
That's it.
