00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.460
There have been places and periods of history,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.540
when only a congenital optimist

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.240
could have had any hope for the future of our species.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.400
Think of the end of Athens' golden age,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.340
the fall of the Roman Empire,

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.160
the petering out of the Renaissance,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.420
the end of the Enlightenment,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.800
the rise of fascism.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.840
It's when things look bleak indeed,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.880
that it pays to remember the German 19th century philosopher,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.840
Hegel.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.100
In his lectures on the philosophy of world history,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.180
published in 1830,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.480
Hegel offered us a way of looking

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.220
at the darker periods of history,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.560
that neither glosses over their pain

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.520
nor, refuses to give up hope

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.940
but intellegently helps us to understand

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.700
why Human progress cannot be linear,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.700
while encouraging us to trust

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.840
that it does occur, nevertheless.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.760
For Hegel, history moves forward

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.180
in what he termed a "Dialectical way".

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.640
A dialectic is a philosophical term

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.920
for an argument made up of three parts.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.420
A thesis, an antithesis and a synthesis.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.020
Both the thesis and the antithesis

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.980
countain parts of the truth

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.700
but they are also exaggerations and distortions

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.600
of the whole.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.180
And so, need to clash and interract until

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.720
the best elements find resolution

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.620
in a synthesis.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.360
One cannot, in short, get there in one leap.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.220
Hegel thought this pattern constantly observable

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.020
in History.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.700
The world makes progress

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.440
by lurching from one extreme to another,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.460
as it seeks to overcompensate for previous mistake.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.840
And generally requires three moves

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.960
before the right balance on any issue can be found.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.200
So, for example, the ancient Athenians discovered

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.520
the idea of individual liberty.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.340
But their regime was blind to the need

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.900
for collective discipline and organisation.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.460
The ancient Persians knew all about that

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.760
and were thereby able to conquer the Athenians

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.800
on the battlefield.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.080
Yet, they were also despotic enemies of free thought

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.860
which with time, became its own liability.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.020
It took many centuries for the correct synthesis

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.780
between liberty and discipline, to be worked out

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.920
in the form of the Roman Empire.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.600
In Hegel's own era, the stifling, unfair,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.760
18th century system of inheritage,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.640
traditionnal monarchy, had been abolished

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.920
by the French Revolution.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.000
But, what should've been a peaceful birth

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.460
of representative government

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.620
ended up in the anarchy and chaos of the Terror.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.580
This, in turn, led to the emergence of Napoleon,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.600
who restaured order, but became a military brute,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.060
trampling on the liberty he had professed to love.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.720
Only after 40 years and much bloodshed,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.640
did the modern balance, Constitution, emerge.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.100
An arrangement which more sensibly balanced up

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.300
popular representation, with the rights of minorities.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.700
Or, to take another example, the European Enlightenment

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.760
had stressed the importance of reason,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.000
but it had in many parts been sterile and reductive.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.180
The movement known as 'Romanticism'

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.880
had then swept in to assert the importance of emotion.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.260
But this had carried excesses of its own.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.700
Only eventually had a correct reconciliation

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.560
been worked out between the legitimate,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.600
competing needs of reason

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.100
and emotion.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.600
Hegel argument has a highly reassuring feel

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.920
at moments when it seems

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.020
that one kind of progress has been entirely lost.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.720
He's on hand to reassure us that we're merely seeing

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.900
the pendulum swing back for a time.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.920
But also wisely council that this was needed,

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.520
because the initial move forward had been blind

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.700
to a range of crucial insights.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.360
All sides on a matter will contain important truths,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.060
lodged amidst exaggerations and bombast.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.140
Yet, these truths will eventually be sifted out

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.800
through the wisdom of time.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.260
Hegel reminds us that big overreactions are

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.240
eminently compatible with events broadly moving

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.280
forward, in the right direction.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.360
The dark moments aren't the end.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.140
They are a challenging, but even in some ways

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.440
necessary parts of an antithesis,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.240
that will, eventually,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.980
find a wiser point of synthesis.
