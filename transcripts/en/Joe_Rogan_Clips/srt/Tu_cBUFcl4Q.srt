1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,130
The Joe Rogan experience. So did you look
at the heart before they put it in you?

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,170
Did you get a chance to see it?
No, no, no. I was out. Yeah.

3
00:00:09,171 --> 00:00:13,320
It was out by that time. Yeah.
Wow. Nope. Didn't look anything.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,460
So you wake up, lights come back on. Yep.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,570
And uh, doctors, every
wipes, they're doctors.

6
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:26,130
They're my wife's there. And
uh, it was, uh, you know,

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,250
a new day and I was like, uh,
I want, I kind of wanted to,

8
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:35,940
I kind of wanted to say,
and I told you so. Yeah.

9
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:40,590
That was the first pop. That's
hilarious. Do so told you.

10
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:41,880
So it was a funny thing to say.

11
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:45,800
Would you come back from a heart
transplant because you would be a,

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,610
you would be surprised at how many so
funny though if you did say that. So true.

13
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:52,140
So it was so many.

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,040
I got so many people and it
was overwhelming support,

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,440
but I got quite a few,
well, too many for me, uh,

16
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,920
messages with the engine. I hope you
don't make it. I hope you die and your,

17
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:07,200
I wish we did already
know stuff like that.

18
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,610
Do you feel I'm sorry for
those people now? Oh yeah.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,570
Most definitely now. Now I do, you know,

20
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,730
instead of being angry
before and I was like,

21
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,860
yeah, you don't choke the shit out of him.
But you know, now, I mean, you gotta be,

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,160
um, what, what is your,

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,230
your existence must be pretty
pitiful for you to, you know,

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,040
feel that much hate for somebody that
you don't even know, never even met.

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,540
I just can't stand Joe Rogan.
I hate him.

26
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,470
I've never met him.
My niggers sit down.

27
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,290
There's no happy people that are
doing that. It's so transparent.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,820
You gotta be pretty, you know, pump
believably miserable, miserable,

29
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,680
miserable. I'm a file of Joe Rogan
just so I can talk shit about them.

30
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,220
I don't care.
I wish Joe Rogan was off the air,

31
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,370
but I'm following every
word he says because I don't
want to miss nothing to Joe

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,380
Rogan has to say, but I hate them.
Yeah. Makes no sense, man. Well,

33
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,470
it doesn't make sense, but a lot of
people don't make sense. That's true.

34
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:16,740
People live their lives and just very
counterproductive ways and they feel like

35
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:19,140
as long as they've got something,
they're excited about that,

36
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:20,400
that they're doing something,

37
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:24,270
even if it's excited about hating
you for no reason, man. I just,

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,460
I don't get it. Time is too precious
to waste on hate. It's just foolish.

39
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,930
It's just, yeah, it's a foolish way to
exist. Yeah. I can take, they can take,

40
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:34,620
uh,

41
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,440
livers and hearts and different origins
from any nationality and switching

42
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,430
around were interchangeable.
Joe.

43
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,290
We are interchangeable or all one thing.
Yes.

44
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,960
The only thing that separates us is the
climate that we came from. That's it.

45
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,430
That's it. So, and it, it,
it, it makes racism. So

46
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,040
everything's stupid. Tribalism of stupid
across the board. The conservative

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,340
versus liberal,
that stupid southern versus northern bat.

48
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:08,350
Stupid to Asian versus black
versus Pakistani stupid.

49
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,320
It's all super. Those boots. All stupid.

50
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,900
We're are any boat dude.
We were all back there right there.

51
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,420
So, you know, we all one,
we wouldn't be entertained.

52
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,620
It's this outer shit that's on top,

53
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,570
this epidermis, the skin,
this stuff that, you know,

54
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,410
the fights and it's what
makes us interesting.

55
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,071
Shabbat it,

56
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:42,210
it's like what's fascinating to me is
that human beings came from every single

57
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:43,850
spot on the earth.
Yeah.

58
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,220
One time they originated in Africa
and spread out all over the planet.

59
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,400
Gapped individual environment. When you
meet someone from Ireland, they're white,

60
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,760
like paper. That shit's just because
there's no sun that body developed.

61
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,210
It's like a, a solar panel for vitamin
D. They're like, we've got to figure out,

62
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:04,350
I get fucking vitamin D, this black
skinny cut, no fucking son out here.

63
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,630
We don't need this melon.

64
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:07,830
And cause we're not protecting
ourselves from the sun anymore.

65
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,160
So they turned white. Yes.
Did the same exact thing.

66
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,450
Megan,
take that guy from Ireland,

67
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,760
guy from African and this
guy needs a part. It's, hey,

68
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:19,820
let me switch it up.

69
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,160
This gentleman here,

70
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,630
Graham Hancock was on my podcast
last week and he's a brilliant,

71
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:26,231
brilliant guy,

72
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:30,310
but he studies ancient civilizations
and people and one of the things that

73
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,110
they're studying now is,
um,

74
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,640
the various civilizations that we didn't
even know existed that existed in South

75
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:37,990
America.
Like huge,

76
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,800
multimillion size of population,
um,

77
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,440
civilizations in the Amazon,

78
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,740
like 20 million people living in the
Amazon at one point in time and they think

79
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:50,760
they were wiped out by Spanish explorers.
Um,

80
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,080
in European explorers that
came over game smallpox,

81
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,080
like the way they've gone wiped
out 90% of the native Americans.

82
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,440
They think the same thing happened
down there in the Amazon. It just,

83
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,800
they had huge cities down there that
European settlers had reported on.

84
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:06,010
They were just wiped out.
But the point is that we are,

85
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,230
we were everywhere and it's all one thing.
It's all humans.

86
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,630
Human race.
That's it man.

87
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:16,030
And the funny thing about white people
that are racist is that especially like I

88
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:21,031
have a neanderthal DNA does more primitive
than homosapien DNA and it's only in

89
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:26,640
white people. Like, it's kind of
funny that way, you know, cause white,

90
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,730
white racists,

91
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,390
like they have to deal with the fact
that the only white people carry that in

92
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:33,300
the Anatol shitting them.
Yeah.

93
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,330
And do you think that,
I don't think that they would find that a,

94
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:40,300
a bad thing

95
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,340
after neanderthal DNA? No, I think
they'd be a oh yeah. Oh, right. Yeah.

96
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,560
They weren't smart enough to
stick around for whatever reason.

97
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:49,630
I don't even know why,
you know,

98
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,700
they don't know if we out bred them or
we interbred with them or if we wiped

99
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:54,960
them out when they don't
even know what they,

100
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,850
they're also finding new humans there.
There's um,

101
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,900
a human they found in
Russia called a Dennis,

102
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,640
I think it's called Dennis
Sullivan is that he's had,

103
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,130
and they just found more
bones of them in Tibet.

104
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,590
So they know that these Russian people,

105
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:11,170
that was a totally distinct
sub species of human traveled,

106
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,790
traveled to Tibet. Yeah. And,

107
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,550
and neanderthals lived
for half a million years,

108
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,160
so they were around way longer than
weaver. We've only been around,

109
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:21,930
I think for a couple of hundred
thousand years. Homo sapiens. Yeah.

110
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,780
So they were around longer than us,

111
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:28,190
like by a factor of like somewhere
around 300,000 years. Yeah.

112
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,610
All over the world, man. Just
what a crazy animal we are.

113
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,410
We just travel everywhere and find
a spot and adapt. That's right.

114
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,273
We make it work.

115
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,590
Stay in a community so you can help
each other and live off each other and

116
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:46,040
adapt. And unfortunately that's
where all tribalism comes from too.

117
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,850
That we have this tight knit group and
everybody else, fuck everybody else.

118
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,210
It's US versus them. And
that's inside of us. You know,

119
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,670
we met, wouldn't it be great and, and,

120
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:01,730
and this where I don't
think that it's wrong.

121
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,710
If you're attacking guy,

122
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,410
I don't think it's wrong to be
very proud of being Italian. I,

123
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,470
and if you're a Polish guy,
I don't think it's, uh,

124
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,650
wrong to be very proud of being imposed.

125
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,010
Why can't I be proud?

126
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:21,270
Or why can't you be proud of
being whatever race you are.

127
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:22,200
You can be proud of that.

128
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:27,201
But there's that me that I have to
hate another guy because he's not,

129
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,070
no.
The racing game.

130
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,540
You can be proud of what you are and
not hate another guy for being different

131
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,010
than what you are. How?
How about we give dad

132
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,870
try? Well, I think the feeling that
you got from the second chance on life,

133
00:07:40,871 --> 00:07:45,430
this beautiful feeling of appreciation
and celebration of, of this existence,

134
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,050
that's what we need to try to foster
in people. Oh, we need to try to like,

135
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:54,040
let people know this is, this
is a temporary thing, man.
