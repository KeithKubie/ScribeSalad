00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.870
For this project I’m going to show you how
to forge a “Mini Master Sword”, out of

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.420
styrofoam. Make one just for fun and Cosplay.
Or bury it in a bucket of sand, and turn it

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.809
into solid metal. However you wield your power,
is completely up to you, because with this

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.669
Legendary Sword, you are the Master.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.980
Let’s begin this project, with another sheet
of dollar store foam board, and the Hot-Wire

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.699
“Styro-Slicer” I showed you how to build
in a previous project.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.630
You’ll also need this “Mini Master Sword”
template, I drew in photoshop. And you can

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.609
have it for free, if you just say thank you,
and check the description for a link.

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:36.210
Now you probably remember that dollar store
foam board is just a layer of foam, sandwiched

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.039
between two pieces of paper, and if we carefully
use a fingernail to pull up on one of the

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.539
corners, the paper peels right off, with hardly
any trouble at all.

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.230
Alright, let’s get busy cutting out all
the individual pieces from the template. And

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.609
if you want to save yourself from having to
glue them on, then simply print your templates

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.220
on full page label paper instead.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.100
Cut all the shapes out, as cleanly and neatly
as you can, then go find a glue stick, so

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.129
we can stick them firmly onto the foam board,
next.

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.760
Now when you’re adding glue to the back
of the paper templates, you don’t actually

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.720
need to smear the entire piece of paper. That
will only make it trickier to get off later on.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.270
So just add a generous coating around the
edges instead, then take time to position

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.830
the template carefully on the foam-board,
pressing the edges down as smoothly as you can get them.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.620
And if you utilize the space by keeping the
pieces close together, you’ll be able to get 3 swords, from one board.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.960
If everything looks smooth and secure, then
go ahead and power up the “Styro-Slicer”.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.600
The “Styro-Slicer” is a homemade hot-wire
foam cutting factory, that has adjustable

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.790
power settings, for slicing styrofoam of all
shapes and sizes, and can probably create

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.130
any custom Cosplay, or foam prop you can think
up.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.340
Alright, the first thing we need to do with
this foam board, is chop the templates down, into manageable pieces.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.030
I typically slide the foam up and down the
wire a few times, to rough out the foam pieces

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.210
a little faster, then carefully trace each
of the shapes, once they’re smaller, and easier to work with.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.260
Now the two base blades need some really special
attention, so let’s focus on them next.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.540
Tracing around the edges of just the hilt,
and the handles first, you can see the hot-wire

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.800
slices easily though the foam, but doesn’t
actually go through the paper.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.660
That’s really cool, because it leaves us
with a really smooth, and professional looking cut.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.440
Now hopefully you didn’t cut the blade out
yet, because there’s a cool little trick

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.860
I’m going to show you for doing that next.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.990
Move the arm of the “Styro-Slicer” to
the side of the cutting base, then slide the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.680
wire back into the center of the work surface,
and you’ll see, you can adjust the angle

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.060
of the wire. How cool is that?

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.640
This means, that now we can give our blade
a nice beveled edge. So set the wire around

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.720
45º and double-check it’s pointing away
from you, then lay the sword flat on the cutting

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.860
base, and trace the blade.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.540
Keep the wire as perpendicular to the lines
of the template as you can, then carefully

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.170
trace the edges in four separate passes.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.910
When you’ve made it around to the other
side of the hilt, then stop, and pull the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.700
sword straight back toward you, to release
the wire.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.800
Go ahead and peel the styrofoam off, from
around the edges, and take a look, at that cool beveled blade.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.000
And now that you’ve got the hang of it,
go ahead and do the other sword the same way,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.600
so we can move on to modifying, the thickness
of the handle next.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.990
Now for this next trick, you’re going to
need to adjust the blade of the “Styro-Slicer”

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.990
so it hangs horizontally over the cutting
base. And just like that, you’ve got the ability to cut foam bits, in half.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.459
The blade can adjust to any thickness you
want, but for simplicity, we’ll just be

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.819
cutting a few select pieces, in half.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.830
The only parts that actually need to be downsized,
are the 2 small blades, and the 2 handle grips,

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.360
which you can see leave us with 4 of each.
But you can scrap the ones with paper glued

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.120
to them, because we won’t be needing them
anymore.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.680
Alight the pieces are all cut to shape, so
let’s peel the paper templates off the foam,

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.410
and if you’re careful not to rip the paper,
you can actually use the templates again, to make another sword.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.940
Now before going any further, it’s a good
idea to layout all the pieces on a table to make sure they’re all there.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.880
You should have 28 pieces altogether, and if you do,
then let’s get busy gluing them together.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.060
There’s a little diagram on the template
that shows how the finished sword is going

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.680
to look. So start assembling it by laying
one of the base blades flat on a table, and gluing the hilt to the top.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.780
Take a little time to adjust the bottom and
the sides so they match up with the base blade on the bottom.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.840
Then simply follow the pattern for the rest
of the pieces, and you should end up with

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.930
two completed sides of the sword, that look
identical.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.810
Now simply add a generous amount glue, to
the flat sides on the bottom, then gently,

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.520
but firmly, seal them together.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.260
That’s pretty much it. All that’s left
for finishing our “Master Sword” now, is carving out the Tri-Force.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.330
Use a pair of scissors, or an X-Acto knife
to carefully draw the 3 lines, to form a triangle

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.640
in the middle, then carve the little channels
as deep as you like.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.719
With that final step, your 3D foam sword is
finished, and of course you can get creative,

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:21.819
and customize it any way you want.

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:26.569
I gently sanded the sword with a 220 grit
sanding sponge, to smooth down any imperfections,

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:30.120
making our little homemade creation, look
surprisingly professional.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.340
Now before you get too crazy with your sword,
it’s a good idea to leave it overnight so

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.389
the glue has a chance to dry completely.

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.449
And if you plan on turning your sword into
aluminum, you’re going to need a foam riser

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.389
like this as well. So you might as well make
one of those, while you’re waiting.

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.000
Simply cut the riser to whatever length you
need, then bury the sword in a bucket of sand

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.260
and pour hot molten aluminum overtop.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.060
You’ll see the styrofoam vaporizes instantly
from the extreme temperature, allowing the

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:56.360
metal to flow in and take its place, before
the sand even has a chance to collapse.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.279
After 5-10 minutes of cooling, the metal will
still be scalding hot, but should be hard

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:05.619
enough for you to grip onto with a pair of
pliers or channel locks, so you can unearth the sword, from the sand.

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.699
Now the finer the sand you use, the more detail
will be captured in your casting. And if you’re

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.189
happy with how it looks, just dip the whole
thing in a bucket of water to cool it, then

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:15.469
clean it up a bit to finish it off.

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.949
These swords will take some time, and some
skill to make, but they’re so low cost,

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.809
that you can make a whole arsenal of foam
weaponry, for just a couple of bucks, and a bit of your time.

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:27.960
Well now you know how to use a little electricity,
and some dollar store foam-board to forge

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.990
a powerful, and impressive, “Mini Master
Sword”.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.199
By the way if you try experimenting with different
kinds of metals, you’ll probably find you

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.900
can cast a sword, from just about anything
you want.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.600
I melted a few handfuls of bullet casings,
and turned them into a “Golden Sword”.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.390
It’s over 3 times heavier than aluminum,
but it makes a really cool addition, to my metal casting collection.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.820
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this
project, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
