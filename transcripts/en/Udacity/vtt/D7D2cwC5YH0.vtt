00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.969
&gt;&gt; One of the common misconceptions of that phrase, nature versus

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.540
nurture, is that it seems to imply one or the other.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.000
&gt;&gt; The question really should be, how much of

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.200
a role does each one play in different traits?

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.810
&gt;&gt; Exactly, maybe it should be nature and nurture.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.590
&gt;&gt; I like that. Because it implies that both are important and

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.480
we just need to determine which one is more important for different traits.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.540
&gt;&gt; Exactly, this is really important for

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.780
complex traits like. Risk for breast cancer, or

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.800
even traits like height.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.250
&gt;&gt; Well, are there examples of traits that are caused

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.390
by multiple genes but not much of an environmental influence?

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.070
&gt;&gt; So you mean like a really big

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.010
nature portion and not a very big nurture component?

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.630
&gt;&gt; There are a few, and one of them

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.660
is eye color. Eye color's actually what we call

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.380
a polygenic trait. A polygenic trait is a trait

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.840
that's controlled by multiple genes with very little environmental influence.
