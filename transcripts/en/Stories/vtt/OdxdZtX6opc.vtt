00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:03.700
JEFF GOLDBERG: My favorite
thing about this photo

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.160
is watching people react to it.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.733
Most people look
at it and see all

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.030
of the photographers
looking in one direction,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.510
and it takes them a second
or two before they notice

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.320
the bear is right behind them.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.890
And then they get a big
smile on their face or laugh

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.700
or have some shocked reaction.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.810
And then they look up at
me and ask me if it's real.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.564
When I tell them it is, we
generally laugh together.

00:00:25.564 --> 00:00:28.370

00:00:28.442 --> 00:00:30.400
NARRATOR: I'm going to
assume that a lot of you

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.770
had the same reaction when you
looked at this picture-- shock,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.600
surprise, doubt, amazement.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.470
And that's all
because of this guy.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.510
JEFF GOLDBERG: Hi, my
name is Jeff Goldberg.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.950
I live in Grayslake, Illinois.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.940
I'm a retail consultant
and avid photographer.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.030
I took this photo
in Hallo Bay, Alaska

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.910
in part of the
Katmai National Park.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.350
I was in Hallo Bay that day as
part of an extended photography

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.450
adventure with my son.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.130
He had recently
graduated high school,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.830
and before going
off to college, we

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.569
wanted to spend some time in the
wild observing grizzly bears.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.110
NARRATOR: And there's
no better place

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.151
in the world to do that
then Katmai National Park.

00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:11.400
It's home to one of the
largest protected grizzly bear

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.115
populations in the world,
making it a perfect--

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:18.450
if slightly dangerous-- place
to photograph these animals.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.180
JEFF GOLDBERG: When I first saw
the bear approach this group,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.335
my first reaction was,
how can they not see it?

00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:25.820
It's so big.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.950
And when they come close, I
can smell them and hear them,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.149
and they make noises.

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.815
But I also understand
as a photographer,

00:01:31.815 --> 00:01:36.020
I can be fixated on what
you see through the lens.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.140
So then my second
reaction was nervous.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.760
I was wondering if something
bad was going to happen.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.940
Our guide told me this was
not an unusual occurrence

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.129
in Hallo Bay.

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:46.920
As long as they didn't
approach him or make

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.170
any sudden movements, they
would probably be fine.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.320
Also, in his
estimation, the bear

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.330
wasn't as close as
it really seems.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.390
And lastly, and
probably most important,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.840
we didn't really have a way
to signal these photographers

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.836
as we were quite
some distance away.

00:02:01.836 --> 00:02:03.460
NARRATOR: But everything
turned out OK.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.940
The bear walked right
past the photographers

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.690
without some of
them even noticing.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.750
And Jeff got a picture
that was pretty

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.960
different from what that pack
of photographers captured.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.880
JEFF GOLDBERG: This trip was
wonderful in so many ways.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.580
First was the complete
immersion in the wild lives

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.620
of these bears.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.430
We spent a lot of time on
the ground with the bears,

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.950
really seeing how they
go about their lives--

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.400
the daily struggles, their fun
of playing with each other,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.750
fighting with each
other, and really seeing

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.550
their constant
struggle for survival.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.910
So being able to see the whole
story play out in front of us

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.570
was really a
tremendous experience

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.860
I got to have that
experience with my son--

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.070
these shared memories for
the rest of our lives.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.250
And I really will treasure that.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.470
NARRATOR: If you thought
this was a close encounter,

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.120
check out this
episode on what it's

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.776
like to get this close
to a great white shark.

00:02:57.776 --> 00:02:59.150
JOE BUTLER: This
particular photo

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.020
was taken off of Hans
Bay, South Africa

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.690
in the late September of 2012.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.470
We were in the area for
a university field course

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.330
looking at the
local biodiversity

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.830
and took the opportunity to
experience more charismatic sea

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.272
life we rarely get to see.

00:03:11.272 --> 00:03:13.230
