00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.910
Welcome to Android TV Games.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.070
Your game is going to look
awesome on the big screen.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.200
Android TV is your opportunity
to develop for TV and

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.040
mobile at the same time and in the same
APK without much extra effort.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.170
That's because Android TV is,
after all, just Android.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.180
While this will not be a course on how
to develop a complete game from scratch,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.660
we will teach you how to
extend your existing game to

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.320
also work on Android TV.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.030
We'll show you how to
work with TV remotes and

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.490
game controllers using a simple
arcade game called Asteroids.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.130
We'll also cover a variety of core and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.760
advanced topics like nearby
connections for second screen input.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.370
Ready?

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.980
Let's get started.
