00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.675
&gt;&gt; For a game developer, tools are the life force of your development cycle.

00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:07.575
It's starts all the way at the beginning with the compiler that the programmers

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:11.351
use, all the way to the art creation tools for the artists and even notepad and

00:00:11.351 --> 00:00:15.110
text editors for the designers. Basically, it's how we get things done. And

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.152
believe it or not, this has actually been going on for about 30 years now. So,

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:22.992
it really hurts my heart when we hear a lot of web game developers say that they

00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:27.042
have to go start from scratch creating a brand-new HTML 5 game development tool.

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:30.881
That's simply not true. So, before you go out and actually start throwing all of

00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:34.651
your venture capitalist money at a new studio to try and put together some HTML

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:38.363
5 development tools, go back and take a look at the stuff that we've been using

00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:42.510
for the past 30 years to make really good 2D and 3D games. You'll actually find

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.094
that HTML 5 and JavaScript, in particular, is very capable of reading in data

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:49.904
formats from all these tool systems. So, go out and educate yourself before you

00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:52.884
throw your money away, you'll find some good stuff out there.
