00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.296
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.223
&gt;&gt; Good morning and
welcome one and all

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.136
to the 10th Annual
National Book Festival

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.510
[ Applause ]

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.870
&gt;&gt; We're thrilled to be celebrating
this milestone-- excuse me--

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.626
which we're calling a decade of
words of wonder, and we're delighted

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.126
to have all of you here celebrating
it with us, and I expect many

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.230
of you have been here for
several of the festivals before.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.226
It gives me extraordinary pleasure
this morning to introduce the person

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.006
who was instrumental
in bringing this unique

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.296
and amazing event to all of us.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.183
I'm, of course, referring to
Laura Bush who was First Lady--

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.420
excuse me-- brought the concept
of the National Book Festival

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.593
to Washington from her
home state of Texas

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.366
where she had conducted
it with great [inaudible].

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.510
[ Applause ]

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.913
&gt;&gt; She co-hosted the National Book
Festival throughout her years here

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.053
on Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.740
She's a former librarian,
a champion of literacy.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.510
[ Applause ]

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.816
&gt;&gt; She's a teacher.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.430
She's an author of multiple
books including her latest,

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.736
Spoken from the Heart.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.346
Madam, former First Lady, you
speak to the heart of all of us.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.470
She'll do a reading from her
book, then take questions.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.116
Microphones are on either side.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.050
Please keep your questions
brief and on point.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.603
She's honors us by taking a time

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.226
out from an extraordinarily
busy schedule continuing,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.846
involving her United Nations
role, her role with UNESCO,

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.070
her championship of reading
and many other good causes.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.230
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.430
in welcoming the woman I've
been able to call, I think,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.453
with full force and with genuine
conviction, Reader-in-Chief

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.543
of the United States of America.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.910
[ Applause ]

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.453
&gt;&gt; Thank you all.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.520
Thank you so much.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.653
Thank you very much Dr. Bellington.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.520
Thank you for all your good work.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.920
Thank you for being
such a great partner

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.126
for the National Book Festival.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.323
And thank you for continuing to
build this National Book Festival.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.376
This is the 10th National
Book Festival which I think is

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.790
so terrific and I can see
looking around this tent and all

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.226
around the festival that it's
hugely popular with people

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.333
from all over our country.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.903
So thank you all for coming and
thank you for the warm welcome.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.586
I especially wanna thank David
Rubenstein, who is sitting here

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.740
on the front row, for your generous
gift to the Library of Congress

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.810
which will ensure that the
book festival will continue.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.303
Thank you very much David.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.070
[ Applause ]

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.320
&gt;&gt; I love the National Book
Festival and I'm very happy

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.776
to be here this year as an author.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.906
I spent most of my life
surrounded by books.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.703
I was an avid reader as a child.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.810
My mother and I were
regular fixtures

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.496
at the Midland County Public Library
which was a magical place not only

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.986
because it house thousands of books
but because it was in a basement

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.263
which was a very exotic
place for west Texas.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.156
Going to the library was the only
time I ever got to go underground.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.443
I continued my love of
books through college,

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.273
through elementary school
teaching in Dallas and Houston,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.386
through graduate school
and library science,

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.246
and then as a public
librarian in Houston

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.500
and a school librarian in Austin.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.426
I made a career out
of my love for books.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.633
And to help spread that love,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.076
I helped to found the
Texas Book Festival

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.390
and then the National Book Festival.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.833
But while I love reading, I never
thought I would write a book,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.773
certainly, not one about myself.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.713
But as George's eight years
in office drew to a close,

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.130
publishers began calling, asking
me when I was gonna write a memoir

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.316
and I realized that there was,
in fact, a lot I wanted to say.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.646
Our years in Washington, the first
decade of the new century were

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.293
as consequential as almost
any other time in our history.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.926
We lived through the most
vicious attack on our homeland

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.293
in the history of our nation.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.753
I was on Capitol Hill on the morning
of September 11 and in a minute,

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.460
I'm gonna read you
something about that.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.246
George and I cried with the
grieving families and we prayed

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.393
with the nation and we never forgot
that day for the rest of his time

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.793
in office, and we'll never forget
it for the rest of our lives.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.586
I met so many of the brave
men and women who volunteered

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.240
to defend our country and
who risk and give their lives

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.986
so that the rest of us might--
may never know terror again.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.106
And I've met the Voices for Freedom
like the former Czech president,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.460
Vaclav Havel, the great
intellectual and playwright,

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.296
who for years was imprisoned by
the communist, but who never gave

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.096
up his hopes for freedom.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.490
When the Iron Curtain fell, he
stepped up to lead his country

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.650
and he's still speaking now
on behalf of the oppressed.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.406
I met the Dalai Lama from Tibet and
female candidates for parliament

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.680
in Kuwait who ran for office
in 2006, the first year

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.673
that women there were
granted the right to vote.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.210
And I met women in Afghanistan

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.663
who under the Taliban could
not leave their houses along,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.916
who could not get an education,

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.886
who would have their fingernails
pulled off if they so much

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.620
as wore a coat, a fingernail polish.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.400
Now, their lives are changing.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.316
In my book, I wanted to give voice
to all of these remarkable people

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.460
and to share these
experiences with others.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.870
And I wanted to remember the many
wonderful people I met here at home,

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.896
the volunteers from the Red
Cross and the Baptist men

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.053
who drove all night to the
storm-ravaged gulf coast

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.413
after Katrina to cook meals for
those in need and who stayed

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.266
for months helping the
people there rebuild,

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.423
or the brave Coast Guard volunteers

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.220
who rescued some 30,000 people
stranded after the hurricane struck.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.793
I wanted to tell of the days I spent
with the young men in our cities

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.960
and towns, many of whom were
ex-gang members and who were trying

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.500
to turn their lives around.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.170
I was never prouder than when,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.726
as part of my own helping
America's youth initiative,

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.760
I was able to welcome a group
of ex-gang members from L.A.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:32.016
to the White House, the same house
where we hosted the Queen of England

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.393
and the Pope on his birthday.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.283
The more I thought about
it, the more I realized

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.703
that I had some great
stories to tell even

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.856
about the great Easter egg caper
at the 2006 Easter Egg Roll where--

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.250
well, if you wanna know
what happened in that story,

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.350
I think I'll let you wait
and read it in my book.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.083
I had so many wonderful
memories to share,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:58.316
memories about the White House,

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.670
stories about our life there
and about our families.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.496
And of course, many of my happiest
and most enduring memories are

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.270
of the National Book Festival.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.370
I remember something from each

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.903
of the eight festivals I attended
during our time at the White House.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:17.596
I remembered talking with
some of my favorite authors

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.010
with hosting Ludmila Putin
at the 2nd Book Festival,

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.203
with the National Basketball
Association players

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.010
who are our partners, the
beautiful gala dinners,

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.863
the wonderful authors
coffees at the White House

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.506
on the Saturday mornings, and so
many more happy, happy memories.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.540
But I especially recall that
first National Book Festival,

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.290
September 8, 2001.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.660
It was a magnificent day, sunny
with a beautiful blue sky,

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.840
just the kind of weather
we had hoped from.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.293
Friends had come from around
the country to stay with George

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.453
and me at the White House.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:02.806
Over 40 friends came from Austin
all who had worked with me

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.300
on the Texas Book Festival.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.706
I remember how patiently the
festival goers had waited in line

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.146
to meet their favorite authors.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:19.190
That first festival was everything
we had hoped for and more.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.170
Three days later, our world changed.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:24.533
And since we're here in the
history tent, I thought I'd read

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.080
from my book a little bit that
day that changed our world.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.510
[ Pause ]

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.686
&gt;&gt; Tuesday morning, September
11, was sunny and warm,

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.363
the sky brilliant cerulean blue.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.553
My friends who had come

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.060
for the National Book
Festival had all flown home

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.780
and even George was gone in
Florida for a school visit.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:55.633
George H. W. Bush and Bar had spent
the night buy they'd already left

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.060
on a 7 a.m. plane to
catch an early flight.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.070
&gt;&gt; And I had what I
considered a big day planned.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.083
I was set to arrive
at the Capitol at 9:15

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.426
to brief the Senate
Education Committee chaired

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.840
by Edward M. Kennedy on the findings

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.160
of early childhood development
conference that I'd held in July.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.766
In the afternoon, we were
hosting the entire Congress

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.380
and their families for the
annual Congressional Picnic.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.076
The south lawn at the White
House was already covered

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.070
with picnic tables awaiting
their fluttering cloths.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.160
And Tom Perrini from
Buffalo Gap, Texas,

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.726
was setting up his chuckwagons.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.400
Our entertainment would
old-fashioned square dancing

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.393
and Texas swing music by Ray Benson

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.503
and his classic band,
Asleep at the Wheel.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:47.636
I finished dressing in silence,

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:49.766
going over my statement
again in my mind.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.363
I was very nervous about
appearing before a Senate committee

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.116
and having news cameras
trained on me.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:03.396
Had the TV been turned on, I might
have heard the first fleeting report

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:03.980
of a plane hitting the north
tower of the World Trade Center.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.886
Instead, it was the head of my
Secret Service detail Ron Sprinkle

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.163
who leaned over and
whispered the news in my ear

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.630
as I entered the car a few
minutes after 9 a.m. Andi Ball,

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:19.850
my chief of staff at
the White House,

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:25.723
Domestic Policy Adviser Margaret
Spellings, and I speculated

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.786
on what could have happened.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.986
A small plane maybe, a
Cessna, running into one

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.353
of those massive towers on this
beautiful September morning.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.206
We were driving at
Pennsylvania Avenue when word came

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.766
that the south tower had been hit.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:42.943
The car fell silent.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.296
We sat in mute disbelief.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.926
One claim might be
a strange accident.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.776
Two planes were clearly an attack.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:52.993
I thought about George and wondered

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.176
if the Secret Service had already
hustled him to the motorcade

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.543
and begun the race to Air
Force One to return home.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.633
Two minutes later, at 9:16 a.m.,

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.036
we pulled up to the entrance
of the Russell Building.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.196
In the time it had taken to
drive the less than two minutes

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:11.846
between the White-- two
miles between the White House

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.320
and the Capitol, the world
as I knew it had changed.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:19.760
Senator Kennedy was
waiting to greet me.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.203
We both knew when we met
that the towers had been hit.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:25.623
And without a word being spoken,

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:28.096
we knew that there would be
no briefing that morning.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:31.026
Together, we walked the
short distance to his office.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:37.380
He began by presenting me
with a limited-edition print.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.986
It was vase of bright daffodils, a
copy of a painting he had created

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:46.443
for his wife Victoria and given
to her on their wedding day.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.706
The print was inscribed to me
and dated September 11, 2001.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.066
An old television was turned on in
the corner of the room and I glanced

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.553
over to see the plumes of smoke
billowing from the twin towers.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.233
Senator Kennedy kept his
eyes averted from the screen.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:05.783
Instead, he led me on a
tour of his office pointing

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.350
out various pictures,
furniture, pieces of memorabilia,

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.816
even a framed note that his brother
Jack had sent to their mother

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.816
when he was a child in which he
wrote, "Teddy is getting fat."

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.413
The senator who would outlive
all his brothers by more

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.506
than 40 years laughed at the
note at he showed it to me,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.766
still finding it amusing.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:32.743
All the while, I kept glancing over
at the glowing television screen.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.550
My skin was starting to crawl.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:39.426
I wanted to leave to
find out what was going

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.553
on to process what I was
seeing, but I felt trapped

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.190
in an endless cycle of pleasantries.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.420
It did not occur to me to say,

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.366
"Senator Kennedy, what
about the towers?"

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:56.070
I simply followed his lead
and he may have feared

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:56.523
that if he actually--
if we actually began

00:13:59.130 --> 00:13:59.433
to contemplate what had
happened in New York,

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.626
I might dissolve into tears.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.116
Senator Judd Gregg of New
Hampshire, the ranking Republican

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:07.436
on the committee and one
of our very good friends,

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:10.950
Judd had played Al Gore for George
during mock debates at the ranch

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.736
that previous fall, arrived just
as I was completing the tour.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:19.676
Senator Kennedy invited us to sit on
the couch as he continued chatting

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.630
about anything other than
the horrific images unfolding

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.193
on the tiny screen across the room.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:30.960
I looked around his shoulder
but could see very little,

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:33.730
and I was still trying
to pay attention to him

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.576
and to the thread of
his conversation.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.886
It seemed completely unreal sitting
in this elegant sunlit office

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.566
as an immense tragedy unfolded.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.120
We sat as human beings driven by
smoke, flame, and searing heat,

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:56.250
jumped from the tops of the
twin towers to end their lives

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.316
and as firemen in full gear began
to climb up the tower's stairs.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:03.090
I've often wondered
if the small talk

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:07.890
that morning was Ted
Kennedy's defense mechanism.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.210
If after so much tragedy, the
combat death of his oldest brother

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:16.970
in World War II, the assassinations
of his brother Jack and Robert,

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:21.950
and the deaths of nephews including
John Jr., whose body he identified

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:22.986
when it was pulled from the cold,
dark waters off Martha's Vineyard.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.000
If after all those things, he
simply could not look upon another

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.753
grievous tragedy.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.410
About 9:45 after George had made
a brief statement to the nation

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:40.673
which we watched clustered around
a small television that was perched

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.166
on the receptionist desk,
Ted Kennedy, Judd Gregg,

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:51.856
and I walked out to tell reporters
that my briefing had been postponed.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:52.896
I said you heard from the president
this morning and Senator Kennedy

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:56.466
and Senator Gregg, and I joined his
statement in saying that our hearts

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.766
and our prayers go out to the
victims of this act of terrorism

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.533
and that our support goes
to the rescue workers,

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.363
and all of our prayers are
with everyone there right now.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.133
As I turned to exit,
Laurence McQuillan

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.810
of USA Today asked a
question, "Mrs. Bush, you know,

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.060
children are kind of
struck by all this.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.446
Is there a message you
could tell to the nations?"

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.736
I didn't even wait for
him to finish but began,

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:30.243
"Parents need to reassure
their children everywhere

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:34.903
in our country that they are safe."

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.626
As we walked out of
the briefing room,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.363
the cellphone of my advance
man, John Meyers, rang.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:41.440
A friend told him that
CNN was reporting

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.806
that an airplane had
crashed into the Pentagon.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.223
Within minutes, the
order given to evacuate--

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:54.846
an order would be given to evacuate
the White House and the Capitol.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:56.566
The Secret Service had
decided to take me temporarily

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.813
to their headquarters located

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:02.846
in a nondescript federal
office building a few blocks

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.380
from the White House.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.230
Following the Oklahoma City bombing,
their offices had been reinforced

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.396
to survive a large scale blast.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:13.923
Outside our convoy windows,
the city streets were clogged

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:19.756
with people evacuating
their work places.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.713
In the time I reached my
motorcade, Flight 93 had crashed

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.933
into a Pennsylvania
field in the west side

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.706
of the Pentagon had
begun to collapse.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.363
In the intervening years,
Senator Judd Gregg and I,

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.336
and many others were
left to contemplate,

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:40.483
what if Flight 93 had not been
forced down by its passengers

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.750
into an empty field; what if shortly

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.990
after 10 a.m. it had
reached the Capitol dome?

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:48.663
Walking through the hallways
at the Secret Service building,

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:55.483
I saw a sign emblazoned with
the emergency number 911.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.430
Had the terrorist thought
about our iconic number

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.253
when they picked this date

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:02.566
and planned an emergency
so overwhelming?

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:05.320
For awhile, I sat in this small
office area off the conference room

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.160
silently watching the
images on television.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:12.863
I watched the replay
as the South Tower

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.496
of the World Trade Center word
was sound and then collapsed

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.833
into a silent gray plume,
offering my personal prayer to God

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.746
to receive the victims
with open arms.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.930
The North Tower had
given way live in front

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:33.810
of my eyes sending some 1,500
souls and 110 stories of gypsum

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.990
and concrete buckling to the ground.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.570
Inside Secret Service
headquarters, I asked my staff

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:44.810
to call their families and I called
my girls who had been whisked away

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.983
by Secret Service agents
to secure locations.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:52.036
In Austin, Jenna had been awakened

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.236
by an agent pounding
on her dorm door.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.776
In her room at Yale, Barbara had
heard another student sobbing

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.913
uncontrollably a few doors down.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.546
Then I called my mother because I
wanted her to know that I was safe

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:15.450
and I wanted so much to
hear the sound of her voice.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.826
Late in the afternoon, we got word

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:19.126
that the president was
returning to Washington.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:21.463
At 6:30, we got in a Secret Service
caravan to drive to the White House.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.363
I gazed out the window.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:28.023
The city had taken on the cast
of an abandoned movie set.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:31.663
The sun was shining, but
the streets were deserted.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:34.440
We couldn't see a person
on the sidewalk

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.446
or any vehicles driving
on the street.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:44.423
There was no sound at all except for
the roll of wheels over the ground.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.660


00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.776
By 7:30, we ran our way
up to the residence.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.710
I have no memory of
having eaten dinner.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.363
George may have eaten on the plane.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.616
He tried to call the girls as soon

00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.866
as we were upstairs but
couldn't reach them.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:01.926
&gt;&gt; Barbara called back close
to 8 p.m. and then George left

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.340
to make remarks to the nation.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:07.860
We did finally climb
into our own bed

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.733
that night exhausted
and emotionally drained.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.683
Outside the doors of the residence,

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.496
the Secret Service details
stood in their usual post.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:18.820
I fell asleep, but it
was a light, fitful rest

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.453
and I could feel George staring
into the darkness beside me.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.323
Then I heard a man
screaming as he ran.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.160
"Mr. President, Mr.
President, you've got to get up.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.660
The White House is under attack."

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.396
We jumped up and I grabbed the robe
and stuck my feet into my slippers,

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.470
but I didn't stop to
put on my contacts.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:41.793
George grabbed Barney
and I grabbed Kitty.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:44.233
With Spot trailing behind, we
started walking down to the PEOC.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:48.473
George had wanted to
take the elevator,

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:50.716
but the agents didn't think it was
safe and so we had to descend flight

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:58.030
after flight of stairs to the
state floor, then the ground floor

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:02.583
and below while I held George's hand
because I couldn't see anything.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:03.603
My heart was pounding and all
I could do was count stairwell

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.830
landings, trying to
count off in my mind

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.320
to how many more floors
we had to go.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:11.980
When we reached the
PEOC, I saw the outline

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.366
of a military aide unfolding
the ancient hideaway bed

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.880
and putting on some sheets.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.480
At that moment, another
agent ran up to us and said,

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.120
"Mr. President, it's
one of our own."

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.653
The plane was one of ours.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:29.803
For months afterwards
at night, in bed,

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:35.330
we'd hear the military jets
thundering over head traveling

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.960
so fast that the ground
below quivered and shook.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:39.373
They'd make one pass and then three

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:41.303
or five minutes later make
another low-flying loop.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.310
I'd fall asleep to the roar
of the fighters in the sky,

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.710
peering in my mind those
words, "One of our own."

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.673
There was a quiet security in
that and knowing that we slept

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.716
between the watchful
eyes of one of our own,

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.216
and then just a little
closing signets

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.783
from the 2nd Book Festival in 2002.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.373
Many moments from that
day stayed with me.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.956
But a particular note where the
closing remarks by the historian,

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:19.063
David McCullough, in which he
described John Adams' quest

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.990
for knowledge in quotes,
"The greatest gift

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.293
of all he was certain was the
gift of an inquiring mind."

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.510
McCullough quoted Adams
saying and I quote,

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.826
"I have the liberty
to think for myself."

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.216
And then David McCullough
added, "We face a foe today

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.513
who believes in enforced ignorance.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:43.210
We don't."

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:45.710
[ Applause ]

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.393
&gt;&gt; Thank you all.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:56.730
Thank you.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:59.863
Now, we have time for questions.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.210
We have a few minutes for questions.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:03.430
I like your Charlotte's Web T-shirt.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.296
&gt;&gt; Well, we've met.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.700
You know I am the grandniece of E.
B. White who wrote Charlotte's Web.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.960
&gt;&gt; Oh, really?

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.960
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.960
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.960
&gt;&gt; And--

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.960
[ Applause ]

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.293
&gt;&gt; And two years ago when you--
and Jenna were signing your books,

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.360
we talked and you both
signed my book

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.670
and I do E. B. White presentations,
and I always bring your book

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:26.456
and show them and talk
about on your page

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.510
where you referenced
Charlotte's Web.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.770
And I thank you so much
for that children's book.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:33.793
It's wonderful, but this is
also a wonderful, wonderful book

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.373
and thank you for writing it.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.440
[ Applause ]

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.973
I really appreciate it.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.373
&gt;&gt; What was your exact
feeling when you found

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.440
out that you were attacked
by one of your own?

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.373
&gt;&gt; No. We weren't attacked
by one of our own.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:55.706
We were covered by one of our own.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.040
They were protecting us.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:23:59.840
This was the plane
that I was talking

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.106
about where the military kept
that flew over Washington.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:03.560
They were United States military.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.386
So we were protected by them

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:07.723
and that gave me a great
feeling of security.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.643
&gt;&gt; What was your favorite
part about being the host

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.030
of the National Book Festival?

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:16.270
&gt;&gt; Well, I love seeing so
many happy people here,

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.330
so many people that love to read.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.453
And I think there's something
that book lovers all share.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.336
And no matter what our
political views might be

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:31.623
or what our differences might be
of any kind, we all love books

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:36.113
and we all love reading, and we
especially appreciate that we have

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:38.550
so many tremendous American authors.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:42.123
We have such a huge body
of literature to choose

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.266
from our own writers
and then, of course,

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:45.660
from writers around the world,
but especially children.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:49.530
We have a really wonderful huge
body of children's literature

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:52.860
in the United States and as an
old retired children's librarian,

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.506
I'm really proud of that.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.840
Thank you.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.840
[ Applause ]

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.173
&gt;&gt; One more I think.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.906
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.440
Who are your-- some of your favorite
authors of the last 5 or 10 years

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.773
and what are you reading now?

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.040
&gt;&gt; Right now, I'm reading Cutting
for Stone by Abraham Verghese.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.250
He was a Texas Book Festival
before with one of his books.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.516
I don't know if he-- has been a
National Book Festival writer,

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:23.210
but it's terrific.

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:27.543
It's a great book about twins
but also about Ethiopia.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.006
Then I read and this was one of the
books given to me by Booksellers

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.246
on my book tour, My Name is
Mary Sutter, historical fiction

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:40.423
about the Civil War, really
great by Robin Oliveira

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:42.220
and so I recommend both of those.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:44.166
George is reading the new
biography about Bonhoeffer.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.273
That's the title, Bonhoeffer.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.436
And I can't wait to get my
hands on it and read it next.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.116
So I'm usually reading the newest
books by Book Festival authors.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:01.263
I'll be at the Texas Book
Festival in late October for the--

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.206
also and so I hope that any of you

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:05.930
that have a chance can also come
there for the Texas Book Festival.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.630
Thank you all very much.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:11.896
[Background applause]
I think my time is up.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:13.163
I appreciate it very, very much.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.030
Thank you all.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.230
God bless you all.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.030
Thanks a lot.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.896

of the Library of Congress.
