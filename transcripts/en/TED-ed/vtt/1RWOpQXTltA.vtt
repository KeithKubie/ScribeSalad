00:00:06.437 --> 00:00:10.926
What is reality, knowledge,
the meaning of life?

00:00:10.926 --> 00:00:13.251
Big topics you might tackle figuratively

00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:18.196
explaining existence as a journey 
down a road or across an ocean,

00:00:18.196 --> 00:00:25.194
a climb, a war, a book, a thread, a game,
a window of opportunity,

00:00:25.338 --> 00:00:28.986
or an all-too-short-lived 
flicker of flame.

00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:30.800
2,400 years ago,

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.240
one of history's famous thinkers said
life is like being chained up in a cave,

00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:39.722
forced to watch shadows 
flitting across a stone wall.

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:41.358
Pretty cheery, right?

00:00:41.358 --> 00:00:45.503
That's actually what Plato suggested
in his Allegory of the Cave,

00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:47.916
found in Book VII of "The Republic,"

00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:51.521
in which the Greek philosopher
envisioned the ideal society

00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:56.124
by examining concepts 
like justice, truth and beauty.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.032
In the allegory, a group of prisoners
have been confined in a cavern since birth,

00:01:01.032 --> 00:01:03.582
with no knowledge of the outside world.

00:01:03.607 --> 00:01:07.346
They are chained, facing a wall,
unable to turn their heads,

00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:10.390
while a fire behind them
gives off a faint light.

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:13.230
Occasionally, people pass by the fire,

00:01:13.255 --> 00:01:18.485
carrying figures of animals and other objects
that cast shadows on the wall.

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:21.445
The prisoners name 
and classify these illusions,

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.899
believing they're perceiving
actual entities.

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.978
Suddenly, one prisoner is freed
and brought outside for the first time.

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:33.507
The sunlight hurts his eyes and he finds
the new environment disorienting.

00:01:33.532 --> 00:01:35.872
When told that the things 
around him are real,`

00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:39.902
while the shadows were mere reflections,
he cannot believe it.

00:01:39.902 --> 00:01:42.445
The shadows appeared much clearer to him.

00:01:42.445 --> 00:01:45.193
But gradually, his eyes adjust

00:01:45.218 --> 00:01:47.676
until he can look 
at reflections in the water,

00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:49.380
at objects directly,

00:01:49.405 --> 00:01:51.643
and finally at the Sun,

00:01:51.668 --> 00:01:55.548
whose light is the ultimate source
of everything he has seen.

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:59.228
The prisoner returns to the cave
to share his discovery,

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:01.628
but he is no longer used to the darkness,

00:02:01.628 --> 00:02:05.804
and has a hard time 
seeing the shadows on the wall.

00:02:05.804 --> 00:02:09.878
The other prisoners think the journey
has made him stupid and blind,

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.576
and violently resist 
any attempts to free them.

00:02:13.876 --> 00:02:16.833
Plato introduces this passage
as an analogy

00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:21.269
of what it's like to be a philosopher
trying to educate the public.

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.473
Most people are not just comfortable
in their ignorance

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:28.174
but hostile to anyone who points it out.

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:32.028
In fact, the real life Socrates
was sentenced to death

00:02:32.028 --> 00:02:35.272
by the Athenian government 
for disrupting the social order,

00:02:35.297 --> 00:02:38.339
and his student Plato 
spends much of "The Republic"

00:02:38.364 --> 00:02:40.802
disparaging Athenian democracy,

00:02:40.802 --> 00:02:44.201
while promoting rule by philosopher kings.

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:45.873
With the cave parable,

00:02:45.873 --> 00:02:50.113
Plato may be arguing that the masses
are too stubborn and ignorant

00:02:50.113 --> 00:02:52.025
to govern themselves.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.223
But the allegory has captured
imaginations for 2,400 years

00:02:56.223 --> 00:02:59.279
because it can be read in far more ways.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:03.187
Importantly, the allegory is connected
to the theory of forms,

00:03:03.212 --> 00:03:05.524
developed in Plato's other dialogues,

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.951
which holds that 
like the shadows on the wall,

00:03:07.976 --> 00:03:12.834
things in the physical world are flawed
reflections of ideal forms,

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.028
such as roundness, or beauty.

00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:19.692
In this way, the cave leads to many
fundamental questions,

00:03:19.717 --> 00:03:21.786
including the origin of knowledge,

00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:23.931
the problem of representation,

00:03:23.956 --> 00:03:27.138
and the nature of reality itself.

00:03:27.163 --> 00:03:31.950
For theologians, the ideal forms
exist in the mind of a creator.

00:03:31.975 --> 00:03:35.995
For philosophers of language
viewing the forms as linguistic concepts,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.580
the theory illustrates the problem
of grouping concrete things

00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:41.815
under abstract terms.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.546
And others still wonder whether
we can really know

00:03:44.546 --> 00:03:49.110
that the things outside the cave
are any more real than the shadows.

00:03:49.135 --> 00:03:50.491
As we go about our lives,

00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:53.452
can we be confident 
in what we think we know?

00:03:53.452 --> 00:03:54.638
Perhaps one day,

00:03:54.663 --> 00:03:58.810
a glimmer of light may punch a hole
in your most basic assumptions.

00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:01.207
Will you break free to struggle
towards the light,

00:04:01.232 --> 00:04:03.904
even if it costs you 
your friends and family,

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:07.353
or stick with comfortable
and familiar illusions?

00:04:07.378 --> 00:04:10.751
Truth or habit? Light or shadow?

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:14.824
Hard choices, but if it's any consolation,
you're not alone.

00:04:14.824 --> 00:04:17.363
There are lots of us down here.
