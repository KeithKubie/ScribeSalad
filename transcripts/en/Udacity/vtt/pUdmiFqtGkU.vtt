00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
And to show you this relationship, I will do the following--for each of the edges that is blue

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.990
over here I will draw in here and I will color them black and I'm going to do the same thing

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.430
over here, so each edge that is blue over here I'm going to draw in black over here.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.250
Now, and I hope you can see it here even with my drawing that is not very similar,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.630
it turns out that this graph over here

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.330
once I've added all the edges from this graph is the same as this graph here

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.470
once I've added all the edges from that graph over here

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.370
and this is exactly the connection between clique and independent set.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.500
If you have solved clique on a given graph,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.190
you take another graph where you draw exactly the opposite edges.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.760
Every pair of vertices that is connected by an edge in this network

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.890
is not connected over here and vice versa

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.840
but this means that finding the largest possible clique in one graph

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.050
is basically the same as finding the largest possible independent set in the--

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.280
well you can call it an inversed graph where you connected exactly those vertices

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.260
that where not connected over here

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.150
and it's the same the other way around.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.600
If you have found an independent set in a graph that is as large as possible,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.550
then the same vertices will form a clique if you build the inverse graph.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.110
You connect all of the vertices that were not connected over here.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.690
This is actually a great news for Bob and for Carol

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.430
because if Bob were to find a polynomial time algorithm for clique.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.260
If he were to determine that clique is tractable, then independent set would also be tractable

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.430
because Carol could just take her network,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.620
build the inverse network, then have Bob solve clique on that network,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.010
take that same solution for her problem.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.430
Carol wanted to take independent set which she would basically do as

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.720
she would start out with a graph

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.140
then she would build the inverse graph and solve clique.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.990
That would give her the same solution as if she were looking for

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.230
an independent set on the original graph.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.509
And it's the same for Bob here because if Carol finds a good algorithm for independent set,

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.720
what he can do is he can take his graph, also build the inverse graph,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.060
and then solve independent set which means that either both clique and independent set are tractable

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.750
or both of these problems are intractable

00:02:23.750 --> 99:59:59.000
but it cannot be the case that only one of them is tractable or intractable.
