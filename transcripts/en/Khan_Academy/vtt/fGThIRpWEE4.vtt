00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.590
In this video I'm just going
to multiply a ton of

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.500
polynomials, and hopefully
that'll give you enough

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.630
exposure to feel confident when
you have to multiply any

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.450
for yourselves.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.810
Let's start with a fairly
simple problem.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:18.810
Let's say we just want to
multiply 2x times 4x minus 5.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.440
Well, we just straight
up use the

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.680
distributive property here.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.390
And really, when we do all
of these polynomial

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.140
multiplications, all we're
doing is the distributive

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.990
property repeatedly.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.710
But let's just do the
distributive property here.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:39.240
This is 2x times 4x, plus
2x times negative 5.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.700
Or we could say negative
5 times 2x.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.520
So you'd say, minus
5 times 2x.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.480
All I did is distribute
the 2x.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.740
This first term is going to be
equal to-- we can multiply the

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.440
coefficients.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.560
Remember, 2x times 4x is the
same thing as-- you can

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.530
rearrange the order
of multiplication.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.170
This is the same thing as 2
times 4, times x times x.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.020
Which is the same thing
as 8 times x squared.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.880
Remember, x to the 1, times x
to the 1, add the exponents.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.380
I mean, you know x times
x is x squared.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.070
So this first term is going
to be 8x squared.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.520
And the second term, negative
5 times 2 is negative 10x.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.720
Not too bad.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.620
Let's do a slightly
more involved one.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:34.140
Let's say we had 9x to the third
power, times 3x squared,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.570
minus 2x, plus 7.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.720
So once again, we're just going
to do the distributive

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.810
property here.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.260
So we're going to multiply the
9x to the third times each of

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.650
these terms.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.100
So 9x to the third
times 3x squared.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.750
I'll write it out this time.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.530
In the next few, we'll
start doing it a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.420
little bit in our heads.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.230
So this is going to be 9x to
the third times 3x squared.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.710
And then we're going to have
plus-- let me write it this

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:13.960
way-- minus 2x times 9x to the
third, and then plus 7 times

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.400
9x to the third.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.606
So sometimes I wrote the 9x to
the third first, sometimes we

00:02:17.606 --> 00:02:18.610
wrote it later because
I wanted this

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.400
negative sign here.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.770
But it doesn't make a difference
on the order that

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.980
you're multiplying.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.730
So this first term here
is going to be what?

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.720
9 times 3 is 27 times x to
the-- we can add the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.190
exponents, we learned that in
our exponent properties.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.670
This is x to the fifth power,
minus 2 times 9 is 18x to

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.770
the-- we have x to the
1, x to the third-- x

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.970
to the fourth power.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.160
Plus 7 times 9 is 63x
to the third.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
So we end up with this nice
little fifth degree

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.920
polynomial.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.640
Now let's do one where we are
multiplying two binomials.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.400
And I'll show you what
I mean in a second.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.680
This you're going to see
very, very, very

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.510
frequently in algebra.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.215
So let's say you have x minus
3, times x plus 2.

00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:16.920
And I actually want to show you
that all we're doing here

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.990
is the distributive property.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.510
So let me write it like
this: times x plus 2.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.940
So let's just pretend that this
is one big number here.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.510
And it is.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.100
You know, if you had x's, this
would be some number here.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.770
So let's just distribute this
onto each of these variables.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:44.790
So this is going to be x minus
3, times that green x, plus x

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.760
minus 3, times that green 2.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.530
All we did is distribute
the x minus 3.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.980
This is just the distributive
property.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.920
Remember, if I had a times
x plus 2, what would

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.750
this be equal to?

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:19.810
This would be equal to a
times x plus a times 2.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.620
So over here, you can see when x
minus 3 is the same thing as

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.220
a, we're just distributing it.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.910
And now we would do the
distributive property again.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.960
In this case, we're distributing
the x now onto

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.050
the x minus 3.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.850
We're going to distribute the
2 onto the x minus 3.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.760
You might be used to seeing the
x on the other side, but

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.730
either way, we're just
multiplying it.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.840
So this is going to be--
I'll stay color coded.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:56.390
This is going to be x times x,
minus 3 times x, plus x times

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.870
2-- I'm going through great
pains to keep it

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.030
color coded for you.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.640
I think it's helping--
minus 3 times 2.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.640
All I did is distribute the
x and distribute the 2.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.450
And soon you're going
to get used to this.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.480
We can do it in one step.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.740
You're actually multiplying
every term in this one by

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.200
every term in that one, and
we'll figure out faster ways

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.940
to do it in the future.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.960
But I really want to show
you the idea here.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.590
So what's this going to equal?

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.050
This is going to equal
x squared.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.040
This right here is going
to be minus 3x.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.800
This is going to be plus 2x.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.720
And then this right here
is going to be minus 6.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.950
And so this is going to be x
squared minus 3 of something,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.940
plus 2 of something, that's
minus 1 of that something.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.860
Minus x, minus 6.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.510
We've multiplied those two.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.630
Now before we move on and do
another problem, I want to

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.450
show you that you can kind of do
this in your head as well.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.000
You don't have to go through
all of these steps.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.670
I just want to show you really
that this is just the

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.270
distributive property.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.980
The fast way of doing it, if
you had x minus 3, times x

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.880
plus 2, you literally just want
to multiply every term

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.240
here times each of
these terms.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.510
So you'd say, this x
times that x, so

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.130
you'd have x squared.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.000
Then you'd have this x times
that 2, so plus 2x.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.250
Then you'd have this minus
3 times that x, minus 3x.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.070
And then you have the minus 3,
or the negative 3, times 2,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.750
which is negative 6.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.930
And so when you simplify, once
again you get x squared

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.140
minus x minus 6.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.680
And it takes a little
bit of practice to

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.680
really get used to it.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.910
Now the next thing I want to
do-- and the principal is

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.160
really the exact same way-- but
I'm going to multiply a

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.290
binomial times a trinomial,
which

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.720
many people find daunting.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.840
But we're going to see,
if you just stay calm,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.010
it's not too bad.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:56.000
3x plus 2, times 9x squared,
minus 6x plus 4.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.910
Now you could do it the exact
same way that we did the

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.160
previous video.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.720
We could literally take this 3x
plus 2, distribute it onto

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.860
each of these three terms,
multiply 3x plus 2 times each

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.860
of these terms, and then you're
going to distribute

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.920
each of those terms
into 3x plus 2.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.460
It would take a long time and in
reality, you'll never do it

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.090
quite that way.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.930
But you will get the same answer
we're going to get.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.130
When you have larger
polynomials, the easiest way I

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.450
can think of to multiply,
is kind of how you

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.730
multiply long numbers.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.300
So we'll write it like this.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.110
9x squared, minus 6, plus 4.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:37.010
And we're going to multiply
that times 3x plus 2.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.670
And what I imagine is, when you
multiply regular numbers,

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.930
you have your ones' place,
your tens' place, your

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.760
hundreds' place.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.590
Here, you're going to have your
constants' place, your

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.090
first degree place, your second
degree place, your

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.650
third degree place,
if there is one.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.300
And actually there will
be in this video.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.910
So you just have to put things
in their proper place.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.270
So let's do that.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.250
So you start here, you multiply
almost exactly like

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.480
you would do traditional
multiplication.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.370
2 times 4 is 8.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.440
It goes into the ones', or
the constants' place.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:20.640
2 times negative 6x
is negative 12x.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.580
And we'll put a plus there.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.390
That was a plus 8.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:28.060
2 times 9x squared is 18x
squared, so we'll put that in

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.360
the x squared place.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.000
Now let's do the 3x part.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.710
I'll do that in magenta, so you
see how it's different.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:43.480
3x times 4 is 12x,
positive 12x.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.940
3x times negative 6x,
what is that?

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.190
The x times the x is
x squared, so it's

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.780
going to go over here.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:59.330
And 3 times negative
6 is negative 18.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.330
And then finally 3x times 9x
squared, the x times the x

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.150
squared is x to the
third power.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.500
3 times 9 is 27.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.670
I wrote it in the
x third place.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.620
And once again, you just
want to add the like

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.230
terms. So you get 8.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.460
There's no other constant
terms, so it's just 8.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.670
Negative 12x plus 12x,
these cancel out.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.650
18x squared minus 18x squared
cancel out, so we're just left

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.620
over here with 27x
to the third.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:33.940
So this is equal to 27x
to the third plus 8.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.110
And we are done.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.840
And you can use this technique
to multiply a trinomial times

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.910
a binomial, a trinomial times
a trinomial, or really, you

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.290
know, you could have
five terms up here.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.930
A fifth degree times
a fifth degree.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.480
This will always work as long
