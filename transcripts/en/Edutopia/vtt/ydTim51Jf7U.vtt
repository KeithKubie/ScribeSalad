00:00:07.696 --> 00:00:12.306
&gt;&gt;Alec: When I get in arguments with my
peers, it's really hard for me to like,

00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:14.406
say I'm wrong or apologize.

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:17.436
That's why I was like, wondering if you
guys have any tips, because like, it's--

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:20.206
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: Because our students
participate in student-led meetings,

00:00:20.536 --> 00:00:22.746
they have a sense of
agency in their own life.

00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:25.856
They gain the skills
to make good decisions

00:00:25.856 --> 00:00:27.396
in school and outside of school.

00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.976
&gt;&gt;Alec: So I think I need
to improve in this area.

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:40.436
&gt;&gt;Lynnel Reed: So often, in anything
that you do in education, in life,

00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:44.206
students always feel like, "Oh, adults
are always saying their opinion.

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:45.286
I don't have a voice.

00:00:45.286 --> 00:00:46.206
I never have any say."

00:00:47.206 --> 00:00:51.076
So part of what we do with
the student-led meetings is,

00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:53.976
they get a chance to say what their
concerns are, how they see things.

00:00:55.186 --> 00:00:56.046
&gt;&gt;Alec: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:59.366
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: Alec led his
own meeting today and we bring

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:03.906
in all the teachers, me, parents, to
say, here are some strengths of mine

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.496
and here are some challenges
that I need help with.

00:01:07.096 --> 00:01:11.926
&gt;&gt;Alec: I'm very happy that they decided
to have everybody in the same room,

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:14.466
because it allows all of us
to get all on the same page.

00:01:14.856 --> 00:01:18.306
&gt;&gt;Like my schoolwork and tests and
stuff is pretty good, but when it comes

00:01:18.306 --> 00:01:19.616
to homework, it's really bad.

00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:22.816
&gt;&gt;Homework really hurt
my grades this quarter,

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:23.976
so that's something I
really need to improve.

00:01:24.046 --> 00:01:26.826
&gt;&gt;The second I get home, I don't feel

00:01:26.826 --> 00:01:29.016
like doing anything else
involving school.

00:01:29.016 --> 00:01:31.056
&gt;&gt;Kaitlin Kelley: They're not
making up what's going to happen

00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:32.686
in this meeting on the spot, right.

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:34.086
That's intimidating.

00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:37.586
Instead, he's got this structured
document, with things he's proud of,

00:01:37.626 --> 00:01:40.926
things he needs to work on, specific
steps that he's going to take.

00:01:41.486 --> 00:01:43.816
&gt;&gt;Lynnel Reed: So they come up
with their steps and their goals,

00:01:44.316 --> 00:01:47.846
and what they want to work on and
what they may need support with.

00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:51.656
&gt;&gt;Alec: For me, it's actually being
able to sit down and get it done,

00:01:51.656 --> 00:01:53.566
because once I sit down and get
it done, it's going to get done.

00:01:53.706 --> 00:01:57.686
Getting started is the hardest
part for me, so I could stay after

00:01:57.976 --> 00:02:00.026
and do my homework before I go home.

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:05.376
&gt;&gt;Kathy Murphy: For mom and dad, when
a student stays with me, I write a note

00:02:05.716 --> 00:02:09.016
and I say, "Alec stayed
today until three thirty.

00:02:09.016 --> 00:02:10.666
He did a great job working on his PAL."

00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:13.436
So that way, there's good
communication back and forth.

00:02:14.256 --> 00:02:19.386
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: I think it's about him
having to set goals for himself

00:02:19.386 --> 00:02:22.496
and for us to give him the
best tools to work with so

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:23.576
that he can accomplish those goals.

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:26.126
&gt;&gt;Chad: And then you'd be able
to see yourself in a new light,

00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:29.036
which only gives you
more of that confidence.

00:02:29.796 --> 00:02:34.326
&gt;&gt;The fact that he has, you know, eight
or nine, ten adults for these meetings

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:38.296
to actually get on the same page and
say, "Look, we recognize you're here.

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:42.486
We see where you've come from and we
want you to tell us where you want

00:02:42.486 --> 00:02:46.016
to go," and just having that
collaboration, it's wonderful.

00:02:46.696 --> 00:02:52.526
&gt;&gt;Alec: I just wanted to thank Mr.
St. Louis real quick and all of you

00:02:52.646 --> 00:02:53.866
for being such good teachers.

00:02:54.676 --> 00:02:56.466
I think I improved more
just because I've got,

00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:58.056
like a personal relationship
with all of you.

00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:01.486
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: As students get
a little older and especially

00:03:01.486 --> 00:03:03.896
in their junior year, we have
these meetings called PEP meetings,

00:03:03.896 --> 00:03:05.936
which is planning for
educational progress.

00:03:06.106 --> 00:03:07.746
&gt;&gt;Kaitlin Kelley: So
Jocelyn's meeting is different.

00:03:07.746 --> 00:03:10.576
She too will lead hers, but hers
is more focused on her future.

00:03:10.926 --> 00:03:14.436
&gt;&gt;Jocelyn: I went to Holy Cross,
I've been around Clark a lot,

00:03:14.786 --> 00:03:17.736
but those are the only two
colleges I've really seen, I guess.

00:03:17.836 --> 00:03:20.256
&gt;&gt;Lynnel Reed: During
junior PEPs we like to find

00:03:20.256 --> 00:03:24.836
out what their future college
ideas, goals, aspirations are.

00:03:25.276 --> 00:03:27.316
&gt;&gt;Jocelyn: The medical field,
like is very fascinating for me

00:03:27.316 --> 00:03:29.336
but I haven't really gone
more in depth with it.

00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:34.286
&gt;&gt;This meeting was basically to evaluate
where I should be looking for colleges

00:03:34.586 --> 00:03:37.656
and to see what are my strengths
and what I need to work on more.

00:03:38.046 --> 00:03:41.146
&gt;&gt;Lynnel Reed: A lot of our students are
the first generation to go to college,

00:03:41.436 --> 00:03:45.066
so they don't have any experience
in the process and sometimes

00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:48.216
because they don't, they
think that it's out of reach.

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:52.946
It's really an opportunity for
them to get that support from us.

00:03:53.726 --> 00:03:57.906
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: I wrote my college
essay actually around this idea

00:03:57.906 --> 00:03:59.916
that I had of perhaps
being a physical therapist.

00:04:00.296 --> 00:04:02.756
I know, I know, you look at me now.

00:04:03.056 --> 00:04:06.326
Then I got to college and I saw, oh,

00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:09.956
it's like all science
classes all the time,

00:04:10.476 --> 00:04:12.646
which I hadn't really realized that.

00:04:12.826 --> 00:04:15.436
So do you find yourself interested
in the sciences like that,

00:04:15.436 --> 00:04:17.096
like taking that amount on?

00:04:17.096 --> 00:04:20.546
&gt;&gt;Jocelyn: I know that science is
not that of my highest strengths

00:04:20.716 --> 00:04:23.966
but if I apply myself, I think I could.

00:04:24.016 --> 00:04:28.326
&gt;&gt;Lynnel Reed: Student-led
meetings allow our students to feel

00:04:28.326 --> 00:04:34.206
like they have a chance to talk to staff
on another level as humans with a life

00:04:34.206 --> 00:04:36.336
and an experience that can be shared.

00:04:36.986 --> 00:04:41.526
&gt;&gt;Jocelyn: My meeting helped me
understand that you don't really need

00:04:41.526 --> 00:04:45.796
to know your passion right away,
but it's really good to have an idea

00:04:45.796 --> 00:04:48.396
of what kind of college is right for me.

00:04:48.566 --> 00:04:51.096
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: At the center
of any meeting like this,

00:04:51.096 --> 00:04:53.256
especially since the
students are leading them,

00:04:53.936 --> 00:04:57.066
is just a baseline of real respect.

00:04:57.266 --> 00:04:59.366
You're in the driver's
seat, it's your life.

00:04:59.556 --> 00:05:01.796
Love yourself, respect
yourself, we're here to help.

00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:04.616
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You know, be patient
with yourself and as you said

00:05:04.616 --> 00:05:07.386
in the last line, take it
a day at a time, right?
