STEVE VINTER: Good to go?

00:10:54.953 --> 00:10:55.994
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:55.994 --> 00:10:57.505
STEVE VINTER: Yes, it is.

00:10:57.505 --> 00:10:58.005
All set?

00:11:14.859 --> 00:11:15.650
Welcome, everybody.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:20.851
It is my great pleasure to do
an introduction this morning.

00:11:20.851 --> 00:11:21.850
My name is Steve Vinter.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.380
I'm on of the site leads here.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.530
A few years ago we had a
vision of creating a space that

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.939
was more than just a
way of connecting three

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:32.230
separate buildings, but was
actually creating a campus.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.591
And one of the wonderful
outcomes of that

00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:36.340
was the space that
we're sitting in today,

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.280
which we affectionately call
Boston Commons, which is just

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:45.090
an amazing place to meet
and to hear people talk.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.790
And as part of the vision
of creating this space,

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.120
we also had the
vision of filling it

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.310
with big ideas and really
interesting people.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.240
And it's my incredible pleasure
to introduce our speakers

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.270
today, who really are the
inaugural participants

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.560
in Thought Leadership
Series that we're

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.010
bringing into Cambridge,
and sharing with not just

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.070
Googlers in this building or
Googlers around the world,

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.100
but also with the
community here.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.060
And the community
here is magnificent.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.150
Obviously, we have
MIT across the street.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.820
This university,
Harvard, I think

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:24.690
you may have heard of, up
the street a little bit.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.020
But then, an amazing
mix of industries here.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:28.710
Biotech.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.674
The center of the world
is here, and so on.

00:12:30.674 --> 00:12:32.590
So it's just a great
place to bring people in,

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.484
and I'm so happy that
we're starting here.

00:12:36.484 --> 00:12:38.400
And what's really exciting
is about education,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.960
which is one of my
personal passions.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.110
So having the first session
talk about education is great.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.269
I'd first like to
introduce Karen Miller.

00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:47.810
She's the host and
executive director

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:51.360
of WGBH's Innovation
Hub radio show.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.940
I don't know if you hear this
much, but from my perspective

00:12:53.940 --> 00:13:01.030
WGBH is one of the jewels of
communication and information

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.952
in Boston.

00:13:01.952 --> 00:13:02.910
KARA MILLER: Thank you.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:07.250
STEVE VINTER: So you ought to
be very honored to work there.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.284
Professor Eric Mazur.

00:13:09.284 --> 00:13:11.200
He's from Harvard's
internationally recognized

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.860
Education Innovator,
and he's an advocate

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.300
of Peer Instruction,
which is what

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.950
we're going to talk about today.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.580
A lot of people
would obviously think

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.364
that I would bring in
someone like Eric to talk.

00:13:21.364 --> 00:13:23.530
But, obviously, I had a lot
of people to choose from

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:28.060
and I chose Eric simply because
it's his birthday today.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.350
So let's hear it for
Eric's birthday today.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:31.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.659
I think every birthday should
be spent coming to Google

00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:35.200
and talking about
something you love.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.400
And I think that's
the case today.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.870
So thank you both for coming
here and joining the Thought

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.850
Leaders at Google Cambridge,
an event as you said,

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.390
is going to be streamed
everywhere through YouTube.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:54.660
And welcome, all the people
who are out there in the world.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.860
We do have a process that
we use called Dory, which

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.930
is a way of having live
questions be asked,

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.340
and we also have the system
for people to actually vote.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.152
So the people that
are in this room

00:14:05.152 --> 00:14:06.610
have little hand-held
things so you

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.920
get a chance to vote on things.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.430
I have no idea how you're
going to use that, but use it

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.180
carefully and wisely
is my recommendation.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.790
Without further
ado, Kara and Eric.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:17.700
Thank you very much.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.158
KARA MILLER: Thanks
so much, Steve.

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:22.340
Thanks to Warren,
and especially Carly

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:26.120
who really helped from the
beginning organize this.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.710
And we talked about
in the beginning,

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.290
we wanted to bring
somebody who would

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.110
talk about an issue
that's of real interest

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.810
right now, that would
be fun here from,

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.126
and Eric was the first
person I thought of.

00:14:40.126 --> 00:14:41.750
It is absolutely
right when Steve said,

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:42.740
there's a lot of biotech here.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.050
There's a lot of really
interesting people and things

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:45.900
going on.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.390
But Eric is a great
person to talk to.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:52.310
So be thinking as we're
talking of your questions,

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.560
because we want to take those.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.180
And if you're in the
room, there's the mics.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.170
There's Dory.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.430
If you're listening,
there's tweeting.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.470
We're looking at your tweets.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:05.800
So feel free to be part
of the conversation.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.340
And as we said, as Steve alluded
to, there's a quiz coming up.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.110
Literally, there's
a quiz coming up.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.910
But let's just start with this.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.680
And you've sort of
traveled this path

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.660
of learning about learning,
like what learning really means.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.520
And I think we're at a point--
I mean, you teach at Harvard--

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.500
but we're at this point
of higher education

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.990
where, if you go
to private school

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:34.140
north of $200,000
a year-- I mean

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.110
$200,000 for the four years.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.445
Getting to about a
quarter million dollars

00:15:38.445 --> 00:15:40.430
to go to college.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.710
And I think people
wonder, is it worth it?

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.750
Is it worth a tremendous
amount of paying back

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:49.260
student loans, a
tremendous amount of debt?

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.580
And you've seen how college
average-- what's your view?

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.460
ERIC MAZUR: Well, I think if
you look at the data they still

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.870
show that it's worth
paying that amount of money

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:02.240
for future returns.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.180
The real question is, are
we using that money wisely

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.390
and educating people
in the optimal way?

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.410
And that is not
immediately obvious to me.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.680
KARA MILLER: What are we
doing in those four years

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.382
that you see as potentially
not using the money wisely?

00:16:18.382 --> 00:16:20.590
ERIC MAZUR: Well, I think
if you look at the approach

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:24.940
to teaching in most
classroom settings,

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:30.080
both in higher education and
also in K through 12 education,

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.580
it's a very antiquated
approach focusing mainly

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.740
on information transfer.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.020
In fact, when I started
teaching at Harvard,

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.870
which is now, what,
over 30 years ago?

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.410
I never asked
myself the question,

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:47.970
how am I going to teach?

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.350
It was patently obvious
what I was going to do.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.960
I was going to do
my students what

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.950
my professors had done to me.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:59.290
And it's not because I wanted
to take revenge or anything.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.120
It's basically because
I naively believed,

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.180
I learned it in a room not
very different from this one,

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.290
with everybody facing me and
the professors talking to me.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.540
So that's how one learns.

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:15.660
So in a sense, I projected
my own experiences

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.569
and didn't really ask
myself, where did I learn it?

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.609
KARA MILLER: You were doing
the classic lecture, which

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:28.109
we've all been in
many, many times.

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:30.980
Were the students that
were learning from you

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.720
absorbing the material that
you were giving to them?

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.036
How much were they learning?

00:17:36.036 --> 00:17:38.160
ERIC MAZUR: I don't know
if they were absorbing it.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.660
Somebody once described
the lecture as a process

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.820
whereby the lecture
notes of the instructor

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.890
get transferred to the
notebooks of the students

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.320
without passing through
the brains of either.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.820
That's pretty much what was
going on in my classroom.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.570
Let me give you a
little bit more context.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.590
I was asked to teach the class
that none of my colleagues

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:02.034
wanted to teach, physics
for pre-medical students.

00:18:02.034 --> 00:18:04.200
These were not students who
wanted to learn physics.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.810
They already dreaded
physics before setting foot

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.260
into my classroom.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.880
At the end of the semester, the
evaluations of the instructor,

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.876
these pre-meds tended
to be very harsh.

00:18:14.876 --> 00:18:16.250
This is why none
of my colleagues

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.070
wanted to teach that course.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.050
And I, as an assistant
professor who

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:23.980
had not been educated
in this country,

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.020
didn't know any of this.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.960
So I just accepted
this assignment.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.480
Not that I had choice.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.890
And what happened was
actually quite interesting.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.420
The idea that I was
doing the right thing

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:41.260
got reinforced, because
the students ended up

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.380
high valuations.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.410
Four point five on
a five-point scale.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.630
They did well on the
examinations I gave them.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.500
So I pretty quickly
became convinced

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.730
that I was the world's
best physics teacher.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:57.420
KARA MILLER: And then?

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.830
ERIC MAZUR: And then.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.330
KARA MILLER: I'm guessing
this doesn't end here,

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.550
in sweetness and
light and rainbows.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.770
ERIC MAZUR: Well, it went
on for quite a few years.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.530
I think seven or so.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:14.192
And then in my seventh year,
just for getting tenure

00:19:14.192 --> 00:19:19.000
at Harvard, I came across
an article that showed data,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
basically that made an
instrument, a questionnaire,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.920
if you want, using
word-based questions.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.590
So no drawings, no equations.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.360
Just words, to test
students' understanding

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.187
of very basic physics.

00:19:31.187 --> 00:19:33.020
Essentially, the concept
of force, which you

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:38.510
learn in week one in
my course at Harvard.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.040
And it showed that, in the
southwest of the US-- Arizona,

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:47.280
New Mexico, California--
if you test students

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.730
at the beginning of the term
and then you try it again

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.940
after two semesters,
there's no difference

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.720
between the pretest
at the beginning

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.930
and the post-test at the end.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.290
And in both cases,
quite a few students

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:01.250
score even below
what a gorilla would

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.970
score by just
pressing random keys.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.080
I thought, no way.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.607
No way.

00:20:09.607 --> 00:20:11.940
But I'm a scientist, so one
of things I've learned to do

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.800
is not just to make a statement.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.020
I thought, I'm going to show
that my students at Harvard

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:19.874
do much better.

00:20:19.874 --> 00:20:21.540
This was all in the
southwest of the US,

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.520
so I thought, maybe there's
some disease raging there.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.450
Up here in the Northeast I'm
sure things are much better.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.560
So it was too late
to do a pretest.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.790
We were already two-thirds
into the semester.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.040
So I gave it to my students.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:41.290
It took no more than
one minute to tumble out

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.860
of my ivory tower,
because as soon

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.930
as they started looking
at the questions

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:50.470
on this questionnaire, one
student raise their hand.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.890
I walked over to her
and she asked me,

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:57.540
Professor Mazur, how should
I answer these questions?

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.060
According to what you taught
us or according to the way

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.840
I usually think
about these things?

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.290
I had no idea how to answer
that question, and by the time

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.190
the test had been completed
I had been dragged out

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:11.810
of my ivory tower.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:15.400
KARA MILLER: So now,
that seems to say

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.540
since an awful lot of
information transfer

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:23.140
goes on by professor is
lecturing to their students,

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.740
and if those students
aren't absorbing anything,

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.310
then what do we make of
what goes on in colleges?

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.450
I come back to you.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:33.270
That's worth a quarter
million dollars?

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.450
ERIC MAZUR: Well clearly, I
think we still generate people

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.900
that end up doing better
than the people who

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.180
don't go to college.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:40.940
KARA MILLER: But is
that just because they

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.230
have a piece of paper?

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.514
ERIC MAZUR: Well, I
like to say that you

00:21:44.514 --> 00:21:45.930
take the types of
students that we

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.770
get in an institution
like mine-- Harvard,

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:50.777
or any other comparable
institution--

00:21:50.777 --> 00:21:53.360
even if you were to put them in
a closet for four years they'd

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.450
come out smarter, right?

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.380
Because they're a
select group of students

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.120
that takes ownership
of their learning.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.630
So you almost can't go wrong.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:06.830
But I think what that little
anecdote that I just told you

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:10.640
about, which is true anecdote,
with that made me realize

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.530
is that, in the
classroom I had been

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:16.340
focusing on
information transfer.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.580
I had basically been
transferring information

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:25.950
to the students as if the book
had not even been invented yet.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:30.704
In a sense I was
transferring the information

00:22:30.704 --> 00:22:32.120
from the textbook
to the students.

00:22:34.705 --> 00:22:37.330
And education is, of course, so
much more, because as a learner

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.121
you need to make sense
of that information.

00:22:39.121 --> 00:22:40.900
It's not enough
just to put it down

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:45.715
in your notes in your notebook
or try to remember it.

00:22:45.715 --> 00:22:47.673
You have to do something
with that information.

00:22:47.673 --> 00:22:50.700
You have to extract whatever
understanding, mental models,

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.090
interpretations there are that
you can apply in a new context.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:55.170
Right?

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.680
Because we don't want to
train our students to only

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.992
be able to solve the
problems that we teach them

00:22:59.992 --> 00:23:00.700
in the classroom.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.920
Later on they'll take on
jobs that we don't even

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.364
have words for.

00:23:06.364 --> 00:23:09.862
20 years ago the word "Google"
wouldn't have meant anything.

00:23:09.862 --> 00:23:11.570
If somebody would have
come to me saying,

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.670
I need a web
programmer, I would have

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.880
had no idea what the
person was talking about.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.406
So we need to prepare
students for the unknown.

00:23:19.406 --> 00:23:21.280
And therefore, it's not
just the information.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.640
It's sort of the mental models,
the skills, that underlie,

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.520
that transcendent, in a certain
sense, that information.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.740
So I see education as
a two-step process.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.520
One, information transfer.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.980
Two, making sense
of that information.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:42.180
And I ask myself
next, where did I

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.860
make sense of that information?

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:49.730
Where did I have the aha
moments, the, oh, I get it now.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:50.920
Ask yourself that question.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.310
I mean, you've been
in college classes.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:54.780
You've sat there, right?

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.400
How many times did you go
"aha" in the classroom?

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.840
I think usually you go "aha"
outside of the classroom when

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.580
you struggle with
all the information

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:03.790
that you've taken down.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.840
In part, that's because when
you're listening to somebody

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.310
speak, when you're
listening to a lecture,

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.100
there's no time to think.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:12.920
Right?

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.330
I mean, if you think,
your mind wanders

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.110
and you're no longer listening.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.442
Our brains are just not
wired for multitasking.

00:24:19.442 --> 00:24:21.400
KARA MILLER: Joy Ito,
who some of you may know,

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:26.800
who runs the MIT
Media Lab-- he worked

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.915
with a lot of roboticists--
had somebody attach

00:24:28.915 --> 00:24:33.040
a sensor to a student as
they went through their week,

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.546
and when their brain waves
were the least active

00:24:35.546 --> 00:24:36.670
is when they were in class.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:40.800
Less active than when
they were sleeping.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.972
I mean, when they were
sleeping they were dreaming.

00:24:42.972 --> 00:24:45.180
There's a certain amount
that goes on when you sleep,

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.670
but in class they
were really resting.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.510
OK, so you learn this.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:54.010
You learn that
the physics is not

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.230
being transferred, that people
don't really understand force.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.080
What do you do?

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.102
How do you reshape your
classroom after that right?

00:25:01.102 --> 00:25:02.560
ERIC MAZUR: So if
you see education

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.240
as a two-step process,
information transfer making

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.860
sense, and you
realize that educators

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.890
put most of their effort
on the first step,

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:13.225
leaving the second step to
the students on their own,

00:25:13.225 --> 00:25:15.350
if you think about it
pragmatically it doesn't make

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.308
much more sense to have
students be responsible

00:25:17.308 --> 00:25:19.270
for the information transfer.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:24.020
And you, as the teacher
there, in order to help them

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.280
make sense of the information.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.260
So basically, it boils down
to inverting this approach.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.210
Flipping it, as it's called now.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:34.220
So push the information transfer
outside of the classroom

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.040
so that you don't have to
regurgitate a textbook to them.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.000
You can do that with
video or a book.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.140
And then in class,
do something that

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.770
helps them build understanding.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:46.250
KARA MILLER: So
I'm in your class.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.590
I read the textbook
at home, and then

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.547
what do I do when
I get into class?

00:25:50.547 --> 00:25:52.130
ERIC MAZUR: Well,
the answer to that--

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:55.930
that's a very good
question-- is, nothing new.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:59.090
It's teach by questioning.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:04.940
Socrates said that,
what, 2000 years ago.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.840
Actually, I can explain to
you how I stumbled on this,

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.790
because the serendipity of
this is quite interesting.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:13.360
See, after I'd given my students
this questionnaire that they

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.790
did so miserably
on, I was shocked.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.462
They were shocked, too.

00:26:17.462 --> 00:26:19.420
And they had the midterm
examination coming on,

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.860
so they wanted me to go
over every single question

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.470
before the exam.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:27.000
So I came to a
question that dealt

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.280
with a truck and a car collide.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.830
And I thought, in
my mind, it was

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.870
a completely trivial question.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.550
So I made a few
drawings on the board

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.480
and in two minutes
I explained it.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.970
And I turned around and I
could see from their faces

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:43.510
that they were confused.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:45.580
So asked, is there
any questions?

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.241
They were so confused they
couldn't articulate a question.

00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:49.490
So I thought, this is serious.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:51.531
I erased the board, and
in the next eight minutes

00:26:51.531 --> 00:26:53.680
I managed to produce the
most brilliant explanation

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.110
you can possibly imagine.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:58.400
The whole board was covered
with equations and drawings,

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.000
and I triumphantly
turnaround, thinking,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.820
I nailed it this
time, only to see

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.600
that they look
even more confused.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.180
And they still couldn't
articulate a coherent question.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.550
So you know how it is, right?

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:11.924
If you don't
understand something

00:27:11.924 --> 00:27:14.260
it's hard to articulate it.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.590
So I didn't know what to do.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:19.139
I'd used my whole arsenal
trying to explain it.

00:27:19.139 --> 00:27:21.430
But I knew that half of them
had given the right answer

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:25.060
on that particular question, so
in a moment of despair I said,

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.320
why don't you discuss
it with each other?

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.540
And something happened
that I'd never seen before.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.060
I had 250 students in my class.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.429
Complete chaos broke out.

00:27:36.429 --> 00:27:37.470
They all started arguing.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:38.790
They forgot about me
in front of the class.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:39.750
I could've walked away.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.820
They would not have noticed it.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.882
And what happened is, two
minutes they figured it out.

00:27:45.882 --> 00:27:48.730
At first I thought,
how is that possible?

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:49.656
Right?

00:27:49.656 --> 00:27:53.590
I mean, I, the expert,
have taken 10 minutes

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:56.330
to explain it, unsuccessfully?

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:58.740
And in just two minutes
they figured it out?

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.930
Imagine you're Mary and John
sitting next to each other.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.450
Mary has the right
answer, John does not.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.380
On average, Mary's
more likely convince

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.390
John than the other way around.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:10.960
But the key point is this.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.200
Mary is more likely
to convince John

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.570
than Professor Mazur
in front of the class,

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.700
because she has only
recently learned it.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.300
She still knows what
the difficulties

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.508
are to the beginning learner.

00:28:21.508 --> 00:28:24.120
As Professor Mazur learned
it such a long time ago.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.640
To him it is so clear that
he cannot even imagine why

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.310
somebody doesn't understand it.

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.280
KARA MILLER: So
you're going to do

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.770
a demo for us, of this sort of
idea of flipping the classroom.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:38.244
So if you do not have one,
if you're in this room,

00:28:38.244 --> 00:28:40.160
make sure you get one
of these, because you're

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.560
going to get to participate.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.890
We're flipping the
classroom here.

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:47.850
And if you are watching
on the live stream, Eric,

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.870
you can tell people how
they can participate.

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:52.619
You can vote on what
the right answer is.

00:28:52.619 --> 00:28:53.160
Take it away.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.850
ERIC MAZUR: Well, first
of all it would be good

00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:00.330
if you were not sitting
alone, because you will not

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:01.339
have anybody to talk to.

00:29:01.339 --> 00:29:03.130
So you might want to
find somebody on Skype

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:05.190
to talk to, or sit
next to somebody.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:13.680
But go to rwpoll.com-- RW,
ResponseWare-- and then

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.190
enter the session ID, emazur.

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:21.010
My initial, Eric, e, and then my
last name, M-A-Z-U-R. In fact,

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:26.570
if we could have the
slide up on the screen,

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.110
then you see my name and
the spelling on there.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:32.240
And if you're a Twitter, you can
use my Twitter handle to tweet,

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.420
although I can't promise I'll
look at tweets while you talk.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:41.180
OK, I asked you to give
them all this little handout

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.057
about thermal expansion.

00:29:43.057 --> 00:29:44.140
Did you give that to them?

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:44.806
KARA MILLER: No.

00:29:44.806 --> 00:29:46.670
ERIC MAZUR: You did not?

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.690
How are we going
to do this, then?

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:53.186
Because you need to read
to before coming to class.

00:29:53.186 --> 00:29:54.310
Well, actually, it's great.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:57.960
I'll give a little lecture
about thermal expansion.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.800
I don't get to lecture
in my own classes,

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.950
so I'm actually
happy you didn't.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.530
KARA MILLER: Fantastic.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:06.160
ERIC MAZUR: So
thermal expansion is

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.764
something that is really
important in engineering.

00:30:09.764 --> 00:30:11.305
Thermal expansion
deals with the fact

00:30:11.305 --> 00:30:17.350
that hard solids, like wood
or steel or stone or concrete,

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:23.450
expand when they get hotter and
contract when they get colder.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.770
For example, you may have
been in a train at low speed

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.330
and heard this clickety-clack
sound of the wheels

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.079
as the wheels go over gaps in
different sections of the rail.

00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:32.620
You may have wondered,
why don't they

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.740
just jam the rails together?

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:38.340
Well, if they were not
leaving that little gap

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.700
between different sections
of the rail and the weather

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.600
heats up and the rail
expands, bad things

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.220
happen, as you can
see on the screen.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.440
Same thing with steel-beam
buildings, like this one.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.990
You need to take into
account the expansion

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.290
of the steel in hotter weather.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:54.720
Otherwise, things can go
wrong with the expansion.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:00.270
Next time you park your car in a
big concrete parking structure,

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:04.430
look down and you'll see that
the concrete doesn't extend

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:07.650
all the way from one side to
the other, but there are gaps.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.650
Every 30 yards or so, there's
a gap filled with rubber

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:15.010
to permit the
concrete to expand.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:19.570
Now, you may wonder
why materials expand.

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:21.240
Well, materials--
solids, I should

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.370
say-- are made, like
any other material,

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:26.470
from atoms that are
usually in fixed positions.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:31.340
And atoms get further away from
each other when it gets hotter.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:35.080
So this is cold, and that's hot.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.420
Cold, and hot.

00:31:39.777 --> 00:31:40.860
That's all there is to it.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.730
That's the only thing
I'm going to test you on.

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:46.480
I won't test you on
it, but you my wonder,

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.940
why is it that they get
further away from each other?

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.440
The reason is that atoms
don't sit still, they vibrate.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.900
And the amplitude
of that vibration

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.600
is what we call temperature.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.610
So when you touch
something, in a sense

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:00.570
you feel the energy
associated with the atoms that

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:02.340
are moving back and forth.

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.284
If you are cold you
have little amplitude.

00:32:04.284 --> 00:32:05.950
If you're hot, you
have a big amplitude,

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.440
which means you need more space.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.610
And they all push
each other away.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:14.410
Not just the nine that
are on the screen.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:15.090
All of them.

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.975
The millions, billions of
atoms that make up a solid.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:24.047
Cold, and hot.

00:32:24.047 --> 00:32:25.380
Does anybody have any questions?

00:32:29.002 --> 00:32:31.377
Thank you for reaffirming that
I'm such a great lecturer.

00:32:31.377 --> 00:32:32.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:36.820
But I'm not going to black
out the screen and ask you,

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:40.129
when solids get hotter,
they expand because A,

00:32:40.129 --> 00:32:41.920
the atoms get further
away from each other.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.045
Two, they stay
the same distance.

00:32:43.045 --> 00:32:44.370
Three, they get close together.

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:46.830
That would be just me
giving information to you.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:49.950
You giving that same
information back to me.

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:54.000
I want to see if you can take
this idea of the atoms getting

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.170
further away from each
other and apply it

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:59.890
in a different context.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.900
So you better ask me questions.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:07.210
Cold, and hot.

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:08.182
Yes?

00:33:08.182 --> 00:33:10.150
AUDIENCE: So what happens
when something melts?

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:11.620
ERIC MAZUR: So what happens
when something melts?

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:12.777
Very good question.

00:33:12.777 --> 00:33:14.360
Again, we only deal
with solids, so we

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.200
don't have to worry
about the question.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.870
But as it gets
hotter and hotter,

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:21.370
the atoms go further and
further away from each other.

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:24.400
At a certain point they
lose their attraction

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.310
and they lose their
position, and they melt.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:30.260
They go into a different
phase, and they eventually

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.260
become a gas.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.760
But we won't get
anywhere near that.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.100
Yes?

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.752
AUDIENCE: Is this
true for all solids?

00:33:38.752 --> 00:33:40.210
ERIC MAZUR: Is true
for all solids.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:41.430
Yes, absolutely.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.020
Even ice.

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.770
Ice as it melts
does funny things,

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.300
but even if you take ice and
you cool it down, it shrinks.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.640
And if you heat it
up again, it expands.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.950
Until the melting point,
when strange things happen.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:54.060
But yeah, it's true
for all solids.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.710
All hard solids.

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:58.900
A bagel, or a fried egg.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.521
It won't be, but any hard solid.

00:34:01.521 --> 00:34:02.437
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:07.090
KARA MILLER: Do you
want to actually

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.486
come to the microphone,
then everybody can hear it?

00:34:10.486 --> 00:34:11.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sure.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.943
So you've got this picture here
of the railroad tracks falling

00:34:13.943 --> 00:34:14.530
apart.

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:17.090
Is that because the railroad
tracks got hot and the ground

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.920
didn't, or is that because there
are two different things going

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.480
on there?

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.239
ERIC MAZUR: No.

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:24.780
The track and the ground, of
course, both become hotter.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:29.120
But the track as it expands,
each section of steel

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.053
becomes a little bit longer.

00:34:31.053 --> 00:34:32.070
Right?

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.810
It becomes a little bit longer,
but it has no place to go,

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:38.805
because as it expands
and links, there's

00:34:38.805 --> 00:34:40.810
another section
next to it, which

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:42.370
is also trying to get longer.

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:44.230
AUDIENCE: But didn't
the ground get longer?

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:45.230
ERIC MAZUR: Not as much.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.860
That's a good question.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.170
The stone does not
expand as much.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:54.190
Actually, metals expand
much more than just

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:57.200
about any other material.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.260
So thank you for
asking a question.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.845
Excellent question.

00:35:00.845 --> 00:35:03.220
I think you're ready, because
the questions you're asking

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:07.880
are way beyond what
I'm going to ask.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.600
So get ready.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.360
Oh by the way, let me quickly
show you how this works.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.700
I see four of you.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.885
I see this little window here.

00:35:15.885 --> 00:35:17.510
I can see that already
four people have

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:18.690
been playing with
their clickers.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:19.280
Very good.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.520
Why don't you all
press a button?

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.800
And then you'll see that
this number here-- I

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.500
can zoom in-- so you
can see it goes up.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.180
OK, very good.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.435
The people who are remote,
there'll be a slight delay

00:35:30.435 --> 00:35:31.670
but it'll go up.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:35.410
And at any point, I can
display the distribution.

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:38.780
Why don't you all press one?

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.890
I love it when audiences
follow my instruction.

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:43.130
Thank you.

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:47.880
OK, and then when I hit stop
here you can no longer vote.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.630
So this is what
we're going to do.

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:53.632
I'm going you ask
you a question.

00:35:53.632 --> 00:35:56.090
You're going to think about
the question, about the answer.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:58.450
It's going to be
multiple choice.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:00.000
You press a button
that corresponds

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.790
to the answer you
think is correct.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:05.590
If you change your mind
before I close the polling,

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:07.230
you can change your mind.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:10.280
You can press, let's say,
first five and then seven.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.270
The seven will
override the five.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.920
Once I stop it you can
no longer change it.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.715
I don't want you to
talk to anybody else.

00:36:16.715 --> 00:36:20.820
I want your individual
commitment on that first round.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.320
If I hear you talk
to somebody else,

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.210
I'll come to you
with this microphone

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.220
and you'll have to tell
everybody what you just

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.820
told him.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.790
Then, I'm going
to ask you to find

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:32.564
a neighbor who has
a different answer.

00:36:32.564 --> 00:36:34.980
So you turn to your neighbor
and you're right and you say,

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.110
I chose this answer.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:38.580
If that neighbor
has the same answer,

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.160
you say, thank you
very much, and you

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.510
turn to the person on your left.

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.343
If everybody around you
has the same answer,

00:36:43.343 --> 00:36:44.480
get up and walk around.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.015
You have to find somebody
who has a different answer.

00:36:47.015 --> 00:36:49.630
If you just sit there
without talking to anybody,

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:52.660
I will come and talk to you.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.770
So find somebody
else and then try

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:56.520
to convince that person
that you are right

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.950
and he or she is wrong.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:59.290
OK?

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:00.330
Clear?

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:01.900
Good.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.150
So here is the question.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.110
Consider a rectangular
metal plate

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:12.290
with a circular hole in it.

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:15.620
When the plate is
uniformly heated,

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.890
what happens to the
diameter of-- I haven't even

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:21.330
read the question and there's
already three people who

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:24.180
have answered-- what happens
to the diameter of the hole?

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.880
Does it increase?

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.030
Does it stay the same?

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:30.645
Or does it decrease?

00:37:30.645 --> 00:37:32.770
I'm going to give you one
minute to think about it.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.850
OK, so if you don't have the
answer right now, don't worry.

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:07.960
Nothing depends on it.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.810
Your salary will
not be affected.

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:11.112
Nothing.

00:38:11.112 --> 00:38:12.690
But just make it a game.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:15.270
I do want you to make a choice.

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:20.610
So choose whichever you think is
the most reasonable answer, OK?

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.600
So we have a reasonable
number of responses,

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.200
so now please turn
to your neighbor.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.480
Find a neighbor who
has a different answer,

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.500
and try to convince that
person of your answer.

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:35.329
And again, if you don't talk,
I'll come and talk to you.

00:38:35.329 --> 00:40:43.270
[AUDIENCE CHATTER]

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:46.400
ERIC MAZUR: Now look at this.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.850
You all got engaged.

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:51.960
You got all fired up.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.590
It's OK.

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:53.140
It's OK.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.125
It's all right.

00:40:54.125 --> 00:40:55.000
You're still talking.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.850
They are gesticulating
about holes and so on.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:01.630
Hello?

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.210
Hello?

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.591
It's OK.

00:41:05.591 --> 00:41:07.090
You probably have
all forgotten here

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:10.250
that Karen and I are
here not to teach you

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:12.500
about thermal expansion.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.410
We're here to talk
about education.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.560
The answer to this question
doesn't even matter.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:21.190
You've already made my
point, how engaged you got.

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:25.260
Imagine I had just given my
little lecture, as I did,

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:28.590
and then instead of asking
you this question I said,

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:31.220
let's now apply this to
rectangular metal plates

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.750
with circular holes in it.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:35.870
If you take one of these
plates and put it in an oven

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:40.070
and turn up the oven,
the plate expands

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:43.130
and the diameter
of the hole will--

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:46.750
I'm going to keep you in
suspense a little bit longer.

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:48.731
You would have not
been engaged like this.

00:41:48.731 --> 00:41:50.480
You would have been
sleeping through this.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.590
I mean, what is more boring
than rectangular metal plates

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:56.400
with circular hols in it?

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.140
Isn't it amazing
how you can turn

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:01.020
on the curiosity
of the human mind?

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.030
Right?

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:08.460
We're all born curious and
inquisitive, and asking

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.100
for why and reasons
and everything.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.750
If anything,
education does really

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:15.610
a good job turning that
curiosity off, right?

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:18.441
It's only later in life
that we rediscover it.

00:42:18.441 --> 00:42:19.940
In a sense, what
I've shown you here

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.830
is how easy it is to
reignite that curiosity,

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:28.550
a curiosity that gives you
ownership of you're learning.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:30.040
Now, I know you want the answer.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.110
But before I tell you
what the answer is,

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:34.810
let's analyze what happened.

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:39.500
I asked you a question, and then
I had you make a commitment.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:43.460
You had to choose an
answer and press a button.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.011
And after you made
that commitment

00:42:45.011 --> 00:42:46.510
I asked you to turn
to your neighbor

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:48.590
and to externalize your answer.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.592
I chose.

00:42:51.592 --> 00:42:53.300
And something interesting
happened there,

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.439
because in that explanation--
even though I didn't come down

00:42:57.439 --> 00:42:58.855
from the podium
and listen to you,

00:42:58.855 --> 00:43:00.750
I could see it from
your gesticulation--

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:03.494
you moved away from the
answer to the reasoning.

00:43:03.494 --> 00:43:04.910
It was no longer
about the answer,

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:08.430
it was about how you
get to the answer.

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:11.350
So much education is focused
on the outcome and the answer,

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:13.430
and students are
evaluated on the answers.

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:16.490
But in any real world
problem, the outcome is known.

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:19.480
It's the path to the
outcome that's unknown.

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:20.630
It's a thinking skill.

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:24.590
This brings the thinking
back in the classroom.

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:28.350
But most importantly, you
became emotionally invested

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:29.980
in the learning process.

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.590
If Kara were to shut
me down and say,

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:35.021
Eric, we have only a few
minutes left for questions,

00:43:35.021 --> 00:43:36.520
and then we left,
you'd come running

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.949
after me asking
what the answer is.

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:41.240
You want to know the answer,
even though we're not here

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.573
to talk about thermal expansion.

00:43:42.573 --> 00:43:45.650
We're here to talk
about pedagogy.

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:49.140
OK, so before I can
give you the answer--

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:50.740
KARA MILLER: I have
to say, when you

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:54.160
said, OK, stop talking,
let's talk about why

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.310
you got all fired up, somebody
out there screamed at you,

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:59.900
what's the answer?

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:00.987
So talk about fired up.

00:44:00.987 --> 00:44:02.820
ERIC MAZUR: Before I
can tell you the answer

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.310
you need to vote a second time.

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:06.230
We need a first vote
and a second vote.

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:09.110
So please, vote again,
indicating what you now

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:11.160
believe to be the
correct answer.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:13.650
If you've chosen
a certain answer

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.100
and you've not
changed your mind,

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.810
then you just vote
the same thing again.

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:20.350
But you have to
vote a second time.

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:23.780
And I'm going to give
you 10 more seconds here.

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.326
And there's a slight delay for
people online, but that's OK.

00:44:31.112 --> 00:44:33.820
I have bad news for you.

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:37.480
I thought I gave a pretty clear
lecture on thermal expansion,

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.512
and so did you.

00:44:40.512 --> 00:44:45.050
You had only 33% got
the right answer,

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:47.174
which means one in three.

00:44:47.174 --> 00:44:48.840
You should really
have done your reading

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:49.964
before coming to this show.

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:56.210
Anyway, in a sense
you've helped me

00:44:56.210 --> 00:45:03.510
make a really important point,
because you've been telling me,

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:07.780
Eric, you're lecturing sucks.

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.260
After all, you got
only 33% right.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:11.009
But the method doesn't
work that well when

00:45:11.009 --> 00:45:13.280
there's only 33% right,
because it means only one

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.120
person of every three people.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.450
Typically you want to
have a higher percentage.

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:22.180
Anyway, the right
answer is-- oh,

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:26.250
look at all the attention
I'm getting here.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:29.650
There's not a single person
looking at his or her computer

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:33.630
screen or texting or tweeting.

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:35.980
All right, so the right
answer-- I need a new drum

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:41.340
roll-- the right
answer is, number one.

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:45.160
Let's see what the
second vote was.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.360
A small miracle happened,
because look at this.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:52.920
This was the initial
distribution here, 33%.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.650
So the correct answer
went up, that one-third

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:58.810
had had the right answer
effectively convinced

00:45:58.810 --> 00:45:59.520
the other.

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.450
But there were just
not enough of it.

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:04.376
So typically want to
choose your questions--

00:46:04.376 --> 00:46:05.750
I chose this
question on purpose,

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:07.970
because I knew people would
score around this level--

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:10.240
so that about half of
the people get it right.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.700
Then you find the largest
short-term learning gains.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:21.140
Now, I don't want you to lie
in bed tonight at 2 AM awake,

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:26.565
thinking, why is this
hole getting larger?

00:46:26.565 --> 00:46:28.690
Can I take another minute
of my precious time here?

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:29.320
KARA MILLER: Yeah, go ahead.

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:29.945
ERIC MAZUR: OK.

00:46:29.945 --> 00:46:31.910
Take a jar of jam that's
in the refrigerator.

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:33.597
Glass jar, metal lid.

00:46:33.597 --> 00:46:34.930
Take it out of the refrigerator.

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:35.880
You can't open it.

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.090
What do you do?

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:40.100
You run the lid under hot water.

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:43.970
The lid is a ring and a plate,
and the ring gets bigger,

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:45.660
so the hole in the
ring gets bigger.

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:46.950
You knew this already.

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:50.030
You say, well, you asked about
a plate, not about a jar.

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:51.820
OK.

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.570
I'm going to steal
your little piece here.

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:54.430
KARA MILLER: Yeah, that's fine.

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:56.138
ERIC MAZUR: Imagine
that we have a plate.

00:46:56.138 --> 00:46:57.252
No hole.

00:46:57.252 --> 00:46:57.960
Here's the plate.

00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:58.920
No hole.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.200
We draw a circle
on it, so now we

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.230
have a plate with
a circle on it.

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:05.260
We put it in the oven.

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.600
Turn up the temperature,
the plate expands.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.700
What happens to the
diameter of the hole?

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:11.430
Gets larger.

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:13.940
Everything gets larger, so
that has to get larger, too.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.390
You said, that's unfair.

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:17.360
You asked about a metal
plate with a hole,

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.640
and if there's a
hole then the atoms

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.150
are going to expand
into the hole.

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:22.590
In fact, most of
you had that answer.

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:24.550
Let me show you what's
wrong with that.

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:28.200
Imagine we go outside and we
form a circle holding hands.

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.630
We are the atoms at
the edge of the hole.

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:36.030
Now we step in towards
the center of the whole.

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:39.580
What just happened to
the distance between us?

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.310
It gets smaller.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:43.270
We get crunched together.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:45.110
It can't do it, because
we need more space.

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:45.910
We're shaking more.

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:49.071
The only way to increase the
distance is to take a few of us

00:47:49.071 --> 00:47:49.570
away.

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.260
But atoms don't
disappear like that.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:54.810
Or, to make the whole larger.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:56.010
You won't forget this.

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:07.180
KARA MILLER: OK, so how do
you take that kind of response

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:11.110
and that kind of
engagement and replicate it

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:12.370
across more college classes?

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:14.420
Because I did not have
any college classes

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:16.934
where anybody brought
anything this into it.

00:48:16.934 --> 00:48:18.350
I had college
classes where people

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:21.220
read chapters of their books.

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.817
Like chapter eight
today, because this

00:48:22.817 --> 00:48:24.150
is the eighth week of the class.

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:26.520
So how do you change things?

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.140
Is that possible to do?

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.779
Are teachers too
resistant to that?

00:48:29.779 --> 00:48:31.320
ERIC MAZUR: Change
is very difficult,

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.420
for a large number of reasons.

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.710
The first one is, most
teachers are perfectly

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:38.140
happy with what they're doing.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:41.050
There's no indication that
there's anything wrong, really,

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:43.577
and change is
threatening, because you

00:48:43.577 --> 00:48:45.910
don't know what it's going
to do to your end of semester

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:46.420
evaluation.

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.670
You don't know how it's
going to affect you.

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:52.660
So unless there's a real
reason to change, why change?

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:53.990
So that's one problem.

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:58.350
The second thing is that the
students also demand lecturing.

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:00.310
By the time to get into
college they've already

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:05.360
been pre-conditioned
to think, the professor

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.530
should be lecturing me.

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:09.160
In fact, I have
some students who--

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.370
after I switched to this
interactive teaching, which

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:14.220
has been 24 years
ago now-- write

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:17.380
at the end of their
evaluation questionnaire,

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:20.530
Professor Mazur is not
teaching us anything.

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:24.120
We have to learn
it all ourselves.

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.650
So I think there's resistance
from the students, too.

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:30.110
And, of course, higher
education depends on K

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:31.045
through 12 education.

00:49:31.045 --> 00:49:33.170
K through 12 education
depends on higher education.

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:36.240
So it's all sort of an
interlocking mechanism that

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.166
prevents change,
in a certain sense.

00:49:38.166 --> 00:49:40.790
KARA MILLER: I want to get your
questions in about two minutes,

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:42.790
so be thinking of them.

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:44.480
So K through 12 education.

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.940
I know you travel
all over the place.

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.940
When we were trying to schedule
a day that you could come here,

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:53.317
talking to Eric on the
phone is mind-blowing.

00:49:53.317 --> 00:49:55.650
He's like, well, I'm going
to be in Birmingham, Alabama,

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:57.483
and then I'm going to
be in the Netherlands,

00:49:57.483 --> 00:49:59.720
and then I'm going
to be in Africa.

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.485
I mean, it's crazy.

00:50:01.485 --> 00:50:02.860
And almost
everybody's having you

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.070
come and talk about
education and how

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:06.180
you've change education.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:09.220
So where are you
seeing the interest

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.200
for people who actually-- I
mean, somebody's inviting you

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.065
to speak, so somebody must be
interested in changing things.

00:50:15.065 --> 00:50:15.773
ERIC MAZUR: Yeah.

00:50:15.773 --> 00:50:17.580
Amazingly, I'm seeing
it from everywhere.

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:21.710
And I think in part it
is because of-- I'm not

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:23.320
a big believer in MOOCs.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:29.470
MOOCs or any online type
of learning environment

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:33.277
basically replicate a
failed model online,

00:50:33.277 --> 00:50:35.860
and they basically focus, again,
on this information transfer,

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.170
not on the engagement.

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:42.060
But what the MOOC
has done is it made

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:45.560
faculty realize that whatever
they do in the classroom

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.370
can be put online.

00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:48.410
And then they lose
their job, so they

00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:50.440
start questioning
about the value of what

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.670
is happening in their classroom.

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:58.080
And the whole flipped
class movement,

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.690
which is focused mostly on
the out-of-class component,

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:02.370
is now all of sudden
thinking, what

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:04.570
is it that we're going
to do in the classroom

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:05.830
if students are getting ready?

00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:09.630
So maybe those are things
that are slowly driving people

00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:12.760
to realize that we
shouldn't basically

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:16.060
be doing what people
did in the Middle Ages.

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:19.610
Other than maybe wearing
our robes at graduation.

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:20.830
Let's keep that tradition.

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:22.871
KARA MILLER: So let me
open this up to questions.

00:51:22.871 --> 00:51:25.330
There are these two
microphones here,

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:28.730
and then if we get anything from
Dory or Twitter, let me know.

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:30.330
There's one right
here, and if you

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:32.880
want to just get in line
and I'll call on you.

00:51:33.334 --> 00:51:35.750
AUDIENCE: I've been a fan of
what you've done for a couple

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:38.290
years, and I've followed
that exact problem

00:51:38.290 --> 00:51:40.770
and asked it to at
least 200 people.

00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:43.820
And PhDs in sciences
generally get it wrong.

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:46.790
Car mechanics, plumbers,
emergency medical technicians

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:48.160
generally get it right.

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.900
So my question is, do we
have things really wrong

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:51.650
in a profound way?

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:53.775
Do we have people who are
really great at hands-on,

00:51:53.775 --> 00:51:57.260
intuitive learning that could
be high-quality experimental

00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:59.050
physicists, but
because they're not

00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:01.510
good at fast manipulation
of algebraic expressions

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:05.086
on standardized tests-- and I'm
a big fan of a car mechanic--

00:52:05.086 --> 00:52:06.960
but are we limiting the
careers because we're

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.914
teaching the wrong things
and measuring the wrong way?

00:52:09.914 --> 00:52:11.580
ERIC MAZUR: That's a
very good question,

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:13.860
and I think one of the
problems is that, of course,

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:17.160
a lot of education is
focused on content.

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:20.390
But to me, in a
certain sense, content

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:23.130
is irrelevant,
because we don't know

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:26.620
what our students will
need later in life.

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:29.040
It's the skills, really,
that matter, right?

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.820
In the traditional approach to
teaching you start by thinking,

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.784
what am I going to
cover in this course?

00:52:33.784 --> 00:52:35.700
Topic one, topic two,
topic three, topic four.

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:37.839
Then you start covering
in the classroom and then

00:52:37.839 --> 00:52:39.380
after a month or so
you ask yourself,

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.544
hmm, how am I going to
assess whether or not

00:52:41.544 --> 00:52:42.710
my students have learned it?

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:45.511
And you set an examination,
and then usually you're

00:52:45.511 --> 00:52:47.260
disappointed that you
haven't accomplished

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:49.030
what you wanted to.

00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:51.430
A much more logical
approach would

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:56.100
be to use backward design, to
start at the output, advocated

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:59.050
by Grant Wiggins and Jay
McTighe in their book,

00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:00.540
"Understanding by Design."

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:03.440
So why not ask ourselves,
what are the desired

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.880
outcomes of this
educational discourse?

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.150
And you have to formulate
those with action verbs

00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:12.651
rather than saying, content
topic one, topic two, topic

00:53:12.651 --> 00:53:13.150
three.

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:14.070
You have to ask
yourself, what do

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:17.010
I want my student to be able
to do after taking this course,

00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:23.214
or after finishing this year
in school or in college?

00:53:23.214 --> 00:53:24.880
A lot of my colleagues
really like that,

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.713
but they have a lot of
difficulty with that.

00:53:26.713 --> 00:53:29.240
They will say, well,
after taking this course,

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:33.730
you will be able to understand
Topic A, Topic B, Topic

00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:36.690
C. The content is so ingrained.

00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:39.380
Anyway, once you have
formulated outcomes,

00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:42.730
you can ask yourself, what am
I going to accept as evidence?

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:44.181
So you think about
the assessment.

00:53:44.181 --> 00:53:46.180
And then, what am I going
to do in the classroom

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:48.570
to maximize those outcomes?

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:51.860
And I think in education we
haven't done enough of that.

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:54.390
KARA MILLER: I've
heard engineers say--

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:57.500
and engineering is an area
where there's a ton of dropout.

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.120
People start and
they're thinking,

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.870
oh, I'm going to be a
mechanical engineer,

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:02.880
and there's a lot of
people along the way

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.730
before they get to be a senior
in college drop that major.

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:08.910
And I've heard people
say it's because it's not

00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:10.841
until your senior that
you build anything.

00:54:10.841 --> 00:54:12.590
People say, you have
to take these courses

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:14.310
in physics and calculus.

00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:16.860
And I know you want
to build things,

00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:20.630
but you can't build
anything for several years.

00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:23.140
The thing is out there
at the end, the prize,

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:25.190
but it's a very long
time before you actually

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:28.570
get to do the fun stuff.

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:31.030
Question here.

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:33.000
AUDIENCE: I was one
of the people who

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.060
changed our answers on the basis
of talking to somebody else,

00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:41.160
and it was interesting to
me because it wasn't exactly

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:44.350
that I agreed with the
other person's explanation

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:47.130
or theory of what was going on.

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:50.900
It was more that it
caused me to realize

00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:54.580
that, in my original thinking,
it was exactly what you ended

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:57.560
up with in your explanation,
that the only way

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.130
for the circle to get smaller
would be for some atoms

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:02.320
to be closer together,
which would violate

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:03.670
the whole principle.

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:06.440
But that was not the explanation
that the other person gave it

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.210
all.

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:10.050
So what's interesting
to me about it

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:12.380
is what was going on there.

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:17.820
And so, for example, you offered
earlier one sort of suggestion

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.190
that there's something
about emotional investment.

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:22.550
So one theory, one
hypothesis, might

00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:25.000
be, you get emotionally
invested and that

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.350
makes you more motivated
to question and dive

00:55:29.350 --> 00:55:31.610
deeper into your own thought
patterns or whatever.

00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:34.740
I'm sure there are many other
hypotheses for what's going on,

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:38.250
and I'm sure that by this
point many people have studied

00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:41.360
the psychological and
cognitive aspects of what's

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:42.680
really happening here.

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.260
And I wonder if you could just
say a few words about what

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:47.380
the current thinking is on that.

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.540
ERIC MAZUR: Yeah.

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.190
Of course, it's not
that easy to study,

00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:55.820
because you can't measure what's
going on in people's head.

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:58.020
But we've done an
experiment where

00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:00.720
we vary the activity
between the two polling.

00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:04.530
So what you did was
poll, discuss, repoll.

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:07.710
So what we've done with a
class is we've taken students,

00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:11.750
we've polled them, then
distracted them with cartoons.

00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:13.900
No talking, were just
distracted with cartoons,

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:15.690
and we polled them again.

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:19.960
And then we took another set
of students and we polled them,

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.420
and then we were silent
for two minutes so

00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:26.450
that they don't exchange
ideas and they don't talk.

00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:29.150
And we polled them again.

00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:30.520
And then poll, discuss.

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.520
So depending on the
activity in the middle

00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:36.400
we find some
interesting results.

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.430
Even if you distract
people with cartoons,

00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:41.170
the second polling, on
average, is 4% higher

00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:42.470
than the one before.

00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:44.720
So clearly, even though
you distract them,

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:47.195
people keep thinking.

00:56:47.195 --> 00:56:49.570
If you don't distract them
and you give them all the time

00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:52.300
to really continue to think,
you see a much larger gain,

00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:53.650
like 10%.

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:56.870
But that shoots up to 16%
once you have the discussion.

00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:58.630
So the discussion
actually does something.

00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:02.940
The interchange of ideas.

00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:06.460
And had I showed you some
video of my classroom--

00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:09.445
I didn't pay enough attention
to you while you were talking--

00:57:09.445 --> 00:57:11.070
but if you see a
video of my classroom,

00:57:11.070 --> 00:57:15.210
you'll actually see
students go, oh.

00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:17.650
You see that aha moment
occurring in front of you.

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:20.260
So clearly, at some
point in the discussion,

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:24.890
triggered by who knows what,
you had this aha moment.

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:28.040
Aha moment was, if the
circle gets smaller,

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.800
the atoms are crunched together.

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.569
What exactly triggered that?

00:57:31.569 --> 00:57:32.110
I don't know.

00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:33.910
That's one of the
mysteries of the brain.

00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:39.694
Because learning, after all,
is a social experience, right?

00:57:39.694 --> 00:57:41.610
In fact, most of the
things we do-- everything

00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:44.544
we de-- is a social
experiment, learning included.

00:57:44.544 --> 00:57:46.710
Even though we treat it
like a completely individual

00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:49.382
experience, which I think is
not the right thing to do.

00:57:49.382 --> 00:57:50.840
KARA MILLER: Another
question here.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.340
AUDIENCE: I'm going to read a
few questions from the Dory.

00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:54.930
What kinds of technological
advancements-- hardware

00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:57.310
or software-- would
help peer instruction

00:57:57.310 --> 00:57:58.800
become even more effective?

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.350
What sort of not-yet-developed
gizmo or application

00:58:01.350 --> 00:58:03.150
do you think would be useful?

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:06.720
ERIC MAZUR: OK, so when I
started there was no hardware.

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:12.120
It just got developed as a
result of peer instruction,

00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:15.900
and it's now a $100
million-a-year industry,

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.270
growing.

00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:20.580
But it's not about
the technology.

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:21.750
It's about the pedagogy.

00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:23.770
We could have done
exactly the same thing

00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:26.980
with hands on the chest
indicating one, two, three,

00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:29.880
or having flashcards, and
I would have seen the same.

00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:31.630
There would have
been same engagement.

00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:33.260
It's not about the technology.

00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:35.030
It's about the pedagogy.

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:38.112
Now, after this I founded
a software company,

00:58:38.112 --> 00:58:39.570
Learning Catalytics,
that basically

00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:44.690
allows people to use handheld
devices like smartphones

00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:45.770
or laptops.

00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:48.530
And also, get away
from multiple choice.

00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:50.250
So people can just
draw something,

00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:52.550
or they can type in
an expression or type

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:55.580
in some words, and the
system can actually

00:58:55.580 --> 00:59:01.560
analyze, use analytics, hence
the word "learning catalytics,"

00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:04.260
to basically
tabulate the answers

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:08.320
and display them in a meaningful
way for the instructor.

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:09.760
Where do we go from here?

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:15.530
I think the big interesting
thing is, how do we push this

00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:18.060
from a synchronous mode,
which is what we did here,

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:22.780
to something that's asynchronous
and on the internet as a whole?

00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:25.520
Frankly, that's not
completely clear to me.

00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.720
But that's an interesting
question to study.

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.970
KARA MILLER: It's interesting.

00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:31.040
A lot of you know Sal Kahn.

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:35.270
Obviously, Khan Academy is big.

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:37.880
And when you kind
of press him on,

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.010
how do you really
make this interactive?

00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:44.000
He says, kids do
do modules at home.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:44.870
They come in.

00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:48.230
The teacher basically has a
screen and can look and see,

00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:50.390
well, Johnny does
not understand when

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:54.750
you've got two equations
with two different variables.

00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:55.970
He's not getting that.

00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:58.140
And they can go over.

00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:01.240
But then, how do you take
the teacher out of that?

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.240
The final thing is, can
you take the teacher out

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.420
of that equation and
still make it work?

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:07.750
And I think you're saying
it's kind of not clear

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:11.407
yet that you can, that
it can all be online.

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:12.740
ERIC MAZUR: That's the question.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.500
Could you move some
of that online?

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.140
Actually you can teach take
the teacher out of this.

01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:20.530
There's an organization in India
called the Monte Fellows that

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:22.380
took this idea of
peer instruction

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:25.760
and did something
absolutely amazing.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.270
Mind-blowing.

01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:30.840
India has a big shortage
of science teachers,

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.130
especially in rural India.

01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:34.410
And they have a
need for, I think,

01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:35.840
several million
science teachers.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.110
No way they can
even generate that.

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.720
So what they did is, they
created this organization

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.470
that develops a curriculum,
which is interactive,

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:45.000
and then they have
classroos staffed

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.020
by social workers who
have no content knowledge.

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:48.850
None whatsoever.

01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:51.680
I went to see one of these
classrooms in Mumbai.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.110
You have to imagine 40
kids crammed together

01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:57.870
in a space not much larger than
this stage with just two of us

01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:59.120
on it right now.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.610
Shoulder to shoulder.

01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:02.300
And the social
worker shows a video

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:07.020
of an instructor delivering
some science class.

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:08.260
Five, seven minutes.

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:12.400
And then comes up a
question, just like you did.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.020
They raised colored cards
depending on the answer

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:16.050
that they choose.

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:18.550
The instructor quickly counts
them and said, now turn to you

01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:19.050
neighbor.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:21.005
She has no idea what
the question is.

01:01:21.005 --> 01:01:23.130
She knows from her script
what the right answer is,

01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:26.270
but she would not be
able to explain it.

01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:27.360
Kids start talking.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:30.620
You see this chaos, and then
they raise their flashcards

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:33.029
again and you see an
overwhelming shift

01:01:33.029 --> 01:01:33.945
to the correct answer.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.020
And then she said--
and I was really

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:40.350
wondering, how is she going
to handle this-- she says,

01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:42.290
are there any remaining-- oh no.

01:01:42.290 --> 01:01:44.500
First she shows an explanation.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.660
It would be the instructor
in New Delhi giving

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:48.820
the explanation.

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.140
And then the social
worker in the classroom

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:53.579
said, does anybody have
any remaining questions?

01:01:53.579 --> 01:01:55.120
I thought, how is
she going to answer

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.550
that given that she
doesn't know any physics?

01:01:57.550 --> 01:01:59.930
One student raises
his hand and says,

01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:02.492
well I don't understand why
blah, blah, blah and so on.

01:02:02.492 --> 01:02:04.950
So she says, is there anybody
who knows the answer to that?

01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:08.040
She just plays the kids
out against one another.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.020
And if there's an issue
that remains unresolved

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:10.890
she takes it down.

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:15.030
It gets sent to the mother
office, the main office in New

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:17.710
Delhi, and they resolve
it the next time around.

01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:18.880
Fantastic.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.340
I always thought
that the teacher

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:25.440
had to be here if
the kids were there.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.840
But the balance is the
other way around there.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.550
Watch the YouTube video
about [INAUDIBLE] Fellows

01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:35.960
on the internet.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.771
It's really very encouraging.

01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:39.520
KARA MILLER: So we're
running low on time,

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.770
so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to take all three

01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:44.840
of your questions and then
we'll tackle them as a group,

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:45.547
if that works.

01:02:45.547 --> 01:02:46.880
If they all make sense together.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.930
We'll make them
make sense together.

01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:50.820
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:53.010
You referred to
teachers figuring out

01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:56.070
how to evaluate students and
teachers being evaluated.

01:02:56.070 --> 01:03:00.390
Of course, in Massachusetts
we have the much-loved MCAS.

01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:04.240
How do you see in this
process the better way

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.970
of evaluating
students and teachers?

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:08.662
KARA MILLER: OK,
testing and evaluation.

01:03:08.662 --> 01:03:10.620
AUDIENCE: This does kind
of follow along there,

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.170
and that is, how
does this change

01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:16.040
the nature of the
take-home work.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.600
Are you completely replacing
the take-home problem

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.450
set with the
lecture or the book,

01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:26.250
or is there still a place
for, I'm on my own in my room,

01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:28.495
thinking, struggling
through this myself.

01:03:31.276 --> 01:03:32.650
AUDIENCE 2: So
I've recently read

01:03:32.650 --> 01:03:34.790
a book called "Talent
is Overrated,"

01:03:34.790 --> 01:03:39.270
by Geoff Colvin, that gives
a popular summary of research

01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:42.120
on delivered practice,
the thesis of which

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.220
is that the extent to which a
person acquires a specialized

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:50.040
skill is determined, basically,
by the amount of repeated

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:54.560
practice they do of
tasks that are just

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.850
beyond their current ability
in which they receive feedback

01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:02.120
about how they
missed perfection.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.640
That is, what needs
improvement next.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:09.360
And I'm curious what
intersection your methods

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.702
that you're proposing
have with this idea.

01:04:11.702 --> 01:04:13.410
ERIC MAZUR: OK, first
this last question,

01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:15.451
because it was not as much
related to the others.

01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:18.420
I think it was Dan Pink who once
said that the single strongest

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:22.580
indicator of success is
persistence and perseverance.

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:24.700
I think it was he
who once said that.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:27.880
And I think that's so true.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.380
If you stick to it,
if you push yourself.

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.280
Take the light bulb.

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.210
Thomas Edison.

01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:34.220
He didn't just
invent a light bulb.

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:36.465
There were 300 failures
before he finally got there.

01:04:36.465 --> 01:04:39.080
But he persisted and
continued and continued.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:42.260
Failure is so essential
and we don't teach failure.

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.440
Failure means you
take points off.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.410
And that brings
me to assessment,

01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:48.450
which I'm very
happy this comes up.

01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:50.920
I wish we had another
hour to talk about.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:55.810
But assessment is actually
the other part of education.

01:04:55.810 --> 01:04:59.210
And I realized two years
ago, all of sudden,

01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:01.310
that the students
in my class were not

01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:02.850
really learning to learn.

01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:05.690
They were learning to
pass the assessment.

01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:08.070
And, of course,
in an ideal world

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.572
those two things are the same.

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:12.030
But the there are many shortcuts
to passing the assessment.

01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:13.640
It's not really learning.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:17.580
And that made me aware of the
fact that I really had to start

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.660
radically changing
the assessment.

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:23.400
Unfortunately, I think
we're almost out of time.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:27.690
But I have a YouTube video
called "Assessment-- The Silent

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:30.180
Killer of Learning."

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:34.120
Kind of a negative title,
but I truly believe.

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:37.200
I spent all these years
thinking about the input.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.310
What do you do in the classroom?

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:42.000
Not really thinking
about how the assessment

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.640
is what drives the
students' study habits.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:49.520
So we need to spend as much time
rethinking the assessment as we

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.990
are rethinking the
approach teaching.

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:53.460
Much less work has
been done there,

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.820
but there are some
promising approaches.

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:58.980
KARA MILLER: Let me just
insert one second, which is you

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:01.550
and I were once talking
and you told me the story.

01:06:04.605 --> 01:06:05.980
Tell me if anything's
wrong here.

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:08.730
But the people who got
into your physics class

01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:11.310
at Harvard who had
taken AP Physics

01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:14.029
were no better than the people
who hadn't taken AP Physics.

01:06:14.029 --> 01:06:15.570
And you were wondering
what was wrong

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:18.380
the AP test, so you tried
to change the AP test.

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:22.310
And they told you your
questions weren't good,

01:06:22.310 --> 01:06:25.130
because high school
physics students couldn't

01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:26.560
do those questions.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.310
ERIC MAZUR: Right.

01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:30.650
Well, actually, they
said, our good students

01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:32.570
don't do well on your questions.

01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:34.550
Because the good students
did well on questions

01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:38.100
that are actually
quite meaningless.

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:42.300
For five years I tried to change
the AP Physics B and C exam,

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:46.590
only to realize that
ETS and the whole AP

01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:48.200
and standardized
testing enterprise

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.470
is like a supertanker, which
is already hard to maneuver,

01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:52.840
where you've removed the rudder.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.140
There's only one way it can go.

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:55.730
Straight.

01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:59.000
So it's unfortunate
that we have MCAS.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.280
Somebody here was talking about
MCAS and standardized testing,

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:06.620
because it's only as good
as what type of skills

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:08.060
that test really tests.

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:11.480
And unfortunately, if you look
at the thinking skills that

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:14.664
are tested by many
standardized instruments,

01:07:14.664 --> 01:07:15.580
they're not very high.

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:19.300
A lot of them are remembering
and understanding, rather than

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:24.045
being able to apply or analysis,
or any type of creative skill.

01:07:24.045 --> 01:07:26.170
KARA MILLER: And let's
touch on that last question.

01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:28.140
So is this the end
of the problem set?

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:31.260
Is what happens that you go
home and you either read a book

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:32.900
or you watch a
video by yourself,

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:37.284
and then you come into class
and have a remote control

01:07:37.284 --> 01:07:37.950
and talk about--

01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:39.190
ERIC MAZUR: No, no, no, no.

01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:42.410
No, of course that's not enough.

01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:45.665
The homework consists not
only about watching a lecture

01:07:45.665 --> 01:07:49.490
or reading a book but
also applying some.

01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:50.890
Learning is a
scaffolded process.

01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:52.850
You don't go from
not knowing anything

01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:54.380
to knowing everything
in one step.

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.350
You learn a little bit,
and a little bit more.

01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:59.240
So the reading primes
the pump, or the watching

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.200
the lecture primes the pump.

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.880
The in-class activity pushes the
students a little bit higher,

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.963
and then there are other
activities, some of which

01:08:05.963 --> 01:08:07.670
can be done at
home, that continue

01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:09.690
to reinforce the process.

01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:12.519
It's really a
scaffolded process.

01:08:12.519 --> 01:08:14.310
KARA MILLER: Eric Mazur,
thank you so much.

01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:17.050
I feel like this hour
went by so quickly.

01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:19.120
Thank you for all
your questions.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:19.670
Thanks.

01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:20.480
That was great.

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.438
ERIC MAZUR : Thank you.

01:08:21.438 --> 01:08:23.530
[APPLAUSE]
