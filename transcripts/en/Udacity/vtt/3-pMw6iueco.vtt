00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.469
We've reached the end to another lesson and

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.460
we learned a lot of important concepts that we're

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.650
going to summarize into five main points. Point one our

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.640
genome's are largely made up of non-coding sequences which

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.800
play a major role in influencing the transcription of

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.315
coding regions. Point two. All coding regions have a

00:00:19.315 --> 00:00:22.940
non-coding sequence called a promoter that's typically located in

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.140
front of the transcription initiation site and is essential

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.190
for transcription to occur. Point three:

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.750
The consensus TATA sequence, or TATA-box, is

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.750
common to promoters of many genes and is essential for their transcription to

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.220
occur. Point 4. Activators and repressors

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.430
are transcription factors, or proteins that combine

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.600
enhancers and silencers that regulate gene expression,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.850
typically through combinatorial regulation. And point 5.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.440
All humans have two copies of non-coding alleles,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.070
just as they have two copies of coding alleles.
