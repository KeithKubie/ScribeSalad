00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:02.660
Now that we know a little
bit about Newton's First Law,

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.260
let's give ourselves
a little quiz.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.470
And what I want you
to do is figure out

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.370
which of these statements
are actually true.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.990
And our first statement is,
"If the net force on a body

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.530
is zero, its velocity
will not change."

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.030
Interesting.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.100
Statement number two, "An
unbalanced force on a body

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.680
will always impact
the object's speed."

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.650
Also an interesting statement.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.880
Statement number
three, "The reason

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.240
why initially
moving objects tend

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.870
to come to rest in
our everyday life

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.560
is because they are being
acted on by unbalanced forces."

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.760
And statement four, "An
unbalanced force on an object

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.180
will always change the
object's direction."

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.675
So I'll let you
think about that.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.426
So let's think about these
statement by statement.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.050
So our first statement
right over here,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.160
"If the net force
on a body is zero,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.750
its velocity will not change."

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.600
This is absolutely true.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.080
This is actually
even another way

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.200
of rephrasing
Newton's First Law.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.520
If I have some type
of object that's

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.020
just traveling through
space with some velocity--

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.640
so it has some speed
going in some direction,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.752
and maybe it's deep space.

00:01:23.752 --> 00:01:25.210
And we can just,
for purity, assume

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.125
that there's no
gravitational interactions.

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:29.070
There will always be
some minuscule ones,

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.170
but we'll assume no
gravitational interactions.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.700
Absolutely no
particles that it's

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.870
bumping into, absolute
vacuum of space.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.050
This thing will
travel on forever.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.760
Its velocity will not change.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.450
Neither its speed nor its
direction will change.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.040
So this one is absolutely true.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.640
Statement number two, "An
unbalanced force on a body

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.970
will always impact
the object's speed."

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.170
And the key word right
over here is "speed."

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.090
If I had written "impact
the object's velocity," then

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.430
this would be a true statement.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.760
An unbalanced force
on a body will always

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.860
impact the object's velocity.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.770
That would be true.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.130
But we wrote "speed" here.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.910
Speed is the
magnitude of velocity.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.630
It does not take into
account the direction.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.160
And to see why this
second statement is false,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.070
you could think about
a couple of things.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.930
And we'll do more
videos on the intuition

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.950
of centripetal acceleration
and centripetal

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.190
forces, inward forces,
if this does not

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.060
make complete intuitive sense
to you just at this moment.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.940
But imagine we're looking at
an ice skating rink from above.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.400
And you have an ice skater.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.300
This is the ice skater's head.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.010
And they are traveling
in that direction.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.530
Now imagine right
at that moment,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.181
they grab a rope that is
nailed to a stake in the ice

00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:43.430
skating rink right over there.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.013
We're viewing all of this from
above, and this right over here

00:02:46.013 --> 00:02:46.990
is the rope.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.050
Now what is going to happen?

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.570
Well, the skater
is going to travel.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.782
Their direction is
actually going to change.

00:02:55.782 --> 00:02:57.240
And they could hold
on to the rope,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.610
and as long as they
hold on to the rope,

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.860
they'll keep going in circles.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.340
And when they let
go of the rope,

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.150
they'll start going
in whatever direction

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.280
they were traveling
in when they let go.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.580
They'll keep going
on in that direction.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.800
And if we assume very,
very, very small frictions

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.230
from the ice skating
rink, they'll

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.580
actually have the same speed.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.660
So the force, the inward
force, the tension

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.710
from the rope pulling on the
skater in this situation,

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.720
would have only changed
the skater's direction.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.360
So and unbalanced force
doesn't necessarily

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.910
have to impact the
object's speed.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.090
It often does.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.480
But in that situation, it
would have only impacted

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.240
the skater's direction.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.540
Another situation like
this-- and once again,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.390
this involves centripetal
acceleration, inward forces,

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.310
inward acceleration--
is a satellite in orbit,

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.880
or any type of thing in orbit.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.890
So if that is some
type of planet,

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.820
and this is one of the
planet's moons right over here,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.810
the reason why it stays in orbit
is because the pull of gravity

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.630
keeps making the object
change its direction, but not

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.340
its speed.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.236
Its speed is the
exact right speed.

00:04:04.236 --> 00:04:05.610
So this was its
speed right here.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.318
If the planet wasn't
there, it would just

00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:09.580
keep going on in that
direction forever and forever.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.460
But the planet right
over here, there's

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.970
an inward force of gravity.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.320
And we'll talk more about the
force of gravity in the future.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.860
But this inward
force of gravity is

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.810
going to accelerate this object
inwards while it travels.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.860
And so after some
period of time,

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.960
this object's velocity
vector-- if you

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.430
add the previous velocity
with how much it's

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.640
changed its new velocity vector.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.430
Now this is after its traveled
a little bit-- its new velocity

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.090
vector might look
something like this.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.650
And it's traveling at
the exact right speed

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.910
so that the force
of gravity is always

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.370
at a right angle to
its actual trajectory.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.372
It's the exact right speed so it
doesn't go off into deep space

00:04:54.372 --> 00:04:56.080
and so it doesn't
plummet into the earth.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.700
And we'll cover that
in much more detail.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.160
But the simple answer is,
unbalanced force on a body

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.930
will always impact its velocity.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.260
It could be its speed,
its direction, or both,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.910
but it doesn't have to be both.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.170
It could be just the speed
or just the direction.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.510
So this is an
incorrect statement.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.220
Now the third
statement, "The reason

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.860
why initially
moving objects tend

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.880
to come to rest in
our everyday life

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.670
is because they are being
acted on by unbalanced forces."

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.870
This is absolutely true.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.230
And this is the example we gave.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.780
If I take an object,
if I take my book

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.660
and I try to slide
it across the desk,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.600
the reason why it
eventually comes to stop

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.160
is because we have the
unbalanced force of friction--

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
the grinding of the
surface of the book

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.720
with the grinding of the table.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.470
If I'm inside of a
pool or even if there's

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.410
absolutely no
current in the pool,

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.670
and if I were to try to
push some type of object

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.350
inside the water,
it eventually comes

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.800
to stop because of all of the
resistance of the water itself.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.560
It's providing an unbalanced
force in a direction

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.970
opposite it's motion.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.740
That is what's slowing it down.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.210
So in our everyday
life, the reason

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.970
why we don't see these
things go on and on

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.250
forever is that we have
these frictions, these air

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.690
resistants, or the friction
with actual surfaces.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.980
And then the last statement, "An
unbalanced force on an object

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.870
will always change the
object's direction."

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.620
Well, this one actually is
maybe the most intuitive.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.130
We always have this situation.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.460
Let's say I have a
block right over here,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.910
and it's traveling with some
velocity in that direction--

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.480
five meters per second.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.550
If I apply an unbalanced
force in that same direction--

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.050
so that's my force
right over there.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.940
If I apply it in
that same direction,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.360
I'm just going to accelerate
it in that same direction.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.030
So I won't
necessarily change it.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.510
Even if I were to act against
it, I might decelerate it,

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.184
but I won't necessarily
change its direction.

00:06:50.184 --> 00:06:52.600
I could change its direction
by doing something like this,

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.650
but I don't necessarily.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.790
I'm not always
necessarily changing

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.330
the object's direction.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.530
So this is not true.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.990
An unbalanced force on
an object will not always

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.310
change the object's direction.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.810
It can, like these
circumstances, but not always.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:13.290
So "always" is what makes
this very, very, very wrong.
