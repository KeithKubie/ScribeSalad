00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.421
- [Instructor] I think
there's a strong argument

00:00:01.421 --> 00:00:02.926
to be made that England was the most

00:00:02.926 --> 00:00:06.176
powerful and successful imperial nation

00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:11.032
of all time, but when you look back to the

00:00:11.032 --> 00:00:14.661
Age of Exploration, it
becomes clear that England

00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:19.029
was actually pretty late
to the imperial game.

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.364
As we know, Christopher Columbus,

00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:24.203
backed by Spain, had arrived in

00:00:24.203 --> 00:00:27.203
Hispaniola in the New World in 1492.

00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:33.346
He was the first European to start

00:00:34.514 --> 00:00:36.366
a colony in the New World.

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:39.793
England, by contrast, didn't actually have

00:00:39.793 --> 00:00:42.695
a successful colonial venture in the

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:45.695
New World until 1607 with Jamestown.

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.220
Now from this distance it doesn't look

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.220
that far behind, but this
is more than 100 years

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.723
later than Spain's
first colonial ventures.

00:00:59.723 --> 00:01:01.893
So what was England up to?

00:01:01.893 --> 00:01:05.407
Why were they so late
in the colonial game?

00:01:05.407 --> 00:01:07.264
That's what I'd like to
take a closer look at

00:01:07.264 --> 00:01:08.995
in this video, and I'll also talk

00:01:08.995 --> 00:01:11.460
a little bit more about what conditions

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.627
in England led that nation
to start New World colonies.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.073
Now I think the biggest reason why England

00:01:20.073 --> 00:01:22.833
waited another 100 years to have a

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.154
New World colony is that England had

00:01:25.154 --> 00:01:26.993
its own problems, and it had a number

00:01:26.993 --> 00:01:28.954
of problems in this time period,

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:32.572
and we're talking about the 1500s here.

00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:35.695
And the first of these
was ongoing conflict

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:39.085
between Catholics and
Protestants in England.

00:01:39.085 --> 00:01:41.038
Now this is a very long story.

00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:43.188
I don't have time to
do justice to it here,

00:01:43.188 --> 00:01:45.412
but suffice it to say
that the trouble started

00:01:45.412 --> 00:01:49.204
with Henry VIII, who we know from his

00:01:49.204 --> 00:01:51.940
many wives and many beheadings,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.417
and Henry VIII broke away
from the Catholic Church

00:01:55.417 --> 00:01:57.662
in Rome to start his own church,

00:01:57.662 --> 00:02:00.592
the Church of England, also
known as the Anglican Church.

00:02:00.592 --> 00:02:02.513
Now this is a Protestant religion.

00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:05.573
I'm gonna put P here for Protestant.

00:02:05.573 --> 00:02:08.740
Now Henry had two daughters, Elizabeth

00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:12.961
who like him was a Protestant,

00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:18.210
and Mary, who was a
Catholic, and Mary occupied

00:02:20.028 --> 00:02:21.537
the throne for a number of years,

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:24.181
but Elizabeth managed to
wrest it away from her

00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:27.207
and once Elizabeth was on the throne

00:02:27.207 --> 00:02:31.374
as Elizabeth I, England
became a Protestant nation.

00:02:34.786 --> 00:02:37.623
So it's hard to be
involved in world affairs

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:40.392
when you've got kind of
a crisis of succession

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:44.559
going on, so one factor
here is religious conflict.

00:02:50.474 --> 00:02:52.736
Another reason why England is not headed

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:54.679
over to the New World is that they have

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:58.664
colonial problems closer
to home in Ireland.

00:02:58.664 --> 00:03:02.099
England is trying to, and will succeed at,

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.432
subduing Ireland as one of its colonies,

00:03:07.581 --> 00:03:10.169
and they're undertaking a very bloody

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.877
and costly war, and they think of this

00:03:12.877 --> 00:03:16.158
Catholic Irish population almost as

00:03:16.158 --> 00:03:18.462
barbarian savages who don't know

00:03:18.462 --> 00:03:21.286
what's good for them and in
the opinion of the English,

00:03:21.286 --> 00:03:22.915
what's good for them is English rule

00:03:22.915 --> 00:03:24.572
and Protestantism, when of course

00:03:24.572 --> 00:03:26.666
what the Irish really want is self rule

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:28.496
and to be left alone, but they use

00:03:28.496 --> 00:03:32.433
very brutal tactics against the Irish,

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:34.619
and we'll kind of see that again

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:37.284
when they're met with another hostile

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:40.456
colonial population in North America.

00:03:40.456 --> 00:03:42.296
Another issue England is dealing with

00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:44.213
is economic depression.

00:03:45.247 --> 00:03:47.556
The Crown doesn't have a lot of money

00:03:47.556 --> 00:03:50.277
and there's a great deal of crime

00:03:50.277 --> 00:03:53.179
and poverty throughout the nation,

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:56.897
so while the Crown can't actually afford

00:03:56.897 --> 00:04:00.401
to sponsor colonial exploits the way

00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:03.450
that Spain sponsored Columbus, they still

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.700
managed to get some riches out

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.195
of the New World by giving ship captains

00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:10.862
license to plunder Spanish ships

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.931
coming back with New World riches,

00:04:14.931 --> 00:04:17.185
and these were called privateers,

00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:20.602
the most famous of them here is this man,

00:04:22.044 --> 00:04:25.919
Sir Francis Drake, and
really, privateers are

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.893
just pirates with a fancy name,

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:31.931
but the logic here was, why bother

00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:35.264
trying to set up a colony here in Mexico

00:04:36.427 --> 00:04:39.260
or South America, the West Indies,

00:04:40.567 --> 00:04:43.848
and do all the work of setting up housing

00:04:43.848 --> 00:04:46.846
and trying to tame laborers and mining,

00:04:46.846 --> 00:04:49.357
when instead you could just let the

00:04:49.357 --> 00:04:52.116
Spanish do all of that and then put that

00:04:52.116 --> 00:04:55.949
gold on a ship and then
use your awesome navy,

00:04:57.261 --> 00:05:00.981
'cause England is growing
a very awesome navy,

00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:02.814
to steal those riches.

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:07.706
So England doesn't have a strong incentive

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:10.348
to do all the labor when they can

00:05:10.348 --> 00:05:13.664
just steal it from the
ships along the way.

00:05:13.664 --> 00:05:14.903
Alright, those are some of the reasons

00:05:14.903 --> 00:05:17.572
why it took England so long to start

00:05:17.572 --> 00:05:19.892
colonization in North America.

00:05:19.892 --> 00:05:21.436
In the next video I'll talk about

00:05:21.436 --> 00:05:24.765
the factors that led England to finally

00:05:24.765 --> 00:05:27.003
join the race for New World colonies.
