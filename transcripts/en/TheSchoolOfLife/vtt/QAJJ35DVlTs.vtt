00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.390
Andy Warhol

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.170
Was the most Glamorous Figure of 20th Century American Art

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.809
Born in Pennsylvania in 1928 to czech parents he lived most of his life in New York

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.340
Much about his life was eccentric

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.559
He wore a silver wig, he liked to go to the dry cleaners and stand in the corner

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.000
Enjoying the smells and sounds of the chemicals and cleaning machines

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.000
he Loved Airports and Used to go Through Airport Security Multiple Times

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.000
Just Because he Said he Found it Fascinating and Kind of Inspiring

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.700
Andy Warhol's great achievement was to Develop a generous and Helpful view of two major Forces in modern society

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.200
Commerce and Celebrity

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.200
he Spent Most of his life as an International Celebrity

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.000
but he was also very Keen on Business

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.789
There Are Four Big Ideas Behind Andy Warhol's Work

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.199
Which Can Teach Us a more Inspired way of Looking at the World and prompt us to build a better society

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:06.929
We Spend too much of our Life Wanting something Better and extraordinary, it's normal to feel that the exciting things are not where we are

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.868
Andy Warhol aims to remedy this by getting us to look again at things in everyday life

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.379
he performed his magic most famously on soup cans

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.000
Putting them on the wall and looking at them helps us to see their beauty

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.000
to notice they're appealing labels as strong but elegant forms

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.000
Perfectly fitted to their uses, in the same spirit of redirecting our attention

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.000
Andy Warhol made a video of himself eating a hamburger

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.000
During The 1960s, Warhol groomed a retinue of bohemian and countercultural eccentrics

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.900
To whom he gave the title superstars

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.970
Including Nice, Joe Dallesandro, Edie Sedgwick, Viva, Ultraviolet, Holly Woodlawn

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.200
and Jackie Curtis and Candy Darling

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.300
Warhol understood that celebrities have an Important power

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.200
They can distribute glamour and prestige

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.000
He thought that glamour needed to be redistributed

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.790
in such a way that society could work better

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.949
for example, he suggested that the president of the United States

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.589
Could use his status to shift perceptions

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.740
As he wrote, if the president would go Into a public bathroom in The Capitol and have the TV cameras film him

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.200
Cleaning the toilets and saying

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.680
But why not? Someone's got to do it

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.580
Then that would do so much for the morale of people who do the wonderful job of keeping the toilets clean

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.640
He didn't call his place in New York a studio, the prestigious term used by artists since the renaissance to describe their place of work

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.490
Instead he Called it 'The Factory'

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.339
We tend to feel that the idea of art and the idea of a factory don't really mix, but Warhol's point

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.880
Was that business and art actually do very much belong together

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.000
As he wrote, being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.709
During the hippie era, people put down the idea of business, they'd say money is bad and working is bad

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.200
But making money is art and working Is art and good business is the best art

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.829
The lesson of The Factory is that we can organize ourselves to produce good things more reliably and cheaply

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.120
One example of this for Warhol

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.780
Was Coke, he pointed out the wherever in the world you go, Coke is always the same and is always quite Nice

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.879
Art has generally not been able to live up to this ideal of being good and

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.050
widely distributed

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.089
Artists make a few things but only a few people ever get to own them

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.200
Warhol tried to counteract this.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
One day, after reading that Picasso had made four thousand masterpieces in his lifetime

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.000
Wahol set out to make 4,000 prints in one day

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.630
as it turned out It took him one month to make 500

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.579
The lesson we Can draw from Warhol is that mass production needs to apply beyond making prints and other kinds of high art

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.780
We need the organizing,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:08.509
commoditizing and branding powers of business to reliably produce and distribute the good things in life, like high quality child care,

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.160
psychotherapy, career advice and beautiful architecture, Just to start the list

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.040
Most art doesn't have much of an impact on the world but Warhol was extremely keen on

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.189
large-scale impact, he mastered many genres from drawing, painting and printing to photography

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.000
audio recording, sculpture and theatre, he started a magazine,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.690
designed clothes, managed a band, made 60 films and had plans to start his own TV chat show

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.300
Warhol was able to extend his work into different channels, partly because of his populism

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.389
being a populist meant that he  was unafraid to reach people where they started

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.089
the chat show is a quintessential populist medium

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.729
Because it Plays - What Masses of People find Funny and Interesting

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.209
Warhol was a populist out of Generosity he Wanted to translate the things he Cared about like

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:07.369
Sensitivity A love of Glamour and Spectacle and Playfulness Into Objects and Experiences That Could Touch Many Many People

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.410
The Only Pity Is that he Never Quite finished what he, Did he Could Have Founded his Planned TV

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.140
Chat Show then gone On in Ever Broader and Broader

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.719
Partnerships To Start A Fashion Label Designer Hotel Maybe a financial Advisory Service A

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:28.760
Supermarket Chain Or an Airport This is the Task Still open To people, who, Had Drawn to Art but, also want to change the World

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.979
Andy Warhol Died in 1987 When he was Only 58 after Complications

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.399
Following Routine Gallbladder Surgery in A new York Hospital

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.589
He is buried at a small Cemetery near Where he was Born in Bethel Park Pennsylvania

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:50.529
His Example Is Still an Invitation to us to change the world in A mass Populist Way Through Art

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.108
'My Name is Andy Warhol and I just Finished Eating a hamburger'
