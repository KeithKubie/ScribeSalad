00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
- Good morning, everyone, it's Mark Wiens,

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.296
I'm in Nakhon Si Thammarat
in the South of Thailand.

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:07.957
And today, I'm gonna take you on a

00:00:07.957 --> 00:00:11.295
special little day trip
with Ying and Micah,

00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:12.818
and we are going,

00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:16.283
it's about 60 kilometers away
to a place called Hua Sai.

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:19.450
(upbeat reggae music)

00:00:22.143 --> 00:00:25.510
And what's special
about this place is that

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.939
it's where Ying was born.

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.144
And I haven't ever been there before

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:31.259
and I think it's been many, many years

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.012
since Ying has been there.

00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:35.949
She was born there and then her
family moved to other places

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.416
especially most of her
family moved to Krubi.

00:00:38.416 --> 00:00:41.443
We are in Nakhon Si
Thammarat the town right now.

00:00:41.443 --> 00:00:44.468
And Hua Sai is along the ocean.

00:00:44.468 --> 00:00:47.125
It's about 65 kilometers from here,

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.606
so we are on our way now.

00:00:49.606 --> 00:00:51.273
Good morning, Micah!

00:00:52.226 --> 00:00:55.393
(upbeat reggae music)

00:01:14.897 --> 00:01:17.656
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:19.461
We made it to Hua Sai!

00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:21.812
And I didn't tell you
this earlier this morning,

00:01:21.812 --> 00:01:23.769
because Ying and I
weren't sure if this place

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:27.239
was gonna be open or if
it even existed anymore!

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:28.880
But I am

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.538
so outrageously excited
because we made it here

00:01:31.538 --> 00:01:32.617
and we drove straight here

00:01:32.617 --> 00:01:35.443
and they are open and
they are still running.

00:01:35.443 --> 00:01:39.558
This is a grilled chicken
place that Ying remembers

00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:41.057
from her childhood.

00:01:41.057 --> 00:01:44.680
And Ying tells me stories that
they used to drive from Krubi

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.221
which is maybe three or
four hours drive away.

00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:49.564
And they used to drive
straight here to come back

00:01:49.564 --> 00:01:52.869
and they would even like
stop anywhere in town

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.757
to visit relatives or anything,

00:01:54.757 --> 00:01:57.696
but they'd come straight to
get grilled chicken here.

00:01:57.696 --> 00:02:01.724
And this the type of special
southern Thai grilled chicken

00:02:01.724 --> 00:02:03.109
called gai galae.

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:07.150
They're on the third generation
now who is running the shop.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.209
So they've been here 50 years or so.

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.189
Or longer, Ying?

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.993
And she remembers your family?
- Yeah.

00:02:14.993 --> 00:02:17.396
- She remembers Ying's family.

00:02:17.396 --> 00:02:19.410
(speaks in foreign language)

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.614
The barbecued chicken
here is one of a kind.

00:02:21.614 --> 00:02:24.085
And each skewer goes through
an intense cooking process

00:02:24.085 --> 00:02:25.972
that's amazing to watch.

00:02:25.972 --> 00:02:28.450
Their special barbecue sauce
is made from a combination

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.735
of pure coconut cream,
curry paste which includes

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:35.492
dry fragrant chilies,
peanuts and palm sugar.

00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:37.809
The chicken itself is first
loaded onto the bamboo skewers

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.009
and grilled without any seasoning.

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:42.095
After the initial grilling process,

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.460
the chicken skewers are bathed

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.408
in the glorious coconut
cream barbecue sauce

00:02:46.408 --> 00:02:49.630
and slow grilled until the
coconut cream starts to clot

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.810
and dry onto the chicken.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.462
The chicken is then left to rest

00:02:53.462 --> 00:02:55.615
before it's smothered in another coat

00:02:55.615 --> 00:02:57.473
of thick barbecue sauce.

00:02:57.473 --> 00:02:59.238
Again, it grills,

00:02:59.238 --> 00:03:01.781
the coconut cream starts to caramelize,

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.393
and then it's taken off the grill,

00:03:03.393 --> 00:03:05.659
and left to rest and dry again.

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.678
Finally, the chicken undergoes one more

00:03:07.678 --> 00:03:10.344
full barbecue sauce immersion,

00:03:10.344 --> 00:03:11.697
and one more trip to the grill

00:03:11.697 --> 00:03:13.875
before it's ready to be served.

00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:16.085
It's safe to say they do not skimp

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:17.799
on the barbecue sauce here.

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.376
And you'll know that as soon
as you see them cooking,

00:03:20.376 --> 00:03:22.559
and when you take your first bite.

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:26.309
(speaks in foreign language)

00:03:28.814 --> 00:03:29.761
Okay and she just handed me one,

00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:32.761
my first skewer right off the grill.

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:37.422
Oh wow, that smells like a fresh coconut!

00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:40.736
And you can smell the
red chilies in there.

00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:42.078
And look, you have to just,

00:03:42.078 --> 00:03:43.178
to really appreciate this chicken,

00:03:43.178 --> 00:03:45.065
you gotta get a really
close up look at this.

00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:47.292
It's really heavy because that is heavier

00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:48.125
than the amount of,

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:49.760
much heavier than the
amount of chicken on there

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.170
because of the barbecue
sauce and the coconut milk

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.605
that just caked on there,

00:03:53.605 --> 00:03:56.282
and just coated on there
and caramelized on there

00:03:56.282 --> 00:03:58.364
by that slow grilling process.

00:03:58.364 --> 00:03:59.400
I haven't even had my first bite

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.559
and I'm having a little bit
of an emotional breakdown

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:02.392
right now!

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.165
Oh, wow! (laughs)

00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:21.948
That is unbelievable!

00:04:21.948 --> 00:04:24.434
Their sauce is so thick

00:04:24.434 --> 00:04:26.245
and so rich!

00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:28.593
It's like the consistency
of peanut butter.

00:04:28.593 --> 00:04:30.542
But you can taste that it's just

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:32.986
fully coconut cream.

00:04:32.986 --> 00:04:36.877
And then the chicken remains
really juicy on the inside.

00:04:36.877 --> 00:04:38.836
And then you can taste those
dried chilies in there.

00:04:38.836 --> 00:04:41.164
You can taste the little
bit of peanutey taste,

00:04:41.164 --> 00:04:43.350
and then you can also taste
a lot of garlic in there.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.330
That just might be the best single bite

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.807
of barbecue sauced chicken
that I've ever had in my life!

00:04:49.807 --> 00:04:52.372
And I'm not saying that lightly!

00:04:52.372 --> 00:04:55.623
That is absurd, actually, how good it is.

00:04:55.623 --> 00:04:56.915
Be careful of the wire at the end,

00:04:56.915 --> 00:04:58.797
you don't wanna bite into that!

00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:00.686
And normally you could untwist the wire

00:05:00.686 --> 00:05:03.340
and then take it out of
the skewer but I just,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.423
I don't have time for that right now!

00:05:09.557 --> 00:05:11.140
That is life changing.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.387
That's unbelievable!

00:05:12.387 --> 00:05:14.041
Micah was sleeping at first,

00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:15.187
but Micah has

00:05:15.187 --> 00:05:18.400
woken up for the occasion now.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.617
But I just,

00:05:19.617 --> 00:05:21.709
I just licked my first,

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:24.709
my first piece of gai galae Hua Sai,

00:05:25.917 --> 00:05:27.337
grilled chicken.

00:05:27.337 --> 00:05:29.087
I licked the skewers!

00:05:29.938 --> 00:05:30.771
That was

00:05:33.353 --> 00:05:35.659
a life changing grilled
chicken experience.

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:36.987
It's so good!

00:05:36.987 --> 00:05:39.741
But it is extremely rich!

00:05:39.741 --> 00:05:41.334
That amount of coconut,

00:05:41.334 --> 00:05:43.339
I don't even know how much
condensed coconut milk

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:44.599
I just ate.

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:47.577
But that is a lot per skewer
because it is literally,

00:05:47.577 --> 00:05:49.274
it could be like,

00:05:49.274 --> 00:05:52.204
in some parts it was literally
like a centimeter thick

00:05:52.204 --> 00:05:55.265
with that coconut milk just
caked up on that chicken.

00:05:55.265 --> 00:05:58.244
But there is nothing as great

00:05:58.244 --> 00:06:01.549
as a successful food pilgrimage.

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:05.506
And they are a very, very friendly family.

00:06:05.506 --> 00:06:08.229
We got six more skewers to go,

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:11.166
and we're gonna drive to the beach now

00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:12.495
and eat them all.

00:06:12.495 --> 00:06:13.483
But,

00:06:13.483 --> 00:06:14.400
oh, this is

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:17.659
the type of food memory
and food experience

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:19.516
that I will never forget.

00:06:19.516 --> 00:06:20.663
And what's also very cool is that

00:06:20.663 --> 00:06:23.392
they remember Ying's family,
especially Ying's father.

00:06:23.392 --> 00:06:25.439
Ying said they used to go there and order

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:26.956
like 50 skewers

00:06:26.956 --> 00:06:27.824
at a time!

00:06:27.824 --> 00:06:30.123
The beach here is not extremely nice,

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:32.767
but it is really, really nice and quiet.

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:34.254
Just a few people are out here,

00:06:34.254 --> 00:06:35.587
a few fishermen.

00:06:37.483 --> 00:06:39.650
And it's just so peaceful.

00:06:40.535 --> 00:06:42.469
Oh, and I'm so happy.

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:45.295
Ying and I failed to bring
a mat to sit at the beach,

00:06:45.295 --> 00:06:48.860
so we just decided to back the car in,

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.579
opened up the trunk,

00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:53.062
and sit in here in the
shade enjoying the breeze.

00:06:53.062 --> 00:06:54.145
Oh hi, Micah!

00:06:55.087 --> 00:06:58.254
(upbeat reggae music)

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:07.607
One thing that Ying just pointed out to me

00:07:07.607 --> 00:07:09.553
is that you can tell it's all coconut milk

00:07:09.553 --> 00:07:11.821
because none of it sticks to the bag!

00:07:11.821 --> 00:07:13.455
Look the bag is clean.

00:07:13.455 --> 00:07:14.903
Sometimes, if you eat
this type of chicken,

00:07:14.903 --> 00:07:16.308
they add

00:07:16.308 --> 00:07:18.108
flour to the barbecue sauce,

00:07:18.108 --> 00:07:20.436
and then you can tell because
it kinda clumps up on the bag

00:07:20.436 --> 00:07:22.519
and it sticks to the bag.

00:07:23.407 --> 00:07:27.574
Oh, it just has this amazing,
garlicky, garlicky coconut,

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:30.715
coconut field smell to it!

00:07:31.688 --> 00:07:32.521
Alright.

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:42.509
Okay, I got all barbecue
sauce in that bite!

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:44.997
And that's not a bad thing!

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:46.752
I didn't get any chicken in that bite!

00:07:46.752 --> 00:07:49.002
And that's not a bad thing!

00:07:51.106 --> 00:07:51.940
Micah!

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.675
(baby coos)

00:07:54.675 --> 00:07:56.292
This is just on the next level.

00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:58.633
I don't know if I've
ever tasted such thick,

00:07:58.633 --> 00:08:01.195
condensed coconut milk in anything.

00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:02.564
Ever.

00:08:02.564 --> 00:08:05.731
(upbeat reggae music)

00:08:10.377 --> 00:08:12.731
Hua Sai is a very small, little town,

00:08:12.731 --> 00:08:14.002
so there's not a lot going on there,

00:08:14.002 --> 00:08:16.216
so we decided to take a drive back.

00:08:16.216 --> 00:08:18.784
We're driving, heading back
towards Nakhon Si Thammarat,

00:08:18.784 --> 00:08:20.325
and we're gonna hopefully
find a restaurant

00:08:20.325 --> 00:08:22.259
somewhere on the side of the road

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:25.196
for another bite to eat for lunch.

00:08:25.196 --> 00:08:28.363
(upbeat reggae music)

00:08:47.212 --> 00:08:49.682
We didn't really have any
plans of where to eat.

00:08:49.682 --> 00:08:52.068
The chicken was the only plan that we had,

00:08:52.068 --> 00:08:54.138
so we just drove down the highway.

00:08:54.138 --> 00:08:56.221
And this is a restaurant.

00:08:57.222 --> 00:08:59.394
They have food here, they
have a convenience store,

00:08:59.394 --> 00:09:01.394
they have a gas station.

00:09:02.437 --> 00:09:05.341
They have it all right on
this little home property.

00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:06.624
And I just love this style

00:09:06.624 --> 00:09:08.525
of countryside eating in Thailand.

00:09:08.525 --> 00:09:11.668
Ying and I have our own
little private cabana.

00:09:11.668 --> 00:09:12.501
Micah

00:09:13.909 --> 00:09:15.159
is fast asleep.

00:09:26.651 --> 00:09:29.281
Eating at little countryside
restaurants like this

00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:31.644
where the mother or the family

00:09:31.644 --> 00:09:33.646
just prepares the food
right in their house

00:09:33.646 --> 00:09:37.169
and just serves it
right outside the house,

00:09:37.169 --> 00:09:39.666
is one of the joys of being
in the countryside of Thailand

00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:41.263
or being in Thailand.

00:09:41.263 --> 00:09:43.962
I love eating at little places like this.

00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:45.448
I'm gonna begin with the gaeng som,

00:09:45.448 --> 00:09:48.615
which is the sour southern Thai curry.

00:09:49.744 --> 00:09:51.489
And there's fish,

00:09:51.489 --> 00:09:53.569
there are bamboo shoots in here,

00:09:53.569 --> 00:09:56.059
and it's orange from turmeric

00:09:56.059 --> 00:09:58.070
and lots of chilies in there.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.320
I'll put this onto my rice.

00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:06.673
Very sour,

00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:07.596
and

00:10:07.596 --> 00:10:09.213
it's not spicy on my first bite,

00:10:09.213 --> 00:10:11.166
but it's that type

00:10:11.166 --> 00:10:13.775
of curry that you know the heat will build

00:10:13.775 --> 00:10:14.962
as you keep on eating it.

00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:16.863
Next up is gaeng khua kraduk moo,

00:10:16.863 --> 00:10:20.564
which is pork curry, southern curry.

00:10:20.564 --> 00:10:23.564
Navigate the bone structure of this.

00:10:26.764 --> 00:10:28.847
Actually, I'm gonna have to just eat that.

00:10:28.847 --> 00:10:33.784
Let me add a little bit
more of that sauce, though.

00:10:33.784 --> 00:10:36.284
Oh yeah, that looks wonderful!

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:41.032
Mm, mm!

00:10:42.358 --> 00:10:44.317
You can taste a lot of
black pepper in there,

00:10:44.317 --> 00:10:45.870
you can taste the chilies.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.662
It's fragrant, also with dried chilies.

00:10:48.662 --> 00:10:50.794
And then you gotta just
pick up these bones and

00:10:50.794 --> 00:10:54.127
there's no way to eat them with a spoon.

00:10:55.851 --> 00:10:57.616
Oh, that was a good chunk
of meat right there!

00:10:57.616 --> 00:10:59.266
And next up, this is gaeng tai pla.

00:10:59.266 --> 00:11:00.998
One of the absolute best of all.

00:11:00.998 --> 00:11:02.594
I love how there's an entire,

00:11:02.594 --> 00:11:03.488
I think this is an eggplant.

00:11:03.488 --> 00:11:04.917
It almost looks like a lime,

00:11:04.917 --> 00:11:07.479
but like an entire,
wrinkly eggplant in here.

00:11:07.479 --> 00:11:08.738
And there's fish,

00:11:08.738 --> 00:11:10.191
and if you look at the broth,

00:11:10.191 --> 00:11:12.724
you can see how many chilies are in here.

00:11:12.724 --> 00:11:15.244
It just looks filled with chilies.

00:11:15.244 --> 00:11:17.577
I'll take some of that fish.

00:11:24.492 --> 00:11:25.425
That's good!

00:11:25.425 --> 00:11:27.175
Oh, that's wonderful!

00:11:28.226 --> 00:11:29.059
Oh, yeah.

00:11:29.059 --> 00:11:29.896
That has a kick to it.

00:11:29.896 --> 00:11:32.770
That is definitely the
Nakhon Si Thammarat flavor

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.131
that you want when you're
in Nakhon Si Thammarat.

00:11:36.131 --> 00:11:38.093
The dishes are not sweet whatsoever.

00:11:38.093 --> 00:11:40.658
Just spicy and salty is the flavor

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.078
that is common in Nakhon Si Thammarat.

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:44.020
Even at just restaurants like this,

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.306
you're always served a
plate of raw vegetables

00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:48.026
which is one of the best.

00:11:48.026 --> 00:11:50.648
I don't know if I've ever
eaten these leaves before.

00:11:50.648 --> 00:11:53.481
These are transparent, neon green.

00:11:57.621 --> 00:11:58.454
Oh, wow!

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.290
That is so sour, but these are not--

00:12:04.422 --> 00:12:07.338
a lot of the random leaves
that you eat are very chalky.

00:12:07.338 --> 00:12:09.868
But these aren't chalky at all.

00:12:09.868 --> 00:12:13.304
It's like chewing on a lime peel

00:12:13.304 --> 00:12:15.417
but much softer.

00:12:15.417 --> 00:12:18.368
Oh, that's a really good random leaf!

00:12:18.368 --> 00:12:20.812
And then finally last dish
is just some kind of a,

00:12:20.812 --> 00:12:21.812
a pork soup.

00:12:22.843 --> 00:12:26.224
(upbeat reggae music)

00:12:26.224 --> 00:12:28.560
Oh, that is nice and sour

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.143
and has a porky, bone
flavored broth to it.

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:39.280
Ying and I just finished with that meal.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.125
That was amazingly good

00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:42.990
and what I love so much is that

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.902
this is no planning,

00:12:43.902 --> 00:12:45.962
we're just driving down the road,

00:12:45.962 --> 00:12:48.369
we stopped at a restaurant,

00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:50.786
rice and curry southern Thai restaurant,

00:12:50.786 --> 00:12:52.172
just cooking out of their home.

00:12:52.172 --> 00:12:53.578
It's home-cooked food,

00:12:53.578 --> 00:12:55.909
and it's just absolutely delicious!

00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:58.832
We're gonna just head back to

00:12:58.832 --> 00:13:00.589
the Nakhon Si Thammarat city from here

00:13:00.589 --> 00:13:03.706
so I'm gonna end the video now.

00:13:03.706 --> 00:13:06.023
