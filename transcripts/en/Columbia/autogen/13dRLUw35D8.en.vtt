and the protein is blue in fact you

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069
and the protein is blue in fact you
 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.430
and the protein is blue in fact you
could take away all the protein and this

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440
could take away all the protein and this
 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.680

what's left the RNA can still make

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690
what's left the RNA can still make
 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.749
what's left the RNA can still make
proteins it can still catalyze the

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759
proteins it can still catalyze the
 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.499

peptide bond so the RNA is actually

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509
peptide bond so the RNA is actually
 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.890

back then there's also T RNAs and we
 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.670
back then there's also T RNAs and we
will talk about tRNA is a bit so let's

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680
will talk about tRNA is a bit so let's
 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.260
will talk about tRNA is a bit so let's
make sure we understand them these are

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270

more than one and there is a part that

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050
more than one and there is a part that
 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.589
more than one and there is a part that
recognizes the mRNA the anticodon and

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599
recognizes the mRNA the anticodon and
 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:16.999
recognizes the mRNA the anticodon and
then there's a part where the amino acid

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009
then there's a part where the amino acid
 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.129
then there's a part where the amino acid
is attached and these have secondary

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139

initiation complex binds to the cap and

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099
initiation complex binds to the cap and
 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.430
initiation complex binds to the cap and
moves down to

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440
moves down to
 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.220

internal ribosome entry and this is

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650
internal ribosome entry and this is
 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.000
internal ribosome entry and this is
where the initiation complex binds just

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010
where the initiation complex binds just
 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.910
where the initiation complex binds just
upstream of the initiation codon it

00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:58.920
upstream of the initiation codon it
 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.760

can bind internally hence the name

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270
can bind internally hence the name
 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.790
can bind internally hence the name
internal ribosome entry so that was

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800
internal ribosome entry so that was
 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.770

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.330
changed our understanding of how
translation works so let's take a look

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340
translation works so let's take a look
 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.700
translation works so let's take a look

blue box so what we need to do is bring

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:37.650
blue box so what we need to do is bring
 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.370
blue box so what we need to do is bring
the ribosome to the mRNA and eventually

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380
the ribosome to the mRNA and eventually
 

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.800
the ribosome to the mRNA and eventually
to the Aug so we start with the 40s

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:42.810
to the Aug so we start with the 40s
 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.790
to the Aug so we start with the 40s
subunit and this 40s subunit binds a

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800
subunit and this 40s subunit binds a
 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.330

00:12:21.319 --> 00:12:23.980
subunit can then come in and associate
with the 40s subunit and now we're ready

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:23.990
with the 40s subunit and now we're ready
 

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.619
with the 40s subunit and now we're ready
to begin protein synthesis we have a met

00:12:26.619 --> 00:12:26.629
to begin protein synthesis we have a met
 

00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:30.040
to begin protein synthesis we have a met
tRNA sitting in the P site of the

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.050
tRNA sitting in the P site of the
 

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.220
tRNA sitting in the P site of the
ribosome and now we can put a new amino

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:33.230
ribosome and now we can put a new amino
 

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.239
ribosome and now we can put a new amino
acid in the a site now we also think

00:12:37.239 --> 00:12:37.249
acid in the a site now we also think
 

00:12:37.249 --> 00:12:39.819
acid in the a site now we also think
that the 3 prime end is involved in this

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:39.829
that the 3 prime end is involved in this
 

00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:44.019
that the 3 prime end is involved in this
translation there is a protein in cells

00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:44.029

slides back there was a diagram of

00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:55.819
slides back there was a diagram of
 

00:12:55.819 --> 00:12:58.090

binding protein and there's quite a bit

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:04.970
binding protein and there's quite a bit
 

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.869

of evidence which suggests that the RNA

00:13:07.869 --> 00:13:07.879
of evidence which suggests that the RNA
 

00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:09.910
of evidence which suggests that the RNA
ends have to be brought together by

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920
ends have to be brought together by
 

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.679
ends have to be brought together by
these interactions in order to get

00:13:11.679 --> 00:13:11.689
these interactions in order to get
 

00:13:11.689 --> 00:13:14.439
these interactions in order to get
maximally efficient translation so

00:13:14.439 --> 00:13:14.449
maximally efficient translation so
 

00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:16.860
maximally efficient translation so
there's genetic and biochemical evidence

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:16.870
there's genetic and biochemical evidence
 

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.429
there's genetic and biochemical evidence
unfortunately no one has actually

which suggests that this is important

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:26.510
which suggests that this is important
 

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.350
which suggests that this is important
for efficient translation why it is so

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360
for efficient translation why it is so
 

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.410
for efficient translation why it is so
is not clear one idea is that after if

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:32.420
is not clear one idea is that after if
 

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.960
is not clear one idea is that after if
you have a circular mRNA when you stop

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:34.970
you have a circular mRNA when you stop
 

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.150
you have a circular mRNA when you stop
translating so the ribosome goes to the

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:37.160
translating so the ribosome goes to the
 

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.579
translating so the ribosome goes to the
stop codon maybe it's easier for the

00:13:39.579 --> 00:13:39.589
stop codon maybe it's easier for the
 

00:13:39.589 --> 00:13:42.939
stop codon maybe it's easier for the
ribosomes to recirculate on the mRNA but

00:13:42.939 --> 00:13:42.949
ribosomes to recirculate on the mRNA but
 

00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:45.009
ribosomes to recirculate on the mRNA but
nobody really knows if that's true or

00:13:45.009 --> 00:13:45.019
nobody really knows if that's true or
 

00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:49.120
nobody really knows if that's true or
not okay so in virus infected cells this

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.130
not okay so in virus infected cells this
 

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.670
not okay so in virus infected cells this
basic system has been modified and

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680
basic system has been modified and
 

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.889
basic system has been modified and
expanded for a variety of reasons that

00:13:53.889 --> 00:13:53.899
expanded for a variety of reasons that
 

00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:55.449
expanded for a variety of reasons that
we're going to talk about that now

00:13:55.449 --> 00:13:55.459
we're going to talk about that now
 

00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:59.920
we're going to talk about that now
and one of these types of expansions is

00:13:59.920 --> 00:13:59.930
and one of these types of expansions is
 

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:02.259
and one of these types of expansions is
called ribosome shunting now basically

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:02.269
called ribosome shunting now basically
 

00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:06.069
called ribosome shunting now basically
what viruses will try and do is to take

00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079
what viruses will try and do is to take
 

00:14:06.079 --> 00:14:08.439
what viruses will try and do is to take
over the entire translational apparatus

00:14:08.439 --> 00:14:08.449
over the entire translational apparatus
 

00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:11.199
over the entire translational apparatus
of the cell so as you will see they will

00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:11.209
of the cell so as you will see they will
 

00:14:11.209 --> 00:14:13.569
of the cell so as you will see they will
try and shut off the translation of host

00:14:13.569 --> 00:14:13.579
try and shut off the translation of host
 

00:14:13.579 --> 00:14:15.910
try and shut off the translation of host
mRNAs they want to have the ribosomes

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920
mRNAs they want to have the ribosomes
 

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.800
mRNAs they want to have the ribosomes
and the tRNA is all dedicated to making

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:17.810
and the tRNA is all dedicated to making
 

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.220
and the tRNA is all dedicated to making
their proteins viral proteins so I will

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:21.230
their proteins viral proteins so I will
 

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.870
their proteins viral proteins so I will
talk about some ways that that happens

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880
talk about some ways that that happens
 

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.490
talk about some ways that that happens
but in turn the viruses have to have a

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:24.500
but in turn the viruses have to have a
 

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.590
but in turn the viruses have to have a
way to escape their own inhibition of

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:26.600
way to escape their own inhibition of
 

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.650
way to escape their own inhibition of
translation and this is one of them so

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:29.660
translation and this is one of them so
 

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.829
translation and this is one of them so
that's why we're talking about

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839
that's why we're talking about
 

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:33.699
that's why we're talking about
modifications of the translation

00:14:33.699 --> 00:14:33.709
modifications of the translation
 

00:14:33.709 --> 00:14:36.340
modifications of the translation
apparatus to make the viruses have the

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:36.350
apparatus to make the viruses have the
 

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.530
apparatus to make the viruses have the
system dedicated to them but also not to

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:38.540
system dedicated to them but also not to
 

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.590
system dedicated to them but also not to
be inhibited by their own actions

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.600
be inhibited by their own actions
 

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.600
be inhibited by their own actions
so ribosome shunting is an interesting

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:43.610
so ribosome shunting is an interesting
 

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.180
so ribosome shunting is an interesting
mechanism whereby we think that

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:46.190
mechanism whereby we think that
 

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.269
mechanism whereby we think that
ribosomes bind the cap just as I've told

00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279
ribosomes bind the cap just as I've told
 

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:51.670
ribosomes bind the cap just as I've told
you this happens on viral mRNA is they

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680
you this happens on viral mRNA is they
 

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.710
you this happens on viral mRNA is they
bind the cap and then they pass over

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:53.720
bind the cap and then they pass over
 

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.819
bind the cap and then they pass over
most of the five prime UTR okay so that

00:14:57.819 --> 00:14:57.829
most of the five prime UTR okay so that
 

00:14:57.829 --> 00:15:00.819
most of the five prime UTR okay so that
is shown by this experiment where we we

00:15:00.819 --> 00:15:00.829
is shown by this experiment where we we
 

00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:02.829
is shown by this experiment where we we
have made a messenger RNA it's capped

00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:02.839
have made a messenger RNA it's capped
 

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:05.620
have made a messenger RNA it's capped
and it has a lot of secondary structure

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:05.630
and it has a lot of secondary structure
 

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:10.960
and it has a lot of secondary structure
in the utr and this secondary structure

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:10.970
in the utr and this secondary structure
 

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.579
in the utr and this secondary structure
of course would have to be melted out in

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:12.589
of course would have to be melted out in
 

00:15:12.589 --> 00:15:14.439
of course would have to be melted out in
order to get translation of of the

00:15:14.439 --> 00:15:14.449
order to get translation of of the
 

00:15:14.449 --> 00:15:16.660
order to get translation of of the
protein and this is a Western blot on

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:16.670
protein and this is a Western blot on
 

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.069
protein and this is a Western blot on
the right where we're looking for the

00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079
the right where we're looking for the
 

00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:20.050
the right where we're looking for the
protein that is made by translation of

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:20.060
protein that is made by translation of
 

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.389
protein that is made by translation of
this mRNA so if you take this wild-type

00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399
this mRNA so if you take this wild-type
 

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:25.870
this mRNA so if you take this wild-type
mRNA and you put it in a cell or in a

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880
mRNA and you put it in a cell or in a
 

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.569
mRNA and you put it in a cell or in a
translation extract you get proteins

00:15:28.569 --> 00:15:28.579
translation extract you get proteins
 

00:15:28.579 --> 00:15:32.670
translation extract you get proteins
made now if you put a very stable

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:32.680
made now if you put a very stable
 

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.110
made now if you put a very stable
stem-loop structure right here right

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120
stem-loop structure right here right
 

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:35.740
stem-loop structure right here right
next to the

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:35.750
next to the
 

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.200
next to the
that's shown in red so this is a stem

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:38.210
that's shown in red so this is a stem
 

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.210
that's shown in red so this is a stem
loop which is so stable it will for sure

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:40.220
loop which is so stable it will for sure
 

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.170
loop which is so stable it will for sure
block the movement of ribosomes and

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:43.180
block the movement of ribosomes and
 

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.030
block the movement of ribosomes and
prevent them from getting to the Aug we

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.040
prevent them from getting to the Aug we
 

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.050
prevent them from getting to the Aug we
know this this has no effect in this

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:50.060
know this this has no effect in this
 

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.750
know this this has no effect in this
position on protein synthesis so somehow

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:52.760
position on protein synthesis so somehow
 

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.690
position on protein synthesis so somehow
the ribosomes are getting around it if

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:55.700
the ribosomes are getting around it if
 

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.880
the ribosomes are getting around it if
you put the same stem loop here at near

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:57.890
you put the same stem loop here at near
 

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.340
you put the same stem loop here at near
the 5-prime and it blocks translation of

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:00.350
the 5-prime and it blocks translation of
 

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:04.210
the 5-prime and it blocks translation of
this mRNA all right so this shows you

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:04.220
this mRNA all right so this shows you
 

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.860
this mRNA all right so this shows you
that the stem loop in itself is enough

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:05.870
that the stem loop in itself is enough
 

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.800
that the stem loop in itself is enough
to block the passage of the ribosome

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:07.810
to block the passage of the ribosome
 

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.690
to block the passage of the ribosome
here only so we think that the ribosome

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:10.700
here only so we think that the ribosome
 

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.360
here only so we think that the ribosome
is begin to scan and they can scan past

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:13.370
is begin to scan and they can scan past
 

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.330
is begin to scan and they can scan past
this region and this blocks it so they

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:16.340
this region and this blocks it so they
 

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.040
this region and this blocks it so they
normally would scan through here and at

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:18.050
normally would scan through here and at
 

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.770
normally would scan through here and at
some point in here they are released or

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:20.780
some point in here they are released or

one part of this utr to the other so
 

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.020
one part of this utr to the other so
they can shunt over this stem loop but

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:32.030
they can shunt over this stem loop but
 

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.820
they can shunt over this stem loop but
they can't apparently shunt over this

they can't apparently shunt over this
 

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.610
they can't apparently shunt over this
one so that's the evidence for our

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.829
bind at the 5-prime and they scan a bit
and then they reach some secondary

00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:44.839
and then they reach some secondary
 

00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:47.110
and then they reach some secondary

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:22.360
non-coding region at the five prime end
so this is seven hundred and forty

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:22.370
so this is seven hundred and forty
 

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.490

linked to it which if you remember from

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:53.030
linked to it which if you remember from
 

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.590

do the ribosomes attached to this RNA

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:02.510
do the ribosomes attached to this RNA
 

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.510
do the ribosomes attached to this RNA
and how do they get through all of these

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:04.520
and how do they get through all of these
 

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.280
and how do they get through all of these
aegs well someone had the idea that

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:06.290
aegs well someone had the idea that
 

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.980
aegs well someone had the idea that
maybe this allows ribosomes to bind

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:08.990
maybe this allows ribosomes to bind
 

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.210
maybe this allows ribosomes to bind
internally so they did this experiment

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:12.220
internally so they did this experiment
 

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:17.680
internally so they did this experiment
they made two different mRNAs and they

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:17.690
they made two different mRNAs and they
 

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:21.040
they made two different mRNAs and they
both have two protein coding regions so

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:21.050
both have two protein coding regions so
 

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.169
both have two protein coding regions so
one here in orange and one here in blue

00:19:23.169 --> 00:19:23.179
one here in orange and one here in blue
 

00:19:23.179 --> 00:19:25.540
one here in orange and one here in blue
so you're making orange proteins here

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:25.550
so you're making orange proteins here
 

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.580
so you're making orange proteins here
and blue proteins here now this is a

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:27.590
and blue proteins here now this is a
 

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.970
and blue proteins here now this is a
capped mRNA if you put this in a cell

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:30.980
capped mRNA if you put this in a cell
 

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.580
capped mRNA if you put this in a cell
you make a lot of orange protein but

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:33.590
you make a lot of orange protein but
 

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.730
you make a lot of orange protein but
remember eukaryotic mRNAs are not very

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:36.740
remember eukaryotic mRNAs are not very
 

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.030
remember eukaryotic mRNAs are not very
good at making more than one protein so

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:40.040
good at making more than one protein so
 

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.220
good at making more than one protein so
most of the ribosomes will fall off

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:42.230
most of the ribosomes will fall off
 

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.370
most of the ribosomes will fall off
after making the orange protein and very

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:45.380
after making the orange protein and very
 

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.620
after making the orange protein and very
few will make it to the second protein

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:47.630
few will make it to the second protein
 

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.080
few will make it to the second protein
coding region it's just a fact of the

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:50.090
coding region it's just a fact of the
 

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.480
coding region it's just a fact of the
way eukaryotic mRNAs work so we have one

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:52.490
way eukaryotic mRNAs work so we have one
 

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.370
way eukaryotic mRNAs work so we have one
blue protein here to illustrate that not

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:54.380
blue protein here to illustrate that not
 

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.340
blue protein here to illustrate that not
many of those are made if you take this

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:57.350
many of those are made if you take this
 

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.470
many of those are made if you take this
sequence from the five prime end of

00:19:59.470 --> 00:19:59.480

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:06.700
poliovirus RNA that sequence here
this 740 some base sequence you make a

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:06.710
this 740 some base sequence you make a
 

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.210
this 740 some base sequence you make a
DNA copy of it you put it into this

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:09.220
DNA copy of it you put it into this
 

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.710
DNA copy of it you put it into this
construct you make it and you make it

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720
construct you make it and you make it
 

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.049

00:20:14.049 --> 00:20:14.059
RNA of course eventually this is an RNA
 

00:20:14.059 --> 00:20:16.120
RNA of course eventually this is an RNA
so that's this sequence here in the

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:16.130
so that's this sequence here in the
 

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.190
so that's this sequence here in the
middle which we've labeled ir es and

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.200
middle which we've labeled ir es and
 

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.040
middle which we've labeled ir es and
then you put this into a cell now you

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:21.050
then you put this into a cell now you
 

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.960
then you put this into a cell now you
can make a lot of orange proteins as

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:22.970
can make a lot of orange proteins as
 

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.060
can make a lot of orange proteins as
well as a large a lot of blue proteins

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:25.070
well as a large a lot of blue proteins
 

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.910
well as a large a lot of blue proteins
so somehow this sequence enables the

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:27.920
so somehow this sequence enables the
 

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.390
so somehow this sequence enables the
ribosomes to get inside the mRNA and

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:31.400
ribosomes to get inside the mRNA and
 

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.750
ribosomes to get inside the mRNA and
initiate translation and it was called

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760
initiate translation and it was called
 

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.890
initiate translation and it was called
an internal ribosome entry site or iris

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:37.900
an internal ribosome entry site or iris
 

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.810
an internal ribosome entry site or iris
that's where the name comes from now on

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:40.820
that's where the name comes from now on
 

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.370
that's where the name comes from now on
the bottom is another experiment that

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:42.380
the bottom is another experiment that
 

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.890
the bottom is another experiment that
was done this was done instead of

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:44.900
was done this was done instead of
 

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.720
was done this was done instead of
putting these RNAs into regular

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:46.730
putting these RNAs into regular
 

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:49.150
putting these RNAs into regular
uninfected cells they were put into

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:49.160
uninfected cells they were put into
 

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.450
uninfected cells they were put into
polio virus infected cells now as we

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:52.460
polio virus infected cells now as we
 

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.750
polio virus infected cells now as we
will see later in polio virus infected

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760
will see later in polio virus infected
 

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:59.919
will see later in polio virus infected
cells the five prime end dependent

00:20:59.919 --> 00:20:59.929
cells the five prime end dependent
 

00:20:59.929 --> 00:21:02.290
cells the five prime end dependent
translation is completely inhibited so

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:02.300
translation is completely inhibited so
 

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.960
translation is completely inhibited so
ribosomes cannot get on to the five

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:04.970
ribosomes cannot get on to the five
 

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.880
ribosomes cannot get on to the five

onto the cap well we'll talk about the
mechanism so this mRNA is absolutely not

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:12.890
mechanism so this mRNA is absolutely not
 

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.130

translated at all no orange proteins are

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:15.140
translated at all no orange proteins are
 

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.540
translated at all no orange proteins are
made no blue proteins because the

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:16.550
made no blue proteins because the
 

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.180
made no blue proteins because the
ribosomes can't load its again it's a

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:19.190
ribosomes can't load its again it's a
 

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.950
ribosomes can't load its again it's a
polio virus infected cell but if you

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960
polio virus infected cell but if you
 

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.560
polio virus infected cell but if you
take this RNA where you have an iris you

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:23.570
take this RNA where you have an iris you
 

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.410
take this RNA where you have an iris you
make plenty of blue proteins because the

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:26.420
make plenty of blue proteins because the
 

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.919
make plenty of blue proteins because the
ribosomes don't need a five-prime end

00:21:28.919 --> 00:21:28.929
ribosomes don't need a five-prime end
 

00:21:28.929 --> 00:21:32.020
ribosomes don't need a five-prime end
which is blocked by polio infection to

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:32.030
which is blocked by polio infection to
 

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.450
which is blocked by polio infection to
translate the blue protein they can load

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:34.460
translate the blue protein they can load

internally which is not affected by the
 

00:21:37.309 --> 00:21:39.220
internally which is not affected by the
block at the five prime end so this

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:39.230
block at the five prime end so this
 

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.669
block at the five prime end so this
showed that internal ribosome entry

00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679
showed that internal ribosome entry
 

00:21:41.679 --> 00:21:44.169
showed that internal ribosome entry
actually bypasses a five-prime and

00:21:44.169 --> 00:21:44.179
actually bypasses a five-prime and
 

00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:45.340
actually bypasses a five-prime and
that's why I like to call the other

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:45.350
that's why I like to call the other
 

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.830
that's why I like to call the other
mechanism five prime end dependent

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840
mechanism five prime end dependent
 

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.360
mechanism five prime end dependent
because this one is not

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:49.370
because this one is not
 

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.660

you don't need a three five prime end so

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:52.670
you don't need a three five prime end so
 

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.790
you don't need a three five prime end so
internal ribosome entry site was coined

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:54.800
internal ribosome entry site was coined
 

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.960
internal ribosome entry site was coined
to describe this now this predicts that

00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:58.970
to describe this now this predicts that
 

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.090
to describe this now this predicts that
a five prime end is not needed but it

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:01.100
a five prime end is not needed but it
 

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.250
a five prime end is not needed but it
doesn't prove it but the following very

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:03.260
doesn't prove it but the following very
 

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.280
doesn't prove it but the following very
cool experiment does prove that so if

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:06.290
cool experiment does prove that so if
 

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:08.380
cool experiment does prove that so if
you want to prove that a five prime end

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:08.390
you want to prove that a five prime end
 

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:11.290
you want to prove that a five prime end
is needed for five prime end dependent

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:11.300
is needed for five prime end dependent
 

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.630
is needed for five prime end dependent
translation but not iris dependent

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640
translation but not iris dependent
 

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.880
translation but not iris dependent
translation you make a circular

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:15.890
translation you make a circular
 

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:18.880
translation you make a circular
MRNA and you can do this by ligating the

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:18.890
MRNA and you can do this by ligating the
 

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:22.420
MRNA and you can do this by ligating the
ends together you have to make a little

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:22.430
ends together you have to make a little
 

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.220
ends together you have to make a little
I'll ago nucleotide that bridges the

I'll ago nucleotide that bridges the
 

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.260
I'll ago nucleotide that bridges the
ends and then you can light them

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:26.270
ends and then you can light them
 

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.240
ends and then you can light them
together you make circles like this and

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:28.250
together you make circles like this and
 

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.490
together you make circles like this and
in this experiment we have two circular

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:30.500
in this experiment we have two circular
 

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:34.330
in this experiment we have two circular
mRNAs one has an iris and the other

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:34.340
mRNAs one has an iris and the other
 

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.390
mRNAs one has an iris and the other
doesn't and this has an Aug so this is

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:37.400
doesn't and this has an Aug so this is
 

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.520
doesn't and this has an Aug so this is
the open reading frame for a protein and

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:39.530
the open reading frame for a protein and
 

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.440
the open reading frame for a protein and
this one has the same open reading frame

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:41.450
this one has the same open reading frame
 

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:47.710
this one has the same open reading frame
but no iris this RNA will make protein

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720
but no iris this RNA will make protein
 

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.230
but no iris this RNA will make protein
when you try to translate it because the

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240
when you try to translate it because the
 

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.990
when you try to translate it because the
ribosomes can bind to the iris this one

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.000
ribosomes can bind to the iris this one
 

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.150
ribosomes can bind to the iris this one
has no iris the ribosomes can't

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:55.160
has no iris the ribosomes can't
 

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.820
has no iris the ribosomes can't
recognize it there's no free five prime

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:57.830
recognize it there's no free five prime
 

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.590
recognize it there's no free five prime
end with a cap so they can't translate

00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600
end with a cap so they can't translate
 

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.390
end with a cap so they can't translate
it so this shows that an iris doesn't

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:01.400
it so this shows that an iris doesn't
 

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.460
it so this shows that an iris doesn't
need a 5 prime end in order for

need a 5 prime end in order for
 

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.460
need a 5 prime end in order for
translation to occur and what does an

so you see first of all the yellow parts

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:47.690
so you see first of all the yellow parts
 

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.110
so you see first of all the yellow parts
are the iris part here here here and

here they're all different the sequences
 

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.100
here they're all different the sequences
are completely different and even the

are completely different and even the
 

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.950
are completely different and even the
structures are different so you actually

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960
structures are different so you actually
 

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.140
structures are different so you actually
cannot look at a nucleotide sequence and

00:23:59.140 --> 00:23:59.150
cannot look at a nucleotide sequence and
 

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.700
cannot look at a nucleotide sequence and
say AHA that's an iris because there's

to bind but it's very hard to scan for
 

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:10.270
to bind but it's very hard to scan for

to be able to bind directly the 40 s

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:19.450
to be able to bind directly the 40 s
 

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:22.020
to be able to bind directly the 40 s
subunit so the 40 s binds the iris

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:22.030
subunit so the 40 s binds the iris
 

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.930

40 s subunit right on top of the
 

00:25:27.429 --> 00:25:30.780
40 s subunit right on top of the
initiation codon and then eiei f3 can

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:30.790
initiation codon and then eiei f3 can
 

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.600

come in and this the big subunit then

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:33.610
come in and this the big subunit then
 

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.030
come in and this the big subunit then
comes in as well so this is an example

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:36.040

4g binds to the iris which then if you

00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:12.309
4g binds to the iris which then if you
 

00:26:12.309 --> 00:26:14.340
4g binds to the iris which then if you
remember binds the CIF 3 and then the

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:14.350
remember binds the CIF 3 and then the
 

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:16.919
remember binds the CIF 3 and then the
40's subunit so it's a little different

00:26:16.919 --> 00:26:16.929
40's subunit so it's a little different
 

00:26:16.929 --> 00:26:18.960
40's subunit so it's a little different
from the Hep C example where the 40's

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:18.970
from the Hep C example where the 40's
 

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.230
from the Hep C example where the 40's
combine the iris directly here it has to

for the first Aug as soon as it finds it
it puts a tRNA there there are examples

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:25.750
it puts a tRNA there there are examples
 

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.650
it puts a tRNA there there are examples
of Metheny and independent in not only

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:28.660
of Metheny and independent in not only
 

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.960
of Metheny and independent in not only
cells but in virus infected cells and

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:30.970
cells but in virus infected cells and
 

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:35.790

here are two of them this is an example

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:35.800
here are two of them this is an example
 

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.810
here are two of them this is an example
where you don't need an Athenian tRNA

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:39.820
where you don't need an Athenian tRNA
 

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.750
where you don't need an Athenian tRNA
because the viral RNA folds in a way

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:42.760
because the viral RNA folds in a way
 

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.380
because the viral RNA folds in a way
that mimics a tRNA so this is a viral

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:46.390
that mimics a tRNA so this is a viral
 

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.380
that mimics a tRNA so this is a viral
RNA it happens to be a plus strand RNA

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:48.390

we'll talk about in a moment the very

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:51.460
we'll talk about in a moment the very
 

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.580
we'll talk about in a moment the very
five prime end is folding in a way that

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:53.590
five prime end is folding in a way that
 

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:56.100
five prime end is folding in a way that
looks like a met tRNA so not

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.110
looks like a met tRNA so not
 

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.350
looks like a met tRNA so not
at tRNA but an initiator tRNA this

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360
at tRNA but an initiator tRNA this
 

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.930
at tRNA but an initiator tRNA this
happens to be initiating at a prolene

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:00.940
happens to be initiating at a prolene
 

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.480
happens to be initiating at a prolene
triplet although there is no amino acid

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:03.490
triplet although there is no amino acid
 

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.010
triplet although there is no amino acid
placed in here because this is not

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:05.020
placed in here because this is not
 

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.010
placed in here because this is not
charged with an amino acid all right so

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:08.020
charged with an amino acid all right so
 

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.010
charged with an amino acid all right so
this RNA can initiate translation

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020
this RNA can initiate translation
 

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.200
this RNA can initiate translation
without a met tRNA the first amino acid

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:13.210
without a met tRNA the first amino acid
 

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.030
without a met tRNA the first amino acid
to go in in this case is an alanine in

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:15.040
to go in in this case is an alanine in
 

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.090
to go in in this case is an alanine in
the in the a site here again because the

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:18.100
the in the a site here again because the
 

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.100
the in the a site here again because the
RNA is folding to beat to look like a

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:20.110
RNA is folding to beat to look like a
 

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:21.960
RNA is folding to beat to look like a
tRNA even though there's no amino acid

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:21.970
tRNA even though there's no amino acid
 

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:24.690
tRNA even though there's no amino acid
attached to it so that's one example and

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:24.700
attached to it so that's one example and
 

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.610
attached to it so that's one example and
there's another one this is a plant

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:26.620
there's another one this is a plant
 

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:30.990
there's another one this is a plant
viral RNA where the three prime end has

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.000
viral RNA where the three prime end has
 

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.710
viral RNA where the three prime end has
a tRNA like structure this is actually

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720
a tRNA like structure this is actually
 

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.600
a tRNA like structure this is actually
charged with valine you can see the

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:36.610
charged with valine you can see the
 

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.030
charged with valine you can see the
valine amino acid is attached here so

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:39.040
valine amino acid is attached here so
 

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.669
valine amino acid is attached here so
this sits down on a valine codon and the

00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679
this sits down on a valine codon and the
 

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:43.049
this sits down on a valine codon and the
first amino acid to be put in as a

00:29:43.049 --> 00:29:43.059
first amino acid to be put in as a
 

00:29:43.059 --> 00:29:46.440
first amino acid to be put in as a
valine so the RNA three prime end mimics

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:46.450
valine so the RNA three prime end mimics
 

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.470
valine so the RNA three prime end mimics
a Metheny initiator instead putting in

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:49.480
a Metheny initiator instead putting in
 

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.789
a Metheny initiator instead putting in
valine we're not sure why they do this

00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799
valine we're not sure why they do this
 

00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:56.909
valine we're not sure why they do this

open reading frames separated by an iris
 

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.110
open reading frames separated by an iris
now an iris would in theory give you the

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.120
now an iris would in theory give you the
 

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.150

out one morning and saw paralyzed
 

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:51.870
out one morning and saw paralyzed
crickets on the ground and they sent

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:51.880
crickets on the ground and they sent
 

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.850
crickets on the ground and they sent
them to a virologist and the virologist

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:53.860
them to a virologist and the virologist
 

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.669

for pest control the interesting thing

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.000
for pest control the interesting thing
 

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.210
for pest control the interesting thing
about the virus went sequenced it would

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:03.220
about the virus went sequenced it would
 

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.400
about the virus went sequenced it would
look almost like polio except instead of

one long open reading frame it was split

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:07.330
one long open reading frame it was split
 

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:09.510
one long open reading frame it was split
in two and there's an iris in between

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:09.520
in two and there's an iris in between
 

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.150
in two and there's an iris in between
here labeled igr intergenic region so

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:12.160
here labeled igr intergenic region so
 

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.580
here labeled igr intergenic region so
this is an iris splitting to open

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:14.590
this is an iris splitting to open
 

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:17.070
this is an iris splitting to open
reading frames there's also an iris at

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.080
reading frames there's also an iris at
 

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.770

picornaviruses now this iris here looks

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200
picornaviruses now this iris here looks
 

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.830
picornaviruses now this iris here looks
like this and in fact this is the this

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840
like this and in fact this is the this
 

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.740
like this and in fact this is the this
is a sequence that can mimic a tRNA so

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:28.750
is a sequence that can mimic a tRNA so
 

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.320
is a sequence that can mimic a tRNA so
that's the one I just showed you before

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:30.330
that's the one I just showed you before
 

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.570
that's the one I just showed you before
the way initiation works on this iris is

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:33.580
the way initiation works on this iris is
 

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.940
the way initiation works on this iris is
that the ribosome binds internally and

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:35.950
that the ribosome binds internally and
 

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.380
that the ribosome binds internally and
the RNA mimics

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:37.390
the RNA mimics
 

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:40.050
the RNA mimics
the tRNA so that initiation begins

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:40.060
the tRNA so that initiation begins
 

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.690
the tRNA so that initiation begins
without a methionine codon but the

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:42.700
without a methionine codon but the
 

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.100
without a methionine codon but the
interesting point here well they're two

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:44.110
interesting point here well they're two
 

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.930
interesting point here well they're two
interesting points this is very

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:45.940
interesting points this is very
 

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.600
interesting points this is very
interesting the Metheny independent

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:48.610
interesting the Metheny independent
 

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:50.370
interesting the Metheny independent
initiation but also the fact that you

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:50.380
initiation but also the fact that you
 

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.660
initiation but also the fact that you
have this is a polycistronic mrna which

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:54.670
have this is a polycistronic mrna which
 

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:57.420
have this is a polycistronic mrna which
only happens in bacteria and is the only

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:57.430
only happens in bacteria and is the only
 

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:00.840
only happens in bacteria and is the only
example that I know of that so here's

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:00.850
example that I know of that so here's
 

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:01.680
example that I know of that so here's
the problem

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:01.690
the problem
 

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:02.910
the problem
and we're going to talk about other ways

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:02.920
and we're going to talk about other ways
 

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.090
and we're going to talk about other ways
to get around this so eukaryotic mRNAs

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:06.100
to get around this so eukaryotic mRNAs
 

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.820
to get around this so eukaryotic mRNAs
are typically mono so Stronach one mRNA

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:08.830
are typically mono so Stronach one mRNA
 

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:12.870
are typically mono so Stronach one mRNA
one protein bacterial and archaeal mRNAs

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880
one protein bacterial and archaeal mRNAs
 

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.330
one protein bacterial and archaeal mRNAs
are polycistronic you can make several

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:15.340

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:27.300
leaky scanning mechanism actually two
two of the proteins are made by RNA

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:27.310
two of the proteins are made by RNA
 

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:30.210
two of the proteins are made by RNA
editing so you remember RNA editing is

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:30.220
editing so you remember RNA editing is
 

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.460
editing so you remember RNA editing is
when you make the mRNA you insert an

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:32.470
when you make the mRNA you insert an
 

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:34.260
when you make the mRNA you insert an
extra base during transcription which is

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:34.270
extra base during transcription which is
 

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:36.420
extra base during transcription which is
not templated so you shift the reading

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:36.430
not templated so you shift the reading
 

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:37.030
not templated so you shift the reading
frame

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040
frame
 

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.680
frame
so you can make this protein in this

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:38.690
so you can make this protein in this
 

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.250
so you can make this protein in this
protein which have different C termini

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:41.260
protein which have different C termini
 

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.440
protein which have different C termini
but the C proteins 1 2 3 4 are all made

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:44.450
but the C proteins 1 2 3 4 are all made
 

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:47.290
but the C proteins 1 2 3 4 are all made
by leaky scanning so let's see how this

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:47.300
by leaky scanning so let's see how this
 

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.510
by leaky scanning so let's see how this
works so we have a cap at the 5 prime

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520
works so we have a cap at the 5 prime
 

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:53.350
works so we have a cap at the 5 prime
end the ribosome binds and it starts to

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:53.360
end the ribosome binds and it starts to
 

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.180
end the ribosome binds and it starts to
scan down and it reaches this ACG codon

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:57.190
scan down and it reaches this ACG codon
 

00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:05.710
scan down and it reaches this ACG codon
ok now a cg can be an initiator trna is

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:05.720
ok now a cg can be an initiator trna is
 

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.120
ok now a cg can be an initiator trna is
will bind to that but it's not very

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:07.130
will bind to that but it's not very
 

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:07.810
will bind to that but it's not very
efficient

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:07.820
efficient
 

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:10.210
efficient
so maybe ribosomes start translating

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:10.220
so maybe ribosomes start translating
 

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:13.570
so maybe ribosomes start translating
only 5% of the time so they make this C

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:13.580
only 5% of the time so they make this C
 

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.550
only 5% of the time so they make this C
prime protein but a number of ribosomes

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560
prime protein but a number of ribosomes
 

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.230
prime protein but a number of ribosomes
will keep scanning without initiating

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:17.240
will keep scanning without initiating
 

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.070
will keep scanning without initiating
and then they reach this Aug at 104

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:20.080
and then they reach this Aug at 104
 

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.350
and then they reach this Aug at 104
that's an Aug codon so the ribosome is

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:23.360
that's an Aug codon so the ribosome is
 

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.810
that's an Aug codon so the ribosome is
like that but you know the surrounding

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:25.820
like that but you know the surrounding
 

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.660
like that but you know the surrounding
sequence around an Aug is very important

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:28.670
sequence around an Aug is very important
 

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:30.760
sequence around an Aug is very important
for the efficiency and we call that the

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:30.770
for the efficiency and we call that the
 

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:34.090
for the efficiency and we call that the
context of the Aug and this Aug has a

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:34.100
context of the Aug and this Aug has a
 

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.550
context of the Aug and this Aug has a
really bad context so again a few

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560
really bad context so again a few
 

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.380
really bad context so again a few
ribosomes translate and make this P

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:38.390
ribosomes translate and make this P
 

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:41.170
ribosomes translate and make this P
protein but many of them continue to

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:41.180
protein but many of them continue to
 

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:45.760
protein but many of them continue to
scan then they reach this Aug at 114

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:45.770
scan then they reach this Aug at 114
 

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.740
scan then they reach this Aug at 114
which is an Aug and it has a great

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:47.750
which is an Aug and it has a great
 

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:58.150
which is an Aug and it has a great
context yes

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160
 

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.319
sure good question

00:37:00.319 --> 00:37:00.329
sure good question
 

00:37:00.329 --> 00:37:02.749
sure good question
I mean this would be uninteresting if

00:37:02.749 --> 00:37:02.759
I mean this would be uninteresting if
 

00:37:02.759 --> 00:37:04.819
I mean this would be uninteresting if
they weren't functional right yes you

00:37:04.819 --> 00:37:04.829
they weren't functional right yes you
 

00:37:04.829 --> 00:37:08.450
they weren't functional right yes you
can do experiments to eliminate each of

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:08.460
can do experiments to eliminate each of
 

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.150
can do experiments to eliminate each of
these proteins and they're important so

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160
these proteins and they're important so
 

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.609
these proteins and they're important so
they differ at their end terminal and in

00:37:13.609 --> 00:37:13.619
they differ at their end terminal and in
 

00:37:13.619 --> 00:37:15.019
they differ at their end terminal and in
fact this one is in a totally different

00:37:15.019 --> 00:37:15.029
fact this one is in a totally different
 

00:37:15.029 --> 00:37:17.059
fact this one is in a totally different
reading frame the pea protein that's why

00:37:17.059 --> 00:37:17.069
reading frame the pea protein that's why
 

00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:18.739
reading frame the pea protein that's why
it's brown here so this is a totally

00:37:18.739 --> 00:37:18.749
it's brown here so this is a totally
 

00:37:18.749 --> 00:37:20.180
it's brown here so this is a totally
different protein from the others which

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:20.190
different protein from the others which
 

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:22.400
different protein from the others which
just differ by the length of their end

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:22.410
just differ by the length of their end
 

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.559
just differ by the length of their end
terminus but they do have important

00:37:24.559 --> 00:37:24.569
terminus but they do have important
 

00:37:24.569 --> 00:37:36.469
terminus but they do have important
functions yeah yeah yeah so the context

00:37:36.469 --> 00:37:36.479
functions yeah yeah yeah so the context
 

00:37:36.479 --> 00:37:39.829
functions yeah yeah yeah so the context
is bad hmm around the Aug there are a

00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839
is bad hmm around the Aug there are a
 

00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:41.450
is bad hmm around the Aug there are a
couple of bases on either side which

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:41.460
couple of bases on either side which
 

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.039
couple of bases on either side which
have to be a certain sequence to get

00:37:43.039 --> 00:37:43.049
have to be a certain sequence to get
 

00:37:43.049 --> 00:37:45.799
have to be a certain sequence to get
maximal initiation it's called the

00:37:45.799 --> 00:37:45.809
maximal initiation it's called the
 

00:37:45.809 --> 00:37:50.450
maximal initiation it's called the
consensus sequence and if in eukaryotic

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.460
consensus sequence and if in eukaryotic
 

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.749
consensus sequence and if in eukaryotic
mRNAs there are really no perfect

00:37:52.749 --> 00:37:52.759
mRNAs there are really no perfect
 

00:37:52.759 --> 00:37:55.279
mRNAs there are really no perfect
consensus mRNAs because every mRNA

00:37:55.279 --> 00:37:55.289
consensus mRNAs because every mRNA
 

00:37:55.289 --> 00:37:56.809
consensus mRNAs because every mRNA
doesn't have to be translated to its

00:37:56.809 --> 00:37:56.819
doesn't have to be translated to its
 

00:37:56.819 --> 00:37:59.719
doesn't have to be translated to its
maximal efficiency so that Aug I 104 has

00:37:59.719 --> 00:37:59.729
maximal efficiency so that Aug I 104 has
 

00:37:59.729 --> 00:38:04.209
maximal efficiency so that Aug I 104 has
a bad consensus surrounding the Aug and

00:38:04.209 --> 00:38:04.219
a bad consensus surrounding the Aug and
 

00:38:04.219 --> 00:38:07.190
a bad consensus surrounding the Aug and
then we have so these these are leaky

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200
then we have so these these are leaky
 

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.029
then we have so these these are leaky

proteins are RNA editing and then these

00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:14.099
proteins are RNA editing and then these
 

00:38:14.099 --> 00:38:18.079

two here very interesting Aug 183 and

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:18.089
two here very interesting Aug 183 and
 

00:38:18.089 --> 00:38:20.749

remember that mechanism where the

00:38:22.279 --> 00:38:22.289
remember that mechanism where the
 

00:38:22.289 --> 00:38:24.289
remember that mechanism where the
ribosomes jump the long distance that's

00:38:24.289 --> 00:38:24.299
ribosomes jump the long distance that's
 

00:38:24.299 --> 00:38:26.900
ribosomes jump the long distance that's
what they do here they start to scan and

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:26.910
what they do here they start to scan and
 

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:30.109
what they do here they start to scan and
then they get past Aug 114 and the

00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119
then they get past Aug 114 and the
 

00:38:30.119 --> 00:38:31.609
then they get past Aug 114 and the
number of them are still scanning and

00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:31.619
number of them are still scanning and
 

00:38:31.619 --> 00:38:35.749
number of them are still scanning and
they jump to 181 or 175 so it's amazing

00:38:35.749 --> 00:38:35.759
they jump to 181 or 175 so it's amazing
 

00:38:35.759 --> 00:38:38.450
they jump to 181 or 175 so it's amazing
from one mRNA the virus has evolved to

from one mRNA the virus has evolved to
 

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:46.430
from one mRNA the virus has evolved to
be able to make multiple proteins yeah

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440
 

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:53.510
right so the context in this and the

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520
right so the context in this and the
 

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.340

allows more ribosomes to pass over it so

00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480
allows more ribosomes to pass over it so
 

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.360
allows more ribosomes to pass over it so
that you can get the downstream protein

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:00.370
that you can get the downstream protein
 

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:06.240
that you can get the downstream protein
made well you need apparently you need

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:06.250
made well you need apparently you need
 

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.310
made well you need apparently you need
to make all of them right but you don't

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320
to make all of them right but you don't
 

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.140
to make all of them right but you don't
need all of them at the same levels and

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:10.150
need all of them at the same levels and
 

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:12.540
need all of them at the same levels and
this just ensures you that eventually

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:12.550
this just ensures you that eventually
 

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.330
this just ensures you that eventually
you get to the downstream one right so

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:15.340
you get to the downstream one right so
 

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.680
you get to the downstream one right so
those are the three made by Leakey

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:16.690
those are the three made by Leakey
 

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:18.090
those are the three made by Leakey
scanning and then the others are

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:18.100
scanning and then the others are
 

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.550
scanning and then the others are
different mechanisms as well all right

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560
different mechanisms as well all right
 

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.830

rna's I told you you make you have an
open reading frame you make one protein

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:32.410
open reading frame you make one protein
 

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:33.810
open reading frame you make one protein
but there are a couple of examples of

what's called the non translated region

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:40.840
what's called the non translated region
 

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.140
what's called the non translated region
obviously this is not technically a non

obviously this is not technically a non
 

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.970
obviously this is not technically a non
translated region but it would normally

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:44.980
translated region but it would normally
 

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:46.740
translated region but it would normally
look like one because it's upstream of

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:46.750
look like one because it's upstream of
 

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:49.440
look like one because it's upstream of
the main open reading frame but in some

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:49.450
the main open reading frame but in some
 

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.120
the main open reading frame but in some
virus-infected cells you can make these

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:51.130
virus-infected cells you can make these
 

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:53.310
virus-infected cells you can make these
short proteins they're called upstream

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:53.320
short proteins they're called upstream
 

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.040
short proteins they're called upstream
open reading frames and the ribosomes

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:56.050
open reading frames and the ribosomes
 

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:58.080
open reading frames and the ribosomes
keep going and then they reinitiate at

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:58.090
keep going and then they reinitiate at
 

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.620
keep going and then they reinitiate at
this downstream Orff so you can make two

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:01.630
this downstream Orff so you can make two
 

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:04.080
this downstream Orff so you can make two

2 what happens here's the ribosomes

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:17.380
2 what happens here's the ribosomes
 

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:21.390
2 what happens here's the ribosomes
initiate here they make this protein UA

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:21.400
initiate here they make this protein UA
 

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.240
initiate here they make this protein UA
a as a termination codon so they stop

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:24.250
a as a termination codon so they stop
 

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:28.320
a as a termination codon so they stop
but look the UAA is part of the next Aug

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:28.330
but look the UAA is part of the next Aug
 

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:30.810
but look the UAA is part of the next Aug
so they reinitiate immediately so

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:30.820
so they reinitiate immediately so
 

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.690
so they reinitiate immediately so
normally after terminations ribosomes

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:33.700
normally after terminations ribosomes
 

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.540
normally after terminations ribosomes
move a little more and then fall off but

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:36.550
move a little more and then fall off but
 

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:38.160
move a little more and then fall off but
there's nowhere to go here they move

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:38.170
there's nowhere to go here they move
 

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:39.900
there's nowhere to go here they move
they see an Aug and boom they start

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:39.910
they see an Aug and boom they start
 

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.150
they see an Aug and boom they start
translating again so that's another kind

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160
translating again so that's another kind
 

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:48.579
translating again so that's another kind
of reinitiation yeah

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:48.589
 

00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:51.019
now it doesn't in this case it's just

00:40:51.019 --> 00:40:51.029
now it doesn't in this case it's just
 

00:40:51.029 --> 00:40:53.180
now it doesn't in this case it's just
that's the actual open reading frame but

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:53.190
that's the actual open reading frame but
 

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:55.009
that's the actual open reading frame but
the protein begins right here

00:40:55.009 --> 00:40:55.019
the protein begins right here
 

00:40:55.019 --> 00:40:57.170
the protein begins right here
yeah these no but there is an example of

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180
yeah these no but there is an example of
 

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.640
yeah these no but there is an example of
that which we will get to overlapping

00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:58.650
that which we will get to overlapping
 

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:01.699
that which we will get to overlapping
reading frames reinitiation then we have

00:41:01.699 --> 00:41:01.709
reading frames reinitiation then we have
 

00:41:01.709 --> 00:41:03.859
reading frames reinitiation then we have
suppression of termination so view

00:41:03.859 --> 00:41:03.869
suppression of termination so view
 

00:41:03.869 --> 00:41:06.199
suppression of termination so view
proteins synthesis stops when the

00:41:06.199 --> 00:41:06.209
proteins synthesis stops when the
 

00:41:06.209 --> 00:41:10.130
proteins synthesis stops when the
ribosome reads a termination codon how

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140
ribosome reads a termination codon how
 

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:13.789
ribosome reads a termination codon how
does that work so you make proteins by

00:41:13.789 --> 00:41:13.799
does that work so you make proteins by
 

00:41:13.799 --> 00:41:18.199
does that work so you make proteins by
adding charge T RNAs to the a site and

00:41:18.199 --> 00:41:18.209
adding charge T RNAs to the a site and
 

00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:21.199
adding charge T RNAs to the a site and
then a peptide bond is form and here's

00:41:21.199 --> 00:41:21.209
then a peptide bond is form and here's
 

00:41:21.209 --> 00:41:23.599
then a peptide bond is form and here's
the growing peptide chain and then you

00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:23.609
the growing peptide chain and then you
 

00:41:23.609 --> 00:41:26.180
the growing peptide chain and then you
throw away the the tRNA without the

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:26.190
throw away the the tRNA without the
 

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:28.160
throw away the the tRNA without the
amino acid so this one has just been

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:28.170
amino acid so this one has just been
 

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.529
amino acid so this one has just been
linked to the growing peptide chain if

00:41:30.529 --> 00:41:30.539
linked to the growing peptide chain if
 

00:41:30.539 --> 00:41:33.589
linked to the growing peptide chain if
this were a triplet for the next amino

00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599
this were a triplet for the next amino
 

00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:35.779
this were a triplet for the next amino
acid a new tRNA would come in here and

00:41:35.779 --> 00:41:35.789
acid a new tRNA would come in here and
 

00:41:35.789 --> 00:41:37.099
acid a new tRNA would come in here and
then it would the amino acid would be

00:41:37.099 --> 00:41:37.109
then it would the amino acid would be
 

00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:39.949
then it would the amino acid would be
linked up to this chain but this is a

00:41:39.949 --> 00:41:39.959
linked up to this chain but this is a
 

00:41:39.959 --> 00:41:42.559
linked up to this chain but this is a
termination codon you a a it is

00:41:42.559 --> 00:41:42.569
termination codon you a a it is
 

00:41:42.569 --> 00:41:45.949
termination codon you a a it is
recognized by termination factors ER F 1

00:41:45.949 --> 00:41:45.959
recognized by termination factors ER F 1
 

00:41:45.959 --> 00:41:49.089
recognized by termination factors ER F 1
and e are F 3 and those are shown here

00:41:49.089 --> 00:41:49.099
and e are F 3 and those are shown here
 

00:41:49.099 --> 00:41:52.519
and e are F 3 and those are shown here
the these factors basically look like at

00:41:52.519 --> 00:41:52.529
the these factors basically look like at
 

00:41:52.529 --> 00:41:56.630
the these factors basically look like at
tRNA but they sit in the termination

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640
tRNA but they sit in the termination
 

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.390
tRNA but they sit in the termination
site and there's no tRNA there there's

00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400
site and there's no tRNA there there's
 

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.249
site and there's no tRNA there there's
no amino acid so that's halts

00:42:01.249 --> 00:42:01.259
no amino acid so that's halts
 

00:42:01.259 --> 00:42:04.729
no amino acid so that's halts
translation so that's how termination

00:42:04.729 --> 00:42:04.739
translation so that's how termination
 

00:42:04.739 --> 00:42:06.739
translation so that's how termination
normally happens you have these

00:42:06.739 --> 00:42:06.749
normally happens you have these
 

00:42:06.749 --> 00:42:09.049
normally happens you have these
termination factors recognizing the

00:42:09.049 --> 00:42:09.059
termination factors recognizing the
 

00:42:09.059 --> 00:42:10.969
termination factors recognizing the
termination codon and remember the three

00:42:10.969 --> 00:42:10.979
termination codon and remember the three
 

00:42:10.979 --> 00:42:13.880
termination codon and remember the three
of them and termination and translation

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:13.890
of them and termination and translation
 

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:16.609
of them and termination and translation
stops but sometimes these stop codons

00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:16.619
stops but sometimes these stop codons
 

00:42:16.619 --> 00:42:20.420
stops but sometimes these stop codons
can be recognized by a tRNA that has an

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:20.430
can be recognized by a tRNA that has an
 

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:22.519
can be recognized by a tRNA that has an
amino acid on it and that's called

00:42:22.519 --> 00:42:22.529
amino acid on it and that's called
 

00:42:22.529 --> 00:42:25.279
amino acid on it and that's called
suppression of termination and obviously

00:42:25.279 --> 00:42:25.289
suppression of termination and obviously
 

00:42:25.289 --> 00:42:28.549
suppression of termination and obviously
allows translation to continue and that

00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:28.559
allows translation to continue and that
 

00:42:28.559 --> 00:42:31.239
allows translation to continue and that

you AG there's this very interesting
 

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:21.200
you AG there's this very interesting
structure it's called a pseudo knot it's

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:21.210
structure it's called a pseudo knot it's
 

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.750
structure it's called a pseudo knot it's
a stem loop where the the unpaired bases

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760
a stem loop where the the unpaired bases

sequence you showed a picture of this

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:27.360
sequence you showed a picture of this
 

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.650
sequence you showed a picture of this
sometime ago and apparently this causes

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660
sometime ago and apparently this causes
 

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:33.530
sometime ago and apparently this causes
the ribosomes to pause the ribosomes hit

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:33.540
the ribosomes to pause the ribosomes hit
 

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.110
the ribosomes to pause the ribosomes hit
this structure and they pause and that

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:36.120
this structure and they pause and that
 

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.920
this structure and they pause and that
gives enough time for a tRNA to actually

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:39.930
gives enough time for a tRNA to actually
 

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:43.790
gives enough time for a tRNA to actually
sit into this UAG site and put a TIA an

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800
sit into this UAG site and put a TIA an
 

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.100
sit into this UAG site and put a TIA an
amino acid there so this can be a miss

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:46.110
amino acid there so this can be a miss
 

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:49.310
amino acid there so this can be a miss
reading of the codon which is usually

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:49.320
reading of the codon which is usually
 

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.350
reading of the codon which is usually
what happens it's not quite the right

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:51.360
what happens it's not quite the right
 

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.180
what happens it's not quite the right
codon going in there but it's close

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:53.190
codon going in there but it's close
 

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:55.070
codon going in there but it's close
enough and you get an amino acid put in

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:55.080
enough and you get an amino acid put in
 

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.360
enough and you get an amino acid put in
so that's one example

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:56.370
so that's one example
 

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:58.940
so that's one example
there's also suppression in the Alpha

00:43:58.940 --> 00:43:58.950
there's also suppression in the Alpha
 

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:02.420
there's also suppression in the Alpha
viruses these viruses if you remember

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:02.430
viruses these viruses if you remember
 

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:04.580
viruses these viruses if you remember
have a plus strand RNA genome when they

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:04.590
have a plus strand RNA genome when they
 

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:08.210
have a plus strand RNA genome when they
are translated initially they make a

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:08.220
are translated initially they make a
 

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.280
are translated initially they make a
precursor or poly protein precursor

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:10.290
precursor or poly protein precursor
 

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:12.980
precursor or poly protein precursor
called P 1 2 3 it stops right here there

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:12.990
called P 1 2 3 it stops right here there
 

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:16.160
called P 1 2 3 it stops right here there
is a termination codon but what's beyond

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:16.170
is a termination codon but what's beyond
 

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:19.400
is a termination codon but what's beyond
it is an SP 4 which is the viral RNA

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:19.410
it is an SP 4 which is the viral RNA
 

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:22.010
it is an SP 4 which is the viral RNA
polymerase so it has to make this so

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.020
polymerase so it has to make this so
 

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.650
polymerase so it has to make this so
there is some suppression of this

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:23.660
there is some suppression of this
 

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.690
there is some suppression of this
termination codon now because both the

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:26.700
termination codon now because both the
 

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.880
termination codon now because both the
polymerase and this RNA polymerase are

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:28.890
polymerase and this RNA polymerase are
 

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:30.830
polymerase and this RNA polymerase are
enzymes you don't need to have a lot of

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:30.840
enzymes you don't need to have a lot of
 

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.540
enzymes you don't need to have a lot of
them because they're catalytic

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:32.550
them because they're catalytic
 

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:34.580
them because they're catalytic
so this suppression only happens about

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:34.590
so this suppression only happens about
 

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.470
so this suppression only happens about
five to ten percent of the time that the

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480
five to ten percent of the time that the
 

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.570
five to ten percent of the time that the
ribosome comes down because you don't

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:38.580
ribosome comes down because you don't
 

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.460
ribosome comes down because you don't
need a hundred percent translation

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:40.470
need a hundred percent translation
 

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:41.960
need a hundred percent translation
because they're not structural protein

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:41.970
because they're not structural protein
 

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:44.000
because they're not structural protein
so this works gives you a little bit of

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:44.010
so this works gives you a little bit of
 

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:46.190
so this works gives you a little bit of
enzyme aid and that's how the virus

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200
enzyme aid and that's how the virus
 

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:50.240
enzyme aid and that's how the virus
accesses this coding sequence so they're

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:50.250
accesses this coding sequence so they're
 

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:54.410
accesses this coding sequence so they're
cut to two kinds of suppressions

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.420
cut to two kinds of suppressions
 

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.020

that recognize these three termination

00:44:59.810 --> 00:44:59.820
that recognize these three termination
 

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.550
that recognize these three termination
codons and they put in a specific amino

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:01.560
codons and they put in a specific amino
 

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.530
codons and they put in a specific amino
acid so for example there is a

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:03.540
acid so for example there is a
 

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.020
acid so for example there is a
suppressor tRNA that will recognize the

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:06.030
suppressor tRNA that will recognize the
 

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:09.020
suppressor tRNA that will recognize the

Terminator UGA it puts Celino cysteine
 

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:11.900
Terminator UGA it puts Celino cysteine
in a rare amino acid and then there are

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:11.910
in a rare amino acid and then there are
 

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:12.829
in a rare amino acid and then there are
normal TR and

the gag and Pol are in two different

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:35.190
the gag and Pol are in two different
 

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:38.359
the gag and Pol are in two different
reading frames which overlap so how do

00:45:38.359 --> 00:45:38.369
reading frames which overlap so how do
 

00:45:38.369 --> 00:45:40.969
reading frames which overlap so how do
you get both proteins made well you have

00:45:40.969 --> 00:45:40.979
you get both proteins made well you have
 

00:45:40.979 --> 00:45:43.219
you get both proteins made well you have
in fact in infected cells you get gag

00:45:43.219 --> 00:45:43.229
in fact in infected cells you get gag
 

00:45:43.229 --> 00:45:45.739
in fact in infected cells you get gag
made and you get a gag Paul fusion and

00:45:45.739 --> 00:45:45.749
made and you get a gag Paul fusion and
 

00:45:45.749 --> 00:45:48.769
made and you get a gag Paul fusion and
the back gag Paul fusion can be cleaved

00:45:48.769 --> 00:45:48.779
the back gag Paul fusion can be cleaved
 

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:50.870
the back gag Paul fusion can be cleaved
by a protease to release the polymerase

00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880
by a protease to release the polymerase
 

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.019
by a protease to release the polymerase
this is made by ribosomal frame shifting

00:45:54.019 --> 00:45:54.029
this is made by ribosomal frame shifting
 

00:45:54.029 --> 00:45:57.589
this is made by ribosomal frame shifting
basically the ribosomes 5 to 10% of the

00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599
basically the ribosomes 5 to 10% of the
 

00:45:57.599 --> 00:46:01.519
basically the ribosomes 5 to 10% of the
time they reach the end of gag they back

00:46:01.519 --> 00:46:01.529
time they reach the end of gag they back
 

00:46:01.529 --> 00:46:04.519
time they reach the end of gag they back
up a base and shift to another reading

00:46:04.519 --> 00:46:04.529
up a base and shift to another reading
 

00:46:04.529 --> 00:46:07.190
up a base and shift to another reading
frame so they glue they shift in this

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200
frame so they glue they shift in this
 

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.529
frame so they glue they shift in this
case to the minus 1 reading frame and

00:46:09.529 --> 00:46:09.539
case to the minus 1 reading frame and
 

00:46:09.539 --> 00:46:11.690
case to the minus 1 reading frame and
now they can translate the Paul gene

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:11.700
now they can translate the Paul gene
 

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.549
now they can translate the Paul gene
which is in the minus 1 frame with

00:46:13.549 --> 00:46:13.559
which is in the minus 1 frame with
 

00:46:13.559 --> 00:46:15.859
which is in the minus 1 frame with
respect to the gag that's why it's

00:46:15.859 --> 00:46:15.869
respect to the gag that's why it's
 

00:46:15.869 --> 00:46:18.380
respect to the gag that's why it's
called the ribosomal frame shifting ok

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:18.390
called the ribosomal frame shifting ok
 

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:21.109
called the ribosomal frame shifting ok
that's another way to make a protein

00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119
that's another way to make a protein
 

00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:22.819
that's another way to make a protein
that you normally can't access and

00:46:22.819 --> 00:46:22.829
that you normally can't access and
 

00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:26.209
that you normally can't access and
here's here's how this happens here

00:46:26.209 --> 00:46:26.219
here's here's how this happens here
 

00:46:26.219 --> 00:46:29.359
here's here's how this happens here
these frame shiftings usually happen at

00:46:29.359 --> 00:46:29.369
these frame shiftings usually happen at
 

00:46:29.369 --> 00:46:32.089
these frame shiftings usually happen at
a what's called a slippery sequence it

00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.099
a what's called a slippery sequence it
 

00:46:32.099 --> 00:46:35.380
a what's called a slippery sequence it
has a lot of ease and use so the

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:35.390
has a lot of ease and use so the
 

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:39.559
has a lot of ease and use so the
ribosome gets somewhat confused so here

00:46:39.559 --> 00:46:39.569
ribosome gets somewhat confused so here
 

00:46:39.569 --> 00:46:42.499
ribosome gets somewhat confused so here
you have our normal reading of of this

00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:42.509
you have our normal reading of of this
 

00:46:42.509 --> 00:46:47.269
you have our normal reading of of this
triplet this uua but now the trna slips

00:46:47.269 --> 00:46:47.279
triplet this uua but now the trna slips
 

00:46:47.279 --> 00:46:49.789
triplet this uua but now the trna slips
back one so we've gone here to minus 1

00:46:49.789 --> 00:46:49.799
back one so we've gone here to minus 1
 

00:46:49.799 --> 00:46:51.739
back one so we've gone here to minus 1
we're back 1 so now you see this a is

00:46:51.739 --> 00:46:51.749
we're back 1 so now you see this a is
 

00:46:51.749 --> 00:46:53.450
we're back 1 so now you see this a is
basically this u is base paired with

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:53.460
basically this u is base paired with
 

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:58.099
basically this u is base paired with
this a here and then then the next

00:46:58.099 --> 00:46:58.109
this a here and then then the next
 

00:46:58.109 --> 00:47:00.170
this a here and then then the next
triplet to be recognized is going to be

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:00.180
triplet to be recognized is going to be
 

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:03.859
triplet to be recognized is going to be
a UA instead of you a G which in this

00:47:03.859 --> 00:47:03.869
a UA instead of you a G which in this
 

00:47:03.869 --> 00:47:05.959
a UA instead of you a G which in this
case would be a terminator so now you

00:47:05.959 --> 00:47:05.969
case would be a terminator so now you
 

00:47:05.969 --> 00:47:08.660
case would be a terminator so now you
start and you continue the protein so

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:08.670
start and you continue the protein so
 

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:11.089
start and you continue the protein so
the next codon that will be read is not

00:47:11.089 --> 00:47:11.099
the next codon that will be read is not
 

00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:13.309
the next codon that will be read is not
a terminator it's it's an insertion of

00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319
a terminator it's it's an insertion of
 

00:47:13.319 --> 00:47:15.349
a terminator it's it's an insertion of
an amino acid so you've slipped back to

00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359
an amino acid so you've slipped back to
 

00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:17.359
an amino acid so you've slipped back to
the minus 1 frame and now you can access

00:47:17.359 --> 00:47:17.369
the minus 1 frame and now you can access
 

00:47:17.369 --> 00:47:19.219
the minus 1 frame and now you can access
the rest of that open reading frame so

00:47:19.219 --> 00:47:19.229
the rest of that open reading frame so
 

00:47:19.229 --> 00:47:21.440
the rest of that open reading frame so
it's a very simple minus 1 slippage

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:21.450
it's a very simple minus 1 slippage
 

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:24.739
it's a very simple minus 1 slippage
right here ribosomal frame shifting ok

00:47:24.739 --> 00:47:24.749
right here ribosomal frame shifting ok
 

00:47:24.749 --> 00:47:26.690
right here ribosomal frame shifting ok
so those are a couple of ways that

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:26.700
so those are a couple of ways that
 

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.780
so those are a couple of ways that
viruses can make many proteins from one

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:29.790
viruses can make many proteins from one
 

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:32.120
viruses can make many proteins from one
messenger RNA now the other issue I want

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:32.130
messenger RNA now the other issue I want
 

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:33.800
messenger RNA now the other issue I want
to talk about is the regulation of

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:33.810
to talk about is the regulation of
 

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:36.230
to talk about is the regulation of
translation in virus infected cells and

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240
translation in virus infected cells and
 

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.820
translation in virus infected cells and
as I said viruses want the entire

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:37.830
as I said viruses want the entire
 

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:40.640
as I said viruses want the entire
machinery dedicated to them they don't

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:40.650
machinery dedicated to them they don't
 

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:43.280
machinery dedicated to them they don't
want any cell proteins main and here's

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:43.290
want any cell proteins main and here's
 

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:46.930
want any cell proteins main and here's
one example of how viruses achieve that

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:46.940
one example of how viruses achieve that
 

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:49.910
one example of how viruses achieve that
so this is the initiation step which we

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920
so this is the initiation step which we
 

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:54.340
so this is the initiation step which we
talked about here is the 40s subunit

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:54.350
talked about here is the 40s subunit
 

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:56.930
talked about here is the 40s subunit
attached to the RNA and here's the

00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:56.940
attached to the RNA and here's the
 

00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:00.560
attached to the RNA and here's the
ternary complex the Met tRNA ëif to gtp

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:00.570
ternary complex the Met tRNA ëif to gtp
 

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:03.350
ternary complex the Met tRNA ëif to gtp
and now that met tRNA is sitting down on

00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:03.360
and now that met tRNA is sitting down on
 

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.720
and now that met tRNA is sitting down on
the Aug codon so remember I told you at

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:05.730
the Aug codon so remember I told you at
 

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:10.190
the Aug codon so remember I told you at
that step gtp is hydrolyzed to GDP a TI

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200
that step gtp is hydrolyzed to GDP a TI
 

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.190
that step gtp is hydrolyzed to GDP a TI
f2 is released all right this is a very

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200
f2 is released all right this is a very
 

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.560
f2 is released all right this is a very
important factor this ëif too because

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:15.570
important factor this ëif too because
 

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:17.300
important factor this ëif too because
what it has to do eventually is pick up

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:17.310
what it has to do eventually is pick up
 

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:20.480
what it has to do eventually is pick up
more met tRNA and do another round of

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:20.490
more met tRNA and do another round of
 

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:23.900
more met tRNA and do another round of
initiation but in order to do this to

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:23.910
initiation but in order to do this to
 

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:25.670
initiation but in order to do this to
pick up another tRNA and make a ternary

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680
pick up another tRNA and make a ternary
 

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:29.000
pick up another tRNA and make a ternary
complex the GDP has to be exchanged for

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:29.010
complex the GDP has to be exchanged for
 

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:31.760
complex the GDP has to be exchanged for
gtp because GDP won't work can't be

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:31.770
gtp because GDP won't work can't be
 

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:33.800
gtp because GDP won't work can't be
hydrolyzed to release the energy that's

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:33.810
hydrolyzed to release the energy that's
 

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.930
hydrolyzed to release the energy that's
needed so there's a second protein

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:35.940
needed so there's a second protein
 

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:38.960
needed so there's a second protein
called ëif 2b which binds this ëif to

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:38.970
called ëif 2b which binds this ëif to
 

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:42.770
called ëif 2b which binds this ëif to
gdp and exchanges the gdp for GTP

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:42.780
gdp and exchanges the gdp for GTP
 

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:44.750
gdp and exchanges the gdp for GTP
so it's basically a guanine exchange

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760
so it's basically a guanine exchange
 

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.830
so it's basically a guanine exchange
factor now we have GIF to with GTP and

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:48.840
factor now we have GIF to with GTP and
 

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.210
factor now we have GIF to with GTP and
it can go through this whole sequence

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:50.220
it can go through this whole sequence
 

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:53.390
it can go through this whole sequence
again ok now in cells there is a

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400
again ok now in cells there is a
 

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:56.720
again ok now in cells there is a
mechanism to regulate this in this

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:56.730
mechanism to regulate this in this
 

00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:59.990
mechanism to regulate this in this
pathway and it involves phosphorylation

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000
pathway and it involves phosphorylation
 

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.570
pathway and it involves phosphorylation
of ëif 2 we'll talk about how that

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:02.580
of ëif 2 we'll talk about how that
 

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.240
of ëif 2 we'll talk about how that
happens in a moment basically ëif 2 is

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:05.250
happens in a moment basically ëif 2 is
 

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:06.710
happens in a moment basically ëif 2 is
phosphorylated you can see right here

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720
phosphorylated you can see right here
 

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.200
phosphorylated you can see right here
under certain conditions when that

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:09.210
under certain conditions when that
 

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:12.470
under certain conditions when that
happens it binds very tightly to ëif to

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480
happens it binds very tightly to ëif to
 

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.680
happens it binds very tightly to ëif to
B and it doesn't get released at this

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:15.690
B and it doesn't get released at this
 

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:19.670
B and it doesn't get released at this
step so you eventually soak up all the

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680
step so you eventually soak up all the
 

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.740
step so you eventually soak up all the
ëif to be in the cell which happens to

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:21.750
ëif to be in the cell which happens to
 

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:23.810
ëif to be in the cell which happens to
be limiting and you can't get anymore

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:23.820
be limiting and you can't get anymore
 

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:27.350
be limiting and you can't get anymore
recycling of this e is 2 and translation

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:27.360
recycling of this e is 2 and translation
 

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:30.590
recycling of this e is 2 and translation
stops alright so in fact this is a

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:30.600
stops alright so in fact this is a
 

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.480
stops alright so in fact this is a
response of many cells to virus

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:32.490
response of many cells to virus
 

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:37.940
response of many cells to virus
infection they phosphorylate iif 2 with

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:37.950
infection they phosphorylate iif 2 with
 

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:40.130
infection they phosphorylate iif 2 with
the idea of halting virus infection and

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140
the idea of halting virus infection and
 

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:40.460
the idea of halting virus infection and
maybe

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:40.470
maybe
 

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:42.140
maybe
preventing spread of the virus to other

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:42.150
preventing spread of the virus to other
 

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:46.250
preventing spread of the virus to other
cells and that phosphorylation of VI f2

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:46.260
cells and that phosphorylation of VI f2
 

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:48.470
cells and that phosphorylation of VI f2
is carried out by a number of different

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480
is carried out by a number of different
 

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.810
is carried out by a number of different
protein kinases in cells they're called

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:50.820
protein kinases in cells they're called
 

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:54.200
protein kinases in cells they're called
ëif to alpha kinases one of them is

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:54.210

is involved in phosphorylating iif - and
 

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:08.000
is involved in phosphorylating iif - and
we're going to talk about p KR and perc

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:08.010
we're going to talk about p KR and perc
 

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:09.160
we're going to talk about p KR and perc
today

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:09.170
today
 

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:12.380
today
now the p KR response is an antiviral

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:12.390
now the p KR response is an antiviral
 

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:15.890
now the p KR response is an antiviral
response of the cell so on the left here

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:15.900
response of the cell so on the left here
 

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:18.790
response of the cell so on the left here
we have a cell being infected by a virus

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800
we have a cell being infected by a virus
 

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:22.520
we have a cell being infected by a virus
the cell senses that it's been infected

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:22.530
the cell senses that it's been infected
 

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:24.680
the cell senses that it's been infected
how it does so we'll talk about later on

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:24.690
how it does so we'll talk about later on
 

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:27.740
how it does so we'll talk about later on
and one of the responses to the presence

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:27.750
and one of the responses to the presence
 

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:30.680
and one of the responses to the presence
of virus in the cell is that the cell

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:30.690
of virus in the cell is that the cell
 

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:34.400
of virus in the cell is that the cell
makes interferon interferon is a protein

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:34.410
makes interferon interferon is a protein
 

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:36.200
makes interferon interferon is a protein
a series of proteins that are involved

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:36.210
a series of proteins that are involved
 

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:38.480
a series of proteins that are involved
in establishing an antiviral state in

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:38.490
in establishing an antiviral state in
 

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:41.690
in establishing an antiviral state in
cells these interferon molecules that

00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:41.700
cells these interferon molecules that
 

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:44.000
cells these interferon molecules that
are made come out of the cell and they

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:44.010
are made come out of the cell and they
 

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:46.339
are made come out of the cell and they
bind to interferon receptors on the cell

00:50:46.339 --> 00:50:46.349
bind to interferon receptors on the cell
 

00:50:46.349 --> 00:50:48.440
bind to interferon receptors on the cell
surface and they then induced the

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:48.450
surface and they then induced the
 

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:50.570
surface and they then induced the
synthesis of a number of proteins that

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:50.580
synthesis of a number of proteins that
 

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:52.460
synthesis of a number of proteins that
have antiviral properties and one of

00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:52.470
have antiviral properties and one of
 

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:55.520
have antiviral properties and one of
those proteins is PK r which is the

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:55.530
those proteins is PK r which is the
 

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:59.150
those proteins is PK r which is the
kinase that phosphorylates EEI f2 and so

00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160
kinase that phosphorylates EEI f2 and so
 

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.339
kinase that phosphorylates EEI f2 and so
when cells are infected the cells

00:51:01.339 --> 00:51:01.349
when cells are infected the cells
 

00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:03.920
when cells are infected the cells
respond by producing this protein which

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:03.930
respond by producing this protein which
 

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:07.670
respond by producing this protein which
is engineered to stop translation and

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680
is engineered to stop translation and
 

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:12.950
is engineered to stop translation and
stop the infection now the way that this

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960
stop the infection now the way that this
 

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:16.490
stop the infection now the way that this
works is that PKA Aras is normally

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:16.500
works is that PKA Aras is normally
 

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.320
works is that PKA Aras is normally
present at a very low level when it is

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:18.330
present at a very low level when it is
 

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:21.890
present at a very low level when it is
produced it needs to be activated so the

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:21.900
produced it needs to be activated so the
 

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.720
produced it needs to be activated so the
mRNA is induced by interferon it has to

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:23.730
mRNA is induced by interferon it has to
 

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:25.400
mRNA is induced by interferon it has to
be activated before it can phosphorylate

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:25.410
be activated before it can phosphorylate
 

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:29.030
be activated before it can phosphorylate
ëif 2 and what we think happens is when

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040
ëif 2 and what we think happens is when
 

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.460
ëif 2 and what we think happens is when
viruses infect cells most of them

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:31.470
viruses infect cells most of them
 

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:33.680
viruses infect cells most of them
produce double-stranded RNA the

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:33.690
produce double-stranded RNA the
 

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:36.440
produce double-stranded RNA the
double-stranded RNA will will bind to PK

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:36.450
double-stranded RNA will will bind to PK
 

00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:38.960
double-stranded RNA will will bind to PK
R which is shown here this this purple

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:38.970
R which is shown here this this purple
 

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:41.920
R which is shown here this this purple
orange brown molecule this is PK are

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:41.930
orange brown molecule this is PK are
 

00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:44.540
orange brown molecule this is PK are
multiple molecules of PK are bind the

00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:44.550
multiple molecules of PK are bind the
 

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:46.760
multiple molecules of PK are bind the
RNA and they phosphorylate each other

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:46.770
RNA and they phosphorylate each other
 

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:50.329
RNA and they phosphorylate each other
and that activates the kinase so PK R is

00:51:50.329 --> 00:51:50.339
and that activates the kinase so PK R is
 

00:51:50.339 --> 00:51:52.370
and that activates the kinase so PK R is
not active as it's produced it has to

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:52.380
not active as it's produced it has to
 

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:53.870
not active as it's produced it has to
bind double stranded RNA

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880
bind double stranded RNA
 

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.060
bind double stranded RNA
in order to be activated so that it can

00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:56.070
in order to be activated so that it can
 

00:51:56.070 --> 00:52:01.700
in order to be activated so that it can
then go on to phosphorylate gif too so

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:01.710
then go on to phosphorylate gif too so
 

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:05.690
then go on to phosphorylate gif too so
PKR is induced and activated by virus

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700
PKR is induced and activated by virus
 

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:08.210
PKR is induced and activated by virus
infected it is induced by interferon and

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:08.220
infected it is induced by interferon and
 

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:10.910
infected it is induced by interferon and
it is in a it is activated by the

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:10.920
it is in a it is activated by the
 

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.790
it is in a it is activated by the
presence of double-stranded RNA and its

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:13.800
presence of double-stranded RNA and its
 

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.370
presence of double-stranded RNA and its
activation leads to the inhibition of

00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.380
activation leads to the inhibition of
 

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:19.670
activation leads to the inhibition of
host translation it is also a activator

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680
host translation it is also a activator
 

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.870
host translation it is also a activator
of apoptosis

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880
of apoptosis
 

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.600
of apoptosis
now viruses don't like this right they

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:23.610
now viruses don't like this right they
 

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:25.310
now viruses don't like this right they
don't want translation to be shut down

00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:25.320
don't want translation to be shut down
 

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.320
don't want translation to be shut down
because they cannot make their viral

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:27.330
because they cannot make their viral
 

00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:30.230
because they cannot make their viral
proteins so they have evolved almost

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240
proteins so they have evolved almost
 

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.300
proteins so they have evolved almost
every virus has involved some mechanism

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:32.310
every virus has involved some mechanism
 

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:35.180
every virus has involved some mechanism
to evade this PKR pathway so that tells

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:35.190
to evade this PKR pathway so that tells
 

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:37.400
to evade this PKR pathway so that tells
you right away how important this is I'm

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:37.410
you right away how important this is I'm
 

00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:38.720
you right away how important this is I'm
going to show you one of them and that's

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:38.730
going to show you one of them and that's
 

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:42.380
going to show you one of them and that's
a small RNA made by adenovirus this is a

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:42.390
a small RNA made by adenovirus this is a
 

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:45.290
a small RNA made by adenovirus this is a
big double-stranded DNA virus this RNA

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:45.300
big double-stranded DNA virus this RNA
 

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:48.260
big double-stranded DNA virus this RNA
is called va1 RNA it's rather short and

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:48.270
is called va1 RNA it's rather short and
 

00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:51.590
is called va1 RNA it's rather short and
its function is to prevent activation of

00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:51.600
its function is to prevent activation of
 

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.340
its function is to prevent activation of
PKR

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:52.350
PKR
 

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:56.060
PKR
so what happens is again remember PKR is

have an iris they don't need a cap so

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:01.250
have an iris they don't need a cap so
 

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:04.599
have an iris they don't need a cap so
they don't care and in fact 4G still can

look at the rate of protein synthesis
you see it declines initially very

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:20.540
you see it declines initially very
 

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:23.530
you see it declines initially very
rapidly so this is inhibition of cell

01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:23.540
rapidly so this is inhibition of cell
 

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:26.079
rapidly so this is inhibition of cell
translation and then it is replaced with

01:00:26.079 --> 01:00:26.089
translation and then it is replaced with
 

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:28.930
translation and then it is replaced with
viral protein synthesis and then the

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:28.940
viral protein synthesis and then the
 

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:32.109

there are two kinds of ëif 4g in cells

01:01:49.509 --> 01:01:49.519
there are two kinds of ëif 4g in cells
 

01:01:49.519 --> 01:01:52.539
there are two kinds of ëif 4g in cells
the if4 g1 and - and you can see they

01:01:52.539 --> 01:01:52.549
the if4 g1 and - and you can see they
 

01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:56.620
the if4 g1 and - and you can see they
are both cleaved during infection

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:56.630
are both cleaved during infection
 

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.960
are both cleaved during infection
this one is cleaved starting at about an

01:01:58.960 --> 01:01:58.970
this one is cleaved starting at about an
 

01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:01.599
this one is cleaved starting at about an
hour in 15 minutes this one is cleaved

01:02:01.599 --> 01:02:01.609
hour in 15 minutes this one is cleaved
 

01:02:01.609 --> 01:02:03.430
hour in 15 minutes this one is cleaved
around 2 hours and 15 minutes so

01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440
around 2 hours and 15 minutes so
 

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.559
around 2 hours and 15 minutes so
actually the cleavage of 4 g2 really

01:02:05.559 --> 01:02:05.569
actually the cleavage of 4 g2 really
 

01:02:05.569 --> 01:02:07.269
actually the cleavage of 4 g2 really
correlates very nicely with the shut off

01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:07.279
correlates very nicely with the shut off
 

01:02:07.279 --> 01:02:11.229
correlates very nicely with the shut off
so again that's the protein that it is

01:02:11.229 --> 01:02:11.239
so again that's the protein that it is
 

01:02:11.239 --> 01:02:13.059
so again that's the protein that it is
cleaved right here near the N terminus

01:02:13.059 --> 01:02:13.069
cleaved right here near the N terminus
 

01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:15.069
cleaved right here near the N terminus
so cell messages can't be translated

01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:15.079
so cell messages can't be translated
 

01:02:15.079 --> 01:02:18.130
so cell messages can't be translated
because the ribosome can't be recruited

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:18.140
because the ribosome can't be recruited
 

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:20.979
because the ribosome can't be recruited
to the captain RNAs so that's the basis

01:02:20.979 --> 01:02:20.989
to the captain RNAs so that's the basis
 

01:02:20.989 --> 01:02:22.239
to the captain RNAs so that's the basis
for that so again it's shown

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:22.249
for that so again it's shown
 

01:02:22.249 --> 01:02:24.009
for that so again it's shown
diagrammatically here

01:02:24.009 --> 01:02:24.019

rnas can
 

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.580

which suggest that the formation of a

step or the 60s joining stage now you
 

01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:45.490

can see that this is possible because if

01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:45.500
can see that this is possible because if

suggested that would bring the micro

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:50.270
suggested that would bring the micro
 

01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:52.690
suggested that would bring the micro
RNAs down to the three prime and to the

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:52.700
RNAs down to the three prime and to the
 

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:56.350
RNAs down to the three prime and to the
five prime end so that would repress

01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:56.360
five prime end so that would repress
 

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:59.470

initiation here there's also some idea

01:05:59.470 --> 01:05:59.480

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:01.270

that the micro arm piece can actually

about the regulation of the elongation

01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:05.480
about the regulation of the elongation
 

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.930
about the regulation of the elongation
step at all just the initiation step but

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:07.940
step at all just the initiation step but
 

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:10.600
step at all just the initiation step but
there is regulation at that step and

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:10.610
there is regulation at that step and
 

01:06:10.610 --> 01:06:13.570
there is regulation at that step and
perhaps micro rna's caused the ribosomes

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:13.580
perhaps micro rna's caused the ribosomes
 

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:15.730
perhaps micro rna's caused the ribosomes
to drop off at a higher rate so that's

01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:15.740
to drop off at a higher rate so that's
 

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:17.530
to drop off at a higher rate so that's
how they might impact translation and of

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:17.540
how they might impact translation and of
 

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.720
how they might impact translation and of
course the other part which we're not

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:19.730
course the other part which we're not
 

01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:21.550
course the other part which we're not
talking about is that they would degrade

01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:21.560
talking about is that they would degrade
 

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:24.610
talking about is that they would degrade
the mRNAs directly so I just want to

how micro rnas play into virus
 

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:33.430
how micro rnas play into virus
infections and again remember there are

01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440
infections and again remember there are
 

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:37.210
infections and again remember there are
both viral mRNAs and there are cellular

01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:37.220
both viral mRNAs and there are cellular
 

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:39.700
both viral mRNAs and there are cellular
cellular micro RNAs which have different

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:39.710
cellular micro RNAs which have different
 

01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:42.970
cellular micro RNAs which have different
roles so here's an example of a cellular

01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:42.980

replication so Hep C is hepatic tropic

01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280
replication so Hep C is hepatic tropic
 

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.190

it doesn't replicate anywhere else as
far as we know and this is probably

01:06:58.930 --> 01:06:58.940
far as we know and this is probably
 

01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:01.300
far as we know and this is probably
because mirror is a liver specific micro

in the cell that are anti viral and they
 

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.020
in the cell that are anti viral and they
can either target viral genes so they

can either target viral genes so they
 

01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:42.640
can either target viral genes so they
can you can have a cellular Mir that

would inhibit the production of a viral

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:45.230
would inhibit the production of a viral
 

01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:47.710
would inhibit the production of a viral
protein and inhibit viral replication or

cellular mirrors are actually reducing
the expression of those cellular genes

the expression of those cellular genes
 

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.260
the expression of those cellular genes
that are needed for the virus and that

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:01.270
that are needed for the virus and that
 

01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:05.140
that are needed for the virus and that
reduces virus replication so those are

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:05.150
reduces virus replication so those are
 

01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:07.270
reduces virus replication so those are
cellular mirrors that have some role we

01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:07.280
cellular mirrors that have some role we
 

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.460
cellular mirrors that have some role we
have a positive effect on virus

have a positive effect on virus
 

01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:11.589
have a positive effect on virus
replication than some mirrors inhibit

01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599
replication than some mirrors inhibit
 

01:08:11.599 --> 01:08:14.830
replication than some mirrors inhibit
virus replication and then we have virus

01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:14.840
virus replication and then we have virus
 

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:18.760

viruses as you can see some controversy

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:31.370
viruses as you can see some controversy
 

01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:33.729
viruses as you can see some controversy
about whether there they really exist in

01:08:33.729 --> 01:08:33.739
about whether there they really exist in
 

01:08:33.739 --> 01:08:36.970
about whether there they really exist in
retroviruses or not but these appear to

retroviruses or not but these appear to
 

01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:40.059
retroviruses or not but these appear to
have a variety of effects during

infection many of them block apoptosis
 

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.220
infection many of them block apoptosis
so programmed cell death is a response

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:45.230
so programmed cell death is a response
 

01:08:45.230 --> 01:08:47.800
so programmed cell death is a response
of cells to virus infection the cell

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:47.810
of cells to virus infection the cell
 

01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:50.110
of cells to virus infection the cell

wants to die so that viruses cannot be
 

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.809
wants to die so that viruses cannot be
produced so there are many in a virus of

01:08:55.190 --> 01:08:57.789
course doesn't like that especially
viruses with long replication cycles the

01:08:57.789 --> 01:08:57.799
viruses with long replication cycles the
 

01:08:57.799 --> 01:09:00.130
viruses with long replication cycles the
virus does not want apoptosis to occur

01:09:00.130 --> 01:09:00.140
virus does not want apoptosis to occur
 

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:03.729
virus does not want apoptosis to occur
so these mirrors block apoptosis that is

01:09:03.729 --> 01:09:03.739
so these mirrors block apoptosis that is
 

01:09:03.739 --> 01:09:05.410
so these mirrors block apoptosis that is
their function that produced from the

01:09:05.410 --> 01:09:05.420
their function that produced from the
 

01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:07.780
their function that produced from the
virus genome and they block apoptosis

01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:07.790
virus genome and they block apoptosis
 

01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:10.090
virus genome and they block apoptosis
there are also examples of mirrors that

01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:10.100
there are also examples of mirrors that
 

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:13.780
there are also examples of mirrors that
block immune responses which we may hear

01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:13.790
block immune responses which we may hear
 

01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:19.059
block immune responses which we may hear
about from dr. Silverstein many cells go

01:09:19.059 --> 01:09:19.069
about from dr. Silverstein many cells go
 

01:09:19.069 --> 01:09:20.740
about from dr. Silverstein many cells go
into cell cycle arrest when they are

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:20.750
into cell cycle arrest when they are
 

01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:23.349
into cell cycle arrest when they are
infected and remember DNA viruses need

01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359
infected and remember DNA viruses need
 

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.420
infected and remember DNA viruses need
that DNA replication machinery to be

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:25.430
that DNA replication machinery to be
 

01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:27.789
that DNA replication machinery to be
active so the mirrors prevent the cell

01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799
active so the mirrors prevent the cell
 

01:09:27.799 --> 01:09:30.640
active so the mirrors prevent the cell
cycle arrest and many others promote

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:30.650
cycle arrest and many others promote
 

01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:33.999
cycle arrest and many others promote
latency of viruses the ability to remain

01:09:33.999 --> 01:09:34.009
latency of viruses the ability to remain
 

01:09:34.009 --> 01:09:36.700
latency of viruses the ability to remain
with the cell for long periods so these

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:36.710
with the cell for long periods so these
 

01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:39.880
with the cell for long periods so these
are pretty new areas of research and

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:39.890
are pretty new areas of research and
 

01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:40.809
are pretty new areas of research and
this is

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:40.819
this is
 

01:09:40.819 --> 01:09:42.729
this is
going to be explored really in an

01:09:42.729 --> 01:09:42.739
going to be explored really in an
 

01:09:42.739 --> 01:09:44.919
going to be explored really in an
interesting way in coming years how

01:09:44.919 --> 01:09:44.929
interesting way in coming years how
 

01:09:44.929 --> 01:09:47.979
interesting way in coming years how
these viral and cellular mirrors have an

01:09:47.979 --> 01:09:47.989
these viral and cellular mirrors have an
 

01:09:47.989 --> 01:09:50.620
these viral and cellular mirrors have an
interplay and how they result in either

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:50.630
interplay and how they result in either
 

01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:52.809
interplay and how they result in either
an infection or not this is something we

01:09:52.809 --> 01:09:52.819
an infection or not this is something we
 

01:09:52.819 --> 01:10:03.280
an infection or not this is something we
didn't even know about five years ago

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:03.290
 

01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:05.350
