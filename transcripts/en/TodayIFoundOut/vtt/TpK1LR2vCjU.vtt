00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:07.130
Myth: Injecting medicine straight into your
heart can be beneficial in some way.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.719
Ah, the dramatic scene that ends with an actor
stabbing a needle straight into their heart,

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.750
narrowly escaping death and magically curing
whatever ailment just befell them.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.410
While very dramatic, it’s also very untrue
and an exceptionally bad idea if your goal

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.050
is to get better.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.260
In the end, it doesn’t matter whether or
not the medication attempting to be delivered

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.540
would actually work in the described situations;
this myth comes down to one thing: if you

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.680
stick a needle in your heart, you will bleed
to death from the small hole you just placed

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.680
there.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.730
Just like a balloon, if you put a hole in
it, it’s really hard to keep the air from

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.730
escaping.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.520
The other problem with this method of delivery
is your lungs.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.650
The chances of you putting a hole in one of
them, as well as your heart, is pretty good.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.220
Not only would you be bleeding to death, you
would be really short of breath while you

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.740
slowly died.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.850
The truth is that there are much easier ways
to get medication to your heart.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.990
Medication requiring a needle has two options
that are much better than a hole in your heart.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.110
The preferred method is starting an IV and
giving it to the person through their veins.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.640
Considering most people have their entire
blood volume pumped throughout their body

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.710
in about a minute (depending on a person’s
heart rate and left ventricular ejection fraction),

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.990
medication delivered this way would reach
the heart rather quickly.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.880
If you can’t get the medication in a vein,
numerous types can simply be placed in any

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.080
muscle group and have it reach your heart
in under 5 minutes.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.860
Currently, there is no treatment in modern
medicine that requires a doctor to stick a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.500
needle into your heart.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.570
The closest is called a pericardiocentesis.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.560
This procedure involves a doctor sticking
a needle into the sac surrounding the heart

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.810
(pericardium), in an effort to remove excess
fluid that’s putting pressure on the heart

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.799
(cardiac tamponade).

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.810
They even take great care not to advance the
needle too far, causing it to rupture the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.920
heart itself.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.330
As they know, a hole in your heart is a bad
thing.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.240
While the method of medication delivery in
this myth is easily debunked, it does make

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.900
one wonder what else about this treatment
presented in movies is also false (or true).

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.420
Never to be one that leaves a person wondering,
let’s break apart arguably the two most

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.160
famous Hollywood scenes that used this treatment
and see if we can’t reveal some other interesting

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.170
facts while doing so.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.380
Scene #1- Pulp Fiction: In which John Travolta
needs to give an injection of “adrenaline”

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.560
straight into the heart of Uma Thurman’s
character, presumably altering the effects

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.050
of the heroin she just snorted, thinking it
was cocaine.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.140
After stabbing her heart, she immediately
wakes up and is completely fine.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.069
When a medical professional gives a person
an “adrenaline” shot, the medication in

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.700
question is called Epinephrine.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.170
Epinephrine has many uses in medicine, including
cardiac arrest, allergic reactions, asthma

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.730
attacks, and helping with acute low blood
pressures, to name a few.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.650
It’s a hormone and a neurotransmitter that
acts on several different types of nerve cells.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.120
The response involves the stimulation of your
“fight or flight” nervous system (sympathetic

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.290
nervous system).

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.680
While beneficial in many aspects, it’s usually
never given in a heroin overdose.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.050
Unless of course the person’s heart has
stopped, then maybe.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.930
Even in that situation, you would also need
to preform CPR and defibrillation (shocking)

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.440
to be helpful.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.590
Heroin is in a drug class called an opioid.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.900
Other opioids include codeine, morphine, oxycodone,
methadone, and fentanyl to name a few.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.130
(Aside: Heroin was originally marketed as
a non-addictive cough medicine by Bayer.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.130
You can learn more about this in Episode #182
of this podcast: When Heroin was Marketed

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.130
as a Cough Medicine)

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.870
In any event, one of the biggest problems
with these types of medications, and usually

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.700
the cause of the person’s death in an overdose,
is respiratory depression or failure.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.950
When the person takes too much, the person
can begin to breathe slower and shallower,

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.629
or stop breathing all together.

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.239
The heart will soon stop once this happens.

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.349
Giving a person epinephrine in this situation
wouldn’t help.

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.610
While theoretically you might get some respiratory
increase, although I can’t find any study

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.290
that shows this, epinephrine would wear off
long before the heroin, leaving the person

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.450
still dead.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.720
There is, however, a medication that can have
the same effect as adrenaline did in the movie.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.300
It’s called Naloxone.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.310
Developed in the 1960s, it’s known as an
opiate antagonist.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.489
It’s the drug of choice for treating any
opiate overdose.

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.780
When given, it will bind to the receptor site’s
opiate drugs do, in effect, knocking them

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.569
off the cells and not allowing the drug to
work its magic.

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.920
The effect is rather quick and nearly absolute.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.169
It can take a person from not breathing and
unconscious, to completely awake and “sober”

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.169
in about a minute.

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.729
There can, however, be some complications
from using it.

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.759
The drug itself doesn’t last as long as
an opiate does, so there is a chance the person

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.300
could stop breathing again.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.520
Due to the fact that the result is so absolute,
if the person is an addict, completely taking

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.029
away all of the effects of the opiate could
cause them to immediately go into withdrawals.

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:41.319
The results of those can be things like nausea,
vomiting, muscle cramps, diarrhea and seizures.

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.330
From the author of this piece’s personal
experience treating these types of overdoses,

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.169
he states that the two most common problems
are the person’s violence just after they

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.619
realize you took their “high” away, followed
almost immediately by them throwing up all

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:54.619
over you.

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:55.949
Don’t do drugs kids!

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.820
In the end, this movie had Uma Thurman’s
reaction to an antidote correct.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.930
They simply chose the wrong medication and
a completely wrong delivery method.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.219
Scene #2- The Rock: In which Nicholas Cage
has to inject Atropine straight into his heart

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:13.550
to counter the effects of VX poison gas.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.089
In this scene, the movie makers got most of
it right.

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:20.979
There is such a thing as VX poison gas and
part of the treatment for an exposure is Atropine.

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.970
VX is classified as a lethal nerve agent.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.639
Like most nerve agents, VX works by inhibiting
an enzyme called Cholinesterase.

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.099
The result is a build up of a neurotransmitter
called Acetylcholine within the body.

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.240
This build up causes an over-stimulation of
glands and muscles.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.240
The results are things like dilation of your
blood vessels, slower heart rates and constriction

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.740
of the bronchioles in your lungs.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.639
All of this happens while simultaneously you’re
subjected to what is known as SLUDGE- “SLUDGE”

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.830
being an acronym for excessive Salivation,
Urination, Defecation, Gastric irritation

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.129
and Emesis caused by exposure to the toxin.

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.029
If you become exposed, the toxin causes you
to stop breathing due to the over-stimulation

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:03.520
of your diaphragm (and many other muscles)-
all of this while leaking fluids from most

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.460
every orifice of your body.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.339
The treatment for this does include atropine.

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:09.939
It also includes a drug called Pralidoxime.

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:14.569
Pralidoxime helps by reversing the effect
on Cholinesterase thereby helping to reduce

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:17.029
the amount of Acetylcholine in the body.

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:22.210
Atropine helps by competing with Acetylcholine
at its receptor sites, reducing its affect.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.479
The recommended treatment for exposure to
this type of toxin includes the use of both.

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.129
The military, and some civilian emergency
services, use what is called a “Mark 1 kit”

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.369
that has both medications in an auto-injector.

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:37.889
No, it doesn’t inject anything in to the
heart for the aforementioned reasons.

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.990
The recommended sites are on the thighs and
hips.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.569
While this movie did get some of the treatment
right, it got the delivery method completely

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:49.849
wrong, but a gigantic needle to the heart
is certainly slightly more dramatic I suppose.

00:06:49.849 --> 00:07:04.039
Just don’t try that at home kids.
