00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.670
In the last video, we introduced
ourselves to the law of supply.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.630
And it was a fairly
common sense idea

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.370
that if we hold all else equal,
that if the price of something

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.270
goes up, there's more
incentive for more producers

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.250
to produce it or a given
producer to produce more of it.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.940
And we saw that.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.840
As the price goes up, we
moved along the supply curve,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.084
and the quantity
produced went up.

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:24.750
Now what I want to talk about in
this video is all of the things

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.340
we held equal in the last video.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.180
And the first of these, I'll
call this the price of inputs,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.300
or another way to think about
it is the cost of production.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.446
So if the price of inputs,
maybe the price of labor,

00:00:39.446 --> 00:00:41.320
the people who would
have to pick the grapes,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.310
or our fuel that we
need to transport

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.180
the grapes, or the land,
if any of that increased,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.220
that at a given price point,
we would make less money.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.470
There's less incentive
for us to do it,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.680
especially if this is
true only for grapes.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.550
Maybe we'll say,
OK, if it's now more

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.250
expensive to get
grape seeds, maybe

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.060
I'll start planting
something else,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.560
because I'm not getting as
much profit per pound of grape.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.960
So if the price of my inputs,
or if the price of my cost--

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.760
or if the size of my costs goes
up, at any given price point,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.820
I'd want to produce less.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.980
So if my price of inputs go
up, my supply, the supply,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.020
would go down.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.050
So if this becomes,
at this price point,

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.410
I'd make less money,
so I would produce less

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.950
or maybe I would
produce other things.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.450
So the whole supply curve
would shift to the left.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.130
And also even the
minimum price I

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.890
would need to supply
any of it would also

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.779
go up, when you shift
the curve to the left,

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:44.320
because now all of
a sudden, it costs

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.390
me more to produce
even that first unit.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.910
And likewise, if my
price of my inputs

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.160
went down, now all of a sudden
at any given price point,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.190
producing grapes would
become more profitable

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.810
and I would have more incentive
to maybe produce grapes

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.070
relative to other things
and use more land for grapes

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.280
than other things.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.490
And then you would have the
whole curve shift to the right.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.290
Now let's think
about related goods.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.680
So what happens with the
price of related goods.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.359
And we have to put our-- when we
think about this, we don't want

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.150
to think of it from a
demand point of view,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.608
because we're
talking about supply.

00:02:20.608 --> 00:02:23.310
You want to think about it from
the producer's point of view.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.170
So when we think about
related goods here,

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.950
we want to think about
substitutes for production.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.286
So maybe I'm a farmer--
and I know very little bit

00:02:30.286 --> 00:02:32.660
about farming, so I don't even
know if this is possible--

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.230
but maybe on my land, I'm
saying, well, some of my land

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.200
is going to be for
grapes and some of it

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.650
is going to be for blueberries.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.720
And so what would happen if
the price of a related good,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.130
in particular blueberries,
what would happen

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.190
if the price of
blueberries went up?

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.100
Well, if the price of
blueberries went up,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.130
then I would say, wow, maybe I
can do better with blueberries.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.010
And I would allocate
more of my land

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.300
to blueberries than to grapes.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.240
And so once again, the
price of related goods--

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.450
well, it depends
which related goods--

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.410
but if the price of
productive substitutes--

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.740
so price of other
things I could produce,

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.750
other things I can produce.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.270
If the price of other things
I can produce goes up,

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.770
then my supply of grapes,
once again, would go down.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.595
And the important thing is, is
in any of these circumstances--

00:03:29.595 --> 00:03:30.970
literally, just
think it through.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.678
Do not just look at
what I'm writing here

00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:35.800
and just try to memorize it
in some way, shape, or form.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.260
This is really just a way
to think about things.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.312
Hey, obviously, if I
can make more money off

00:03:41.312 --> 00:03:42.770
of blueberries now
all of a sudden,

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.311
I'm going to allocate
more of my land

00:03:44.311 --> 00:03:45.970
to blueberries than to grapes.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.820
Supply of grapes will go down.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.980
Now, let's think
about what happens

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.865
with the number of suppliers.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.790
And this one is
pretty common sense.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.160
The more people
they are supplying,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.330
the higher the supply would be.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.277
So if the number of
suppliers goes up-- and now

00:04:06.277 --> 00:04:08.110
you wouldn't imagine--
this is a curve maybe

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.745
for the aggregate supply.

00:04:09.745 --> 00:04:12.030
So if the number of
suppliers goes up,

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.760
then the aggregate supply would
go up at any given price point.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.029
If the number of
suppliers were to go down,

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.420
then the aggregate
supply would go down

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.120
at any given price point.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.310
So this one, hopefully,
is somewhat obvious.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.770
Then we could think about
things like technology.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.950
And so this is
just maybe, there's

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.120
some innovation,
some new type of seed

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.370
that with the same amount of
work, the same amount of land,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.430
can produce that
many more grapes.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.130
So if we have technological
improvements--

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.030
I'm assuming we're not going to
go into some type of dark ages.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.880
If we have technological
improvements,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:54.040
then that will also
make the supply go up.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.540
You can also think
of it as it might

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.710
make it cheaper to produce.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.210
So it's kind of the
same thing here.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.270
The price of inputs
might go down.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.036
So that would make
your supply go up.

00:05:02.036 --> 00:05:03.410
Or you could just
say, hey, look,

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.080
there's just going to be
more grapes popping off

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.000
of these new types
of vines that we got,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.772
so we're just going to
produce more grapes.

00:05:09.772 --> 00:05:11.230
And then the last
one, I'll cover--

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.820
and it's a little bit strange
in the grape analogy--

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.860
is the expected future prices.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.280
So the expected future
prices, price expectations.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.950
Now let's go away
from the grapes,

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.410
because grapes, they're
perishable goods, they go bad.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.130
It's not like you can save
goods to use them later.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.600
But if, let's say, you
are an oil producer.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.800
And oil is something you can
store and you can use it later.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.010
If you expected oil prices
to be neutral today, and then

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.070
tomorrow, all of
a sudden, you are

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.210
sure that oil prices are going
to go up in the future-- you're

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.870
sure that a year
from now, oil prices

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.720
are just going to go through the
roof-- what's your incentive?

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.440
Well, you should
hoard all of your oil.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.550
Do not sell it today and wait
to sell it in the future,

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.480
if you're sure that's
what's going to happen.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.450
If there's a change in
expected future prices--

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:14.170
so if you go from neutral to
expecting prices go up-- prices

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.801
go up in the future, then you're
going to hoard your goods.

00:06:17.801 --> 00:06:20.300
You can't hoard grapes, because
the grapes will just go bad.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.350
You might be able
to, I don't know,

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.930
turn them into
wine or something.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.590
But if we're talking
about something like oil,

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.210
you would say, hey,
why should I pump

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.320
all of the fixed amount
of oil in the ground

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.790
today to sell at
today's lower prices?

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.480
I'm going to lower
the supply today,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.280
so I can sell it in the future.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.610
So if the expected
future prices go

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.520
from neutral to you
expect future prices to go

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.420
up dramatically,
then current supply--

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.100
and that's, I'm just
going to emphasize

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.680
by writing the word current--
current supply will go down.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.272
So you can hoard it to
sell it in the future.
