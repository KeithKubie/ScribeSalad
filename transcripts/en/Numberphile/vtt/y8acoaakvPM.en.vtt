00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
SIMON PAMPENA: So, 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 ...

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.100
OK, two multiplied by itself five times is 32.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.660
So the opposite of that, is a question: What number multiplied by itself five times gives you 32?

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.460
And the way you express that, is that you go,  is 32 to the fifth.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.260
That's the fifth root.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.560
And that happens to be 2.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.040
So, because in mathematics, there's some beautiful patterns, there's actually a way

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.540
that you can work out the fifth root of very large numbers in your head very quickly.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.060
And you don't have to use a lot of computing power, brain power.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.360
So, Brady, if you take any double digit number you like, and multiply by itself

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.800
5 times

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.280
and you tell me that number, in English, from left to right,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.360
and I write it down, I will be able to tell you what your original number was.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.360
OK.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.720
OK, you got a number?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.340
BRADY HARAN: Yeah. SIMON PAMPENA: Is it big?

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.740
BRADY HARAN: Yeah, it's big. You ready?

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.060
It's 79 million — PAMPENA: Wait a minute. —

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.340
PAMPENA: 79 million. — HARAN: 235 thousand.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.780
PAMPENA: 235 thousand.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.780
HARAN: 168.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.200
PAMPENA: 168. (the number was 79,235,168)

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.980
So your number is 38?

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.380
HARAN: Well yes it is.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.760
PAMPENA: It is? — HARAN: It is.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.360
PAMPENA: OK. HARAN: Very good. [chuckles]

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.960
PAMPENA: How did I do it so quickly?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.860
I'm genius. [chuckles]

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.620
HARAN: We're gonna... [Both laugh.]

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.500
PAMPENA: Well, obviously not. I did it because there's a pattern in the numbers.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:57.520
OK? So... it's actually to do with a wonderful mathematician, Euler. This is Euler's Theorem.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.300
And I'm actually not going to write down what Euler's theorem is.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.160
I'm actually going to show you a result from Euler's Theorem.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.620
For any number, a.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:15.940
a^5, is equal to 10m+a for some m.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.400
So you can get that from Euler's Theorem.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.840
Now that's not the theorem itself, but I just want to cut to the chase here.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.340
So, what is, let's actually do an example. So let's do 47^5.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:40.200
Okay, so 47^5 — actually, we can write it as 22,934,496

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.700
times 10, + 47.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.880
So, if we expand this out, a number *10, you put a 0 on the end, right?

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.340
So it goes 229,344,960

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.420
+, and if we do what we do in primary school,

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.420
+47, look what you've got at the end.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:13.260
0+7=7. So what that means is, any number multiples by itself 5 times, the last digit

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.480
doesn't change.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.720
So for me to know what the last digit of your number was, I just have to wait to hear you say it.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.760
And then I write it down.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.980
OK?

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.460
The first digit? That's a bit harder.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.860
The first digit, you've got to memorize all the powers of the 10s, ^5.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.660
So, that's 100,000.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.720
20^5... is 3 million.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.940
30^5. There's that.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.960
40^5 is that.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.360
50^5 is that.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.000
60^5. That.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.580
80^5 is, uhh...

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.440
And 90^5.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.400
Now the interesting point here, is that these numbers, you can notice...

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.200
10-1, 20-2, 30-3, 40-4. See that? These numbers are all the same.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.000
Those — 5, 6 — They're the same as  that number there.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.640
And the reason why is because of that if you can think about it.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:30.480
So when you said the number, Brady — So you said 79 million — automatically I thought 79 million

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.860
So I know that's between 30^5, and 40^5. OK? —

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.000
And then you went on and did 235 thousand —

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.380
I had kind of tuned out at that stage. I wasn't really paying attention. Don't take it personally.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.960
I was just waiting for you to hist the jackpot at the end.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:57.020
So if you have someone who reads out the number, who's an accountant or something, or an engineer —

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.340
there's an engineer —

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.400
who just kinds of gives you a rough estimate, you're stuffed.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.600
HARAN: That's still a big ask to memorize all that.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.060
PAMPENA: Is it?

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.980
It didn't take me that long.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.760
You just have a feel for the numbers.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.060
It doesn't have to be that precise. —  HARAN: You just need to memorize the — PAMPENA: You just need to

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.240
know that it's anything between 3,000,000 and 24,000,000. You know, you don't have to be that precise.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.740
Anything that's greater than 100,000,000 and — You know, when I go to schools, if I do this for school kids, they

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:35.580
always pick something in the 90s. But the 90s is so easy, because it's anything greater than 6,000,000,000.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.880
So if they go, "8,000,000!!", you just go, "9."

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.680
And you just wait until they say the thing at the end.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.360
The hardest ones are actually down here.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.220
Down here.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.640
And it's actually hard in the transition.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:55.020
I had trouble quite a bit. Believe it or not, a lot kids love to do 69^5. And that one was hard,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:02.840
because it crossed over from 777 million up to 1.7 billion.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.280
That was a bit hard.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.480
But I got used to it.
