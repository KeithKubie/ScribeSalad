00:00:00.203 --> 00:00:01.881
- [Instructor] We've
learned a little bit already

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:04.618
about how a production
possibilities curve can be used

00:00:04.618 --> 00:00:07.130
to illustrate the concept
of economic growth.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.936
Let's review the definition
of economic growth.

00:00:08.936 --> 00:00:10.314
Then we're gonna go on to some more depth

00:00:10.314 --> 00:00:12.907
about the tradeoffs
that society faces today

00:00:12.907 --> 00:00:14.843
between the production of
different types of goods

00:00:14.843 --> 00:00:16.117
and how that can affect the level

00:00:16.117 --> 00:00:18.389
of economic growth in the future.

00:00:18.389 --> 00:00:21.844
You'll recall that
economic growth is defined

00:00:21.844 --> 00:00:24.345
as an increase in the ability of a nation

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:27.678
to produce goods and services over time.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.093
You've already learned that,

00:00:34.093 --> 00:00:36.451
in a production possibilities curve model,

00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:40.137
economic growth can be
illustrated as a shift outward

00:00:40.137 --> 00:00:42.824
in the nation's PPC over time.

00:00:42.824 --> 00:00:44.553
In the graph on our left here,

00:00:44.553 --> 00:00:45.822
economic growth would be shown

00:00:45.822 --> 00:00:48.669
as a shift from the white curve

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:50.361
to the pink curve.

00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:53.962
This represents an increase
in the ability of a nation

00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:58.102
to produce both the goods
shown on its PPC over time.

00:00:58.102 --> 00:00:59.342
The question we want to discuss is

00:00:59.342 --> 00:01:01.938
what are the sources of economic growth,

00:01:01.938 --> 00:01:03.729
and how does a nation's decision about

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.118
how to allocate its resources today

00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:09.672
affect its level of potential
output in the future?

00:01:09.672 --> 00:01:10.741
To help us answer this question,

00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:12.464
we're going to put some different goods

00:01:12.464 --> 00:01:15.118
on our production
possibilities curve here.

00:01:15.118 --> 00:01:16.552
And for today's lesson,

00:01:16.552 --> 00:01:19.759
we'll be looking at two types of goods.

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.123
The rubber ducky on the vertical axis

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:26.190
represents what we're going
to call consumer goods.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.879
We're gonna define these in just a moment,

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.626
but let's look down at
the horizontal axis first.

00:01:30.626 --> 00:01:32.582
The tractor here, it's a tool.

00:01:32.582 --> 00:01:35.079
This is a good that is used
to produce other goods.

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.669
It's used to produce
agricultural products,

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:38.140
which could be used to produce all sorts

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.906
of goods a society needs.

00:01:39.906 --> 00:01:42.238
A tractor and any other
tools like tractors

00:01:42.238 --> 00:01:44.415
are what we call capital goods.

00:01:44.415 --> 00:01:46.588
Let's define consumer
goods and capital goods

00:01:46.588 --> 00:01:49.526
before moving on with our analysis.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:52.214
Our rubber ducky in our
PPC is a consumer good.

00:01:52.214 --> 00:01:55.463
This is a good intended
to be sold to households.

00:01:55.463 --> 00:01:58.216
Consumer goods are used for consumption,

00:01:58.216 --> 00:02:02.049
and ultimately consumer
goods are disposed of.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.221
How does this contrast
with capital goods though?

00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:08.643
Capital goods are a bit different.

00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:10.893
Capital goods are any goods

00:02:11.773 --> 00:02:12.940
sold to firms.

00:02:15.563 --> 00:02:17.393
Capital goods, unlike consumer goods,

00:02:17.393 --> 00:02:20.060
are used to produce other goods.

00:02:21.678 --> 00:02:24.240
Therefore, if society
allocates more resources

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.205
towards capital goods today,

00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:28.065
society's essentially choosing

00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:30.823
to produce more goods and
services in the future

00:02:30.823 --> 00:02:32.048
and the tradeoff being less goods

00:02:32.048 --> 00:02:34.228
and services produced today.

00:02:34.228 --> 00:02:36.664
So let's look back at our white PPC here.

00:02:36.664 --> 00:02:38.573
Let's assume that this represents today's

00:02:38.573 --> 00:02:41.631
production possibilities
for a hypothetical country.

00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:45.670
A country can choose to produce
more consumer goods today.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.089
By doing so, it would
be producing at a point

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.022
such as point A.

00:02:50.022 --> 00:02:51.685
Notice that at point A,

00:02:51.685 --> 00:02:54.038
country is producing more rubber duckies,

00:02:54.038 --> 00:02:56.971
but the opportunity cost
is the capital goods

00:02:56.971 --> 00:03:00.061
of the tools that it could
be producing instead.

00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:02.827
Or society can choose to
allocate its resources

00:03:02.827 --> 00:03:04.809
at a point such as point B.

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.454
Allocating its resources
at point B means society

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:11.906
is choosing to produce
more capital goods today

00:03:11.906 --> 00:03:16.008
with the opportunity cost
being fewer consumer goods.

00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:20.866
Notice that if a country
were to move from point A

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.158
to point B,

00:03:22.158 --> 00:03:25.526
it would give up all these rubber duckies,

00:03:25.526 --> 00:03:29.091
all the toys, all the consumer goods

00:03:29.091 --> 00:03:30.723
that it could have
produced if it had chosen

00:03:30.723 --> 00:03:32.593
to produce at point A instead.

00:03:32.593 --> 00:03:37.347
So this is the opportunity
cost of producing at point B.

00:03:37.347 --> 00:03:40.464
Now, what if society moved
in the other direction

00:03:40.464 --> 00:03:44.552
and chose to produce more
consumer goods today?

00:03:44.552 --> 00:03:46.797
What if society went from point B

00:03:46.797 --> 00:03:48.295
to point A, in other words?

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:49.128
Well, in that case,

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:51.861
the opportunity cost
would be the capital goods

00:03:51.861 --> 00:03:53.472
that it could have enjoyed

00:03:53.472 --> 00:03:56.927
if it had chosen to produce at point B.

00:03:56.927 --> 00:03:57.970
The PPC, once again,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.623
illustrates this very basic
concept of opportunity cost.

00:04:00.623 --> 00:04:03.947
It shows us what is given up
in order to have anything.

00:04:03.947 --> 00:04:08.414
So let's do some analysis
over here of the consequences

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:12.491
of this country choosing
to produce at point A or

00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:15.164
choosing to produce at point B.

00:04:15.164 --> 00:04:18.049
What happens if society chooses
to allocate more resources

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.480
towards consumer goods today?

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.022
Essentially, what it's
choosing is current consumption

00:04:25.022 --> 00:04:26.772
of goods and services

00:04:27.895 --> 00:04:28.728
over

00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:31.711
future consumption.

00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:33.628
What do I mean by this?

00:04:37.054 --> 00:04:40.434
Essentially, by producing at point A,

00:04:40.434 --> 00:04:44.455
society is giving up
all those capital goods

00:04:44.455 --> 00:04:45.943
that could have been used

00:04:45.943 --> 00:04:48.914
to produce other goods in the future.

00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:50.393
Therefore, society is choosing

00:04:50.393 --> 00:04:52.718
a higher standard of living today,

00:04:52.718 --> 00:04:54.719
rather than a higher standard of living

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:56.574
sometime in the future.

00:04:56.574 --> 00:04:58.957
Let's contrast that with point B

00:04:58.957 --> 00:05:01.117
on our production possibilities curve.

00:05:01.117 --> 00:05:03.408
If society chooses to
allocate more resources

00:05:03.408 --> 00:05:05.283
towards capital goods today,

00:05:05.283 --> 00:05:08.450
society is choosing future consumption

00:05:11.775 --> 00:05:12.608
over

00:05:14.205 --> 00:05:15.872
current consumption.

00:05:18.716 --> 00:05:20.340
What do we mean by that?

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.506
By allocating more of its scarce resources

00:05:22.506 --> 00:05:25.991
towards capital goods and tools
and equipment and technology

00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:28.700
that can be used to
produce other goods today,

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.618
society is giving up
the current consumption

00:05:31.618 --> 00:05:33.935
that it could enjoy by producing more toys

00:05:33.935 --> 00:05:35.797
or consumer goods today.

00:05:35.797 --> 00:05:37.271
The benefit though,

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:40.525
the benefit of producing
more capital goods today

00:05:40.525 --> 00:05:42.108
is likely to be higher rates

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:44.307
of economic growth in the future.

00:05:44.307 --> 00:05:45.759
Why is that the case?

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.858
Because capital goods are those things

00:05:47.858 --> 00:05:50.079
which are used to produce other goods.

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:53.057
Capital is a factor of production.

00:05:53.057 --> 00:05:54.793
Consumer goods are not
a factor of production.

00:05:54.793 --> 00:05:56.650
Consumer goods are fun to consume.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.672
They're fun to enjoy.

00:05:57.672 --> 00:05:59.330
We love playing with our toys,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.236
but ultimately they get
consumed and thrown away.

00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:04.632
Capital goods aren't quickly disposed of.

00:06:04.632 --> 00:06:06.785
They instead are used in factories.

00:06:06.785 --> 00:06:08.100
They're used in the fields.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.359
They're used in the mines.

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:11.124
They're used in all the different ways

00:06:11.124 --> 00:06:13.301
that we produce goods and services

00:06:13.301 --> 00:06:15.575
that society benefits from.

00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:18.697
By allocating more resources
towards capital goods today,

00:06:18.697 --> 00:06:21.782
a country would be
choosing future consumption

00:06:21.782 --> 00:06:23.768
over current consumption.

00:06:23.768 --> 00:06:25.300
Now, to illustrate this concept,

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.975
we can look at some real-world data.

00:06:27.975 --> 00:06:31.243
What I'm about to show you is
some data for two countries

00:06:31.243 --> 00:06:33.369
that shows how those
countries are choosing

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:35.556
to allocate their resources today.

00:06:35.556 --> 00:06:38.389
We can then compare the
rates of economic growth

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:42.219
over the last 15 years to show
that one of those countries

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:46.279
has, in fact, experienced
higher rates of economic growth.

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:48.611
Let's look at our data first.

00:06:48.611 --> 00:06:52.950
Here we've got the output
data of two countries,

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.676
China on the left and the
United States on the right.

00:06:56.676 --> 00:06:59.067
What can we learn from this information?

00:06:59.067 --> 00:07:00.506
First, let's look at China.

00:07:00.506 --> 00:07:04.554
Notice that, in 2016, the year
for which this data applies,

00:07:04.554 --> 00:07:06.471
China invested 43%

00:07:07.638 --> 00:07:09.838
of its entire GDP.

00:07:09.838 --> 00:07:10.671
What does that mean?

00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:12.757
It means that 43.7 dollars

00:07:12.757 --> 00:07:15.366
out of every 100 dollars spent in China

00:07:15.366 --> 00:07:17.616
was spent on capital goods.

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:22.608
Compare that to the level
of consumption in China.

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:23.691
Only 37%

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:26.538
of China's total spending

00:07:26.538 --> 00:07:29.576
went towards household consumption.

00:07:29.576 --> 00:07:31.879
China is choosing to allocate
more of its resources

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:33.609
towards the production of capital goods

00:07:33.609 --> 00:07:36.772
than it is towards the
production of consumer goods.

00:07:36.772 --> 00:07:38.635
Let's look over at the United States.

00:07:38.635 --> 00:07:41.797
In the United States in 2016,

00:07:41.797 --> 00:07:43.047
only 15.9%

00:07:44.989 --> 00:07:48.237
of total spending went
towards capital goods.

00:07:48.237 --> 00:07:51.418
On the other hand, 68.6%

00:07:51.418 --> 00:07:54.172
of America's total spending went towards,

00:07:54.172 --> 00:07:56.589
you guessed it, household consumption.

00:07:56.589 --> 00:08:00.485
America has essentially chosen
rubber duckies over tractors

00:08:00.485 --> 00:08:03.830
or consumer goods over capital goods.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.437
So this is one data point.

00:08:05.437 --> 00:08:07.205
It's not the only thing
that affects the rates

00:08:07.205 --> 00:08:08.784
of economic growth in a country.

00:08:08.784 --> 00:08:11.360
But if we look at the actual
rates of economic growth

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.566
since the year 2000 for
China and the United States,

00:08:15.566 --> 00:08:18.321
an interesting fact emerges.

00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:21.277
China has enjoyed
significantly higher rates

00:08:21.277 --> 00:08:22.924
of economic growth.

00:08:22.924 --> 00:08:24.637
The blue line here

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:28.908
represents China's economic
growth rates from 2000

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:29.741
to 2015.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.383
And we can see that
China has average rates

00:08:33.383 --> 00:08:36.466
of economic growth of between 8%

00:08:38.229 --> 00:08:40.601
and 14% per year.

00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:43.739
That means that every year,
China's economy has produced

00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:48.565
approximately 10% more stuff
than it did the year before.

00:08:48.565 --> 00:08:50.855
Compare that to the United States.

00:08:50.855 --> 00:08:54.296
In the United States, growth
rates have averaged between

00:08:54.296 --> 00:08:58.698
negative 2% and 4%, significantly lower.

00:08:58.698 --> 00:09:00.979
The United States has
achieved economic growth

00:09:00.979 --> 00:09:02.862
for most of the last 15 years,

00:09:02.862 --> 00:09:04.684
but the rate of economic growth

00:09:04.684 --> 00:09:06.326
was quite a bit lower than China.

00:09:06.326 --> 00:09:09.320
China has, of course, a
much larger population.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.663
Also, China is at a lower level

00:09:11.663 --> 00:09:13.487
of economic development
than the United States,

00:09:13.487 --> 00:09:14.747
so it has more room to grow.

00:09:14.747 --> 00:09:16.709
There are more unused resources in China.

00:09:16.709 --> 00:09:18.492
But that aside,

00:09:18.492 --> 00:09:21.244
China also chooses to
allocate more of its resources

00:09:21.244 --> 00:09:23.497
towards investment in capital goods

00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:26.752
than it does production of
consumer goods for households.

00:09:26.752 --> 00:09:30.893
This fact, going back to our
production possibilities curve,

00:09:30.893 --> 00:09:33.370
supports the idea that by choosing

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.675
to produce more capital goods today,

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:38.343
a country is essentially
choosing future consumption

00:09:38.343 --> 00:09:39.922
over current consumption.

00:09:39.922 --> 00:09:41.639
Economic growth has many causes.

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:43.452
Economists have been discussing

00:09:43.452 --> 00:09:46.386
the source of economic growth
for over 200 years now.

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:48.014
Increases in the population,

00:09:48.014 --> 00:09:50.134
increases in the education level,

00:09:50.134 --> 00:09:52.320
the skill level, the amount of technology,

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.452
and the availability of resources

00:09:54.452 --> 00:09:57.206
are significant sources
of economic growth.

00:09:57.206 --> 00:09:59.114
However, a country's decision

00:09:59.114 --> 00:10:01.353
as to how it allocates its resources today

00:10:01.353 --> 00:10:03.668
also impacts its rate of economic growth.
