[BASKETBALLS DRIBBLING]

00:00:02.315 --> 00:00:03.241
Yeah, boys!

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.760
A place that I
always have enjoyed

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.870
is the Lavietes
Pavilion for basketball.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.210
My husband is a
particular basketball fan,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.410
and I have taken up his
attitude towards basketball.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.769
And so from the beginning
of my presidency--

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.060
and really even before, when
I was the Radcliffe dean--

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.660
we have been
attendees at Lavietes.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.240
I remember, very soon
after I became president,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.200
attending a women's basketball
game and celebrating with them

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.510
my ascension to female power
as the newly-named president.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.690
We also had the privilege of
watching a remarkable player,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.650
who just was a total standout on
the Harvard team at that time,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.960
named [? Jeremy ?] [? Lin, ?]
who has since become

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.370
a superstar with the advent of
[? "Linsanity" ?] when he broke

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.480
out as a really wonderfully
effective player in the NBA

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.530
soon after his beginning
of his professional career.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.400
I now have the great joy of
seeing a renovated Lavietes--

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.610
updated, lightened, with
better seating, a jumbotron

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.750
to show videos, with
just a better scoreboard.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.010
Just a much better place
for players and spectators,

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.070
with, also, better locker rooms
and backstage elements as well.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.040
So it's fun to be
in the same place

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.800
and have it look a lot the
same, but also different

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.530
in ways that sustain
tradition but make it

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.281
a much better place for our
wonderful basketball teams

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:34.780
to play.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.341
