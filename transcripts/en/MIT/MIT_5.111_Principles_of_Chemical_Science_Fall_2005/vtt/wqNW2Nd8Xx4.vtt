00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.947
We finished the unit on
oxidation-reduction on

00:00:28.947 --> 00:00:32.192
Wednesday.
And so now we are moving into

00:00:32.192 --> 00:00:35.291
the next unit,
which is transition metals,

00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:37.937
and that is Chapter 16 in your
book.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:41.792
And following transition
metals, the last unit is on

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:46.252
kinetics or rates of reaction,
and that is a little bit of a

00:00:46.252 --> 00:00:49.125
longer unit.
So there are only two more

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:53.585
units coming up in the course.
Today I am going to introduce

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:57.818
you to the transition metal
unit, and this follows nicely

00:00:57.818 --> 00:01:02.505
from oxidation-reduction since
you saw a lot of electrons being

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:07.013
lost and gained.
And metals are definitely

00:01:07.013 --> 00:01:10.476
something that will gain and
lose electrons,

00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:14.986
so it follows nicely from that.
Today is an introduction,

00:01:14.986 --> 00:01:19.899
and on Monday we are going to
talk about crystal field theory,

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.248
which is a topic that most
people have not seen in high

00:01:24.248 --> 00:01:27.228
school.
At least that has been true in

00:01:27.228 --> 00:01:31.061
past years.
It looks a little bit scary

00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:34.573
sometimes to people because it
looks different.

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:37.551
It is not something that seems
familiar.

00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:42.133
It is actually not that hard,
but I strongly recommend coming

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:46.179
and being present in lecture and
working the problems.

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.310
That is how you learn how to do
this part.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.669
And this often plays,
this particular unit on

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:56.029
transition metals,
is a dominant theme on the

00:01:56.029 --> 00:02:00.000
final exam, so you will see it
there.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.103
If people could settle down a
little, I am even having trouble

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:06.928
hearing myself.
That is going to be Monday.

00:02:06.928 --> 00:02:10.762
And then on Wednesday we are
going to talk about shapes of

00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:14.192
coordination complexes,
and this fits in nicely with

00:02:14.192 --> 00:02:17.421
the transition metals.
We are going to talk about

00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:20.313
vesper theory.
And then the following Monday

00:02:20.313 --> 00:02:24.215
we continue on and talk about
how one can use crystal field

00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:28.116
theory to think about what
colors molecules with transition

00:02:28.116 --> 00:02:30.791
metals have.
These units,

00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:34.816
it is a little bit of a strange
order this year because of the

00:02:34.816 --> 00:02:38.247
Thanksgiving holidays,
but that is what is coming up.

00:02:38.247 --> 00:02:42.272
Again, this is a unit that most
people have not seen before in

00:02:42.272 --> 00:02:44.845
high school.
And, as I mentioned before,

00:02:44.845 --> 00:02:47.682
problem set nine,
which is handed out today,

00:02:47.682 --> 00:02:50.453
you will see that it is really
quite short.

00:02:50.453 --> 00:02:53.818
It just covers today's lecture
and Monday's lecture.

00:02:53.818 --> 00:02:57.645
It just has a few problems on
it, so it should just kind of

00:02:57.645 --> 00:03:02.000
keep you from falling behind
with the material --

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.211
-- But not take too much time,
so you will be able to get that

00:03:06.211 --> 00:03:08.628
done before Thanksgiving.
All right.

00:03:08.628 --> 00:03:10.768
Today there are a lot of
topics.

00:03:10.768 --> 00:03:14.220
That is what happens when you
introduce a new area.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.741
You need to go through a bunch
of different kinds of

00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:20.503
definitions.
And so today we are going to

00:03:20.503 --> 00:03:22.781
talk about coordination
complexes.

00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:26.924
And we are going to talk about
coordination complex notation,

00:03:26.924 --> 00:03:30.169
coordination number,
structures, just briefly of

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.310
coordination complexes.
Again, on Wednesday,

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.308
we are going to be coming back
next Wednesday and talking much

00:03:38.308 --> 00:03:41.781
more about these structures,
but we will give a little

00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:44.665
introduction today.
We are going to introduce

00:03:44.665 --> 00:03:48.466
something called the chelate
effect and talk about isomers.

00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:52.004
And also, since we are talking
about transition metals,

00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:55.281
we are going to start talking
about d-electrons and

00:03:55.281 --> 00:03:56.985
d-orbitals.
This is, again,

00:03:56.985 --> 00:04:02.333
all in Chapter 16 in your book.
Here is that relevant part of

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:07.241
the periodic table that we will
be talking about in this unit.

00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:10.701
These are what are called
transition metals.

00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:15.206
And this is a part of the
periodic table that is near and

00:04:15.206 --> 00:04:19.873
dear to the hearts of many
faculty members in the Chemistry

00:04:19.873 --> 00:04:24.298
Department, including my own.
We study proteins that use

00:04:24.298 --> 00:04:28.000
these metals to catalyze
reactions.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.049
And so this color scheme is
actually out of a book that was

00:04:32.049 --> 00:04:36.029
published by Steve Lippard,
who is a faculty member in the

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:39.590
Chemistry Department.
I will mention him again later

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.313
in the day.
He does a lot of work on the

00:04:42.313 --> 00:04:46.362
area called Metals in Biology,
these transition metals that

00:04:46.362 --> 00:04:48.666
play a role in biological
systems.

00:04:48.666 --> 00:04:52.716
And this book was also with
Jeremy Berg, who is the current

00:04:52.716 --> 00:04:56.416
head of the general medicine
component of the National

00:04:56.416 --> 00:05:01.066
Institutes of Health.
And so he is somebody else who

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:03.891
has thought a lot about metals
in biology.

00:05:03.891 --> 00:05:05.682
In his case,
in particular,

00:05:05.682 --> 00:05:07.886
zinc.
Why are metals important in

00:05:07.886 --> 00:05:10.228
biological systems?
Well, proteins,

00:05:10.228 --> 00:05:13.328
and I have talked some about
proteins already,

00:05:13.328 --> 00:05:16.360
are composed of amino acids.
You have carbon,

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.013
nitrogen, oxygen,
sulfur.

00:05:18.013 --> 00:05:22.008
And there is quite a bit of
chemistry that these particular

00:05:22.008 --> 00:05:24.764
elements can do,
that amino acids can do,

00:05:24.764 --> 00:05:30.000
but there are some pretty
challenging chemical reactions.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.630
We talked in the unit on
chemical equilibrium about a

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.563
challenging reaction,
splitting dinitrogen.

00:05:36.563 --> 00:05:40.333
And I told you about the
Haber-Bosch and how we need to

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:43.963
do this to get fertilizers.
And so it is an important

00:05:43.963 --> 00:05:47.385
industrial process that an
enzyme can also do very

00:05:47.385 --> 00:05:51.504
efficiently without the high
pressures and temperatures that

00:05:51.504 --> 00:05:55.135
human beings seem to need to get
this reaction to go.

00:05:55.135 --> 00:05:58.905
That is one example of a
protein that uses metals to do

00:05:58.905 --> 00:06:03.171
the chemistry.
And the active site of that

00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:06.630
enzyme is full of different
kinds of metals.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.455
Up here says global cycling of
nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon.

00:06:11.455 --> 00:06:16.201
And so often some of the most
fundamental reactions are also

00:06:16.201 --> 00:06:21.107
very challenging reactions and
require metals to make them go.

00:06:21.107 --> 00:06:25.611
Radical chemistry reactions,
making various products like

00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:31.000
vitamins or deoxynucleotides,
the building block of DNA.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.828
And we have some DNA here with
us today in class.

00:06:34.828 --> 00:06:37.938
A lot of these reactions
require metals.

00:06:37.938 --> 00:06:42.484
In this orange color here,
those are metals that are found

00:06:42.484 --> 00:06:46.631
in biological systems,
but there are also some metals

00:06:46.631 --> 00:06:49.582
in gray.
And some have both orange and

00:06:49.582 --> 00:06:52.453
gray.
There are other metals that are

00:06:52.453 --> 00:06:57.000
used as drugs or to probe
biological systems.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.901
There is a whole area of sort
of metals in medicine where

00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:06.103
people are using,
say, looking at the use of gold

00:07:06.103 --> 00:07:10.742
for treating arthritis.
There is a lot of relevance of

00:07:10.742 --> 00:07:15.381
these transition metals or
d-block metals to medicine.

00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:20.021
Let's talk about the abilities
of these metals to form

00:07:20.021 --> 00:07:25.623
complexes, and this is important
for their ability to function in

00:07:25.623 --> 00:07:30.000
all systems, including the human
body.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.257
A key feature is that they can
form complexes,

00:07:33.257 --> 00:07:36.877
and let's look at why.
And so these complexes then,

00:07:36.877 --> 00:07:41.366
of the metal and their ligands,
are known as these coordination

00:07:41.366 --> 00:07:44.262
complexes.
You have a positive metal ion,

00:07:44.262 --> 00:07:46.796
and it can attract electron
density.

00:07:46.796 --> 00:07:51.357
And that is usually in the form
of a lone pair of electrons from

00:07:51.357 --> 00:07:54.470
another atom.
And so when you bring together

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.307
this metal and these other atoms
and their lone pairs,

00:07:58.307 --> 00:08:02.000
then you form this kind of
complex.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.185
And so if we look at the
different roles that things

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:10.699
play, you have donor atoms.
And they are called ligands.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:15.458
You often talk about a ligand
being coordinated to a metal.

00:08:15.458 --> 00:08:20.054
And we mentioned Lewis acids
and Lewis bases when we were

00:08:20.054 --> 00:08:24.322
talking about acid-base,
and we didn't really do much

00:08:24.322 --> 00:08:29.000
with them when we were talking
about acid-base.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.825
And I said this would come back
later.

00:08:31.825 --> 00:08:36.102
Lewis acids and Lewis bases are
very relevant in terms of

00:08:36.102 --> 00:08:39.997
talking about how coordination
complexes are formed.

00:08:39.997 --> 00:08:43.892
A Lewis base is going to donate
lone pair electrons.

00:08:43.892 --> 00:08:48.322
And here are some examples.
Again, these are referred to as

00:08:48.322 --> 00:08:51.224
ligands.
And so they would be acting as

00:08:51.224 --> 00:08:54.966
Lewis bases typically by
donating their lone pair.

00:08:54.966 --> 00:08:59.396
Here are some of the ones that
you are going to see in this

00:08:59.396 --> 00:09:03.130
unit.
And some of these will become

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:07.097
familiar to you as we go through
the next few lectures.

00:09:07.097 --> 00:09:11.578
They all have these lone pairs.
And the metal is very happy to

00:09:11.578 --> 00:09:15.471
see these ligands coming,
and they will coordinate and

00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:17.895
form these coordination
complexes.

00:09:17.895 --> 00:09:22.082
Then you need an acceptor atom,
and that is the transition

00:09:22.082 --> 00:09:24.507
metal.
That is going to act as the

00:09:24.507 --> 00:09:28.841
Lewis acid, and it is going to
accept that lone pair that is

00:09:28.841 --> 00:09:34.920
being donated by the ligand.
Let's look at some example of

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:40.156
some of these metals.
And we saw some of these on the

00:09:40.156 --> 00:09:44.687
periodic table.
These are all these d-block or

00:09:44.687 --> 00:09:49.420
transition metals.
Then the coordination complex

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:55.159
is the metal surrounded by the
ligands, or the Lewis acids

00:09:55.159 --> 00:10:01.000
surrounded by the Lewis bases.
Here is a picture.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.281
We have cobalt in the center
here, and then there are six NH

00:10:05.281 --> 00:10:09.054
three groups which are
acting as the ligands,

00:10:09.054 --> 00:10:12.682
and their lone pairs are
pointing toward the metal.

00:10:12.682 --> 00:10:15.512
And so, again,
the coordination complex,

00:10:15.512 --> 00:10:19.793
all is meant by that is the
metal surrounded by the ligands.

00:10:19.793 --> 00:10:23.131
And, in this case,
there is a little bracket on

00:10:23.131 --> 00:10:25.526
the side with a plus three
charge.

00:10:25.526 --> 00:10:29.299
And, for this particular
complex, you might have like

00:10:29.299 --> 00:10:33.000
three chloride ions hanging
around.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.473
Three negatively charged ions
to kind of counterbalance the

00:10:37.473 --> 00:10:42.023
fact that this coordination
complex has a plus three overall

00:10:42.023 --> 00:10:44.568
charge.
And so the charge would be

00:10:44.568 --> 00:10:49.503
distributed, but it is indicated
that this whole complex has this

00:10:49.503 --> 00:10:53.205
charge by that little bracket
and the plus three.

00:10:53.205 --> 00:10:56.367
Again, here,
cobalt is acting as the Lewis

00:10:56.367 --> 00:10:58.989
acid.
It is accepting the electrons

00:10:58.989 --> 00:11:03.000
that are being donated by the
ligands.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.790
It is the acceptor atom.
And the NH three groups

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:12.580
are acting as the Lewis bases.
They are the donor atoms,

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.500
so they are donating a lone
pair of electrons.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:21.203
Now we can introduce a term
called coordination number,

00:11:21.203 --> 00:11:23.903
C.N., and that is pretty
simple.

00:11:23.903 --> 00:11:30.000
It is just a number of ligands
that are bonded to the metal.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.115
And so here there are six.
The coordination number is six.

00:11:34.115 --> 00:11:37.293
That would be written as C.N.
equals 6.

00:11:37.293 --> 00:11:39.459
And you have six ligands

00:11:39.459 --> 00:11:42.492
comprising the primary
coordination sphere.

00:11:42.492 --> 00:11:45.597
We also have three chlorines
hanging around,

00:11:45.597 --> 00:11:49.857
but they are not coordinated to
the metal, so they don't get

00:11:49.857 --> 00:11:53.179
counted in this.
You are only interested in the

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:56.934
ligands that are actually
coordinated in the complex.

00:11:56.934 --> 00:11:59.389
C.N.
numbers typically range from 2

00:11:59.389 --> 00:12:04.766
to 12, but 6 is the most common.
You are going to be seeing a

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:07.857
lot of different coordination
complexes like this.

00:12:07.857 --> 00:12:10.759
Let me just show you how that
would be written.

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:14.607
When you are doing a problem in
your book, it is mostly likely

00:12:14.607 --> 00:12:17.824
not going to be drawn.
You are going to see notation

00:12:17.824 --> 00:12:20.537
for this instead.
And so this particular one

00:12:20.537 --> 00:12:22.997
would be indicated,
you have the cobalt,

00:12:22.997 --> 00:12:25.899
and then you have your NH three
groups.

00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:30.000
There are six of them,
so that is indicated there.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.170
Then you have a bracket around
the outside with a plus three,

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.854
so that indicates that the
charge of everything inside

00:12:37.854 --> 00:12:41.051
equals plus three.
You also

00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:43.275
might see this,

00:12:43.275 --> 00:12:47.029
where outside the bracket you
have three chloride ions.

00:12:47.029 --> 00:12:51.199
And so you should be able to
think backwards to this and say,

00:12:51.199 --> 00:12:55.091
well, if we have three things
with a negative one charge.

00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:58.358
And you see why the
oxidation-reduction unit was

00:12:58.358 --> 00:13:02.708
important before this.
Because we talked about

00:13:02.708 --> 00:13:07.015
oxidation numbers and all the
rules for assigning oxidation

00:13:07.015 --> 00:13:09.541
numbers.
You are going to need that

00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:11.992
knowledge to do this unit as
well.

00:13:11.992 --> 00:13:16.299
You should know that this is
going to be minus one for each

00:13:16.299 --> 00:13:20.533
chloride, so that would be
three, which would mean that if

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:23.949
this is minus three,
this bracket would be plus

00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:29.000
three, for this one down here is
written to be neutral.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.118
You will be seeing this and
need to back calculate.

00:13:32.118 --> 00:13:35.985
Then you are also going to need
to calculate what the oxidation

00:13:35.985 --> 00:13:39.228
numbers of the things within the
bracket are as well.

00:13:39.228 --> 00:13:42.534
And we will talk more about
that a little later in the

00:13:42.534 --> 00:13:44.717
lecture.
Again, the NH three

00:13:44.717 --> 00:13:47.898
within the brackets means it is
bound to the cobalt.

00:13:47.898 --> 00:13:49.831
That would be this picture
here.

00:13:49.831 --> 00:13:53.449
There are six of them so you
would draw them as six around.

00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:57.004
And let me just mention a
little bit about this particular

00:13:57.004 --> 00:14:01.834
configuration.
Here, where there is sort of a

00:14:01.834 --> 00:14:06.464
thick line coming out,
indicates that it is coming

00:14:06.464 --> 00:14:09.299
toward you.
Here, in this case,

00:14:09.299 --> 00:14:13.267
you would have two atoms coming
toward you.

00:14:13.267 --> 00:14:18.653
The dashed lines here are
showing that there are two atoms

00:14:18.653 --> 00:14:23.188
back behind the plane.
And then when you have the

00:14:23.188 --> 00:14:26.496
straight line,
that is in the plane.

00:14:26.496 --> 00:14:31.598
This picture here is showing
you this type of geometry,

00:14:31.598 --> 00:14:37.222
which is called what?
Octahedral geometry,

00:14:37.222 --> 00:14:38.000
right.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.356
Let's talk about octahedral
geometry and the other

00:14:47.356 --> 00:14:51.054
geometries that you are going to
see most often in this

00:14:51.054 --> 00:14:54.068
particular unit.
Again, I am going to do much

00:14:54.068 --> 00:14:57.835
more on this on Wednesday,
but this is just a very brief

00:14:57.835 --> 00:15:01.876
introduction to the structures
that you will see the most in

00:15:01.876 --> 00:15:06.296
this particular unit.
For a coordination number of

00:15:06.296 --> 00:15:10.479
six, you are just going to see
one type of geometry,

00:15:10.479 --> 00:15:14.826
which is this octahedral
geometry, which I just showed

00:15:14.826 --> 00:15:17.451
you.
For a coordination number of

00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:22.618
five, you will see two different
types of geometry in this unit.

00:15:22.618 --> 00:15:27.047
And let's take a look at this.
The first one over here,

00:15:27.047 --> 00:15:32.691
the trigonal bipyramidal.
Here is an example of that.

00:15:32.691 --> 00:15:36.279
And I will try to have this as
it is.

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:41.461
Three ligands are in the plane.
You have up and down,

00:15:41.461 --> 00:15:45.348
and out here,
one ligand is pointing out

00:15:45.348 --> 00:15:51.129
toward you with the thick line,
and another ligand is going

00:15:51.129 --> 00:15:56.013
back with the dashed line here.
That is one there.

00:15:56.013 --> 00:16:01.887
We talked about the geometry.
And I forgot to mention that

00:16:01.887 --> 00:16:05.797
those are 90 degree angles,
which I think is pretty easy to

00:16:05.797 --> 00:16:09.438
see when you look at it,
that you would have 90 degrees

00:16:09.438 --> 00:16:12.876
in between those bonds.
And what about for this one?

00:16:12.876 --> 00:16:15.101
What do we have going for the
red?

00:16:15.101 --> 00:16:17.191
What kind of angle is that?
120.

00:16:17.191 --> 00:16:19.887
And what about from the red to
the black?

00:16:19.887 --> 00:16:22.044
90.
Those are the angles we would

00:16:22.044 --> 00:16:24.674
see in here.
And this is going to become

00:16:24.674 --> 00:16:30.000
important because we are going
to be talking about d-orbitals.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.669
And where the d-orbitals are
for the metal,

00:16:32.669 --> 00:16:35.847
which is in the center of the
coordination complex.

00:16:35.847 --> 00:16:38.516
One of the issues we will be
discussing is,

00:16:38.516 --> 00:16:41.822
where are the atoms with
respect to those d-orbitals?

00:16:41.822 --> 00:16:44.364
Geometry becomes important at
this point.

00:16:44.364 --> 00:16:47.669
The other type of coordination
complex you might see,

00:16:47.669 --> 00:16:51.483
here the metal is gray in the
middle, and so then we have our

00:16:51.483 --> 00:16:54.597
ligands bonded to it.
If you have five ligands you

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:58.283
also might see this geometry
here, so this square pyramidal

00:16:58.283 --> 00:17:02.625
geometry.
And what are the angles between

00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:04.743
all of the atoms here?
90.

00:17:04.743 --> 00:17:09.571
Now, in the case where you have
four ligands bound to your

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:13.382
central metal,
there are two possibilities for

00:17:13.382 --> 00:17:17.871
the geometry that you will see.
One is square planner.

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:21.344
In this case,
it is drawn with two ligands

00:17:21.344 --> 00:17:25.663
coming out towards you and two
ligands going behind.

00:17:25.663 --> 00:17:31.000
And what would be the geometry
between these guys?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.718
90 as well.
And so this is one of the easy

00:17:35.718 --> 00:17:42.162
ones to remember because it is a
square and it is planar.

00:17:42.162 --> 00:17:45.730
That is an easy one to
remember.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:52.289
The other that you might see
when you have four ligands is

00:17:52.289 --> 00:17:58.158
this guy, tetrahedral.
And what are the angles here?

00:17:58.158 --> 00:18:02.608
109.5.
And then if you have three

00:18:02.608 --> 00:18:08.628
ligands, pretty much this is all
you are going to see in this

00:18:08.628 --> 00:18:12.642
unit, and so we have the
trigonal planar.

00:18:12.642 --> 00:18:17.859
Again, it looks trigonal and it
is also quite planar.

00:18:17.859 --> 00:18:21.170
And what are our angles here?
120.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:25.384
And linear is going to give you
what angle?

00:18:25.384 --> 00:18:30.000
180.
You will see this one as well.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.275
And this model is a little old,
so it is not really so linear

00:18:34.275 --> 00:18:37.054
anymore, but it is still
supposed to be.

00:18:37.054 --> 00:18:40.759
We are going to bring back,
I am going to bring these

00:18:40.759 --> 00:18:45.176
models to class for a lot of the
next lectures because thinking

00:18:45.176 --> 00:18:49.452
about the structure is going to
be very important in thinking

00:18:49.452 --> 00:18:52.373
about the properties of
transition metals.

00:18:52.373 --> 00:18:55.294
All right.
What else can transition metals

00:18:55.294 --> 00:18:57.361
do?
What are some of the other

00:18:57.361 --> 00:19:01.390
things?
When you talk about transition

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:05.375
metals and coordination
complexes, you need to talk

00:19:05.375 --> 00:19:09.519
about the chelate effect.
We have seen so far ligands

00:19:09.519 --> 00:19:13.264
binding at one site,
but some ligands can bind a

00:19:13.264 --> 00:19:17.807
metal at more than one site.
And so then you start talking

00:19:17.807 --> 00:19:21.473
about chelates.
First, a ligand that can bind a

00:19:21.473 --> 00:19:25.696
metal at one site is called
unidentate or monodentate.

00:19:25.696 --> 00:19:30.000
And the dent comes from dentist
or tooth.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.107
This would be one.
If you have a ligand that can

00:19:34.107 --> 00:19:39.439
bind at more than one point of
attachment, then it is called a

00:19:39.439 --> 00:19:43.372
chelating ligand.
And the coordination complex

00:19:43.372 --> 00:19:46.257
that it forms is called a
chelate.

00:19:46.257 --> 00:19:51.588
And so this is Greek for claws.
It seems like claws are coming

00:19:51.588 --> 00:19:56.570
down and binding to the metal.
Anything above one would be

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:01.552
considered a chelate if it has
two points of attachment or

00:20:01.552 --> 00:20:05.964
three or four.
Bidendate means two points.

00:20:05.964 --> 00:20:09.021
And this nomenclature,
not too challenging.

00:20:09.021 --> 00:20:13.169
People are usually pretty good
at guessing what they mean.

00:20:13.169 --> 00:20:16.881
Tridentate would have how many
points of attachment?

00:20:16.881 --> 00:20:18.264
Three.
Tetradentate?

00:20:18.264 --> 00:20:19.501
Four.
Hexadendate?

00:20:19.501 --> 00:20:21.393
Six.
There are some people,

00:20:21.393 --> 00:20:25.105
this was a question,
I think, hexadentate on a final

00:20:25.105 --> 00:20:29.326
one year people got it wrong.
Don't get something like that

00:20:29.326 --> 00:20:32.928
wrong.
Save the things you are going

00:20:32.928 --> 00:20:35.389
to get wrong for the really hard
part.

00:20:35.389 --> 00:20:37.451
This is really not so
difficult.

00:20:37.451 --> 00:20:40.511
That should be some bonus
points there for you.

00:20:40.511 --> 00:20:44.169
If you remember the dentate,
and this term actually gets

00:20:44.169 --> 00:20:46.630
used quite a bit,
you will be all set.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:50.355
What is the chelate effect?
Chelates are ligands that can

00:20:50.355 --> 00:20:53.082
bind at more than one point of
attachment.

00:20:53.082 --> 00:20:56.807
What is the chelate effect?
Well, it turns out that metal

00:20:56.807 --> 00:21:00.000
chelates are very,
very stable.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.802
And so this is a thermodynamic
property that they have.

00:21:03.802 --> 00:21:06.830
And it is believed,
or the rationale for the

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.563
stability which is observed,
is that it is an entropic

00:21:10.563 --> 00:21:14.366
factor that is going on.
The binding of that chelate at

00:21:14.366 --> 00:21:17.746
more than one point of
attachment is entropically

00:21:17.746 --> 00:21:22.253
favorable, because you are going
to be releasing waters as you do

00:21:22.253 --> 00:21:24.436
this.
We are going to come back,

00:21:24.436 --> 00:21:28.309
and I am going to explain this
using an example in a few

00:21:28.309 --> 00:21:31.902
minutes.
First let me give you some

00:21:31.902 --> 00:21:35.487
examples of chelates,
and then I will show you how

00:21:35.487 --> 00:21:39.951
this chelate effect could work.
There are examples of chelates

00:21:39.951 --> 00:21:43.829
in biological systems.
And it may not be a surprise to

00:21:43.829 --> 00:21:47.560
some of you that one of the
chelates is vitamin B12.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.365
And that would be one that I
would pick to mention in

00:21:51.365 --> 00:21:53.414
particular.
Here the chelate,

00:21:53.414 --> 00:21:56.926
this is all one ligand.
This whole bottom part is

00:21:56.926 --> 00:22:00.000
attached.
It is one ligand.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.596
We have this,
called the corn ring.

00:22:02.596 --> 00:22:07.100
You have cobalt in the middle.
And it is coordinated by this

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.002
planar part.
And you have four nitrogen

00:22:10.002 --> 00:22:13.667
ligands coordinating.
It is one ring system here,

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:17.179
called the corn ring,
that is attaching at four

00:22:17.179 --> 00:22:20.997
points of attachment.
You also have an upper ligand

00:22:20.997 --> 00:22:23.746
here, and this is an adenosyl
moiety.

00:22:23.746 --> 00:22:28.174
And we have a lower ligand.
And we talked about this before

00:22:28.174 --> 00:22:33.002
with buffers effects.
Because, if this lower ligand

00:22:33.002 --> 00:22:36.799
is detached on the protein,
it has to fit into a binding

00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:39.216
site.
And genetic defects that block

00:22:39.216 --> 00:22:41.840
that impair the activity of the
enzyme.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.776
That was mentioned before.
This actually has six different

00:22:45.776 --> 00:22:50.126
ligands and we'll classify as a
chelate, or six different points

00:22:50.126 --> 00:22:52.957
of attachment and classifies as
a chelate.

00:22:52.957 --> 00:22:57.099
Let me just sort of spin that
around so you can kind of get a

00:22:57.099 --> 00:23:02.148
sense of the geometry here.
Again, here is the cobalt in

00:23:02.148 --> 00:23:05.908
the middle, the upper ligand and
the lower ligand.

00:23:05.908 --> 00:23:10.205
And if we move that around,
see if you can get a sense of

00:23:10.205 --> 00:23:13.198
the sort of geometry around that
cobalt.

00:23:13.198 --> 00:23:17.725
You have four in a plane here,
one on top and one on bottom,

00:23:17.725 --> 00:23:22.405
so it is sort of an octahedral
type coordination of that metal

00:23:22.405 --> 00:23:25.782
in the center.
I thought I would just mention

00:23:25.782 --> 00:23:31.000
the person who determined the
structure of vitamin B12.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
That is Dorothy Hodgkin.
For her work on this,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
and on penicillin,
she received a Nobel Prize,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.333
because at the time she was
studying the structure,

00:23:40.333 --> 00:23:44.400
it was really considered very
large for the technique that she

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.799
used, which is x-ray
crystallography.

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:50.733
And people didn't think she
would be able to determine where

00:23:50.733 --> 00:23:54.599
all those atoms were located in
something that was that big

00:23:54.599 --> 00:23:58.000
using crystallography.
Since then we have gone on to

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.903
solve much larger structures.
But she really opened the doors

00:24:02.903 --> 00:24:06.649
for people thinking about this
technique as being important in

00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:09.535
biological systems.
She had a number of graduate

00:24:09.535 --> 00:24:13.219
students who went on to do some
pretty spectacular things and

00:24:13.219 --> 00:24:16.596
really helped to establish the
field of crystallography.

00:24:16.596 --> 00:24:20.219
And I will just mention one of
her graduate students who was

00:24:20.219 --> 00:24:22.614
not as successful as a
crystallographer.

00:24:22.614 --> 00:24:25.561
This is what I do.
And not everybody can do X-ray

00:24:25.561 --> 00:24:29.000
crystallography.
It is a bit challenging.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.705
And some people had to sort of
find something else to do with

00:24:32.705 --> 00:24:35.051
their lives.
One of her students didn't

00:24:35.051 --> 00:24:37.151
quite cut it as a
crystallographer,

00:24:37.151 --> 00:24:40.424
but the good news is she was
still able to find a job.

00:24:40.424 --> 00:24:44.005
And it is actually kind of
interesting that Dorothy Hodgkin

00:24:44.005 --> 00:24:46.784
was a real socialist.
She was very involved in

00:24:46.784 --> 00:24:49.440
left-wing issues,
but she stayed friend with

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.786
Margaret Thatcher throughout the
years.

00:24:51.786 --> 00:24:55.245
And it would have been very
interesting to be in a living

00:24:55.245 --> 00:24:58.209
room with the two of them
hearing them talk about

00:24:58.209 --> 00:25:01.951
politics.
Maybe they would talk about

00:25:01.951 --> 00:25:04.552
crystallography,
I don't really know,

00:25:04.552 --> 00:25:08.093
if they were together.
That might have been safer.

00:25:08.093 --> 00:25:10.405
That is one example of a
chelate.

00:25:10.405 --> 00:25:14.379
Here is another example of a
chelate, and this is called

00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:16.836
EDTA.
And so it has many points for

00:25:16.836 --> 00:25:20.594
attachment to a metal.
We have a lone pair up here on

00:25:20.594 --> 00:25:23.051
this atom, so we have a donor
here.

00:25:23.051 --> 00:25:26.664
We have another lone pair,
another donor site here.

00:25:26.664 --> 00:25:31.000
Another lone pair,
another donor site here.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.108
Also over here,
and here, and here.

00:25:34.108 --> 00:25:38.588
This ligand can attach to
something in six places.

00:25:38.588 --> 00:25:41.605
Here, again,
is the free molecule.

00:25:41.605 --> 00:25:46.725
And here is what it looks like
when it is attached to the

00:25:46.725 --> 00:25:49.194
metal.
See this oxygen here,

00:25:49.194 --> 00:25:52.942
over here, and then if you
follow it down,

00:25:52.942 --> 00:25:56.965
over here, this nitrogen is
also coordinated.

00:25:56.965 --> 00:26:00.440
If we go over here,
then this oxygen is

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:05.618
coordinated.
If we come from this nitrogen

00:26:05.618 --> 00:26:09.500
over to the other nitrogen,
it is over here.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:14.375
Go down to this oxygen,
this oxygen is coordinated down

00:26:14.375 --> 00:26:19.250
here, and then in purple we have
the last coordination.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:23.131
What is the geometry around
that metal site?

00:26:23.131 --> 00:26:29.000
You have these six ligands,
so what is that going to be?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.891
It is going to be an
octahedral.

00:26:31.891 --> 00:26:34.875
You should have angles around
90.

00:26:34.875 --> 00:26:40.005
And it is also hexadentate,
so you have a ligand binding

00:26:40.005 --> 00:26:45.134
with six points of attachment.
It would also have a C.N.

00:26:45.134 --> 00:26:47.000
number, then,
of six.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.943
Why the chelate effect?
Why are complexes like that so

00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:55.113
stable?
The chelate effect could be

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:59.963
viewed in this slide.
Before you have the EDTA bound,

00:26:59.963 --> 00:27:05.000
we have six water molecules
around it.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.299
Then we bind one molecule of
EDTA.

00:27:08.299 --> 00:27:13.599
It binds in the hexadentate
complex, releasing all six

00:27:13.599 --> 00:27:16.799
waters.
Where is entropy greater?

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:22.900
When you have one free thing or
when you have six free things?

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.400
Six.
This is entropically favorable.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:32.242
You are creating disorder.
You are binding one thing and

00:27:32.242 --> 00:27:36.262
releasing six things.
That is why these complexes are

00:27:36.262 --> 00:27:40.128
really quite stable.
We are getting back to entropy

00:27:40.128 --> 00:27:42.448
now.
We have been talking about

00:27:42.448 --> 00:27:44.226
delta G.
We had delta H.

00:27:44.226 --> 00:27:47.860
Now we have delta S.
That is the chelate effect.

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:52.422
And we talk about it due to
this entropic effect accompanied

00:27:52.422 --> 00:27:56.597
by the release of non-chelating
ligands, usually water,

00:27:56.597 --> 00:28:01.118
from the coordination sphere.
In this case,

00:28:01.118 --> 00:28:05.680
one ligand binding displacing
six things is favorable.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.069
The chelate effect leads to a
lot of practical uses.

00:28:10.069 --> 00:28:13.770
Here, some of the uses would be
in medicine.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:18.245
If you discover over
Thanksgiving that your one and a

00:28:18.245 --> 00:28:23.065
half year old niece or nephew
has discovered paint on the

00:28:23.065 --> 00:28:28.229
windowsill is peeling and is
starting eating the paint off of

00:28:28.229 --> 00:28:32.188
the windowsill,
you might want to remember when

00:28:32.188 --> 00:28:37.352
that was painted last and if
there was lead in that paint and

00:28:37.352 --> 00:28:42.000
rush the child to the emergency
room.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.127
And when you get there,
just in case the people there,

00:28:45.127 --> 00:28:48.609
you know, on Thanksgiving it is
always dangerous to be in an

00:28:48.609 --> 00:28:50.321
emergency room.
You might say,

00:28:50.321 --> 00:28:53.095
give this kid EDTA.
That is really what is used.

00:28:53.095 --> 00:28:55.868
And that will chelate,
then, the lead out of the

00:28:55.868 --> 00:29:00.000
system, before it can bind to
things and do a lot of damage.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.685
This is one of the chelators
that is used.

00:29:02.685 --> 00:29:06.222
It is a chelate effect.
It works pretty well if someone

00:29:06.222 --> 00:29:09.825
has been exposed to something
like lead, which is pretty

00:29:09.825 --> 00:29:13.034
toxic, and you want to get it
out of their system.

00:29:13.034 --> 00:29:15.327
That is one use.
It is also in food.

00:29:15.327 --> 00:29:18.668
It is a food additive.
Sometimes it is fun after you

00:29:18.668 --> 00:29:22.598
take a couple chemistry courses
to actually start reading the

00:29:22.598 --> 00:29:26.397
labels of the food that you are
consuming and some of those

00:29:26.397 --> 00:29:30.000
words will actually start making
sense.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.271
One thing that you will often
see is EDTA.

00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:36.862
And it will say,
EDTA was added for freshness.

00:29:36.862 --> 00:29:40.214
One thing that EDTA can do.
Microorganisms,

00:29:40.214 --> 00:29:45.162
bacteria, other things that you
would rather not have consuming

00:29:45.162 --> 00:29:49.790
your food at the time that you
also want to consume it need

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.104
metals for life,
as we all do.

00:29:52.104 --> 00:29:55.775
If you add EDTA,
it is a good way of preventing

00:29:55.775 --> 00:30:00.004
other kinds of unwanted
microorganisms from growing on

00:30:00.004 --> 00:30:04.365
the food.
Because it will chelate all the

00:30:04.365 --> 00:30:07.111
metals and the organisms cannot
live.

00:30:07.111 --> 00:30:11.613
Added for freshness is a more
polite way of saying that this

00:30:11.613 --> 00:30:15.427
food is less likely to be
contaminated with lots of

00:30:15.427 --> 00:30:19.852
bacteria growing on top of it.
Another thing that it can be

00:30:19.852 --> 00:30:23.362
used for is cleaning,
bathtub cleaning or other

00:30:23.362 --> 00:30:26.795
kinds, but bathtubs and showers
in particular.

00:30:26.795 --> 00:30:32.235
There is calcium in tub scum.
And most kinds of cleaners have

00:30:32.235 --> 00:30:36.490
something that chelates out that
calcium which allows you to

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:38.725
clean.
Again, over Thanksgiving,

00:30:38.725 --> 00:30:43.125
one thing that happens to a lot
of people when they go home is

00:30:43.125 --> 00:30:46.947
that their parents say,
help us clean to get ready for

00:30:46.947 --> 00:30:50.264
everyone coming.
And so you might be using EDTA

00:30:50.264 --> 00:30:53.221
then as well.
I thought I would tell you a

00:30:53.221 --> 00:30:57.836
little story about how knowledge
from freshman chemistry can make

00:30:57.836 --> 00:31:02.148
somebody money.
This is a really kind of fun

00:31:02.148 --> 00:31:04.833
story.
I don't know if it was around

00:31:04.833 --> 00:31:07.289
Thanksgiving,
it might have been.

00:31:07.289 --> 00:31:11.202
One day Robert Black had a
life-altering experience.

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:14.654
His wife said to him,
could you clean the tub?

00:31:14.654 --> 00:31:18.874
Apparently Robert Black had
never cleaned the tub before

00:31:18.874 --> 00:31:21.713
that time, and so he went to
clean it.

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:25.703
Apparently, maybe it had not
been cleaned in a while.

00:31:25.703 --> 00:31:30.000
And he discovered that it is
really hard.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.457
You have to scrub a lot to get
the tub clean.

00:31:33.457 --> 00:31:38.409
He thought, wouldn't it be nice
if one never had to clean a tub?

00:31:38.409 --> 00:31:42.888
He came up with this idea.
And here is one of the products

00:31:42.888 --> 00:31:45.953
that came out of this,
Sparkling Shower,

00:31:45.953 --> 00:31:50.197
available at La Verde's.
And what he did was he put the

00:31:50.197 --> 00:31:52.712
same ingredients,
including EDTA,

00:31:52.712 --> 00:31:56.956
in that you have in most
cleaners, but he had sort of a

00:31:56.956 --> 00:32:01.135
novel pitch.
Every time you take a shower,

00:32:01.135 --> 00:32:05.479
just squirt the shower or the
tub, and then you never really

00:32:05.479 --> 00:32:08.425
have to clean it.
In this patent he had a

00:32:08.425 --> 00:32:11.959
surfactant chelating agent,
EDTA, and an alcohol.

00:32:11.959 --> 00:32:16.230
You had a surfactant to sort of
break up the water tension,

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:20.059
the chelating agent to
sequester out the salts in the

00:32:20.059 --> 00:32:24.109
scum, and alcohol to dissolve
the more oily ingredients.

00:32:24.109 --> 00:32:28.453
And so those together kind of
got everything loose and ready

00:32:28.453 --> 00:32:32.022
to go.
And the surfactant kind of

00:32:32.022 --> 00:32:35.833
helped it run off.
If you squirt your shower every

00:32:35.833 --> 00:32:39.333
time you shower,
you will never really have to

00:32:39.333 --> 00:32:42.211
clean it.
He used all ingredients that

00:32:42.211 --> 00:32:45.477
were known before,
but packaged it slightly

00:32:45.477 --> 00:32:48.355
differently.
Again, EDTA is one of the

00:32:48.355 --> 00:32:52.322
ingredients in these products.
And so sales of these

00:32:52.322 --> 00:32:56.599
particular products have reached
$70 million every year.

00:32:56.599 --> 00:33:00.955
I think that the wife is
probably very happy that one day

00:33:00.955 --> 00:33:05.000
she insisted that he clean the
tub.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.715
Because this turned out to be a
pretty profitable exercise.

00:33:09.715 --> 00:33:14.430
It is also an example of how
some very simple chemistry can

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.764
yield you quite a bit of money.
All right.

00:33:17.764 --> 00:33:20.772
Tub cleaner.
There was one more that I

00:33:20.772 --> 00:33:23.617
thought of.
Anybody a fan of vampire

00:33:23.617 --> 00:33:25.000
movies?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.309
Not really all that many.
It is a little surprising.

00:33:34.309 --> 00:33:37.943
I am not sure you are all
telling the truth.

00:33:37.943 --> 00:33:42.760
If any of you happened to see
Blade, you might be aware of

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.887
another use for EDTA.
If you remember,

00:33:45.887 --> 00:33:50.619
you may not have noticed what
they were mentioning at the

00:33:50.619 --> 00:33:55.605
time, but they came up with a
great way of killing vampires.

00:33:55.605 --> 00:34:00.000
There were these darts filled
with EDTA.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.290
I think the kind of general
premise that you can rationalize

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:08.581
this Hollywood special feature
is that vampires drink blood,

00:34:08.581 --> 00:34:11.927
blood has iron,
and if they are pretty much all

00:34:11.927 --> 00:34:15.854
blood, if you give them
something that chelates out the

00:34:15.854 --> 00:34:19.345
iron, it could cause some kind
of harmful effect.

00:34:19.345 --> 00:34:23.127
In the movie they exploded,
and sort of disintegrated

00:34:23.127 --> 00:34:25.745
completely.
If you take your niece or

00:34:25.745 --> 00:34:30.327
nephew to the emergency room for
eating lead paint this will not

00:34:30.327 --> 00:34:33.244
happen.
I am quite sure.

00:34:33.244 --> 00:34:35.888
But it was really very
spectacular.

00:34:35.888 --> 00:34:39.155
Here they are,
the little darts filled with

00:34:39.155 --> 00:34:41.566
EDTA.
Again, more knowledge that

00:34:41.566 --> 00:34:44.755
could be useful on some
occasion, perhaps,

00:34:44.755 --> 00:34:48.644
I am not really sure.
I have a feeling that most of

00:34:48.644 --> 00:34:53.622
you will find the top three more
useful, but here is the complete

00:34:53.622 --> 00:34:58.055
list that I have been able to
come up with for the uses of

00:34:58.055 --> 00:35:00.804
chelators.
All right.

00:35:00.804 --> 00:35:05.547
Those are some coordination
complexes, either single ligands

00:35:05.547 --> 00:35:09.969
bound around a central metal,
or chelating ligands bound

00:35:09.969 --> 00:35:14.070
around a central metal.
There are other coordination

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.206
complexes which have important
features.

00:35:17.206 --> 00:35:21.065
And one thing that we will talk
about is isomers.

00:35:21.065 --> 00:35:25.889
Geometric isomers can have very
different properties to them.

00:35:25.889 --> 00:35:32.000
It seems like it is pretty much
almost the exact same compound.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.628
But the arrangement of the
atoms is slightly different,

00:35:36.628 --> 00:35:41.514
and that can yield two very
different properties for those

00:35:41.514 --> 00:35:45.542
particular compounds.
Let's look at one example.

00:35:45.542 --> 00:35:49.657
This is platinum,
and it has two NH three

00:35:49.657 --> 00:35:52.400
ligands and two chloride
ligands.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:57.371
And so that is in the bracket.
Those four different ligands

00:35:57.371 --> 00:36:02.000
are coordinated centrally to the
platinum.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.726
It would have a C.N.
number of four.

00:36:05.726 --> 00:36:12.220
And the most common shape that
you would see for this would be

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:16.372
this one here,
this square planar shape.

00:36:16.372 --> 00:36:22.228
Depending on how you arrange
the four different ligands,

00:36:22.228 --> 00:36:28.190
two NH three and two
Cl, you get a very different

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:32.385
result.
We have, in this arrangement,

00:36:32.385 --> 00:36:37.403
a compound called cisplatinum.
You can have a cis arrangement,

00:36:37.403 --> 00:36:42.421
where the chlorides are on one
side and the ammonia groups are

00:36:42.421 --> 00:36:46.370
on the other side,
or you can have transplatinum,

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:49.989
where the ligands are across
from each other.

00:36:49.989 --> 00:36:53.115
Here are these two different
molecules.

00:36:53.115 --> 00:36:56.735
Here they are cis with respect
to each other,

00:36:56.735 --> 00:37:02.000
and here they are trans with
respect to each other.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.674
One is a very potent drug that
is used in treatment of cancer.

00:37:07.674 --> 00:37:10.558
The other has no known
function.

00:37:10.558 --> 00:37:13.906
They are composed of identical
atoms.

00:37:13.906 --> 00:37:18.093
Why is this different?
Why are there different

00:37:18.093 --> 00:37:21.720
functions with the different
geometries?

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:26.372
Well, as it turns out,
it is real important to have

00:37:26.372 --> 00:37:31.650
the atoms on the same side.
As shown in this slide,

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:34.665
I said I would mention Steve
Lippard again,

00:37:34.665 --> 00:37:37.537
and here I am,
this has been a subject of

00:37:37.537 --> 00:37:41.772
research in Steve Lippard's
laboratory here in the chemistry

00:37:41.772 --> 00:37:44.571
department at MIT for a number
of years.

00:37:44.571 --> 00:37:48.591
If you have a cancer cell and
you want to kill the cancer

00:37:48.591 --> 00:37:52.539
cell, one thing that you can do
is give it cisplantinum.

00:37:52.539 --> 00:37:55.267
The cisplatinum comes and binds
to DNA.

00:37:55.267 --> 00:37:59.000
Here is a little cartoon of DNA
here.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.545
There is the actual model of
DNA structure down here,

00:38:02.545 --> 00:38:05.204
in the front of the room.
When it binds,

00:38:05.204 --> 00:38:07.454
then it can inhibit
transcription.

00:38:07.454 --> 00:38:10.113
And so this can then lead to
cell death.

00:38:10.113 --> 00:38:13.522
And so Steve has been really
looking at this issue,

00:38:13.522 --> 00:38:17.750
trying to redesign cisplatinum
to see if you get a better drug,

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:21.840
looking at other factors which
might have an additive effect.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.727
This particular drug is used
often for prostate cancer and

00:38:25.727 --> 00:38:30.921
has really been quite effective.
Why does it matter if they are

00:38:30.921 --> 00:38:33.612
on the same side?
Well, if you look at this

00:38:33.612 --> 00:38:36.943
complex and the other,
you see that only two of these

00:38:36.943 --> 00:38:39.825
ligands are left.
Two of the ligands are gone.

00:38:39.825 --> 00:38:43.604
At those sites it is actually
coordinated to the DNA itself.

00:38:43.604 --> 00:38:47.320
That is why it is important
that they are on the same side.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.651
You want to release two
chlorides and have it bind to

00:38:50.651 --> 00:38:53.213
DNA this way.
If it is on the other side,

00:38:53.213 --> 00:38:57.056
it really doesn't work as well.
If we go over and look at the

00:38:57.056 --> 00:39:00.451
DNA molecule for a minute,
you see that if you want to

00:39:00.451 --> 00:39:05.000
have two free sites to
coordinate two DNA molecules.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.676
Of course, this is the totally
wrong scale.

00:39:07.676 --> 00:39:09.651
You want these on the same
side.

00:39:09.651 --> 00:39:13.156
If I made it on the right
scale, it would not fit in the

00:39:13.156 --> 00:39:15.323
room, really.
This is more or less,

00:39:15.323 --> 00:39:18.254
you can imagine.
If you are going down here and

00:39:18.254 --> 00:39:21.122
you want to release just the
chloride ligands,

00:39:21.122 --> 00:39:24.500
well, you cannot get the
chloride ligands to be on the

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.622
right side for this.
Molecules that have different

00:39:27.622 --> 00:39:31.000
shapes may have different
properties.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.589
And if you are in an
environment you are looking to

00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:36.887
react with a particular
molecule.

00:39:36.887 --> 00:39:39.974
I will show you another kind of
view of DNA.

00:39:39.974 --> 00:39:42.415
DNA is a really beautiful
molecule.

00:39:42.415 --> 00:39:46.507
Here you have something you can
carry around and show your

00:39:46.507 --> 00:39:50.025
friends, but also there is a
smaller model of DNA.

00:39:50.025 --> 00:39:54.046
This is actually an artist in
Michigan who will carve out

00:39:54.046 --> 00:39:59.000
within these blocks any atomic
structure that you have.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.199
And you can show the sort of
bases in the detail.

00:40:02.199 --> 00:40:05.933
That is what DNA looks like
sort of from the top and then

00:40:05.933 --> 00:40:08.800
from the side.
It is just a really beautiful

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.933
molecule.
This is a nice example.

00:40:10.933 --> 00:40:14.133
Steve Lippard often takes a lot
of UROP students,

00:40:14.133 --> 00:40:17.733
so it might be something,
if you are interested in this

00:40:17.733 --> 00:40:21.666
area, that you might want to
look at his web page and see if

00:40:21.666 --> 00:40:25.000
that type of research interests
you.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.949
I lost my pointer.
The cisplantinum has the effect

00:40:33.949 --> 00:40:38.302
because you need to release
chlorides on the same side,

00:40:38.302 --> 00:40:40.962
so that it can bind DNA over
here.

00:40:40.962 --> 00:40:45.476
This cannot bind DNA because
you don't have the chlorides

00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:50.151
together, so they cannot be
released and you won't interact

00:40:50.151 --> 00:40:53.617
with the DNA.
Again, these different isomers

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:56.841
have really, really different
properties.

00:40:56.841 --> 00:41:02.000
Here, we look at optical
isomers or enantiomers --

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.541
-- And introduce the idea of a
mirror plane,

00:41:05.541 --> 00:41:08.176
here.
When you have two different

00:41:08.176 --> 00:41:11.717
isomers, and if they are not
superimposable,

00:41:11.717 --> 00:41:16.576
that means there is a mirror
plane and that they are chiral.

00:41:16.576 --> 00:41:21.270
And chiral molecules can have
vastly different properties,

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:26.129
again, if they are in a chiral
environment such as the human

00:41:26.129 --> 00:41:30.000
body.
Let's just look at these two.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.190
See that there is a mirror
plane.

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:41.229
Here, we have the green on top,
the NH three on top,

00:41:41.229 --> 00:41:45.267
chloride in gray here on the
bottom, and then on the side we

00:41:45.267 --> 00:41:47.869
have the oxygens,
the black atoms here,

00:41:47.869 --> 00:41:51.086
more chlorides here;
on the other side there are

00:41:51.086 --> 00:41:55.125
also oxygens pointing out in
front, another NH three 

00:41:55.125 --> 00:41:59.328
group sort of putting in back.
And so they are very,

00:41:59.328 --> 00:42:01.985
very similar.
But if you try to superimpose

00:42:01.985 --> 00:42:04.959
them, you will realize that it
doesn't match up.

00:42:04.959 --> 00:42:08.502
If you try again other ways,
put another green over here,

00:42:08.502 --> 00:42:09.893
no, that is wrong,
too.

00:42:09.893 --> 00:42:13.436
And you can spend maybe not
very long convincing yourself

00:42:13.436 --> 00:42:16.157
that, in fact,
these are non-superimposable.

00:42:16.157 --> 00:42:19.446
They are mirror images,
so they are chiral compounds.

00:42:19.446 --> 00:42:22.673
And the idea of chiral
compounds, we will come back,

00:42:22.673 --> 00:42:26.279
and you will hear much more
about that if you take organic

00:42:26.279 --> 00:42:29.000
chemistry, 5.12 or 5.13.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.112
Now we have to get to some
business that we need to think

00:42:38.112 --> 00:42:41.271
more about the properties of
these elements.

00:42:41.271 --> 00:42:43.401
And that is,
we need to count.

00:42:43.401 --> 00:42:47.293
A lot of counting in these
units, oxidation-reduction,

00:42:47.293 --> 00:42:50.084
and also in this unit,
counting skills.

00:42:50.084 --> 00:42:54.271
We need to figure out how many
d-electrons are involved in

00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:58.163
coordination complexes to be
able to rationalize their

00:42:58.163 --> 00:43:02.396
properties.
This is pretty straightforward.

00:43:02.396 --> 00:43:06.494
One can figure this out,
what the d-electron count is,

00:43:06.494 --> 00:43:11.056
if you know the group number
from the periodic table and the

00:43:11.056 --> 00:43:15.231
oxidation number of the metal.
We know how to calculate

00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:20.025
oxidation numbers at this point,
and the periodic table in your

00:43:20.025 --> 00:43:22.500
book.
Let's just take a look at a

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.979
couple of examples and count
some d-electrons.

00:43:25.979 --> 00:43:30.000
Suppose we have a coordination
complex.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.064
It has cobalt in it,
it has six ammonia ligands,

00:43:34.064 --> 00:43:38.994
and it has a charge of plus
three for the overall complex.

00:43:38.994 --> 00:43:43.664
Then we
need to figure out what the

00:43:43.664 --> 00:43:46.691
oxidation number of cobalt is
first.

00:43:46.691 --> 00:43:49.545
What is the overall charge on
NH3?

00:43:49.545 --> 00:43:53.005
That is zero.
This is a neutral molecule.

00:43:53.005 --> 00:43:57.589
And if you don't know that,
this is something you will

00:43:57.589 --> 00:44:02.000
memorize as you go through this
unit.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.783
What does that leave you for,
for cobalt?

00:44:05.783 --> 00:44:10.986
Plus three, because it all has
to add up, just as it has

00:44:10.986 --> 00:44:13.918
before.
And so we figure out the

00:44:13.918 --> 00:44:17.608
oxidation number first.
And then second,

00:44:17.608 --> 00:44:20.540
we would figure out the
d-count.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:25.932
We need to look at the periodic
table and see where it is.

00:44:25.932 --> 00:44:32.765
Here we have cobalt in group 9.
We have group number 9 minus

00:44:32.765 --> 00:44:36.320
the oxidation number,
which is three,

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:41.160
that we just calculated,
and we are left with six.

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:46.888
And you will often see this
written as d to the six

00:44:46.888 --> 00:44:50.345
for the d-count number of
electrons.

00:44:50.345 --> 00:44:55.086
One year when I had this,
I think the first year,

00:44:55.086 --> 00:44:59.530
I actually had,
I think, 9 minus 3 equals 5 in

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:03.654
the handout.
And that was rather

00:45:03.654 --> 00:45:05.570
embarrassing.
Oh, wait.

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:10.447
I want to do one more example
first, or two more examples

00:45:10.447 --> 00:45:13.234
first.
Let's try just a couple of

00:45:13.234 --> 00:45:14.540
more.
All right.

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:19.852
There are some that will become
very familiar to you as you do

00:45:19.852 --> 00:45:22.813
these.
Let's look at nickel with CO

00:45:22.813 --> 00:45:26.297
ligands, four of them,
written like this.

00:45:26.297 --> 00:45:31.000
There is nothing
up here.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.937
That means that the overall
charge has to equal zero.

00:45:36.937 --> 00:45:43.444
CO, that is one that you will
come across, and its overall

00:45:43.444 --> 00:45:49.610
charge is also going to be zero.
It is neutral as well.

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:53.948
And so what does that leave for
nickel?

00:45:53.948 --> 00:45:57.716
Zero.
Sometimes not very exciting.

00:45:57.716 --> 00:46:03.753
All right.
If your oxidation number is

00:46:03.753 --> 00:46:12.094
zero, then we want to look up
and figure out what the d-count

00:46:12.094 --> 00:46:16.820
is.
We have to see where nickel is.

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:22.381
It is in group 10,
so we have 10 minus 0.

00:46:22.381 --> 00:46:31.000
It is a d ten system.
Let's just try one more.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.944
Cobalt, again,
two molecules of water,

00:46:35.944 --> 00:46:42.626
and one of NH three ,
and three of chloride,

00:46:42.626 --> 00:46:48.907
to the minus one.

00:46:48.907 --> 00:46:54.387
Let's put that up a little bit.
All right.

00:46:54.387 --> 00:47:00.000
Overall, this has to be minus
one.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.842
What is the charge on chloride
going to be?

00:47:03.842 --> 00:47:08.324
It will be minus one.
There will be three of them.

00:47:08.324 --> 00:47:10.520
NH3 was what again?
Zero.

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:14.728
Do you want to guess what water
is going to be?

00:47:14.728 --> 00:47:16.100
Zero.
Two zeros.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.302
What does that leave you for
cobalt?

00:47:19.302 --> 00:47:21.041
Plus two.
All right.

00:47:21.041 --> 00:47:25.066
Cobalt, we looked up before,
and it was in 9.

00:47:25.066 --> 00:47:31.735
Over here we have plus two.
And we have group 9 minus 2 is

00:47:31.735 --> 00:47:35.566
7, and so that is a d seven
system.

00:47:35.566 --> 00:47:39.031
That is how you will do those
problems.

00:47:39.031 --> 00:47:43.864
And you will need that on
Monday when we start talking

00:47:43.864 --> 00:47:49.062
about crystal field theory.
In the last couple of minutes,

00:47:49.062 --> 00:47:53.440
I want to remind you of the
shapes of d-orbitals.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:58.000
This is leading into what we
knew next.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.624
Again, we are thinking about
the shapes of the d-orbitals and

00:48:01.624 --> 00:48:05.187
the metals, and then we are
thinking about the shapes of the

00:48:05.187 --> 00:48:08.449
coordination complexes.
And we are trying to figure out

00:48:08.449 --> 00:48:12.255
whether the ligands are going to
be near the d-orbitals or away.

00:48:12.255 --> 00:48:15.214
And depending on how the
ligands are arranged with

00:48:15.214 --> 00:48:18.476
respect to the d-orbitals
changes the properties of the

00:48:18.476 --> 00:48:20.348
coordination complex.
All right.

00:48:20.348 --> 00:48:23.731
There are five d-orbitals.
And you should be able to draw

00:48:23.731 --> 00:48:27.123
them.
Again, the bar for successfully

00:48:27.123 --> 00:48:31.232
drawing the d-orbitals is you
have to do as well as I do when

00:48:31.232 --> 00:48:35.000
I try to draw the d-orbitals.
Again, it is a low bar for

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.465
drawing.
You just kind of need to get

00:48:37.465 --> 00:48:39.794
some of the general features
right.

00:48:39.794 --> 00:48:43.424
If we look at d z squared,
it has a maximum

00:48:43.424 --> 00:48:47.054
amplitude along the z-axis.
And in this course we will

00:48:47.054 --> 00:48:51.164
always try to keep the axes more
or less the same to help you

00:48:51.164 --> 00:48:53.150
out.
And they will be labeled,

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:55.273
so you know where the z-axis
is.

00:48:55.273 --> 00:49:00.000
Here is the z-axis,
and y is along the plane here.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.853
And x is coming out toward you.
There is x.

00:49:03.853 --> 00:49:07.981
And then you have a doughnut in
the x,y-plane.

00:49:07.981 --> 00:49:13.027
d x squared minus y squared
has maximum

00:49:13.027 --> 00:49:18.073
amplitudes along x and y.
It doesn't have anything along

00:49:18.073 --> 00:49:21.100
z.
The orbitals are along y in the

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:25.871
plane of the board and along x
coming out toward you,

00:49:25.871 --> 00:49:30.000
and also going behind the
screen.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.707
Then we have three more.
We have d(yz),

00:49:34.707 --> 00:49:41.274
and it has its amplitudes 45
degrees off the y and the

00:49:41.274 --> 00:49:45.486
z-axis.
Here is z up and down and y

00:49:45.486 --> 00:49:53.044
across the plane of the board.
And so these orbitals are drawn

00:49:53.044 --> 00:50:00.428
to be 45 degrees off those axes.
d(xy) is 45 degrees to the x

00:50:00.428 --> 00:50:05.197
and the z, so these are coming
out towards you and going

00:50:05.197 --> 00:50:09.880
behind, and also going up.
And then d(xy) is 45 degrees

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.696
off of y and x.
And you will need to know how

00:50:13.696 --> 00:50:18.726
to draw these and need to know
the shapes and to be able to

00:50:18.726 --> 00:50:23.235
think about them in 3D,
so that you can imagine where

00:50:23.235 --> 00:50:27.918
ligands are and how those
ligands are affected by these

00:50:27.918 --> 00:50:30.051
d-orbitals.
Have a great weekend.
