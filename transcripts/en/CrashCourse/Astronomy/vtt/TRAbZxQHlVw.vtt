00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.930
We live — and stop me if I’m going too
fast — on a planet.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.070
I mean, sure, duh. But this isn’t the natural
state of the Universe; or, at least, it’s

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.810
not the way things usually are. Most of the
Universe is pretty empty — that’s why

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.180
we call it “space” — and if I were to
magically transport you someplace randomly

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.040
in the cosmos, the chances are you’d be a million
light years from the nearest substantial object.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.240
Evolving on a planet has warped our sense
of physics. If I throw an object away from

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.770
me, it comes back. That’s bizarre! It should
just keep going, moving away from me at a

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.320
constant speed. Instead though it goes up,
slows, stops, then falls back down toward me.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.010
The difference between living on a planet
and being in deep space is gravity. Gravity

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.160
from an object goes on forever, but it gets
weaker rapidly with distance. A zillion light

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.520
years away, the Earth’s gravity is fantastically
weak, but here on Earth it’s literally a force to be

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.460
reckoned with. And in some places it can be a lot
stronger than what we experience right here.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.240
For most of history, gravity was just a fact
of life, neither understood nor examined terribly

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.930
closely. In the mid 1600s, scientists like
Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton started investigating

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.110
it using math — in fact, the two men got
into a bitter feud over who thought of what

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.590
first. But whoever it was who first got it
right, now we have a much better understanding

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.880
of how gravity works.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.180
One thing before we get to gravity. An important
concept that comes up a lot is mass. It’s

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.619
a bit tricky to define, but you can think
of it as how much stuff makes up an object.

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.279
I know, that’s not very scientific sounding,
but it’s not a bad way to think about it.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.280
Something with more mass has more stuff in it.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.500
Size doesn’t really play into this; two
objects can have the same mass but one can

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.990
be much larger than the other. In that case,
the bigger object’s mass is more spread

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.420
out, so we say it has lower density, where density
is how much mass is inside a given volume.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.600
In science terms, mass tells us how much an
object resists having its motion changed.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.340
An object with more mass is harder to get
moving than an object with less mass, which

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.450
is pretty obvious if you’ve ever tried pushing
on a toy car versus a real truck. But mass

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.490
is also defined using gravity.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.620
Everything that has mass also has gravity
and can inflict this force on another object.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.840
The amount of force you feel from the gravity
of an object like a planet depends on three

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.330
things: How much mass it has, how much mass
you have, and how far away you are from it.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.120
In fact, distance dominates here; the force
of gravity weakens with the square of the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.320
distance. Double your distance from an object
and the force of gravity drops by 2 x 2 = 4

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.940
times. Go 10 times farther away and the force
drops by 10 x 10 = 100 times.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.700
Gravity is also attractive: It can only draw
things in, not repel them. But how it attracts

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.239
things is where it gets fun.

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.420
If I hold up a rock and let go of it, it falls
to the ground. What might be hard to see is

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.239
that it gets faster the longer it drops. Forces
accelerate objects, so the longer the force

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.780
acts, the more the object’s velocity changes
– in this case getting faster. If I drop

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.209
a rock from higher up, it’ll move faster
when it hits the ground. Other forces act

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.950
on moving objects, as well, like friction
and air resistance, counteracting gravity,

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.560
making this acceleration hard to see. But in
space, the force of gravity becomes very clear.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.500
Two objects that have mass will attract each
other. If there are no other forces acting

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.709
on them, they’ll accelerate toward each
other until they meet. Remember, though, that

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.319
the force of gravity depends on those masses.
If one is really massive, and the other not

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.720
so much, then in more practical terms the
massive one will pull in the less massive

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.480
one. The more massive one does move, but much
less than the other one.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.030
When objects are free to move under the effects
of gravity, we say they are in orbit. The

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.129
simplest kind of orbit may not be what you
think: It’s actually just a line! When you

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.489
drop a rock, it’s very briefly in orbit.
Ignoring things like the Earth’s rotation

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.680
(which adds a bit of sideways motion) it’s
close enough to say the rock just falls straight

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.620
down, and is stopped because the Earth itself
gets in the way.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.379
That’s not a terribly interesting orbit!
So what if, instead of dropping the rock,

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.209
we throw it? That gives it a little bit of
sideways motion, so instead of hitting the

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.069
ground at my feet, it hits a bit farther away.
If I throw it harder, it moves horizontally

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.590
even more before it hits.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.539
What if I throw it really hard?

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.419
This is where Newton’s genius comes in.
He realized that if you throw the ball hard

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.779
enough sideways, it will fall at the exact
same rate the Earth would curve away underneath

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:30.830
it. As Douglas Adams said in “Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy,” flying is just falling

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.129
and missing the ground. It turns out, that’s
exactly what orbiting is, too.

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:40.259
A rock thrown hard enough sideways will fall
toward the Earth, but always miss it, going

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:45.669
instead into a circular path around it, guided
only by gravity. It will orbit the Earth in

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.639
a circle, taking about 90 minutes to go around
the planet once.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.860
Circles are simple orbits. The speed at which
the orbiting satellite travels depends on

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.539
the mass of the object it’s orbiting, and
its distance from it. The farther it is, the

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.419
weaker gravity is, so it doesn’t have to
travel as quickly to maintain the orbit.

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.069
Roughly 400 years ago, the astronomer Johannes
Kepler realized that there can be other shapes

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:12.139
of orbits as well. He discovered the planets
orbit the Sun on ellipses, when previously

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.569
it was thought they orbited in perfect circles.
An elliptical orbit happens when you throw

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:20.270
the rock sideways even harder than it takes
for a circular orbit; it goes up higher on

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.860
one end of the orbit than on the other.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.050
In fact, the harder you throw the rock, the
more elongated the orbit gets. An orbit like

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.460
this is still closed; that is, the orbit repeats
itself and the rock is still bound to the

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.400
Earth by gravity. At some point, though if
you throw the rock hard enough, an amazing

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.280
thing happens: It can escape.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.060
Remember, gravity gets weaker with distance.
If you throw a rock hard enough, while gravity

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:46.069
can slow it down, the gravity gets weaker
the farther away the rock is. If the rock

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:51.770
has enough velocity, gravity weakens too quickly
to stop it. The rock can escape, moving away

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.039
forever, so we call this the escape velocity.

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.409
The escape velocity of an object like a planet
or star depends on how much mass it has and

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:03.129
how big it is. For the Earth, that turns out
to be about 11 kilometers per second — for

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:08.669
Jupiter, it’s about 58 kilometers per second,
and for the Sun it’s a whopping 600 kilometers

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.819
per second. Whatever the particular escape
velocity for your cosmic location is, if you

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:18.409
fling a rock away from it faster than that,
I hope you kissed it goodbye first, ‘cause

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:22.399
it ain’t coming back. One way to think of
it is that the rock is always slowing, getting

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:28.270
ever closer to stopping, but it never actually
stops. If it could travel infinitely far away,

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.930
it would stop, but that’s kind of a long
trip.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.410
This works in reverse, too. If I go way far
away from the Earth and drop a rock, it’ll

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.720
accelerate. When it hits the planet it’ll
be moving at escape velocity, that same 11

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:43.759
kilometers per second. And if I give it a
little sideways kick, it’ll miss the Earth

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.969
but still pass us at escape velocity. An escape
orbit is open — it doesn’t come back — and

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:50.300
is shaped like a parabola.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.289
What if you throw the rock even harder than
that? The rock doesn’t come back, and moves

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:59.559
away even faster. The orbit is now a hyperbola,
which is similar to a parabola, but is even

00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:04.509
more open. The rock never stops, even at infinity.
It just keeps movin’ on.

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:08.889
Like all forces, gravity gets weaker with
distance. But its force never quite drops

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:12.939
to zero; it just gets smaller and smaller
as you get farther and farther away.

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:16.419
So why then are astronauts on the space station
“weightless”?

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.740
Gravity is still pulling on the astronauts!
In fact, at the height of the station, Earth’s

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.360
gravity has only decreased by a little bit;
it’s still about 90% as strong as it is

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.120
on the Earth’s surface. If they were in
a tower 320 kilometers high they’d weigh

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.379
90% of what they do on the Earth’s surface.
But the big difference is that the astronauts

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:39.419
are in orbit, falling around the Earth. Weight
is actually not just the force of gravity

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:44.509
on a mass, but how hard a surface pushes back
on that mass. For example, when you stand

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:49.399
on the ground, the ground pushes back. Otherwise
you’d fall through! The force of the ground

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:52.289
back on you is what causes you to have weight.

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:56.709
In free fall, there’s nothing pushing back.
You’re falling freely, and so you have no

00:07:56.709 --> 00:08:00.169
weight. NASA likes to call this condition
“microgravity,” since there are subtle

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:01.330
forces acting on you.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.770
This actually highlights the difference between
mass and weight. In space you have the same

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:10.169
mass as you do on Earth, but no weight. If
another astronaut pushed on you they’d have

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:14.469
to exert a force, but if you stood on a scale
in space it wouldn’t register anything.

00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:17.559
Space is weird. Well, compared to Earth.

00:08:17.559 --> 00:08:23.489
One more thing, and this is truly weird: Photons,
particles of light, have no mass, yet they

00:08:23.489 --> 00:08:28.069
can be affected by gravity, too, bending their
direction of flight as they pass a massive

00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:33.300
object! It turns out gravity can actually
warp space! Light travels along the fabric

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.269
of space like a truck on the road, and if
the road curves, so does the truck. I know

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:41.300
this is an odd concept, and we’ll be dealing
with it later in more detail when we push

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.490
escape velocity to its limits… with black
holes.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:49.250
Today you learned that gravity is a force,
and everything with mass has gravity. Gravity

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:55.060
accelerates object, changing their speed and/or
direction. An object moving along a path controlled

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.730
by gravity is said to be in orbit, and there
are many different kinds: straight lines,

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.509
circles, ellipses, parabolae, and hyperbolae.
You can’t ever escape gravity, but if you

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:08.540
travel faster than escape velocity for an
object you’ll get away from it without falling

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:13.860
back. And if you’re in orbit, in freefall,
you have no weight, but you still have mass.
