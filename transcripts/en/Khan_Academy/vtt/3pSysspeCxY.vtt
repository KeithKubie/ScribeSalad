00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.190
- [Instructor] In this video,
we're gonna think about how

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.240
trade affects the total
economic surplus in a market,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.960
and we're also gonna think about tariffs,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.990
which are a per unit
charge that a government

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.720
will often put on some type of
good that is being imported,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.580
usually to protect a domestic industry,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.230
but sometimes it's also to raise revenue.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.710
So, right over here,
we have a simple model

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.910
for the sugar market in some country.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.090
And we're originally
initially going to assume

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.630
that this country is
operating in isolation.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.280
So, this is the supply curve
for the suppliers of sugar

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.600
in that country, and then
this is the demand curve

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.950
for the people who would want
to use sugar in that country.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.720
And you can see the equilibrium

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.590
price and quantity in that country.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.590
Now, in this world, we've
reviewed this in many videos,

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.730
what's the total economic surplus?

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.810
Well, the total economic surplus would be

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.260
defined by this triangle right over here.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.240
It's the area above the supply

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.140
curve and below the demand curve.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.140
And we know that the part
above this horizontal line

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.300
at the price of three, this
would be the consumer surplus;

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.330
and then down here, this
would be the producer surplus.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.810
Now, let's say that this market opens up

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.460
to the world, to the world price.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.350
And let's say when it does
so, it does not affect

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.010
the world price itself, the
world market is so large,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.720
and let's say this country's
market is relatively small.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.820
And so, the world market,
let's say that sugar

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.050
is trading at $1.50 per pound.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.821
So, this right over
here is the world price,

00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:44.450
$1.50 per pound, let me
write it right over there.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.450
So, this is our world, our world price.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.530
Now, if we assume that it's opened up

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.623
to this world price, what will happen?

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.340
Well, at the world price,
the consumers in this market,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.730
the people who are using the sugar,

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.320
well, they're going to use a lot more.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.460
At $1.50, the place where that

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.580
intersects the demand curve is out here.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.810
So, now, what is the consumer surplus

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.580
in this country, in this market?

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.800
Well, the consumer surplus in this

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.220
country is now much larger.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.350
It contains the triangle
that it contained before,

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.450
and then all of this area
that I am now shading in.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.900
And that has come at the
cost of the producer surplus.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.270
The producers in this
country, or in this market,

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.840
they are now only getting that

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.880
producer of surplus right over there.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.760
But if you look at the total economic

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.090
surplus, it has definitely grown.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.100
The total economic surplus,
instead of just being that

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.060
original triangle, it has
now extended to include

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.950
this entire area that goes
all the way out there.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.790
And you could see that
that completely contains

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.830
the previous total economic surplus,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.020
which we had right over here.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.270
So, theoretically, when a market opens up

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.460
to the world price like this,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.880
it's going to increase your
total economic surplus.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.300
And if that world price is
below the equilibrium price

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.830
in your isolated economy,
then it's probably going to be

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.220
to the benefit of the
consumers, but the producers

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.550
are going to lose out on
some of their surplus.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.000
Now, let's say that a
government comes into power

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.450
in this market, and says,
hey, I've been elected

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.570
by the sugar producers of this country.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.030
I don't like this thing going on.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.760
Our sugar producers in our
country are getting hurt a lot,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.150
and they're a big voting block,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.420
so I am going to enact a tariff.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.030
And once again, a tariff
is a per unit charge,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.980
or it's oftentimes a per unit charge.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.980
And let's say the tariff
is 50 cents per pound,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.800
per pound on imported sugar.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.830
Well, then what is the world
price going to look like

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.040
to the market that we're talking about?

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.090
Well then, for the
consumers in this market,

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.260
instead of being able to get
the world price at $1.50,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.090
they would have to pay 50 cents
per pound higher than that.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.090
So, the tariff would make
the price go over here.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.420
So, in that situation,
what has just happened?

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.670
Well, now, where we
intersect the demand curve

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.360
is a lower quantity than
when we used the world price.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.330
At the world price, we were consuming

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.480
a lot of sugar in this market,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.680
and now we're going to consume
a little bit less sugar.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.140
But since, even with the
tariff, our price is still lower

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.840
than our previous equilibrium price,

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.420
when we were operating in isolation,

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.690
we're still consuming more
sugar, using more sugar,

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.890
demanding more sugar in this market

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.440
than we were when we did not
have it opened up to trade.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.570
Now, what did this tariff
do to the surpluses?

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.080
Well, the consumer
surplus has now gone down

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.330
relative to the free trade scenario.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.760
We've lost this area down here.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.350
So, now, the consumer surplus,

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.970
I will shade it in this blue color.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.690
And we have increased the
domestic producer surplus.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.400
It has increased to this, right over here.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.000
But what about this region that we seem,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.430
that seems to no longer be there,

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.560
either in the consumer
or the producer surplus?

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.240
Well, some of it is
the government revenue.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.140
What's the government revenue going to be?

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.800
Well, it's going to be the amount

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.000
of the tariff times the quantity.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.100
So, the amount of the tariff
is going to be that 50 cents,

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.870
so that's that height right over there.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.140
And then what's the quantity that

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.960
they're getting that tariff on?

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.620
Well, this whole section right over

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.620
here is the imported quantity.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.810
This section right over here
is the domestic production,

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.910
and this is the imported quantity,

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.230
so the imported quantity times the tariff,

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.820
so this area right over here,

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.530
that is going to be government revenue.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.210
But you do have some of
that total economic surplus

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.930
that is just, becomes deadweight loss now.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.690
You have this region right over here

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.610
that is now deadweight
loss, and this region

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.270
right over here that is deadweight loss.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.660
So, I'll leave you there.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.500
As you can see here, that
when you open up to trade,

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.270
theoretically, it increases
the total economic surplus.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.900
But that could have
consequences on the producers.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.080
And actually, there's
cases where it can have

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.620
consequences on the users of whatever,

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.800
or the people who are the
buyers in this market.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.940
And many times, a government
will enact a tariff.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.740
Now, you can see that that tariff

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.250
will reduce the total economic surplus.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.810
Some of that will go towards revenue,

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.560
while other parts of it will
just be deadweight loss.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.840
Another idea that a
government might sometimes do

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.610
is an idea of a quota,
where they're saying,

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.830
hey, we just don't like the total amount

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.340
of imports that are happening,

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.310
so they might just put a cap on it.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.460
I'll let you think about how
you might deal with a quota

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.753
and how that might also
affect the economic surplus.
