00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.849
Let's add 536 to 398.

00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:05.140
I'm going to do it two
different ways so that we really

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.309
understand what this
carrying is all about.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:09.350
So first we'll do it in
the more traditional way.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.474
We start in the ones place.

00:00:10.474 --> 00:00:12.180
We say, well, what's 6 plus 8?

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.955
Well, we know that 6
plus 8 is equal to 14.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.610
And so when we write it down
here in the sum, we could say,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.330
well, look, the four is in the
ones place, so it's equal to 4

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.150
plus one 10 So let's write
that one 10 in the tens place.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.220
And now we focus
on the tens place.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.250
We have 1 ten, plus
3 tens, plus 9 tens.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.870
So what's that going to get us?

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.290
1 plus 3 plus 9 is equal to 13.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.500
Now, we have to remind
ourselves, this is 13 tens.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.830
This is 13 tens.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.510
Or another way of thinking
about it, this is 3 tens.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.157
This is 3 tens and 100.

00:00:59.157 --> 00:01:00.240
You might say, wait, wait.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.740
How does that make sense?

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.240
Remember, this is
in the tens place.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.500
When we're adding a 1 ten
plus the 3 tens plus 9 tens,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:14.170
we're actually adding 10 plus 30
plus 90, and we're getting 130.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.926
And so we're putting the 30.

00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:18.730
The 3 in the tens place
represents the 30.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.420
So this is the 3.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.690
The 3 represents the 30.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.390
And then we're placing this
1 in the hundreds place.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.550
10 tens is equal to 100.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.800
And now we're adding
up the hundreds place.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:40.650
1 plus 5 plus 3 is
equal to-- let's see,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.050
1 plus 5 is equal to 6,
plus 3 is equal to 9.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.440
But we have to remind
ourselves, this is 900.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.690
This is in the hundreds place.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.810
So this is actually 100-- I want
to make all colors the same.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:05.200
So this is actually
100 plus 500 plus 300.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.260
Let me get the
color coding right.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.350
Plus 300 is equal to 900.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.270
And that's exactly
what we got here.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.520
100 plus 500 plus 300 is
equal to 900, and we're done.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.690
This is equal to 934.
