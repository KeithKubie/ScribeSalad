00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:13.281
If you visit a museum with a collection
of modern and contemporary art,

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:16.863
you're likely to see works that sometimes
elicit the response,

00:00:16.863 --> 00:00:21.138
"My cat could make that,
so how is it art?"

00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:25.708
A movement called Abstract Expressionism,
also known as the New York School,

00:00:25.708 --> 00:00:29.216
gets this reaction particularly often.

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:32.372
Abstract Expressionism started in 1943

00:00:32.372 --> 00:00:35.204
and developed after the end of
World War II.

00:00:35.204 --> 00:00:39.461
It's characterized by large,
primarily abstract paintings,

00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:42.960
all-over compositions 
without clear focal points,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.919
and sweeping swaths of paint
embodying and eliciting emotions.

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:52.140
The group of artists who are considered
Abstract Expressionists

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.647
includes Barnett Newman 
with his existential zips,

00:00:55.647 --> 00:00:59.376
Willem de Kooning, famous 
for his travestied women,

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:02.688
Helen Frankenthaler, 
who created soak-stains,

00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:04.050
and others.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.978
But perhaps the most famous, influential,
and head-scratching one

00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:09.997
was Jackson Pollock.

00:01:09.997 --> 00:01:12.711
Most of his paintings 
are immediately recognizable.

00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:15.765
They feature tangled messes
of lines of paint

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:19.247
bouncing around in every direction
on the canvas.

00:01:19.247 --> 00:01:22.814
And sure, these fields of chaos are big
and impressive,

00:01:22.814 --> 00:01:24.973
but what's so great about them?

00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:27.579
Didn't he just drip the paint at random?

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.351
Can't anyone do that?

00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:33.276
Well, the answer to these questions
is both yes and no.

00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:37.777
While Pollock implemented a technique
anyone is technically capable of

00:01:37.777 --> 00:01:39.453
regardless of artistic training,

00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:42.315
only he could have made his paintings.

00:01:42.315 --> 00:01:45.022
This paradox relates to his work's roots

00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:50.337
in the Surrealist automatic drawings
of AndrÃ© Masson and others.

00:01:50.337 --> 00:01:54.131
These Surrealists supposedly drew
directly from the unconscious

00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:57.450
to reveal truths hidden 
within their minds.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.733
Occasionally, instead of picturing 
something and then drawing it,

00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:04.048
they let their hands move automatically

00:02:04.048 --> 00:02:09.266
and would later tease out familiar figures
that appeared in the scribbles.

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:11.968
And after Pollock moved away 
from representation,

00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:16.734
he made drip, or action, paintings
following a similar premise,

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:19.494
though he developed a signature technique

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:24.040
and never looked for images or messages
hidden in the works.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.060
First, he took the canvas off of the easel
and laid it on the floor,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.478
a subversive act in itself.

00:02:30.478 --> 00:02:34.726
Then, in a controlled dance, he stepped
all around the canvas,

00:02:34.726 --> 00:02:39.678
dripping industrial paint onto it
from stirrers and other tools,

00:02:39.678 --> 00:02:41.490
changing speed and direction

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.861
to control how the paint 
made contact with the surface.

00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:48.403
These movements, 
like the Surrealist scribbles,

00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:51.910
were supposedly born 
out of Pollock's subconscious.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.934
But unlike the Surrealists,

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:57.101
whose pictures represented 
the mind's hidden contents,

00:02:57.101 --> 00:03:01.798
Pollock's supposedly made physical
manifestations of his psyche.

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:05.719
His paintings are themselves
signatures of his mind.

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.975
In theory, anyone could make a painting
that is an imprint of their mind.

00:03:09.975 --> 00:03:11.997
So why is Pollock so special?

00:03:11.997 --> 00:03:16.537
Well, it's important to remember that
while anyone could have done what he did,

00:03:16.537 --> 00:03:21.235
he and the rest of the New York School
were the ones who actually did it.

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:25.036
They destroyed conventions of painting
that had stood for centuries,

00:03:25.036 --> 00:03:28.412
forcing the art world to rethink
them entirely.

00:03:28.412 --> 00:03:32.891
But one last reason why Jackson Pollock's
work has stayed prominent

00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:38.367
stems from the specific objects he made,
which embody fascinating contradictions.

00:03:38.367 --> 00:03:41.094
For instance, while Pollock's process

00:03:41.094 --> 00:03:44.480
resulted in radically flat 
painted surfaces,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.631
the web of painted lines can create
the illusion of an infinite layered depth

00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:52.939
when examined up close.

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.097
And the chaos of this tangled mess seems
to defy all control,

00:03:57.097 --> 00:03:59.479
but it's actually the product
of a deliberate,

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.211
though not pre-planned, process.

00:04:02.211 --> 00:04:06.301
These characteristics made Pollock
into a celebrity,

00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:07.653
and within art history,

00:04:07.653 --> 00:04:10.422
they also elevated him 
to the mythified status

00:04:10.422 --> 00:04:13.450
of the genius artist as hero.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.212
So rather than evening the playing field
for all creative minds,

00:04:17.212 --> 00:04:23.585
his work unfortunately reinforced
a long-standing elitist aspect of art.

00:04:23.585 --> 00:04:24.296
Elitist,

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:25.067
innovative,

00:04:25.067 --> 00:04:26.553
whatever you choose to call it,

00:04:26.553 --> 00:04:28.975
the history embedded 
in Abstract Expressionism

00:04:28.975 --> 00:04:32.953
is one that no cat, however talented,
can claim.
