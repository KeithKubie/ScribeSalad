00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.800
This is an animal. 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.230
This is also an animal.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.380
Animal. Animal. Animal carcass. Animal. Animal.
Animal carcass again. Animal.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.210
The thing that all of these other things have
in common is that they're made out of the

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.830
same basic building block: the animal cell.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.900
Animals are made up of your run-of-the-mill eukaryotic
cells. These are called eukaryotic because

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.589
they have a "true kernel," in the Greek.
A "good nucleus".

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:37.989
And that contains the DNA and calls the shots
for the rest of the cell

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.319
also containing a bunch of organelles.

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:44.050
A bunch of different kinds of organelles and
they all have very specific functions.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.600
And all this is surrounded by the cell membrane.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.879
Of course, plants have eukaryotic cells too,
but theirs are set up a little bit differently,

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.339
of course they have organelles that allow
them to make their own food which is super

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:54.489
nice. &nbsp;We don't have those.

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.629
And also their cell membrane is actually a
cell wall that's made of cellulose. It's rigid,

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.129
which is why plants can't dance.

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.309
If you want to know all about plant cells,
we did a whole video on it and you can click

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.500
on it here if it's online yet. It might not
be.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.130
Though a lot of the stuff in this video is
going to apply to all eukaryotic cells, which

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.170
includes plants, fungi and protists. &nbsp;

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.899
Now, rigid cells walls are cool and all, but
one of the reasons animals have been so successful

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.770
is that their flexible membrane, in addition
to allowing them the ability to dance, gives

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.030
animals the flexibility to create a bunch
of different cell types and organs types and

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.100
tissue types that could never be possible
in a plant. The cell walls that protect plants

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.159
and give them structure prevent them from
evolving complicated nerve structures and

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.090
muscle cells, that allow animals to be such
a powerful force for eating plants.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.520
Animals can move around, find shelter and
food, find things to mate with

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.969
all that good stuff. &nbsp;In fact, the ability
to move oneself around using specialized muscle

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.759
tissue has been 100% trademarked by kingdom
Animalia.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.469
&gt;&gt;OFF CAMERA: Ah! What about protozoans?

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.850
Excellent point! What about protozoans?

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.829
They don't have specialized muscle tissue.
&nbsp;They move around with cillia and flagella

00:01:58.829 --> 00:01:59.770
and that kind of thing.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.600
So, way back in 1665, British scientist Robert
Hooke discovered cells with his kinda crude,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.080
beta version microscope. He called them "cells"
because hey looked like bare, spartan monks'

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.350
bedrooms with not much going on inside.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.640
Hooke was a smart guy and everything, but
he could not have been more wrong about what

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.600
was going on inside of a cell. &nbsp;There is
a whole lot going on inside of a eukaryotic

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.540
cell. It's more like a city than a monk's
cell. &nbsp;In fact, let's go with that

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.640
a cell is like a city.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.940
It has defined geographical limits, a ruling
government, power plants, roads, waste treatment

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.750
plants, a police force, industry...all the
things a booming metropolis needs to run smoothly.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.960
&nbsp;But this city does not have one of those
hippie governments where everybody votes on

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.720
stuff and talks things out at town hall meetings
and crap like that. &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;Think fascist

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.280
Italy circa 1938. &nbsp;Think Kim Jong Il's-

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.800
I mean, think Kim Jong-Un's North Korea, and
you might be getting a closer idea of how

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.330
eukaryotic cells do their business.
&nbsp;

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.220
Let's start out with city limits.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.320
So, as you approach the city of Eukaryopolis
there's a chance that you will notice something

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.310
that a traditional city never has, which is either
cilia or flagella. &nbsp;Some eukaryotic cells

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.540
have either one or the other of these structures--cilia
being a bunch of little tiny arms that wiggle

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.270
around and flagella being one long whip-like
tail. &nbsp;Some cells have neither. Sperm cells,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.210
for instance, have flagella, and our lungs
and throat cells have cilia that push mucus

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.950
up and out of our lungs. &nbsp;Cilia and flagella
are made of long protein fibers called microtubules,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.700
and they both have the same basic structure:
9 pairs of microtubules forming a ring around

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.780
2 central microtubules. This is often called
the 9+2 structure. Anyway, just so you know--when

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.970
you're approaching city, watch out for the
cilia and flagella!

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.150
If you make it past the cilia, you'll encounter
what's called a cell membrane, which is

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.290
kind of squishy, not rigid, plant cell wall,
which totally encloses the city and all its

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.330
contents. &nbsp;It's also in charge of monitoring
what comes in and out of the cell--kinda like

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.370
the fascist border police. The cell membrane
has selective permeability, meaning that it

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.450
can choose what molecules come in and out
of the cells, for the most part. &nbsp;

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.080
And I did an entire video on this, which you
can check out right here.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.120
Now the landscape of Eukaryopolis, it's important
to note, is kind of wet and squishy. It's

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.690
a bit of a swampland.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.370
Each eukaryotic cell is filled with a solution
of water and nutrients called cytoplasm. &nbsp;And

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.580
inside this cytoplasm is a sort of scaffolding
called the cytoskeleton, it's basically just

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.290
a bunch of protein strands that reinforce
the cell. &nbsp;Centrosomes are a special part

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.140
of this reinforcement; they assemble long
microtubules out of proteins that act like

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.980
steel girders that hold all the city's buildings
together.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.940
The cytoplasm provides the infrastructure
necessary for all the organelles to do all

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.320
of their awesome, amazing business, with the
notable exception of the nucleus, which has

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.120
its own special cytoplasm called "nucleoplasm"
which is a more luxurious, premium environment

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.310
befitting the cell's Beloved Leader. But
we'll get to that in a minute. &nbsp;

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.080
First, let's talk about the cell's highway
system, the endoplasmic reticulum, or just

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.540
ER, are organelles that create a network of
membranes that carry stuff around the cell.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.870
These membranes are phospholipid bilayers.
The same as in the cell membrane.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.110
There are two types of ER: there's the rough
and the smooth. They are fairly similar, but

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.650
slightly different shapes and slightly different
functions. The rough ER looks bumpy because

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.020
it has ribosomes attached to it, and the smooth
ER doesn't, so it's a smooth network of

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.380
tubes.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.610
Smooth ER acts as a kind of factory-warehouse
in the cell city. It contains enzymes that

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.710
help with the creation of important lipids,
which you'll recall from our talk about

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.400
biological molecules -- i.e. phosopholipids
and steroids that turn out to be sex hormones.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.410
Other enzymes in the smooth ER specialize
in detoxifying substances, like the noxious

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.900
stuff derived from drugs and alcohol, which
they do by adding a carboxyl group to them,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.270
making them soluble in water.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.350
Finally, the smooth ER also stores ions in
solutions that the cell may need later on,

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.610
especially sodium ions, which are used for
energy in muscle cells. &nbsp;

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.550
So the smooth ER helps make lipids, while
the rough ER helps in the synthesis and packaging of proteins.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.240
And the proteins are created by another typer
of organelle called the ribosome. Ribosomes

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.120
can float freely throughout the cytoplasm
or be attached to the nuclear envelope, which

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:56.290
is where they're spat out from, and their
job is to assemble amino acids into polypeptides.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.940
As the ribosome builds an amino acid chain,
the chain is pushed into the ER. When the

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.830
protein chain is complete, the ER pinches
it off and sends it to the Golgi apparatus.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.720
In the city that is a cell, the Golgi is the
post office, processing proteins and packaging

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.260
them up before sending them wherever they
need to go. Calling it an apparatus makes

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.630
it sound like a bit of complicated machinery,
which it kind of is, because it's made up

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.050
of these stacks of membranous layers that
are sometimes called Golgi bodies. The Golgi

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.030
bodies can cut up large proteins into smaller
hormones and can combine proteins with carbohydrates

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.760
to make various molecules, like, for instance,
snot. &nbsp;

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.900
The bodies package these little goodies into
sacs called vesicles, which have phosopholipid

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.230
walls just like the main cell membrane, then
ships them out, either to other parts of the

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.220
cell or outside the cell wall. We learn more
about how vesicles do this in the next episode

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.160
of Crash Course.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.730
The Golgi bodies also put the finishing touches
on the lysosomes. Lysosomes are basically

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.040
the waste treatment plants and recycling centers
of the city. These organelles are basically

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.780
sacks full of enzymes that break down cellular
waste and debris from outside of the cell

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.570
and turn it into simple compounds, which are
transferred into the cytoplasm as new cell-building materials.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:11.570
Now, finally, let us talk about the nucleus,
the Beloved Leader. &nbsp;The nucleus is a highly

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.860
specialized organelle that lives in its own
double-membraned, high-security compound with

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.810
its buddy the nucleolus. &nbsp;And within the
cell, the nucleus is in charge in a major

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.370
way. &nbsp;Because it stores the cell's DNA, it
has all the information the cell needs to do its job.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.850
So the nucleus makes the laws for the city

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.150
and orders the other organelles around, telling
them how and when to grow, what to metabolize,

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.090
what proteins to synthesize, how and when
to divide. The nucleus does all this by using

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.930
the information blueprinted in its DNA to
build proteins that will facilitate a specific

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:48.930
job getting done. &nbsp;For instance, on January
1st, 2012, lets say a liver cell needs to

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.430
help break down an entire bottle of champagne.
The nucleus in that liver cell would start

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:59.540
telling the cell to make alcohol dehydrogenase,
which is the enzyme that makes alcohol not-alcohol

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:05.240
anymore. This protein synthesis business is
complicated, so lucky for you, we will have

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.090
or may already have an entire video about
how it happens.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:13.669
The nucleus holds its precious DNA, along
with some proteins, in a weblike substance

00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:18.070
called chromatin. When it comes time for the
cell to split, the chromatin gathers into

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.860
rod-shaped chromosomes, each of which holds
DNA molecules. Different species of animals

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.930
have different numbers of chromosomes. We
humans have 46. Fruit flies have 8. Hedgehogs,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.479
which are adorable, are less complex than
humans and have 90

00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:36.389
Now the nucleolus, which lives inside the
nucleus, is the only organelle that's not

00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:41.479
enveloped by its own membrane--it's just
a gooey splotch of stuff within the nucleus.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:46.699
Its main job is creating ribosomal RNA, or
rRNA, which it then combines with some proteins

00:08:46.699 --> 00:08:51.240
to form the basic units of ribosomes. Once
these units are done, the nucleolus spits

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:56.059
them out of the nuclear envelope, where they
are fully assembled into ribosomes. The nucleus

00:08:56.059 --> 00:09:01.509
then sends orders in the form of messenger
RNA, or mRNA, to those ribosomes, which are

00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:04.740
the henchmen that carry out the orders in
the rest of the cell.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:11.019
How exactly the ribosomes do this is immensely
complex and awesome, so awesome, in fact,

00:09:11.019 --> 00:09:14.629
that we're going to give it the full Crash
Course treatment in an entire episode.

00:09:14.629 --> 00:09:20.379
And now for what is, totally objectively speaking
of course, the coolest part of an animal cell:

00:09:20.379 --> 00:09:26.689
its power plants! &nbsp;The mitochondria are these
smooth, oblong organelles where the amazing

00:09:26.689 --> 00:09:31.480
and super-important process of respiration
takes place. This is where energy is derived

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.069
from carbohydrates, fats and other fuels and
is converted into adenosine triphosphate or

00:09:36.069 --> 00:09:40.819
ATP, which is like the main currency that
drives life in Eukaryopolis. You can learn

00:09:40.819 --> 00:09:44.990
more about ATP and respiration in an episode
that we did on that.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:49.029
Now of course, some cells, like muscle cells
or neuron cells need a lot more power than

00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:53.949
the average cell in the body, so those cells
have a lot more mitochondria per cell. &nbsp;

00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:58.759
But maybe the coolest thing about mitochondria
is that long ago animal cells didn't have

00:09:58.759 --> 00:10:02.490
them, but they existed as their own sort of
bacterial cell.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.379
One day, one of these things ended up inside
of an animal cell, probably because the animal

00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:11.509
cell was trying to eat it, but instead of
eating it, it realized that this thing was

00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:17.779
really super smart and good at turning food
into energy and it just kept it. It stayed around.

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:21.999
And to this day they sort of act like their
own, separate organisms, like they do their

00:10:21.999 --> 00:10:25.839
own thing within the cell, they replicate
themselves, and they even contain a small

00:10:25.839 --> 00:10:26.949
amount of DNA.

00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:32.420
What may be even more awesome -- if that's
possible -- is that mitochondria are in the

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:36.800
egg cell when an egg gets fertilized, and
those mitochondria have DNA. But because mitochondria

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.660
replicate themselves in a separate fashion,
it doesn't get mixed with the DNA of the father,

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.850
it's just the mother's mitochondrial DNA.
That means that your and my mitochondrial

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:49.429
DNA is exactly the same as the mitochondrial
DNA of our mothers. And because this special

00:10:49.429 --> 00:10:53.670
DNA is isolated in this way, scientists can
actually track back and back and back and

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:59.749
back to a single "Mitochondrial Eve" who lived
about 200,000 years ago in Africa. &nbsp;

00:10:59.749 --> 00:11:06.540
All of that complication and mystery and beauty
in one of the cells of your body. It's complicated,

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.519
yes. But worth understanding.

00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:13.480
Review time! Another somewhat complicated
episode of Crash Course Biology. If you want

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.809
to go back and watch any of the stuff we talked
