00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:40.480
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.980
DON DODGE: Hi, I'm Don
Dodge, and this

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.890
is Google Root Access.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.960
Today we're going to talk
about advisory boards.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.700
Should your startup have
an advisory board?

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.430
Who do you look for to find
on that advisory board?

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.840
And just how do you do it?

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.240
My guest today is David Gurle.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.220
David has been on both
sides of the table.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.960
He's been an adviser to
several companies.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.580
And he's been a CEO who has
built his own advisory board.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.885
So welcome, David.

00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:07.810
DAVID GURLE: Thank you
for having for

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.250
having me today, Don.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.010
DON DODGE: Great to
have you here.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.540
You're CEO of Perzo,
a new company.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.810
So it's about-- how old
is the company?

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.820
DAVID GURLE: Well, since
September, 2012.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.070
So only about six months.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.550
DON DODGE: And do you have
an advisory board?

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.290
DAVID GURLE: I do, actually.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.560
I have four people in my
advisory board today.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.350
DON DODGE: So why do you
get an advisory board?

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.210
You're an experienced
executive.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.270
You've been around big companies
and startups.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.280
Why do you need an
advisory board?

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.440
DAVID GURLE: I think any new
venture has to bring together

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.030
a number of talents and
experiences and assets.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.330
Nobody can have it all.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.960
Clearly, the team that you are
building in your organization

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.880
has to have anything that helps
you to get the product

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.630
to the market.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.220
But even that is
not sufficient.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.050
You need to go to reach out
to other experiences,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.490
complementary ones, sometimes
supplementary ones, so that

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.630
you always get a full picture,
the full information before

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.050
you make a decision.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.660
And that's the reason I went and
sought the advice of these

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.170
four excellent people.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.800
DON DODGE: And do you
look for general

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.120
advice, or do you pick--

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.410
you have four advisers, so do
you pick one who's great at

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.990
marketing and sales?

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.400
And do you pick another one
who knows the financial

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.140
markets, and another one
who knows engineering?

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.960
How do you decide
which advisers?

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.750
DAVID GURLE: That's a
very good question.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.810
I think first you have
to look at yourself--

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.380
where you are good at and
where you need help.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.860
You can get the team as the
team dynamics come true.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.380
Where is your team
really strong at?

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.890
And where they can get better?

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.350
And then look at your market.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.020
Where are you going to go?

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.700
Are you going to be an
enterprise startup?

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.050
Are you going to be a
consumer startup, an

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.460
infrastructure startup?

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.390
Depending on all those elements,
you have to pick the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.950
right people to complement
you.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.550
And this is really the
important thing.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.750
There's a complementarity
around that.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.050
So in my case, this is
my first startup.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.520
I have done startups in big
companies, but it's very

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.760
different when you are
outside on your own.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.400
So I needed the advice of people
who have been in this

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.900
situation before and therefore,
who could help me

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.830
navigate those hurdles.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.010
I think that's number one.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.860
Number two--

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.040
I think you need believers
in you.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.730
Advisers are good
for two things--

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.270
first, telling you what they
will recommend given a

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.650
situation, but also give
you the morale

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.420
boost that you need.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.770
Sometimes when you hit those
bumps in the road, they tell

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.510
you, look, David, it's OK.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.482
We're going to walk
it through.

00:03:50.482 --> 00:03:52.110
This is how it's done.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.540
And with that kind of energy
that comes from your advisers,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.030
you're able to overcome a bunch
of obstacles you could

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.280
otherwise not.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.020
DON DODGE: That's a very
interesting point, because

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.230
normally, you think of advisers
as giving deep,

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.770
professional advice on legal
matters or financial matters

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.890
or engineering or whatever.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.810
But CEOs also need someone that
they can bounce ideas off

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.690
of, things like difficult
problems that you couldn't

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.590
discuss with your employees
because they're too tragic or

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.760
ultimately bad.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.220
So you use the advisers also as
your sounding board, your

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.840
cheerleaders.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.870
DAVID GURLE: Coach
and mentors.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.380
And that's really
how I treat--

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.980
I hope that this comes across
in this way towards my

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:46.100
advisers-- is that I
think my company's

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.020
kind of a sports team.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.210
Maybe it's a soccer team
or a football team.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.360
And the advisers are our
coaches and mentors.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.810
And they've been there.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.185
They are specializing
in different areas.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.340
I can use my advisers to ask
things that I wouldn't ask

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.440
other people, because I know
that the relationship is

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.380
really strong.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.720
And they are not going
to judge me.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.380
And with that judgment element
out of the equation, it makes

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.100
your relationship much simpler,
more straightforward.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.190
What comes out is not you are
good or you're bad, or you

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.190
suck on this and you are
really good at that.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.920
It is, OK, well, you have a
difficult situation or you

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.730
have a very good situation,
and here are the

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.460
right things to do.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.980
And this removes all pressure
that you will get, for

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.950
example, from a regular
board or from

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.570
potential other investors.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.110
And that's what I like about

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.140
surrounding myself with advisers.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.420
Because of those things,
I feel free to

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.020
innovate and execute.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.060
DON DODGE: So the sports analogy
is actually a very

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.770
good one-- a coach
or a mentor.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.090
Even Michael Jordan, the best
basketball player in the

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.990
world, needed a coach.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.400
Or Tom Brady, the quarterback
of the

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.790
Patriots, needs a coach.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.820
CEOs think of themselves as
invincible and knowing

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.470
everything.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.060
But even they need coaches and
mentors to help them through

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.720
some of the tough times.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.450
DAVID GURLE: Absolutely true.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.980
I'm definitely not invincible.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:26.960
And I think the challenge for
CEOs or wannabe founders is to

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.540
understand their
situation well.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.460
And that's where I think
everything starts from.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.840
You have to know what you're
going to be excellent at.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.020
And you have to continue
to be excellent in it.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.280
Michael Jordan was an excellent
basketball player,

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.640
but I'm sure that there are
many other areas in his

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.140
professional life as a
basketball player.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.100
He needed to complement
himself.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.615
And that's again, going back
to this complementarity.

00:06:50.615 --> 00:06:52.660
The coaches are there
to complement you.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.235
Some coaches in the basketball
are just, how do

00:06:55.235 --> 00:06:56.010
you play the game?

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.460
And some people are there,
what do you do

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.650
when you don't play?

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.010
And this is as important.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.490
I have an adviser from a major
recruitment organization.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.820
And he is actually there to tell
me how to pace myself,

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.540
because I overcommit.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.590
And overcommiting is as
bad as overtraining.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.430
So you need to find a balance.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.430
And that's how you surround
yourself with the

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.120
right group of people.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.910
DON DODGE: So how do
you find advisers?

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.690
Or how do you pick them?

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.020
Do you shoot for the stars and
try to get the best possible,

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.810
most prominent famous
person you can get?

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.470
Or do you look for someone who
has deep technical or deep

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.750
domain knowledge?

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.010
How do you choose
your advisers?

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.970
DAVID GURLE: Once you have
identified the areas that you

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.140
need help--

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.215
and before I give more
specifics, I think you need to

00:07:50.215 --> 00:07:54.030
have a master adviser,
somebody who you

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.200
can call at any time.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.610
And that person is going to be
really your day in, day out

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.520
person you interact with.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.520
Then the rest of the
team has to be

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.640
specific to the functions.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.370
It's good to have somebody who's
known in the industry,

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.130
because of two things.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.485
Because a-- because they are
known in the industry, they

00:08:15.485 --> 00:08:17.250
know what happens
in the industry.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:22.010
And therefore, they're advice is
getting lots of information

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.490
and sanitizing and distilling
it to you.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.780
So you don't have to go and
hunt for this information.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.890
I think that's very valuable.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:33.360
So you need to find somebody who
is a maven or who is a hub

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.409
in the world of potential
advisers, and also who's got

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.280
that human touch that you
can connect with.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.360
A big name might be an excellent
idea, but if you

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.060
can't connect with that person,
I don't think it's

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.000
going to be useful, because it's
a personal relationship,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.200
first and foremost.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.140
And that's, I think, criteria
number one.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:59.910
Criteria number two is, there
are lots of people in the

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.490
Silicon Valley and other places
where enterprises are

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.740
created who are willing
to give advice,

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.220
but nobody asks them--

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.980
seriously.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.890
And so they all shoot
for the stars.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.450
But there are plenty of stars
that sometimes you can't see

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.380
with the visible eye, but you
put a telescope, you can.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.040
I think the analogy
is similar here.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.890
There are lots of people with
great experience that you can

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.820
go and get help from.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.040
And you need to network
with people.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.590
You need to not hesitate
to ask.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.240
You see somebody you like in
the domain that you are

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.060
looking for.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.810
Are you open to advise me?

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.030
And most people will say yes.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.710
And that's what you are looking
for, so that the

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:44.840
relationship and then finding
and not always looking for the

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.110
visible stars, but recognizing
that a universe of startups is

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.860
plenty of other stars.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.290
And bringing them together is
what's going to make your

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.090
advisory board a
successful one.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.010
DON DODGE: So the ideal advisory
board then are people

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.410
that you know and trust
and have a great

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:02.700
relationship with.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.620
You try to get one general
adviser who's your go-to

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.500
person every day or every week
and then fill it in with two

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.250
or three others who might have
deep domain experience on a

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.210
particular topic?

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.290
DAVID GURLE: That
works for me.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.000
And I think that's a balanced
advisory board.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.540
It's really important
to have the

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.870
advisory board to be balanced.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.870
You mentioned that I've been on
advisory boards myself in

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.600
my previous roles.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.600
And what I have found, in some
instances, it worked really

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.270
well when the CEO of those
companies I was working with

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:42.180
were using the advisory board
as sounding advisory boards.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.380
I think that's really
valuable.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.370
But if you are using the
advisory board just to have

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.700
the prestige of names that you
are never going to talk to

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.440
during the life cycle of this
advisory board, I don't think

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.210
that's useful.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:01.010
You need to, I think, be very
careful about the star chasing

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.690
syndrome that I have seen
in some instances.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.310
DON DODGE: So there's a board
of directors, and there's an

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.970
advisory board.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.820
So the board of directors is
normally your investors or

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.930
financial investors.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.710
The advisory board may
not be an investor.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.450
They're just there to help.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.240
DAVID GURLE: In my case,
actually yes, some of my

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.770
advisory boards are investors.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.190
And some of them are
here to help.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.210
And the board of directors are
indeed, all investors.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.510
That's the criteria I choose
when I created the company

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.830
that they have to be an investor
in order to be in the

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:34.560
board of directors.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.320
DON DODGE: So you get different
advice from board of

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.300
directors versus an
advisory board?

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.900
DAVID GURLE: Absolutely.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.460
And very interestingly, is
that it's two different

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.260
universes sometimes.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.810
And again, it goes
back to being

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.340
judged versus not judged.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.830
The board of directors, even if
in this case, I am also the

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.380
chairman of that board, you
still are in the context of

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.630
performance.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.250
And the information you
convey and everything

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.970
is tainted by that.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.920
In the advisory board, you are
just there to take advice.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:19.310
So with that bias taken away,
the scope is very broad.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:23.430
And therefore, you get a much
higher quality input.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.390
DON DODGE: Well, this has been
a fascinating conversation.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.080
I really appreciate
you being here.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.830
DAVID GURLE: My pleasure, and
I wish all the existing and

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.690
tomorrow startups best of
success and surround

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.330
themselves with most
complimentary

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.240
advisory board members.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.150
DON DODGE: Thank
you very much.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.690
And that's Google Root Access.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.590
We'll be with you
again very soon.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:44.840
Thank you.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:13:34.417
