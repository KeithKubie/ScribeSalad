was very happy to do it the interest the
things that reason I mentioned it is

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:06.840
things that reason I mentioned it is
 

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.530
things that reason I mentioned it is
because I obviously had that interest of

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540
because I obviously had that interest of
 

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.420
because I obviously had that interest of
some connectedness with architecture at

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:11.430
some connectedness with architecture at
 

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.880
some connectedness with architecture at

for this kind of work it had no have
nope it was no a real model for such a

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680
nope it was no a real model for such a
 

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.470
nope it was no a real model for such a
thing in the way that we were doing it

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480
thing in the way that we were doing it
 

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.250
thing in the way that we were doing it
and also i have to say that it took me

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260
and also i have to say that it took me
 

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.020
and also i have to say that it took me
about 20 or 30 years to be given the

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:27.030
about 20 or 30 years to be given the
 

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.650
about 20 or 30 years to be given the
next opportunity to do so my life might

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660
next opportunity to do so my life might
 

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.330
next opportunity to do so my life might
been quite different if I had had the

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:32.340
been quite different if I had had the
 

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.220
been quite different if I had had the
opportunities to go on to do that

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:34.230
opportunities to go on to do that
 

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.290
opportunities to go on to do that
immediately but it took many many years

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:36.300
immediately but it took many many years
 

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.720
immediately but it took many many years
and then when the opportunities came I

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:38.730
and then when the opportunities came I
 

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.300
and then when the opportunities came I
did them and of course that's also sell

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:41.310
did them and of course that's also sell
 

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.040
did them and of course that's also sell

think i took the four identical boxes
 

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.660
think i took the four identical boxes
and i cut lids out of the boxes each one

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:11.670
and i cut lids out of the boxes each one
 

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.370
and i cut lids out of the boxes each one
getting progressively bigger and then

the thing that interested me was that
 

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.450
the thing that interested me was that
what I did was so uninteresting and that

what I did was so uninteresting and that
 

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.420
what I did was so uninteresting and that
the result is more interesting than the

the other thing that interested me very
much which is tied in with the question

00:11:37.999 --> 00:11:38.009
much which is tied in with the question
 

00:11:38.009 --> 00:11:40.280
much which is tied in with the question
of architecture is the fact that in

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:40.290
of architecture is the fact that in
 

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.170
of architecture is the fact that in
general works of art are the one thing

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.180
general works of art are the one thing

you're not supposed to do is touch them
and by making boxes that it hinged lids

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:45.569
and by making boxes that it hinged lids

and by making boxes that it hinged lids
you are it was I was trying to build

00:11:47.869 --> 00:11:47.879
you are it was I was trying to build
 

00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:50.269
you are it was I was trying to build
into it the forbidden thing that you had

00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279
into it the forbidden thing that you had
 

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:52.160
into it the forbidden thing that you had
to touch it in order for the work to

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.170
to touch it in order for the work to
 

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.009
to touch it in order for the work to
work as this is now in a museum even I

00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:55.019
work as this is now in a museum even I
 

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:56.600
work as this is now in a museum even I
am going to be arrested if I try to

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:56.610
am going to be arrested if I try to
 

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.910
am going to be arrested if I try to
touch it but the thought is there that

00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920
touch it but the thought is there that
 

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:05.840
touch it but the thought is there that
was the idea this is work from the early

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:05.850
was the idea this is work from the early
 

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.110
was the idea this is work from the early
70s I think it Mona speaks for itself

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120
70s I think it Mona speaks for itself
 

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.389
70s I think it Mona speaks for itself
and it has to do with obviously with the

00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399
and it has to do with obviously with the
 

00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:16.610
and it has to do with obviously with the
reversal of certain expectations I got

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.620
reversal of certain expectations I got
 

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.050
reversal of certain expectations I got
interested in the idea of ordinary

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.060
interested in the idea of ordinary
 

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.699
interested in the idea of ordinary
objects and also very interested in the

00:12:19.699 --> 00:12:19.709
objects and also very interested in the
 

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:21.740
objects and also very interested in the
idea that the thing that defines objects

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:21.750
idea that the thing that defines objects
 

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.079
idea that the thing that defines objects
is functionality so I try to always play

00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:24.089
is functionality so I try to always play
 

00:12:24.089 --> 00:12:30.019
is functionality so I try to always play
on the question of functionality this is

00:12:30.019 --> 00:12:30.029
on the question of functionality this is
 

00:12:30.029 --> 00:12:32.150
on the question of functionality this is
another worked in this one there's a

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160
another worked in this one there's a
 

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.869
another worked in this one there's a
tabletop with those pulleys on the

00:12:35.869 --> 00:12:35.879
tabletop with those pulleys on the
 

00:12:35.879 --> 00:12:37.069
tabletop with those pulleys on the
ceiling that's rope went up to the

00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079
ceiling that's rope went up to the
 

00:12:37.079 --> 00:12:38.780
ceiling that's rope went up to the
pulleys and then down to the buckets the

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:38.790
pulleys and then down to the buckets the
 

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.790
pulleys and then down to the buckets the
four buckets are filled with water and

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800
four buckets are filled with water and
 

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.590
four buckets are filled with water and
the water weighs exactly the same amount

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600
the water weighs exactly the same amount
 

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.079
the water weighs exactly the same amount
is the table top so the tabletop is held

00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:45.089
is the table top so the tabletop is held
 

00:12:45.089 --> 00:12:47.030
is the table top so the tabletop is held
in suspension just under the buckets so

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040
in suspension just under the buckets so
 

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.129
in suspension just under the buckets so
in a sense the things on the table are

00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:49.139
in a sense the things on the table are
 

00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:57.769
in a sense the things on the table are
supporting the table now this this is an

00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:57.779
supporting the table now this this is an
 

00:12:57.779 --> 00:13:00.759
supporting the table now this this is an
oak tree which is the work for which I'm

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:00.769
oak tree which is the work for which I'm
 

00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:03.939
oak tree which is the work for which I'm
become the work that I'm best known for

00:13:03.939 --> 00:13:03.949
become the work that I'm best known for
 

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:07.579
become the work that I'm best known for
its become strangely iconic it's had its

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:07.589
its become strangely iconic it's had its
 

00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:09.079
its become strangely iconic it's had its
had a whole life of its own it travels

had a whole life of its own it travels
 

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:11.300
had a whole life of its own it travels
around the world without me it's been

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:11.310
around the world without me it's been
 

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.910
around the world without me it's been
there's a text that the objects when it

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920
there's a text that the objects when it
 

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.559
there's a text that the objects when it
was first shown it was this was the only

00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:15.569
was first shown it was this was the only
 

00:13:15.569 --> 00:13:17.389
was first shown it was this was the only
thing shown in the gallery and then

00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399
thing shown in the gallery and then
 

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:18.980
thing shown in the gallery and then
there was a text that people were handed

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:18.990
there was a text that people were handed
 

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:20.720
there was a text that people were handed
and the text takes the form of an

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:20.730
and the text takes the form of an
 

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.480
and the text takes the form of an
interview with mice with myself I don't

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:23.490
interview with mice with myself I don't
 

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.530
interview with mice with myself I don't
have a copy with here so i'm going to

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:24.540
have a copy with here so i'm going to
 

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.329
have a copy with here so i'm going to
show to you and i'll just read the first

show to you and i'll just read the first
 

00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:28.189
show to you and i'll just read the first
few lines but you'll get the idea if you

00:13:28.189 --> 00:13:28.199
few lines but you'll get the idea if you
 

00:13:28.199 --> 00:13:32.269
few lines but you'll get the idea if you
don't know what you get the idea to

00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279
don't know what you get the idea to
 

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:34.280
don't know what you get the idea to
begin with could you describe this work

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:34.290
begin with could you describe this work
 

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.769
begin with could you describe this work
yes of course what i've done is to

00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779
yes of course what i've done is to
 

00:13:36.779 --> 00:13:38.629
yes of course what i've done is to
change a glass of water into a

00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639
change a glass of water into a
 

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:41.150
change a glass of water into a
full-grown oak tree without altering the

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160
full-grown oak tree without altering the
 

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.340
full-grown oak tree without altering the
accidents of the glass of water the

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:43.350
accidents of the glass of water the
 

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:47.300
accidents of the glass of water the
accidents yes the color feel wait sighs

time I saw a lot of artists as being
cornered into what it was that they were

cornered into what it was that they were
 

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.640
cornered into what it was that they were
known to do and one sees this all the

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:31.650
known to do and one sees this all the
 

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.350

so I was trying to make something that

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:43.860
so I was trying to make something that

wanted to do which I could never achieve
 

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.890
wanted to do which I could never achieve
and part of that was because I was

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:51.900
and part of that was because I was
 

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.060
and part of that was because I was
spending so much of my life also

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:53.070
spending so much of my life also
 

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.030

teaching and I have no money was that I

teaching and I have no money was that I
 

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.890
teaching and I have no money was that I
wanted to be able to do different things

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:57.900

and so my out of this dilemma that i

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:47.090
and so my out of this dilemma that i
 

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:50.200
and so my out of this dilemma that i
created for myself i decided to try just

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:50.210
created for myself i decided to try just
 

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.480
created for myself i decided to try just
drawing the things that i had previously

drawing the things that i had previously
 

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:54.760
drawing the things that i had previously
used so i start to draw individual

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:54.770
used so i start to draw individual
 

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.340

objects and I drew them each what I drew

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:57.350
objects and I drew them each what I drew

them all on the same size sheet of paper

they make pictures of things and one of
 

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.740
they make pictures of things and one of
the reasons is because they're so

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:14.750
the reasons is because they're so
 

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.320

make them tiny I did small drawings took
slides of them which made them even

00:20:28.389 --> 00:20:28.399
slides of them which made them even
 

00:20:28.399 --> 00:20:30.519
slides of them which made them even
smaller blew the slide up in the wall

00:20:30.519 --> 00:20:30.529
smaller blew the slide up in the wall
 

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:32.200

have all the characteristics but you
mean literal economy as well because you

00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:03.559
mean literal economy as well because you
 

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:05.470
mean literal economy as well because you
would have just a bunch of sheets of

again I mean was there a crisis of a

00:21:25.859 --> 00:21:25.869
again I mean was there a crisis of a
 

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:28.090

while these works for me in a way you

while these works for me in a way you
 

00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:33.730
while these works for me in a way you
could technically say well they're a

conceptual crisis is it way well I don't

00:21:48.519 --> 00:21:48.529
conceptual crisis is it way well I don't
 

00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:51.789

I think at this time I mean I i was

00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:51.799
I think at this time I mean I i was
 

00:21:51.799 --> 00:21:54.600
I think at this time I mean I i was
still in that situation where i ii was

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:54.610
still in that situation where i ii was

every day i was just learning something

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840
every day i was just learning something
 

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.049
every day i was just learning something
from the process and finding out things

00:21:59.049 --> 00:21:59.059
from the process and finding out things
 

00:21:59.059 --> 00:22:01.570

that I hadn't that I hadn't anticipated

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:01.580
that I hadn't that I hadn't anticipated
 

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:06.190
that I hadn't that I hadn't anticipated
I mean my idea was with the drawings

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200
I mean my idea was with the drawings
 

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.659
I mean my idea was with the drawings
that drawing was so basic I would just

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:07.669
that drawing was so basic I would just
 

00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:08.830
that drawing was so basic I would just
go back to the most basic thing and

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840
go back to the most basic thing and
 

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.739
go back to the most basic thing and
start again and of course is when you do

00:22:11.739 --> 00:22:11.749
start again and of course is when you do
 

00:22:11.749 --> 00:22:13.330
start again and of course is when you do
that you know you know what in a sense

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:13.340
that you know you know what in a sense
 

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.799
that you know you know what in a sense
that is what happens you do start and

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:14.809
that is what happens you do start and
 

00:22:14.809 --> 00:22:16.720
that is what happens you do start and
you start to untie me one of the things

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:16.730
you start to untie me one of the things
 

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:17.499
you start to untie me one of the things
that's very interesting about

00:22:17.499 --> 00:22:17.509
that's very interesting about
 

00:22:17.509 --> 00:22:20.889
that's very interesting about
discovering things in art is that you

00:22:20.889 --> 00:22:20.899
discovering things in art is that you
 

00:22:20.899 --> 00:22:22.119
discovering things in art is that you
can discover something that people have

00:22:22.119 --> 00:22:22.129
can discover something that people have
 

00:22:22.129 --> 00:22:24.070
can discover something that people have
known for centuries but if you discover

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080
known for centuries but if you discover
 

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.440
known for centuries but if you discover
it it's your discovery I mean unless you

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:26.450
it it's your discovery I mean unless you
 

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:28.269
it it's your discovery I mean unless you
have it it's not a discovery of you it's

00:22:28.269 --> 00:22:28.279
have it it's not a discovery of you it's
 

00:22:28.279 --> 00:22:30.009
have it it's not a discovery of you it's
when you have it that it becomes one and

00:22:30.009 --> 00:22:30.019
when you have it that it becomes one and
 

00:22:30.019 --> 00:22:32.430
when you have it that it becomes one and
that was more less what was happening

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440
that was more less what was happening
 

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.609
that was more less what was happening
for me the other thing was that without

00:22:36.609 --> 00:22:36.619
for me the other thing was that without
 

00:22:36.619 --> 00:22:38.169
for me the other thing was that without
really necessarily

00:22:38.169 --> 00:22:38.179
really necessarily
 

00:22:38.179 --> 00:22:40.570
really necessarily
intending it all the drawings because

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:40.580
intending it all the drawings because
 

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.159
intending it all the drawings because
they were on a state became templates

00:22:42.159 --> 00:22:42.169
they were on a state became templates
 

00:22:42.169 --> 00:22:45.190
they were on a state became templates
and so I've only ever drawn one open

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200
and so I've only ever drawn one open
 

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.200
and so I've only ever drawn one open
book and that was in 1978 and that's it

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:47.210
book and that was in 1978 and that's it
 

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:48.519
book and that was in 1978 and that's it
and then all my work up to now I used

00:22:48.519 --> 00:22:48.529
and then all my work up to now I used
 

00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:49.629
and then all my work up to now I used
the same drawer in the book I've never

00:22:49.629 --> 00:22:49.639
the same drawer in the book I've never
 

00:22:49.639 --> 00:22:51.519
the same drawer in the book I've never
drawn another book open I've never drawn

00:22:51.519 --> 00:22:51.529
drawn another book open I've never drawn
 

00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:53.649
drawn another book open I've never drawn
another safety pin I've never drawn

00:22:53.649 --> 00:22:53.659
another safety pin I've never drawn
 

00:22:53.659 --> 00:22:55.810
another safety pin I've never drawn
another flashlight all these these

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:55.820
another flashlight all these these
 

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.970
another flashlight all these these
images have become templates and I've

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:57.980
images have become templates and I've
 

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:03.450
images have become templates and I've
just added to this vocabulary of things

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:03.460
just added to this vocabulary of things
 

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.519
just added to this vocabulary of things
we yeah we should can get and move move

00:23:06.519 --> 00:23:06.529
we yeah we should can get and move move
 

00:23:06.529 --> 00:23:12.489
we yeah we should can get and move move
on so so then this is the this is in a

00:23:12.489 --> 00:23:12.499
on so so then this is the this is in a
 

00:23:12.499 --> 00:23:14.109
on so so then this is the this is in a
way this is the British school in Rome

00:23:14.109 --> 00:23:14.119
way this is the British school in Rome
 

00:23:14.119 --> 00:23:16.749
way this is the British school in Rome
right yes at some point and it's

00:23:16.749 --> 00:23:16.759
right yes at some point and it's
 

00:23:16.759 --> 00:23:18.430
right yes at some point and it's
interesting reading Richard cork is a

daggers and sharp things and scary stuff

in the work in order almost to try and

00:23:34.389 --> 00:23:34.399
in the work in order almost to try and
 

00:23:34.399 --> 00:23:37.690
in the work in order almost to try and
make it seem more scary or more profound

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:37.700
make it seem more scary or more profound
 

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.850
make it seem more scary or more profound
but of course with this work you do get

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:39.860
but of course with this work you do get
 

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.549
but of course with this work you do get

room that's been designed by someone and
 

00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:51.340
room that's been designed by someone and
built by someone that seems to me very

striking regardless of what you think
 

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.029
striking regardless of what you think
about the work or judge about the work

00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039
about the work or judge about the work

in terms of an artistic act that it's a

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:00.980
it's a it's a turning point for me
 

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.039
it's a it's a turning point for me
because up to that point even though

00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:03.049
because up to that point even though
 

00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:05.799
because up to that point even though
large wall drawings seem to be possible

00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:05.809
large wall drawings seem to be possible
 

00:24:05.809 --> 00:24:08.739
large wall drawings seem to be possible
in in many types of location and

00:24:08.739 --> 00:24:08.749
in in many types of location and
 

00:24:08.749 --> 00:24:11.340
in in many types of location and
suddenly here we have a work that is

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:11.350
suddenly here we have a work that is
 

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:14.649
suddenly here we have a work that is
specific it seems to be it relies on the

00:24:14.649 --> 00:24:14.659
specific it seems to be it relies on the
 

00:24:14.659 --> 00:24:17.139
specific it seems to be it relies on the
room itself it accepts the fireplace as

00:24:17.139 --> 00:24:17.149
room itself it accepts the fireplace as
 

00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:18.669
room itself it accepts the fireplace as
part of the work it accepts the doors

00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:18.679
part of the work it accepts the doors
 

00:24:18.679 --> 00:24:20.710
part of the work it accepts the doors
the lights and so on suddenly there are

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720
the lights and so on suddenly there are
 

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.899
the lights and so on suddenly there are
these decisions that have to be made can

these decisions that have to be made can
you talk a little bit about that well

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:25.460
you talk a little bit about that well
 

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.549
you talk a little bit about that well
what you're describing is exactly the

00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:27.559
what you're describing is exactly the
 

00:24:27.559 --> 00:24:30.009
what you're describing is exactly the
way I felt about about it because what

00:24:30.009 --> 00:24:30.019
way I felt about about it because what
 

00:24:30.019 --> 00:24:32.289

when I had done with the wall drawings

00:24:32.289 --> 00:24:32.299
when I had done with the wall drawings
 

00:24:32.299 --> 00:24:34.480
when I had done with the wall drawings
is I felt I had didn't I had created a

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:34.490
is I felt I had didn't I had created a
 

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.639
is I felt I had didn't I had created a
kind of work that I could take to any

00:24:36.639 --> 00:24:36.649
kind of work that I could take to any
 

00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:40.210
kind of work that I could take to any
place and make it make it become part of

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:40.220
place and make it make it become part of
 

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.310
place and make it make it become part of
that place you simply projected and if

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320
that place you simply projected and if
 

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.159
that place you simply projected and if
the world was was 25 feet high you made

00:24:45.159 --> 00:24:45.169
the world was was 25 feet high you made
 

00:24:45.169 --> 00:24:47.200
the world was was 25 feet high you made
the drawing 25 feet high and if it were

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:47.210
the drawing 25 feet high and if it were
 

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.789
the drawing 25 feet high and if it were
if you could only go 6-foot you went 6

00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799
if you could only go 6-foot you went 6
 

00:24:48.799 --> 00:24:50.349
if you could only go 6-foot you went 6
foot so the same work would it just

00:24:50.349 --> 00:24:50.359
foot so the same work would it just
 

00:24:50.359 --> 00:24:51.850
foot so the same work would it just
simply adjust

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:51.860

of the works were ever done for a

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:55.040
of the works were ever done for a
 

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.860
of the works were ever done for a
particular place and this was the first

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:56.870
particular place and this was the first
 

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.570
particular place and this was the first
time I ever made a work that was

00:24:58.570 --> 00:24:58.580
time I ever made a work that was
 

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.820
time I ever made a work that was
specific to the room but do you think

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:00.830
specific to the room but do you think
 

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.190
specific to the room but do you think
there was this feeling that the

so little character it just seemed to me

00:26:23.049 --> 00:26:23.059
so little character it just seemed to me
 

00:26:23.059 --> 00:26:26.020

that it was crazy not to try to play on

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:26.030
that it was crazy not to try to play on
 

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.690
that it was crazy not to try to play on
that so that's what I try to do and the

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:28.700
that so that's what I try to do and the
 

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.220
that so that's what I try to do and the
minute that and this was also the first

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:30.230
minute that and this was also the first
 

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.409
minute that and this was also the first
time I ever introduced color and I ever

00:26:32.409 --> 00:26:32.419
time I ever introduced color and I ever
 

00:26:32.419 --> 00:26:34.810
time I ever introduced color and I ever
painted the wall I never I better use

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:34.820
painted the wall I never I better use
 

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:38.440
painted the wall I never I better use
paint in this way and everything changed

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:38.450
paint in this way and everything changed
 

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.780
paint in this way and everything changed
my whole career change completely design

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:40.790
my whole career change completely design
 

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.310
my whole career change completely design
ever ever went back to the other thing

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320
ever ever went back to the other thing
 

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.919
ever ever went back to the other thing
it all changed with this from then on I

00:26:44.919 --> 00:26:44.929
it all changed with this from then on I
 

00:26:44.929 --> 00:26:46.990
it all changed with this from then on I
used color and I use painted rooms and I

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000
used color and I use painted rooms and I
 

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.940
used color and I use painted rooms and I
made everything became specific to a

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:48.950
made everything became specific to a
 

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:51.100
made everything became specific to a
place because that enabled me to

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:51.110
place because that enabled me to
 

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:55.720
place because that enabled me to
introduce a kind not only specificity in

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:55.730
introduce a kind not only specificity in
 

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.730
introduce a kind not only specificity in
terms of the place possessed specificity

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:57.740
terms of the place possessed specificity
 

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.340
terms of the place possessed specificity
in terms of me in relation to that place

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:00.350
in terms of me in relation to that place
 

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:02.610
in terms of me in relation to that place
which had never occurred

which had never occurred
the work before too maybe we should

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720
the work before too maybe we should
 

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.850
the work before too maybe we should
maybe we should move through a few

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:05.860
maybe we should move through a few
 

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.380
maybe we should move through a few
things and just maybe you can just tell

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:07.390
things and just maybe you can just tell
 

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:10.460
things and just maybe you can just tell
us where they are and yeah you know like

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:10.470
us where they are and yeah you know like
 

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.049
us where they are and yeah you know like
maybe a little technical stuff like how

00:27:13.049 --> 00:27:13.059
maybe a little technical stuff like how
 

00:27:13.059 --> 00:27:15.170
maybe a little technical stuff like how
it's done or what you know have you

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:15.180
it's done or what you know have you
 

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.190
it's done or what you know have you
there's this moment of you with the

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200
there's this moment of you with the
 

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.549
there's this moment of you with the
acetate and the and the roll of tape and

00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559
acetate and the and the roll of tape and
 

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:23.610
acetate and the and the roll of tape and
a overhead projector so when you're

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:23.620
a overhead projector so when you're
 

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.350
a overhead projector so when you're
shifting and like how is this done for

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360
shifting and like how is this done for
 

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.880
shifting and like how is this done for
example where is this this is it this is

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:26.890
example where is this this is it this is
 

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:31.470
example where is this this is it this is
a painting in Tokyo and this was one of

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480
a painting in Tokyo and this was one of
 

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.110
a painting in Tokyo and this was one of
the first works in the in this work you

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.120
the first works in the in this work you
 

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.299
the first works in the in this work you
can say the images are more or less

00:27:36.299 --> 00:27:36.309
can say the images are more or less
 

00:27:36.309 --> 00:27:38.040
can say the images are more or less
life-size and they're more or less

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:38.050
life-size and they're more or less
 

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:40.500
life-size and they're more or less
naturalistic in color the background is

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:40.510
naturalistic in color the background is
 

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.700
naturalistic in color the background is
very vivid but the objects are not and

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:43.710
very vivid but the objects are not and
 

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:47.220
very vivid but the objects are not and
but this is a painting on canvas and in

order to get the tape to do its thing on

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:49.570
order to get the tape to do its thing on
 

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:51.750
order to get the tape to do its thing on
to do the equivalent line that I had

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760

then paint you all the colors on it and
 

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.660
then paint you all the colors on it and
then you remove the tape at the end and

then you remove the tape at the end and
 

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:05.310

that's how I do absolutely everything

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320
that's how I do absolutely everything

that's how I do absolutely everything
everything is drawn the tape but the

everything is drawn the tape but the
 

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:10.980
everything is drawn the tape but the
tape always has to precede the work you

00:29:26.169 --> 00:29:26.179
growing moment is the thing that's
 

00:29:26.179 --> 00:29:30.640

is of course it's a good line and i like

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:43.220
is of course it's a good line and i like
 

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.940
is of course it's a good line and i like
it and i think i agree with it up to a

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:45.950
it and i think i agree with it up to a
 

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:49.270
it and i think i agree with it up to a
point but it's a very complicated thing

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:49.280
point but it's a very complicated thing
 

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.919
point but it's a very complicated thing
to say when I think it's something you

00:29:50.919 --> 00:29:50.929
to say when I think it's something you
 

00:29:50.929 --> 00:29:53.169
to say when I think it's something you
can say about yourself maybe in and it's

00:29:53.169 --> 00:29:53.179
can say about yourself maybe in and it's
 

00:29:53.179 --> 00:29:56.520
can say about yourself maybe in and it's
hard to say about other people and feel

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:56.530
hard to say about other people and feel
 

00:29:56.530 --> 00:30:00.940
hard to say about other people and feel
safe but but of course you're working in

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:00.950
safe but but of course you're working in
 

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:02.500
safe but but of course you're working in
these cases there's a lot of labor

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:02.510
these cases there's a lot of labor
 

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.450
these cases there's a lot of labor
involved so there seems to be this

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:04.460
involved so there seems to be this
 

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.950
involved so there seems to be this
difference between like where is this

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:05.960
difference between like where is this
 

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.590
difference between like where is this
difference between expression and labor

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:08.600
difference between expression and labor
 

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.260
difference between expression and labor
it seems in a way quite there's this

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:11.270
it seems in a way quite there's this
 

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:12.990
it seems in a way quite there's this
idea that an artist is supposed to work

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000
idea that an artist is supposed to work
 

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.070
idea that an artist is supposed to work
because you're they mean well my idea

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080
because you're they mean well my idea
 

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.659
because you're they mean well my idea
about self-expression is that

00:30:19.659 --> 00:30:19.669
about self-expression is that
 

00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:21.909
about self-expression is that
essentially I don't like the term

00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919
essentially I don't like the term
 

00:30:21.919 --> 00:30:23.620
essentially I don't like the term
self-expression because it seems me that

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:23.630
self-expression because it seems me that
 

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.110
self-expression because it seems me that
it always implies that you that the

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120
it always implies that you that the
 

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.539
it always implies that you that the
artist has something to express to

00:30:28.539 --> 00:30:28.549
artist has something to express to
 

00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:30.520
artist has something to express to
somebody else it's like giving something

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:30.530
somebody else it's like giving something
 

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:33.190
somebody else it's like giving something
and I think that suffix real self

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200
and I think that suffix real self
 

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.130
and I think that suffix real self
expression is the bit that happens that

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:36.140
expression is the bit that happens that
 

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.810
expression is the bit that happens that
expresses something about yourself that

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:37.820
expresses something about yourself that
 

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.650
expresses something about yourself that
you can't resist that happens anyway and

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:40.660
you can't resist that happens anyway and
 

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.320
you can't resist that happens anyway and
you even when you try to resist it you

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:44.330
you even when you try to resist it you
 

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:46.450
you even when you try to resist it you
can't it's not that you try to put it in

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:46.460
can't it's not that you try to put it in
 

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.830
can't it's not that you try to put it in
and it's not that you try to take it out

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840
and it's not that you try to take it out
 

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.350
and it's not that you try to take it out
yet just the character of my work says

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:50.360
yet just the character of my work says
 

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.120

everything about what I'm like really

everything about what I'm like really

everything about what I'm like really
and I think that's true of every artist

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960
and I think that's true of every artist
 

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.960
and I think that's true of every artist
but I don't think that's what's meant in

this is in the country and in Dusseldorf
and this was the first time that I took

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:06.410
and this was the first time that I took
 

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:08.890
and this was the first time that I took
the colors from the walls the bright

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:08.900
the colors from the walls the bright
 

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.539
the colors from the walls the bright
colors and put them into the objects and

colors and put them into the objects and

also start to play with the scale of the

also start to play with the scale of the
 

00:31:12.679 --> 00:31:14.380
also start to play with the scale of the
images which of course why when you're

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:14.390
images which of course why when you're
 

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:15.520
images which of course why when you're
doing images should you make them all

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:15.530
doing images should you make them all
 

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:25.879
doing images should you make them all

in in the country on there there were
 

00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:39.690

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:33.609
as doing these these
 

00:39:33.609 --> 00:39:36.989
as doing these these
things I mean I came to the this work

00:39:36.989 --> 00:39:36.999
things I mean I came to the this work
 

00:39:36.999 --> 00:39:42.720
things I mean I came to the this work
with these stupid drawings and one of

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:42.730
with these stupid drawings and one of
 

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:45.440
with these stupid drawings and one of
the things that I realized is that

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:45.450
the things that I realized is that
 

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.870
the things that I realized is that
architecture is virtually by its nature

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880
architecture is virtually by its nature
 

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:52.289
architecture is virtually by its nature
abstract and you know occasionally you

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:52.299
abstract and you know occasionally you
 

00:39:52.299 --> 00:39:53.609
abstract and you know occasionally you
get a building that looks like a hot dog

00:39:53.609 --> 00:39:53.619
get a building that looks like a hot dog
 

00:39:53.619 --> 00:39:56.099
get a building that looks like a hot dog
but other than that it is not

00:39:56.099 --> 00:39:56.109
but other than that it is not
 

00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:58.519
but other than that it is not
architecture is not representational and

00:39:58.519 --> 00:39:58.529
architecture is not representational and
 

00:39:58.529 --> 00:40:01.470
architecture is not representational and
one what is what hat what happens I

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:01.480
one what is what hat what happens I
 

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.620
one what is what hat what happens I
think I've found some odd corner for

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:04.630
think I've found some odd corner for
 

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:09.720
think I've found some odd corner for
myself of taking this end of these

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:09.730
myself of taking this end of these
 

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:12.630
myself of taking this end of these
representations of things and inserting

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640
representations of things and inserting
 

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.519
representations of things and inserting
them into an intern into an

them into an intern into an
architectural context that do something

00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:18.609
architectural context that do something

that's difficult to put your finger on

00:40:21.479 --> 00:40:21.489
that's difficult to put your finger on

old work in the new how could you do

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:26.650
old work in the new how could you do
 

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:31.609
old work in the new how could you do
that to yourself oh are you thinking I

curious conjunctions between things are

00:48:44.359 --> 00:48:44.369
curious conjunctions between things are
 

00:48:44.369 --> 00:48:47.789
curious conjunctions between things are
so extraordinary that I like it when

00:48:47.789 --> 00:48:47.799
so extraordinary that I like it when
 

00:48:47.799 --> 00:48:49.859

00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:57.880
make something unexpectedly perverse
 

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.630

we've been talking about really which is
to do with the contextualization of

to do with the contextualization of
 

00:49:06.759 --> 00:49:10.079
to do with the contextualization of

took these three objects from the
 

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:11.130
took these three objects from the
collection to put together so this is

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:11.140
collection to put together so this is
 

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:13.109

rebuilding it before the rebuilding all
 

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.459
rebuilding it before the rebuilding all
of the all of that not only occurs is

00:50:17.459 --> 00:50:17.469
of the all of that not only occurs is
 

00:50:17.469 --> 00:50:18.839
of the all of that not only occurs is
the thing that I've done not there but

00:50:18.839 --> 00:50:18.849
the thing that I've done not there but
 

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:21.059
the thing that I've done not there but
the the place itself because all these

00:50:21.059 --> 00:50:21.069
the the place itself because all these
 

00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:22.589
the the place itself because all these
rooms no longer exist they've all been

00:50:22.589 --> 00:50:22.599
rooms no longer exist they've all been

wouldn't even even know where that was
 

00:50:25.569 --> 00:50:34.979
wouldn't even even know where that was
now and then this is a wall drawing done

00:50:34.979 --> 00:50:34.989
now and then this is a wall drawing done
 

00:50:34.989 --> 00:50:37.529
now and then this is a wall drawing done
with tape some paint but merely with

00:50:37.529 --> 00:50:37.539
with tape some paint but merely with
 

00:50:37.539 --> 00:50:45.319
with tape some paint but merely with
tape in the house to clinched in Munich

00:50:45.329 --> 00:50:47.430
 
and this was one of the first time that

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440
and this was one of the first time that
 

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.719
and this was one of the first time that
I'd done something like this which is

00:50:48.719 --> 00:50:48.729
I'd done something like this which is
 

00:50:48.729 --> 00:50:50.279
I'd done something like this which is
taking the images floor to ceiling and

00:50:50.279 --> 00:50:50.289
taking the images floor to ceiling and
 

00:50:50.289 --> 00:50:52.289
taking the images floor to ceiling and
having rows of those something I've done

00:50:52.289 --> 00:50:52.299
having rows of those something I've done
 

00:50:52.299 --> 00:50:56.430
having rows of those something I've done
a lot of sense where there's in us in a

a lot of sense where there's in us in a
 

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:57.599
a lot of sense where there's in us in a
sense I'm trying to have something where

00:50:57.599 --> 00:50:57.609
sense I'm trying to have something where
 

00:50:57.609 --> 00:50:59.039
sense I'm trying to have something where
there's no hierarchy and the thing

00:50:59.039 --> 00:50:59.049
there's no hierarchy and the thing
 

00:50:59.049 --> 00:51:00.839
there's no hierarchy and the thing
everything everything is equal all the

everything everything is equal all the
 

00:51:00.849 --> 00:51:02.819
everything everything is equal all the
way and everything is as big as possible

00:51:02.819 --> 00:51:02.829
way and everything is as big as possible
 

00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:05.189
way and everything is as big as possible
but everything is is contained within

00:51:05.189 --> 00:51:05.199

Dublin and for this which was already a
 

00:51:26.859 --> 00:51:29.309
Dublin and for this which was already a
very large space I decided to make the

00:51:29.309 --> 00:51:29.319
very large space I decided to make the
 

00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:31.499
very large space I decided to make the
images even bigger so the image was so

00:51:31.499 --> 00:51:31.509
images even bigger so the image was so
 

00:51:31.509 --> 00:51:38.180
images even bigger so the image was so
big they didn't fit

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:38.190
 
 

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:46.510

suddenly into a different sort of
relationship because this looks like a

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:31.850
relationship because this looks like a
 

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:33.460
relationship because this looks like a

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.110
and in the way I'm kind of rejection of
this idea of self-expression but there's

01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:04.120
this idea of self-expression but there's
 

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.910
this idea of self-expression but there's
definitely there's the sense of feeling

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920
definitely there's the sense of feeling

and you've talked a few times about the
 

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:09.930
and you've talked a few times about the
idea that or people seem to like it or

01:10:09.930 --> 01:10:09.940
idea that or people seem to like it or

people didn't want it taken away or
 

01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:12.990
people didn't want it taken away or
people would just smile and walk through

there is some sense of people there's a
 

01:10:19.810 --> 01:10:23.310
there is some sense of people there's a
sense of there being audiences or people

01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:23.320
sense of there being audiences or people

there to see things but then again it's

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:26.110
there to see things but then again it's
 

01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:27.870
there to see things but then again it's
quite analytical and it seems that some

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:27.880
quite analytical and it seems that some
 

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.600
quite analytical and it seems that some
of the things you do are almost like

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:30.610
of the things you do are almost like
 

01:10:30.610 --> 01:10:32.910
of the things you do are almost like
this inning and like bloody-minded you

01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:32.920
this inning and like bloody-minded you
 

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.200
this inning and like bloody-minded you
know there's this thing you've talked

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:34.210
know there's this thing you've talked
 

01:10:34.210 --> 01:10:36.600
know there's this thing you've talked
about before if every time you think of

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:36.610
about before if every time you think of
 

01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:38.370
about before if every time you think of
something your next thought is the

01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:38.380
something your next thought is the
 

01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:40.290
something your next thought is the
opposite so maybe first you thought in

01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:40.300
opposite so maybe first you thought in
 

01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:41.880
opposite so maybe first you thought in
the library of doing something else but

you end up doing the books it's so dumb
 

01:10:44.050 --> 01:10:47.100
you end up doing the books it's so dumb
so obviously it's been overlooked in the

so obviously it's been overlooked in the
 

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:48.750
so obviously it's been overlooked in the
way can you talk a little bit about

01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:48.760
way can you talk a little bit about
 

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.940
way can you talk a little bit about
these kind of things because when we see

and they're not so cold so there's
something about the assumptions of what

text you see because i thought the work

01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520
text you see because i thought the work

non-belief so that the discourse is
 

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.620
non-belief so that the discourse is
always between these two things so it

01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:39.630
always between these two things so it
 

01:24:39.630 --> 01:24:42.920
always between these two things so it

I but and I and I found that this tool
is unbelievably flexible so all that's

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:16.530
is unbelievably flexible so all that's
 

01:28:16.530 --> 01:28:19.190

huge digitally printed images it feels

01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:51.180
huge digitally printed images it feels
 

01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:52.640
huge digitally printed images it feels
like those are just really cold and I

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:52.650
like those are just really cold and I
 

01:28:52.650 --> 01:28:53.600

in perspective was even worse i could

of the reasons ever problem with the
 

01:35:39.309 --> 01:35:40.500
of the reasons ever problem with the
digital printing it's the lack of

01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:40.510
digital printing it's the lack of
 

01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:46.620
digital printing it's the lack of
physicality and I all of the work that I

01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:46.630
physicality and I all of the work that I
 

01:35:46.630 --> 01:35:49.109
physicality and I all of the work that I
that I do if you see it in reproduction

01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119
that I do if you see it in reproduction
 

01:35:49.119 --> 01:35:50.459

it looks like there's a very little
 

01:35:50.469 --> 01:35:52.290
it looks like there's a very little
physicality but actually it's very

01:35:52.290 --> 01:35:52.300
physicality but actually it's very
 

01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:54.000
