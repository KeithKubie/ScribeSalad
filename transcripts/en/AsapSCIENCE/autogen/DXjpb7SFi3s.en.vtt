00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.180
 Whether you eat it or not, you must have heard of gluten. Especially with increased interest in gluten-free diet. 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.210
 Many people wonder what gluten is, and more specifically do you have to 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.500
 Should you eat it or not? 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.969
 Simply put, gluten is a compound of two proteins that are found mainly in wheat and similar grains 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.900
 Such as barley and rye. Just ! It's just a protein! These two types of protein are called Glidine 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.070
 Glutinin is a combination of gluten, which helps nourish plant embryos 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.380
 An essential source in giving bread to its usual lyce in chewing, just like 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.550
 Gum, making the dough is similar in its properties to the sponge! 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.550
 Well, why is gluten bad for us? In fact this is not true, gluten itself is not harmful or essential 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.590
 For your health, there is not enough evidence that stopping it is considered 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.860
 A good choice for a healthy person. In contrast, people with chronic digestive disorders - 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.399
 Called "celiac disease" - can not eat gluten at all, which caused the misunderstanding 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.469
 When some 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.719
 The body of a person with celiac disease sees gluten as something exotic on the human body, leading to an immune response 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.609
 Eventually leading to the destruction of a small part of the intestines. By repeating this, the body becomes infected 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.100
 Severely undernourished. Newly discovered scientists 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.140
 Some people who are not sick with Celiac disease have an allergy to gluten 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.700
 They suffer from similar symptoms after eating gluten - such as intestinal cramps, diarrhea and abdominal distension. 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.100
 In both cases, gluten free food is essential. But if you 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.259
 Do not suffer from any of the two conditions, there is no significant difference in health if the follow gluten-free diet. 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.320
 Gluten is not by any means toxic as some people think, as well as gluten free food does not necessarily mean 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.680
 It is healthier food or less in calories. 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.530
 By contrast, there is some risk in the absence of gluten, although the absence of gluten itself 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.670
 Is not in itself a problem, but the absence of vitamins and the accompanying pills may be dangerous. 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.290
 Without getting them, it may be harmful to your health. Most importantly, 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.470
 Without the gluten to keep your food connected, more fat and sugar will be used to compensate gluten when making gluten-free foods 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.090
 So as to make them delicious. 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.990
 At the same time, the popularity of diets based on gluten-free foods has created a market for this 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.990
 Type of foods. Previously there were limited options for this type of food, while now we find multiple options of gluten-free foods, 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.290
 Which is good for people in need of this kind of food! 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.280
 But what if there is a substance that contains all the things your body needs, and excludes
