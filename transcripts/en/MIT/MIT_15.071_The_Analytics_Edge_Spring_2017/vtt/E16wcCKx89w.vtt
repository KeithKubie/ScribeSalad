00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.310
In this video we'll try to make
predictions for the 2012-2013

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.560
season.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.020
We'll need to load our test set
because our training set only

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.870
included data from 1980 up
until the 2011-2012 season.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.960
So let's call it NBA_test.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.550
And we'll read it in
the same way as always,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.600
read.csv("NBA_test.csv").

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.160
All right, so now let's try
to predict using our model

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.090
that we made in the previous
video, how many points we'll

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.070
see in 2012-2013 season.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.450
Let's call this
PointsPrediction.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.450
And so we use the
predict command here.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.990
And we give it the previous
model that we made.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.620
We'll give it
PointsReg4, because that

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.030
was the model we determined
at the end to be the best one.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.880
And the new data
which is NBA_test.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.430
OK, so now that we have our
prediction, how good is it?

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.570
We can compute the out
of sample r-squared.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.980
This is a measurement
of how well

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.580
the model predicts on test data.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.200
The r squared value we
had before from our model,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.300
the 0.8991, you might
remember, is the measure

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.610
of an in-sample
r-squared, which is

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.580
how well the model
fits the training data.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.490
But to get a measure of the
predictions goodness of fit,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.740
we need to calculate the
out of sample r-squared.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.310
So let's do that here.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.190
We need to compute the
sum of squared errors.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.370
And so this here is just the
sum of the predicted amount

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:11.470
minus the actual amount of
points squared and summed.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.670
And we need the total
sums of squares,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:24.890
which is just the sum of
the average number of points

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.680
minus the test actual
number of points.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.530
So the r-squared here
then is calculated

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.630
as usual, 1 minus the sum
of squared errors divided

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.500
by total sums of squares.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.100
And we see that we have an
r squared value of 0.8127.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.810
We can also calculate the root
mean square error the same way

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.940
as before, root
mean squared error

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.080
is going to be the square root
of the sum of squared errors

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.140
divided by n, which is the
number of rows in our test data

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.640
set.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:21.280
OK and the root mean squared
error here is 196.37.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.120
So it's a little bit
higher than before.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.400
But it's not too bad.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.680
We're making an average
error of about 196 points.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.220
We'll stop here for now.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.220
Good luck with the homework.
