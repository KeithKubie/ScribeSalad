the flash and a click of sound coming
 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.270
the flash and a click of sound coming
from the same place and you ask them

from the same place and you ask them
 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.160

okay please point to the place where

one-third of this you know towards the

one-third of this you know towards the
towards the light and two-thirds towards

vision to try to reconstruct the

twice as much as hearing but this is you

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359
twice as much as hearing but this is you

twice as much as hearing but this is you
know relatively surprising we would

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
know relatively surprising we would
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.550
know relatively surprising we would
think that actually with we see the

think that actually with we see the

think that actually with we see the
plate precise place where things happen

plate precise place where things happen
 

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:57.169
plate precise place where things happen
and we sort of here you know something

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179
and we sort of here you know something
 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.480
and we sort of here you know something
very broad but but it is not so our

detailed imagery of the world and again

coming back to my previous point this is

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190
coming back to my previous point this is
 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.839
coming back to my previous point this is
surprising because the amount of primary

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849
surprising because the amount of primary
 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.809
surprising because the amount of primary
sensory receptors that are used for

sensory receptors that are used for
 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.130
sensory receptors that are used for
hearing is so much more

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140
hearing is so much more
 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.140
hearing is so much more
than the ones that are useful for vision

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150
than the ones that are useful for vision
 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.270
than the ones that are useful for vision
that there is a substantial amount of

that there is a substantial amount of
 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.800
that there is a substantial amount of
information processing that the nervous
