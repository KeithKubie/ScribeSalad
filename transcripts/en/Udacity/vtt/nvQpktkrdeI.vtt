00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.260
This equation is a linear equation.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.570
Linear equations have
the following properties.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.450
Linear equations must
have an equal sign.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.510
So here we have an equal sign.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.870
Linear equations must have an expression
on both sides of the equal sign.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.770
And we see here that we have expressions
on both sides of the equal sign.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.620
And no variables will have
an exponent greater than 1.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.640
And x here doesn't have
an exponent greater than 1.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.170
Previously, we talked about
algebraic expressions.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.590
Algebraic expressions do
not have an equal sign.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.060
You could only find a value for
an algebraic expression if you were

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.620
given values to substitute in for
the variables.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.124
This is called evaluating an expression.

00:00:45.124 --> 00:00:48.080
Notice that value is in
the word evaluating.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.750
This is different from an equation,
which has an equal sign.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.690
When you see an equal sign, you know
you can solve the linear equation to

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.690
find the value for the variable.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.910
Please indicate if each of these
is an expression or an equation.
