the time it was a huge interesting

around 2001 2002 a huge interest in

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.740
around 2001 2002 a huge interest in
carbon nanotubes so I was looking for

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750
carbon nanotubes so I was looking for
 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.200

entering into this research area which

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210
entering into this research area which
 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.530
entering into this research area which
brought so many nice results but with

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
brought so many nice results but with
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.229

something new with some prime idea and I

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239
something new with some prime idea and I
 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.959
something new with some prime idea and I
thought why wouldn't we do something

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969
thought why wouldn't we do something
 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.530
thought why wouldn't we do something
like carbon nanotubes but flat instead

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
like carbon nanotubes but flat instead
 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.770

of rolled up and that led me to an idea

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780
of rolled up and that led me to an idea
 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.340
of rolled up and that led me to an idea
to to start making extremely thin pieces

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
to to start making extremely thin pieces
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.549

pieces of graphite and studies and we

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230
pieces of graphite and studies and we
 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.040

eventually went down to single layer of

do very unusual things some chest sound

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250

usually nine ninety percent of those

we continue working on it for the next
 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.649
we continue working on it for the next
seven years
