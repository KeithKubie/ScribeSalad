00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:04.240
Getting an injection?

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:12.780
Where is that needle really going and … what
is in that syringe?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.219
Hi Everyone, Crystal here for DNews.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.470
Injection is a common medical practice and
all of us have to get our shots.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.869
Whether its the chicken pox vaccine or a boost
of insulin, we’ve grown to accept that injection

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.869
is a good way to administer drugs and vaccines,
but how does that actually work and what is

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.140
really being injected into your body?

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.820
It turns out that what type of injection you
get and the “formulation” used depends

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.420
a lot on how quickly doctors want the syringe
contents to be absorbed.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.320
This affects how often a you would need to
receive an injected treatment as well as your

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.540
blood concentration of the active ingredient.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.920
The two main types of injections are intramuscular
injections, which are injected into your muscles,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.140
and subcutaneous injections, which are injected
just under your skin.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.739
Intramuscular injections like the flu vaccine,
and some steroids and anti-psychotics are

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.800
given in large muscles like your upper arm
or buttocks because they need to reach the

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.770
bloodstream and take effect quickly.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.159
This can happen because you’ve got a lot
of blood circulating in your muscles to pick

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.190
up the drug and distribute it throughout your
body.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.950
Subcutaneous injections are probably the most
common, and they include most vaccines and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.509
the “insulin shots” given to diabetics.

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.369
Absorption of drugs injected under the skin
is similar to that of absorption in muscles,

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.020
but since there are less blood vessels under
the skin absorption can be slower.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.179
As a chemist, I think it’s pretty cool that
the absorption rate of an injected fluid is

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.490
influenced by many formulation factors as
well as injection location.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.210
Water based solutions are usually absorbed
faster than oil solutions, and doctors can

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.680
“fine tune” the absorption rate, by using
mixtures of oil-in-water or water-in-oil to

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.799
deliver the drug.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.159
The composition of an injected formulation
may also depend on the solubility of the active

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.140
compound so there are many factors at play
here and it is controversy over the preparation

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.780
of some vaccine formulations that has lead
to the anti-vax movement.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.590
So why injection and not a pill?

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.329
Injected treatments take effect faster, are
more concentrated, and don’t run the risk

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.670
of being destroyed by your stomach acid before
they can do their job.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.410
For all the good they do, there are some risks
associated with injections.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.400
Our skin exists to keep germs out and when
we puncture it we leave ourselves open to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.210
infection and transmission of disease.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.400
This is especially true when equipment is
re-used without adequate sterilization as

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.750
is frequently the case in less developed countries
or in recreational drug use.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.430
Fifteen years ago the World Health Organization
estimated that, in developing and transitional

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.280
countries, unsafe injections accounted for
respectively 5%, 32% and 40% of new infections

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.810
with HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis
C virus (HCV).

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.450
Due to worldwide safe injection campaigns
these conditions are improving, but not fast

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.450
enough.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.280
So now that you know a little more about how
they work, are you still afraid of getting

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.280
shots?
