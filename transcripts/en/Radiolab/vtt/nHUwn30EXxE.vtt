00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.500
This is radio lab in a couple of days ago, as in like seven, we uh,

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.920
we were on stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The big opera house there.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.610
It's a really beautiful theater and it was full of more than 2000 people.

5
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:17.100
We were part of something called Radio Love Fest.

6
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.673
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.871
<v 0>Radial ofs is a,</v>

8
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:26.871
a big public radio broadcasting radio lovey thing that w NYC station here puts

9
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:28.621
on.

10
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:32.730
Basically it's a parade of all these amazing public radio shows and podcasts.

11
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.060
We opened the festival and since it was called radio love fest,

12
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.450
we figured we would use the opportunity to basically talk about the community of

13
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.510
people around radio lab that we love, the producers, the musicians.

14
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:49.170
We features amazing acts like so percussion who you're hearing.

15
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.440
A lot of stuff happened and we told a lot of stories today.

16
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:54.840
We're just on this podcast. We're going to play two stories.

17
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.450
<v 2>These are both stories about love and about heart.</v>

18
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.330
The last one which you'll hear is a,

19
00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:03.520
is an exclusive interview with Oliver Sacks.

20
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.590
Basically giving a kind of valedictory interview. It's pretty wonderful.

21
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.570
But first we decided to do literally a look at a heart.

22
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.280
This comes from our producer, Molly Webster.

23
00:01:15.281 --> 00:01:19.990
It was scored live by a soap percussion, which is Eric,

24
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.970
Chad beats, Josh Quillin, Jason Trudy and Adams Lewinsky. Oh.

25
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.930
And some people in the audience in the theater audience had a pretty strong

26
00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:27.520
reaction to what you are about to hear.

27
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.110
And we are not so sure that that might not also be the case if you're just

28
00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:35.500
listening. So if you are driving or you're operating machinery,

29
00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:38.230
maybe this isn't the best piece to listen to because it can get a little

30
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.690
intense, which we'll talk about a little bit afterwards. Uh, in the meantime,

31
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:43.340
here's producer Molly Webster.

32
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.960
<v 3>So this is a story about a friend summer ash. Uh,</v>

33
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.330
we used to work together and I think it's fair to say that summer has a

34
00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:55.560
complicated relationship with her heart. You know, my heart was not beating

35
00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:58.810
<v 5>for three hours.</v>

36
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.910
<v 3>Really crazy thought. Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.643
<v 5>Technically,</v>

38
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.553
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

39
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.150
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

40
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.390
<v 3>so a couple of things to know about summer. She's like wicked smart.</v>

41
00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:17.720
She's an astrophysicist. She uses a lot of big words, propulsion,

42
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:21.200
center of gravity and moment of inertia, x and Y, Z axis.

43
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.960
Do you remember that original like radial keratotomy like no,

44
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:25.460
I don't even know what that word is.

45
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.810
The other thing to know is she's an engineer, right?

46
00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:32.480
So she loves like take things apart.

47
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.050
You sort of like coke around rewire ratchet.

48
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.260
You got a ratchet. Uh,

49
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.930
and so the thing to know is when she found out she had to get heart surgery,

50
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:48.830
she made sure there was someone in the operating room with the camera taking

51
00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:53.831
pictures of my open chest cavity and the valve and when things were cut and when

52
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:57.140
things were being sown in y. Yeah,

53
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.280
I totally approached this completely as a scientist. I want to know

54
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.310
<v 6>what's happening. I want to know why. I want to know what you're doing.</v>

55
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:04.870
I want to know what's going on around me.

56
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.030
<v 3>And in any case, as sort of backup and explain, um,</v>

57
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.090
summer was just following up on like a heart diagnosis that it had happened

58
00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:17.840
about 15 years earlier. And so she had been diagnosed with a murmur,

59
00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:20.390
which is basically just like a funny sound in your heart.

60
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.680
And that's like a whoosh in between the thump, thump, thump, thump.

61
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.590
And in summer's case, she had been told it's no big deal.

62
00:03:27.591 --> 00:03:31.460
And so this was just a follow up appointment to make sure nothing had changed.

63
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.860
And so she goes to the doctor, she,

64
00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:37.790
they run a few tests and then they send her on her way and a few weeks later she

65
00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:39.100
gets an email saying,

66
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.930
<v 6>um, don't panic.</v>

67
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.453
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

68
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.700
<v 6>but I think you should see a heart surgeon.</v>

69
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.170
<v 3>It turns out the situation with her heart had changed her aorta,</v>

70
00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:58.140
which is like the largest artery coming out of her heart.

71
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.690
It was larger than it should have been.

72
00:04:00.691 --> 00:04:03.270
So it's supposed to be about two centimeters in diameter.

73
00:04:03.271 --> 00:04:06.720
And in summer's case it was five. Yeah. What does that mean for your bodies?

74
00:04:06.721 --> 00:04:07.920
So that's the thing,

75
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.550
<v 6>asymptomatic, it's not actively harming you,</v>

76
00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:15.240
but it's a threat to your life because if it ruptures,

77
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.050
it's your main blood vessel. And if it goes,

78
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.340
you bleed out internally so fast that no er can help you.

79
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

80
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.080
<v 3>Her doctor says go find a heart surgeon. And in the meantime,</v>

81
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:31.810
no heavy lifting or contact sports in summers. Like,

82
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.230
<v 6>well I live in New York, like living in New York as a contact sport. Yeah,</v>

83
00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:38.480
I was gonna say people crash into you all the time. Yeah.

84
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.370
<v 3>Six months later, summer finds herself on the operating table.</v>

85
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.280
<v 6>They actually, um, I think, I'm not sure the exact order of operations,</v>

86
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.423
<v 3>but they</v>

87
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.190
open her sternum from the bottom all the way up to the top and then they just

88
00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:01.770
like, oh, he pulled back a rib cage so they can get EQ,

89
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.470
her heart,

90
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.000
they put some sort of fluid on it that stops it from beading and they actually

91
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:11.220
sort of just inject that fluid into the heart and that short circuits it

92
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.320
<v 6>so your heart actually stops and then they hook you up to a bypass,</v>

93
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.170
a heart lung bypass machine.

94
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.360
<v 3>And one of the things that does is it drains the heart of all it's blood.</v>

95
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.150
And so it's like flat, like a pancake.

96
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.900
And you can see pictures of all of this on her blog.

97
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.660
You can even see pictures. It's true.

98
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.720
You can even see pictures of the a surgeon cutting four inches out of her aorta

99
00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:43.811
and replacing it with the synthetic tube and the entire time summer's heart is

100
00:05:44.631 --> 00:05:45.464
just

101
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.040
<v 1>limb in quiet.</v>

102
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.690
<v 3>Eight hours later she wakes up.</v>

103
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.840
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

104
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.920
<v 6>What do you remember about your first conversation with your doctors? Oh,</v>

105
00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:58.580
I don't remember my first conversation much,

106
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.140
but I do vividly remember my first thought part of my friends was,

107
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.690
<v 1>fuck, this hurts.</v>

108
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.060
<v 3>Just mind altering pain.</v>

109
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.730
<v 8>Oh my God. Eight hours ago I felt so much better than this.</v>

110
00:06:14.731 --> 00:06:18.450
Can we just go back to that now? Like, no, I don't want this. You know,

111
00:06:18.451 --> 00:06:23.451
everything pulls on your torso and so when your sternum has been cut open and

112
00:06:23.641 --> 00:06:27.840
then reconnected, everything that pulls on that hurts.

113
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.030
You can't move anything or lift anything. It hurts to talk.

114
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.920
It even hurt to breathe,

115
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.790
but literally from day one they make you stand up

116
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.933
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

117
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.360
<v 8>and start walking. Really. I was like, she was like,</v>

118
00:06:46.361 --> 00:06:48.970
we're going to get you to sit and chat. I was like, no, no, we're not.

119
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.030
What are you talking? What are you smoking? And that's just to,

120
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.950
that's just to basically, you just got to get the heart going again, you know,

121
00:06:56.951 --> 00:06:58.180
just get it healing.

122
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.600
<v 3>But here's the thing, when it came back,</v>

123
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.580
it came back with a vengeance. So to be fair,

124
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:12.020
her recovery went really well. About two months in, she's in cardiac rehab,

125
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:15.560
the pain is fading. She's thinking about sending her mother home.

126
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:19.880
Her mom had been staying with her for awhile and then one day she's in cardiac

127
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:22.060
rehab on the elliptical machine.

128
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.120
<v 6>And so I remember stopping and I had this white tee shirt that would literally</v>

129
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.510
like just be fluttering

130
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:34.790
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

131
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.900
<v 6>with my heartbeat. Like it was blowing in high windows or something.</v>

132
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.430
And I was like, well that's interesting. You mean that you could see it?

133
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.110
Oh yeah. Yeah. Even the physical therapist there could see it. They, the they,

134
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.960
you mean like you would look down and you'd see the thing,

135
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.900
your heart beating through your chest wall,

136
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.250
pushing your shirt off your chest? Well, because I'm a lady,

137
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.050
there was a gap here.

138
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:04.790
So like that sort of there a space for that vibration to happen, so to speak.

139
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:07.470
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

140
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.050
<v 3>but then she goes home and it was still happening.</v>

141
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.123
<v 9>Okay.</v>

142
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.280
<v 3>Like just sitting on her couch, not even working out. She's like, Whoa,</v>

143
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.140
my heart is strong.

144
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.290
<v 6>It just felt so strong that I, part of me was like,</v>

145
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:25.470
<v 3>am I going crazy? Like is it as strong as it seems like it is? Because if it is,</v>

146
00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:28.980
surely this is making a noise. So one day,

147
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.370
a few months after surgery, she goes to upstate New York,

148
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.820
she's visiting some family friends and she's hanging out with their daughter

149
00:08:35.821 --> 00:08:36.654
Julia.

150
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:41.530
<v 10>She walked in and we were standing in my room,</v>

151
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.430
<v 3>they're just chatting and then suddenly Julia's eyes get really wide.</v>

152
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:50.000
<v 10>And I was standing there just, oh my gosh, I just want to skirt it.</v>

153
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:55.650
<v 3>She could hear summer's heart out loud two feet away from in the room.</v>

154
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.920
<v 6>And I was like, okay, this is happening. Uh,</v>

155
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.760
so I guess in typical summer fashion, she's Kinda like, let's engineer that.

156
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.600
If a friend of mine can hear it with their ear and what could a studio pick up?

157
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.830
So she grabs her radio producer, friend, uh,

158
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.920
they go to a studio and he sticks a Mike about six inches in front of her chest.

159
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.020
And this is what they recorded.

160
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.040
This is not a stethoscope. This is what it sounds like.

161
00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:38.360
If you were standing in a quiet room next to summer, God,

162
00:09:38.361 --> 00:09:40.280
that's strong. What does that feel like?

163
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:45.430
It just feels as if my entire ribcage,

164
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:51.590
my clavicle, my sternum, my whole chest cavity is acting like an amp.

165
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:58.030
And it's sort of transmitting the vibrations of each heartbeat in physically in

166
00:09:59.481 --> 00:10:04.040
my body to feel each RP. Yeah. Do you feel it right now? Yeah.

167
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.640
You can just feel that thump, thump, thump. Yep.

168
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.340
It feels like somebody has a rubber mallet and is banging on the inside of my

169
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.890
start and it's very staccato.

170
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.780
When she goes back to the doctor, she's like, dude, my heart.

171
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.520
So he sort of just did some like listening and some feeling [inaudible],

172
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.560
you know? And his reaction to it was like, yeah, that's strong.

173
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:44.080
So we run some tests and he's like, listen, your blood pressure's fine.

174
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.880
All of your stats are fine. So I guess I did a really good job. Yay.

175
00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:53.740
Good for you. But, but okay, I guess I have a strong heart. Yay. Strong heart.

176
00:10:53.741 --> 00:10:57.000
But I don't want to feel this all the time. The doctor was like, Whoa, Whoa,

177
00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.470
whoa. Don't freak out. This will go away.

178
00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:05.050
It's probably just that there's scar tissue on your sternum and it's

179
00:11:05.051 --> 00:11:09.730
transmitting the vibration and is that goes away. The sensation should fade.

180
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.760
He said sometimes six to nine months is when maybe the Scar Tissue Heals more

181
00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:20.350
thins out. So she's like, all right, nine months. Oh I can get to that.

182
00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:21.250
That's no problem.

183
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.660
So she sorta just settled in and treated it like a scientific curiosity,

184
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.740
like a party trick.

185
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:32.020
If I went to a restaurant where they had like tables for two but they weren't

186
00:11:32.021 --> 00:11:35.820
like the sturdiest of tables. If we had water glasses on them and I,

187
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.910
I sort of leaned on the table like the water glass would look like Jurassic

188
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.023
Park.

189
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.830
Like my heartbeat would be like the footsteps of the tone sorcerer.

190
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.330
Yeah. So that was like my party's strikes.

191
00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.850
You had six months of Alation trick and then yeah.

192
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.880
And then it stopped being a party trick it sounds like. Yeah.

193
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.570
What happened and I'm not really sure like you know incident wise,

194
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:04.180
I think for me it was just time passing

195
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.470
cause that nine month mark just came and went and it was still there and when

196
00:12:12.471 --> 00:12:15.770
she asks her doctor he has no idea why.

197
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.820
So 12 months still there,

198
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:26.590
15 months it's still there and she says it just started getting really annoying

199
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:29.780
if it's distracting.

200
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:35.150
The the funny thing was the more active I was than the less aware of it I was.

201
00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:40.180
But she says when she was at her office trying to be still be still to either be

202
00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:43.940
writing something, writing emails, planning lectures,

203
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:45.900
<v 3>that's when it would be like</v>

204
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.720
<v 6>really loud. That's when it would become the most dominant thing. Like I,</v>

205
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:59.810
I couldn't go to work because it just kept drawing my focus and when it did it

206
00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:04.470
would just feel her with anxiety. It was

207
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.170
<v 3>sort of this like automatic response, and I'll try and explain it,</v>

208
00:13:08.171 --> 00:13:10.990
but it's basically like when you get scared,

209
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.950
it goes into your brain and then the signal goes down into your body.

210
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.160
So you step on a snake and your brain is like, oh my God, it's a snake run,

211
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:21.850
body run, and then your heart pounds. In summer's case,

212
00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:25.980
it was just the opposite. There was no snake, but her heart was pounding zero.

213
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.350
Her brain would be like, Whoa, why is my heart pounding? Oh my God,

214
00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:32.110
is there a snake? There must be a snake run, body run,

215
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:33.490
and her heart would pound.

216
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.270
My brain keeps thinking something must be wrong because we're having,

217
00:13:37.271 --> 00:13:39.520
we're already doing this, so something must be wrong,

218
00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:41.080
so I guess something's wrong, so let's freak out.

219
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:46.470
She was caught in this feedback loop and then she was like rightly so,

220
00:13:46.871 --> 00:13:51.820
edgy and prime that any emotion on top of that, like even if it was happiness,

221
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.660
which is too much. Oh my gosh, yeah. Nights. It would keep me awake.

222
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:56.770
I would focus on it.

223
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.030
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

224
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.760
<v 6>I would get into hearing the rhythm, feeling the rhythm</v>

225
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.400
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

226
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.410
<v 6>yeah, sort of with the expectation of just</v>

227
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.740
<v 9>the next one. Next one.</v>

228
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:19.340
Next one. Next one.

229
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.910
Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one.

230
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.970
Next one. Next one. Next one.

231
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.100
Next one, one next one. Next one.

232
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.690
Next one. Next one. Next one.

233
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.090
Next one. [inaudible]

234
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.140
<v 3>with every beat.</v>

235
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.200
Our hearts are just literally tapping out time and I mean researchers actually

236
00:14:51.801 --> 00:14:56.210
thought about this and there was this idea that was proposed like a right before

237
00:14:56.211 --> 00:15:01.160
the dawn of sort of modern heart surgery that we each get 1 billion beats in our

238
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:02.990
lifetime and then that's it.

239
00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.320
And most of us don't notice them going by,

240
00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:08.570
but in summer's case she can't not notice it.

241
00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.520
<v 6>Yeah, I'm aware of it always. It's never not there.</v>

242
00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.670
It's never not noticeable that,

243
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.990
I mean it's just like this constant awareness of the future that summer is

244
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.700
endlessly meditating on.

245
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:29.730
My heart takes over and I can't do the things that I want to do and not knowing

246
00:15:29.831 --> 00:15:34.831
if that's going to last forever or if it's going to end suddenly or if it's just

247
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.630
gonna Peter out. The not knowing gets to me.

248
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:46.340
<v 3>So she stopped going out as much as she stopped returning phone calls except for</v>

249
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:48.230
like a few close group of friends.

250
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:53.590
<v 6>The Times were just being curled up in bed and just crying.</v>

251
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.040
A really wanted to yell at my heart, shut up,

252
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.650
stop when you really talk to your heart. Well,

253
00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:04.310
I mean I would never had conversations but I would be like shut the fuck up.

254
00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.023
<v 3>But it wouldn't</v>

255
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.620
and as time went on, like the constant pounding,

256
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.630
it just became unbearable.

257
00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:24.650
She describes it as like this alien creature is like trying to just claw it's

258
00:16:25.801 --> 00:16:28.470
way out the bottom of my neck.

259
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.463
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

260
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.950
<v 3>but there was this one moment right in the middle of all of this.</v>

261
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.930
She had her two year checkup post-surgery and for that they had to take a

262
00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:13.130
picture of her heart.

263
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:17.090
So I schedule my two year appointment and to look at her heart,

264
00:17:17.091 --> 00:17:20.120
they do an echocardiogram, which is basically, you know,

265
00:17:20.121 --> 00:17:24.290
like the ultrasound like that you get for the pregnant. Oh yeah.

266
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.190
It's like a little,

267
00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:30.220
a little wand and you get the jelly and they basically go all over your upper,

268
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.370
you know, the area around your heart and from all different angles.

269
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.710
So what ended up happening is I'm lying on my left side and I'm facing the wall

270
00:17:39.711 --> 00:17:43.100
and the technician's behind me and the technician is sort of like reaching

271
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.830
around her, waving the wand over her heart.

272
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.980
And the monitor for the echocardiogram is behind summer so she can't

273
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.870
<v 6>see it, but she's wearing eyeglasses.</v>

274
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.330
So you know how you can sometimes like see a reflection,

275
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.350
a peripherally on your glasses of something that's like behind you.

276
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.350
Like if you were in a somewhat darker room, there was a window,

277
00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:04.650
like you would totally see the reflection. So the room's a little bit darkened.

278
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.780
Summer's lying there on her side and she sees the reflection of the screen,

279
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.440
um, on my glasses and it catches her eye because it's moving.

280
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:15.150
And then I realize what it is that I'm,

281
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:20.270
I'm seeing a tiny reflection of her heart beating and I have this like moment

282
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:23.840
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

283
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.340
<v 6>I have this moment where I'm like, oh my gosh your,</v>

284
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:30.020
I'm like talking to my heart and my head going, well we had your working hard.

285
00:18:30.021 --> 00:18:32.780
Like you're trying your hardest, you're doing the best that you can.

286
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.640
I'm, I'm doing the best that I can.

287
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.960
You're in there and you're working and you are working for me and we are on the

288
00:18:40.961 --> 00:18:45.070
same team and I just totally like, I just silently start crying.

289
00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:51.870
<v 1>No</v>

290
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.300
<v 6>like what do you think spurred that on?</v>

291
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:59.301
Like what was it about seeing it or there's just something about physically

292
00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:04.310
seeing it but feeling it at the same time.

293
00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:08.930
Like knowing that I'm seeing what's happening inside me that somehow just like

294
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.600
clicked this understanding into place.

295
00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.210
<v 3>She said there was something about seeing it in real time,</v>

296
00:19:17.211 --> 00:19:19.790
like feeling this thing in her chest,

297
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:24.470
just pulsing in rhythm with what was happening on the screen and then suddenly

298
00:19:24.471 --> 00:19:25.100
it just,

299
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:30.080
it didn't seem separate from her anymore and all those worries about the future.

300
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.850
And what was going to happen and wasn't going to go away.

301
00:19:31.851 --> 00:19:34.310
And I mean she's just stopped. She was just like, no,

302
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:39.710
<v 6>you are just beating and that beating is me. It was sort of like,</v>

303
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:41.030
it was sort of like this moment of,

304
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:46.300
of recognition of its purpose and its work and and sort of this,

305
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:54.910
so it's kind of like that whole idea of when you feel like you see somebody not

306
00:19:56.001 --> 00:19:58.790
just physically, like you see who they are, you see what they are,

307
00:19:58.791 --> 00:20:02.690
but you see who they are. Like I had that. Like I felt like I see you heart,

308
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:07.370
like I see what you're doing, I see what your purpose is. I see.

309
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.480
I see you

310
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.240
<v 3>on the one hand, what she sees like with her engineer's brain is,</v>

311
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:19.980
oh I get you. You're just a pump. And it's that same, you know,

312
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.830
realization that essentially led to modern medicine, right?

313
00:20:22.831 --> 00:20:27.300
Like the minute we took the soul out of the heart, we were willing to touch it,

314
00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:30.150
to cut it open, to stitch it up to start fixing things.

315
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.480
And now we have lifespans that by some estimates are 2.5 billion beats.

316
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:42.210
But on the other hand, like when you hear someone's heartbeat,

317
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:47.660
your parents or your child's like in that beat is an entire lifetime.

318
00:20:48.671 --> 00:20:53.260
It's a, it's a history of beats. It's a series of beats yet to come.

319
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:57.010
And I dunno, thinking about all that, I just,

320
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.270
I just sort of got walloped at the end of this interview. Um,

321
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.050
when summer asked us if we wanted to try and listen to her heart.

322
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.920
<v 2>Can we try that? Just see it. Do you want to? Yeah. Oh, that's just moved then.</v>

323
00:21:08.921 --> 00:21:10.900
Like, or I'll stand up or something.

324
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:15.130
So she stood up from her chair and she started put her chest right in front of

325
00:21:15.131 --> 00:21:18.820
the mic and then we all just got really quiet. Okay.

326
00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.640
<v 1>Oh my God. Oh my God.</v>

327
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.370
[inaudible]

328
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.280
<v 2>oh my God. Wow. It's just me. It makes me really emotional.</v>

329
00:21:39.281 --> 00:21:42.300
Every time I hear it, it makes my eyes, well, it's here.

330
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.940
It's really amazing. I guess I still got

331
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.640
kitchen art.

332
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.190
<v 1>You Go. Yeah.</v>

333
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.780
<v 2>So give it up for radio lab producer Molly [inaudible].</v>

334
00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:11.920
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

335
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.490
<v 2>yeah. When you said earlier that a lot of people in the audience had a strong</v>

336
00:22:15.491 --> 00:22:18.700
reactions. Here's how we met. I mean, I don't know if you could tune this in,

337
00:22:18.701 --> 00:22:21.460
but like when we were doing that story I was definitely seem like something's

338
00:22:21.461 --> 00:22:24.760
going on out there. I can tell cause we were on stage, I couldn't, you know,

339
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.410
this is their 20 I definitely was tuning in.

340
00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:28.900
There's something going on in the audience, something going on side stage,

341
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.040
but I didn't really know what it was.

342
00:22:30.041 --> 00:22:34.990
We were in the middle of it walk off stage and the first thing we hear is that

343
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:40.400
numerous people had fainted, even vomited during that piece. We were like, what?

344
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.130
Seriously? I did not see it coming. No, we were really,

345
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:49.090
really scared at first and I thought, oh my God, am I, am I killing people?

346
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.700
Like it was just like, I was like, were they old? Were they young? Like what?

347
00:22:54.701 --> 00:22:57.640
Like why they were young and that made me say, Oh okay.

348
00:22:57.641 --> 00:23:01.150
They feel like weirdly a little bit better. Maybe they can handle it. Yeah,

349
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:05.650
I just was, and then I was kind of weirdly mortified. Terrified.

350
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.070
But after we figured out that no one was hurt, we were like, we got,

351
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:09.993
we were like,

352
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.940
we would start putting out and we started making some calls because we were

353
00:23:12.941 --> 00:23:16.180
like, what was that? What do we make of that? Just like, oh, I didn't know you.

354
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:20.200
So the show is over and we all go home. This is days after this.

355
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.000
And you're thinking, oh my God,

356
00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:25.210
we're gonna Cause I'm thinking we've got a podcast, this damn thing, right.

357
00:23:25.211 --> 00:23:28.570
We have to, we have to understand this and say something completely right.

358
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.510
So the first person we called was a psychiatrist,

359
00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:36.260
<v 11>Rachel Yehuda, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry.</v>

360
00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.980
<v 2>I explained to her the basic situation that,</v>

361
00:23:37.981 --> 00:23:41.070
that some people had fainted and felt woozy. We weren't quite sure how any

362
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.700
<v 11>five or six people out of 2100</v>

363
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:49.130
<v 2>somewhere between five and a 12 we don't have a,</v>

364
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.480
a clear number just yet.

365
00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:51.620
<v 11>That's very interesting.</v>

366
00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.970
<v 2>Do you have any sense of what might've caused this? Just like a guess.</v>

367
00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.950
<v 11>So my best guess about that would be that they have activated their</v>

368
00:23:59.951 --> 00:24:04.630
parasympathetic nervous system in response to hearing the heartbeat.

369
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.641
<v 2>No, just to explain.</v>

370
00:24:05.641 --> 00:24:08.610
Our autonomic nervous system is divided into a bunch of different parts.

371
00:24:08.611 --> 00:24:10.680
You've got your sympathetic nervous system,

372
00:24:10.681 --> 00:24:12.090
which is sort of your fight or flight, right?

373
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.810
Sweat turns on when you're scared and then you've got your parasympathetic

374
00:24:15.811 --> 00:24:16.471
nervous system,

375
00:24:16.471 --> 00:24:20.850
which is sort of the opposite rather than getting you ready to fight or run,

376
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.500
it makes you calm.

377
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:26.730
And Doctor [inaudible] says that in certain people that parasympathetic response

378
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:32.030
can actually kind of go overboard and their Lud pressure can drop quickly too

379
00:24:32.191 --> 00:24:34.050
quickly and they end up fainting.

380
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.260
<v 11>Now the most common, um,</v>

381
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.380
stimulus for this to happen in,

382
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:43.130
in real life is fainting at the sight of blood.

383
00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:46.940
Some people just do that and it's not that common.

384
00:24:46.941 --> 00:24:51.740
About two to 4% of the population have this kind of a response.

385
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.250
And we don't exactly know why it happens.

386
00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.280
There is some opinion that the idea of fainting when you see blood is an

387
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.870
adaptive evolutionary response

388
00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.900
<v 2>that you know, maybe back in the day when we were being chased by predators,</v>

389
00:25:05.901 --> 00:25:07.130
it would have been a good idea to faint

390
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:09.310
<v 11>because maybe the animal will think you're dead.</v>

391
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.670
<v 2>Then he'll skip you. He wants a live meat and you're dead meat.</v>

392
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.980
Exactly sees you lying there and he's like, I don't want to eat that.

393
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.710
[inaudible] throw. Another theory is,

394
00:25:17.711 --> 00:25:22.150
this is also an evolutionary one is that if your blood pressure drops like it

395
00:25:22.151 --> 00:25:23.020
does when you faint,

396
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:26.530
well that kind of protects you a little bit because you'll have less blood in

397
00:25:26.531 --> 00:25:29.890
your arms and legs. So if your arms and legs get bitten by a lion,

398
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:34.150
say then you are less likely to bleed out. Let me see. There's nothing,

399
00:25:34.151 --> 00:25:36.810
there's nothing juicy to suck on if your blood is on,

400
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.210
not in your wing or your limb. Yeah, basically. I mean who knows?

401
00:25:40.211 --> 00:25:43.870
These are just stories, but going back to the two or 4% thing,

402
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.960
we got to thinking two to 4% of our audience that night would be,

403
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.950
what do we decide Molly was like 40 people, 44 to 88,

404
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.580
44 to 88 people at 2100.

405
00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.000
So we put out some emails, uh,

406
00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.300
looked at the incident reports and I think now we have identified how many,

407
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.650
what do we get? So for us, we've heard of maybe 10 or 11 at this point,

408
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:12.580
10 or 11 now. But I think that based on some of the stories that are coming in,

409
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.710
that the number might actually be much higher than that. Um,

410
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:18.370
for example,

411
00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:23.230
it's just manifested itself physically in a way that I could not have imagined

412
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.940
would be the case. This is Maria Cha Veco who, uh,

413
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.590
actually works down the street from us, uh,

414
00:26:29.591 --> 00:26:33.790
for the company that makes Latino USA. I was sitting in the front,

415
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:38.240
uh, against one of the walls, but not right at the wall. She says, uh,

416
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.920
she was listening to the story. Everything was fine at first, but then she says,

417
00:26:41.921 --> 00:26:45.000
as the beat kept going, she began to worry,

418
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.080
what if it never stops? What if summer never gets away from it?

419
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:53.670
And then the drumming got more intense and it was just like, oh no,

420
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.931
oh no.

421
00:26:54.931 --> 00:26:57.870
And it was definitely the sense of being trapped that the thing that was giving

422
00:26:57.871 --> 00:27:00.960
her life, which was absolutely necessary,

423
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.650
was also the thing that was tormenting her.

424
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.510
And she says that she was thinking about that.

425
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:08.550
She just kinda got short of breath.

426
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.990
And so I looked at my husband and put my hands up like,

427
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:17.280
like I gotta go. And he looked at me, he was like, are you all right?

428
00:27:17.281 --> 00:27:21.870
And I was like, I shook my head like, no. And um, and I,

429
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.150
and then I had the talk in my brain like, okay,

430
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.470
this is an intimate radio moment. You are right in the front area.

431
00:27:28.471 --> 00:27:32.400
If you get up six people have to get up with you. What are you doing?

432
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.060
You're ruining this for everybody. Just breathe and it'll be fine.

433
00:27:36.061 --> 00:27:40.650
And then the deeper I tried to breathe, the more anxious I sort of got like,

434
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.340
oh, and I had this fantasy of like standing up and doing like a really

435
00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.890
look to wiggle it out of me, but I was like, that's

436
00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:56.730
just got to suck it up and so Jeez, look at that.

437
00:27:56.731 --> 00:27:58.790
I'm having trouble breathing just thinking about it saying,

438
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.560
I don't want to put you back there. No, no, no, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

439
00:28:01.561 --> 00:28:02.394
I'm fine.

440
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:06.480
What my hunch is that there might be a lot more than 10 because maybe a lot of

441
00:28:06.481 --> 00:28:08.880
people just sort of pushed through and didn't get up.

442
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:10.380
It still felt weird knitting case.

443
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.890
One of the most interesting things that we bumped into is that Dr you who told

444
00:28:13.891 --> 00:28:17.040
us, it's very possible that the fainting in the wooziness

445
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.430
<v 11>be some kind of an empathy response.</v>

446
00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:22.120
<v 2>Really? In what sense?</v>

447
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.040
<v 11>Well,</v>

448
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.680
if you hear somebody's heart beating and you're aware that that's what you're

449
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:28.320
hearing,

450
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:33.320
it might arouse a tremendous connection within you of hearing the very source of

451
00:28:34.951 --> 00:28:36.030
their life. Yeah.

452
00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.990
<v 2>I became her. I did. I just, I was there with her.</v>

453
00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:44.500
<v 11>Can really be a lot to take in and you feel a little faint or emotional.</v>

454
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:49.580
<v 2>I just identified so much with somebody being trapped in their own body.</v>

455
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:54.960
It's like she couldn't escape. It was beating in my chest.

456
00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:00.440
The drums I felt were beating in my chest and in my crazy fantasy,

457
00:29:00.931 --> 00:29:03.510
you know, maybe they were breeding at the same rhythm.

458
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:07.980
One of the people that emailed that to the live show said that he felt like his

459
00:29:07.981 --> 00:29:12.420
heart was trying to match her beat and he couldn't catch his breath.

460
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:16.740
I don't know. I have, I don't know. It's never happened to me before. No. Wow.

461
00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.340
I asked her a in the end if she'd ever want to hear summer's heartbeat again and

462
00:29:20.341 --> 00:29:21.360
she said, oh yeah.

463
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:23.880
In fact she said she was going to listen to the story as soon as it was

464
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.450
podcasts, which is now because now she's got all these questions.

465
00:29:27.451 --> 00:29:30.960
Like was it the acoustics of this space or the fact that she was with so many

466
00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:35.130
people or maybe it was the volume cause it was pretty loud and will I feel the

467
00:29:35.131 --> 00:29:39.360
same when I hear it? You know, with my headphones on or, you know,

468
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:41.830
while I'm driving, will I have that feeling?

469
00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:44.860
So I had already decided that I was definitely gonna listen to it again.

470
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.330
We'll let you know what happens.

471
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:57.360

473
00:29:59.101 --> 00:30:01.500
who provided all the music so far? Um,

474
00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.070
they've just released an album called music for wood and strings written by

475
00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.530
Bryce deserter of the national. This is what you're hearing. It's,

476
00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.050
it's kind of an amazing piece.

477
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:12.933
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

478
