00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.570
PROFESSOR: OK, this is where
we were teaching the class.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.650
This is the new ESG kitchen.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.520
But we don't use it
only for this class.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.320
It's a community kitchen.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.870
So all the students in
the community can use it.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.630
And on Friday, we have
a community lunch.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.310
So one or two students
or staff members

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.910
cook for everybody else,
and this is where we usually

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.380
eat all together.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.160
But for the "Speak Italian
With Your Mouth Full" seminar,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.770
we were using this
board whenever

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.600
we needed to discuss some
grammar, some vocabulary.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.520
Right now there is
some physics problem.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.120
That's good, because
they're my students.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.180
So I know that they have
solved the problem set.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.700
And I also had a portable
whiteboard in case

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.640
we needed to visualize
some of the grammar,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.640
for example, while
we were cooking.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.850
So this is the common lounge.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.290
Well, right now there is nobody
around, because it's a holiday.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.840
But usually there are
students at every time

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.800
of the day or night.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.810
It's open 24/7.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.230
And the students come here
to work on problem sets

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.800
together, or just
sometimes socialize.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.060
We have a piano.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.420
We might have somebody play
the piano while the others are

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.090
solving problems at the board.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.140
And then we have our classrooms
on both sides of the hallway.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.990
I can show you.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.220
Yeah, so this is a classroom
where I usually teach physics.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.510
And as you can see,
it's pretty small.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.570
We have about 10, 12 seats.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.220
It's very different
from the classrooms

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.140
in the regular
curriculum where you

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.490
might take physics but with
another few hundred students.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.870
Here everybody knows
each other by name,

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.610
so they can really
work together.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.720
And, well, I use the board,
so part of my classes

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.900
are still lecture style.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.720
But then we work
in groups, as you

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.700
can see from the
structure of the table.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.720
We have chairs all around.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.340
So apart from the main board, I
also use portable whiteboards.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.420
And the idea is that
during the class,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.730
we can split and solve problems
in groups of two or three

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.230
people, which makes it
much more interactive.
