WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.270
The Joe Rogan experience.
But um,
that thing in the Congo Mans,

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.770
it's apparently in a very difficult spot to reach.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.200
It's very dangerous to go through there.
And you know,

4
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:11.580
when Justin wren goes through there,

5
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:16.490
he has some hair raising stories about being held up at gunpoint.
You know,

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.850
people thought they were gonna they were gonna kill somebody.
And Yeah,

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.960
a lot of the people,
a lot of the,
apparently a lot of the sort of,

8
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.340
uh,
soldiers and people that committed atrocities from the,
the uh,

9
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.870
war in Rwanda.

10
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.700
What kind of waiting there bands kind of moved into the Congo and lived in them

11
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.720
in,
you know,
in the jungle and who knows who Justin is a lot of crime.

12
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.850
Justin wren is a saint.
Yeah.
Cause he takes wells.
He's a legitimate sane.
Yeah.

13
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.390
Really is great guy.
He's gotten malaria three times.

14
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.220
God visiting the Congo and building wells.
Unbelievable.
Amazing.
Yeah,

15
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:56.940
he told us some amazing stories.
Heartbreaking.
It's amazing.

16
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.040
The cash app,
um,

17
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.050
which is one of my sponsors also sponsors fight for the forgotten to give people

18
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.930
the $5 every time someone signs up and uses the code.

19
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:10.650
Joe Rogan and they've built a,
they're building wells right now because of that.

20
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.580
Really?
Yeah.
They,
they,
who is the latest number?
I forget what the number was.

21
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:17.810
They sent me an updated,
like very early on there were,

22
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.680
they had built two wells and then they built a bunch more and provided water to

23
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.540
a shit ton of people down there.

24
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:29.460
I don't know the exact statistics moonwalking with Einstein.
Uh,

25
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.910
Dallas is he,
it's a book about memory and stuff.
Really Smart Guy.

26
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:35.360
He lived with the pygmies in the Congo for a long time.
Ah,

27
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.000
but that's what Justin rent's due on its own and said that they smoke copious

28
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:42.690
amounts of weed and they still tribes that they live with.
Is that the book?
Yeah.

29
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:47.370
Josh.
Joshua far for interesting.
What a name if we are for,

30
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.420
yeah.
And I said,
I never seen,
what is it,
you know,

31
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:55.410
these are people that truly have been almost untouched by Western civilization

32
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.920
and he's like,
well no,
I mean they die of stupid things.
Like,
you know,

33
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:02.460
you get an infection,
you know,
and you just,
you know,
you don't have antibiotics.

34
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.080
Well.
So a lot of bacteria and parasites and stuff to get stomach parasites from

35
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:10.590
water,
skin diseases and weird things like that.
Yeah.
The jungle is not,

36
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.920
even if you have evolved to live in it,
it's not a very,

37
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.680
I spent enough time in the Indonesian rainforest.

38
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.130
I've never seen bugs like that in my life.
I've never seen anything like it.

39
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.050
It's so loud.
It sounds like it.

40
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.320
Take the loudest street in Manhattan and I'm not kidding.

41
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.140
That's how loud the insects and birds and everything are,

42
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.430
and then you have to carry out the bug.
Spray does not work.
Never tell you this.

43
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.100
The bug spray.
You've got to carry a sulfur coil.
Yeah.

44
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.800
Good luck with the mosquitoes bugs where they laugh at your fucking,

45
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.960
at your bug spray.
You've got to carry it.

46
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.050
You have to burn a sulfur coil and just carry it.
Hold it.

47
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.430
That's correcting certain times when you wake up and they just,

48
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:50.880
they're all over the place that you were doing this.
God,
I was 21 did they,

49
00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:55.280
did they have thermal cells back then?
I don't think so.
Yeah.
Third,
myself a shit.

50
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.840
If you ever use the Thermostat,
what is that?
Oh my God,

51
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.390
they're fucking game changer.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's um,

52
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.780
it's a device that has like a heating coil in it and some fuel and you ignite it

53
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.920
and the,
the heating coil,

54
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:13.720
it heats up and you put this little pad across the screen and this little pad

55
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:17.430
has this stuff in it.
The mosquitoes hate.
It's probably terrible for you.
Yeah.

56
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.920
Some fucking chemical.
But the chemical wafs up in the air and I'm telling you,

57
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:25.760
it creates like a 10 foot bubble around.
You were no mosquitoes get it right.

58
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.210
Yeah.
And eat,
look,
even if it's a little bad for you,

59
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:32.920
maybe it's like smoking a pack of cigarettes better than gas fed on.

60
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.250
Yeah.
I'm not using it every day.
I wouldn't recommend using it every day.

61
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:39.070
But if it's different between like enjoying like if you're in a place like

62
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.710
Alaska.
Yeah,
exactly.
What about Edmonton up there?
What can you get?

63
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.570
Same thing came back with like,
oh the jacket.
The pockets.

64
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.560
Cause they'll fuck you up.
Those mosquitoes,
man.
Yeah.
They,

65
00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:53.360
they're so aggressive because they only alive for like three months,
you know,

66
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.990
it's so cold up there and nature could give a fuck about you introvert.

67
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.070
I love people that are into nature and they like,
listen man,

68
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.100
they don't even know what nature is.
They try to go to exactly.

69
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.370
Go try to raise crops in South Africa.

70
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:10.570
Went animals when elephants were all everywhere and lions and leopards and now,

71
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.450
yeah.
Even now if these poor villagers that they,

72
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.960
they're poor and they build these crops and they have this farm and they,
they,

73
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.020
they have all this food for their village and then elephant's Roman 20.

74
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.860
Allison's go,
hey man,
that's a wrap.
Yeah,
you're not going to go.

75
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:27.310
You can get the fuck outta here.
They're like,
stomp on you.
They,
I mean,

76
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.600
and then people get mad when people shoot the elephants.
It's like,
okay,
I get it,

77
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.700
but I don't know what you want here.

78
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.540
Like they have a lot of stories about elephants have this mistaken in South

79
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.510
Africa.
There was,
this guy was a farmer and uh,

80
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.660
he had a donkey and it was tied up and the elephants came into his property and

81
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:54.250
he shot guns and got him the hell away from there.
And then,
uh,

82
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.370
the next day the elephants came back and stomped his fucking donkey into mush.

83
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.600
Whoa.
Just stomped.
The donkey was on,
uh,
you know,

84
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.840
rope and they were like really gang,
gang,
gang.
And then of course,
the other,

85
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.880
the neighboring farm and the elephants came,
she,

86
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.740
she laid out a bunch of food for them and the eye and they spared her,
her crops.

87
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:18.460
There are all these elephants have this mystique,
which is all,
by the way,

88
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.210
maybe the biggest day holds in the world element.
They hate everybody.

89
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.500
But there were so nice,
I was in Thailand,
I was used as a tie off,
sir.

90
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.460
The different African elephants.
You're not,

91
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.150
you're not taming an African elephant.
Could look most of the elephants.
You see?

92
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.370
What does this,
Jamie,
okay.
Jimmy's watching like this little buffalo.
What's up?

93
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.550
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Elephant came over and rolled it all.

94
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.340
I don't give a fuck about you.
Essentially he's trying to stab him.
He is.
Oh,

95
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:46.550
he does?
He's killing it.
He's killing a baby.
That's,

96
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.230
that's probably a full ground buffalo.
That's just a giant elephant.
Well,

97
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:53.580
she's fucking up this buffalo.
They're so dangerous.
Look it up.
Yeah.

98
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.830
Elephants stabs and kills Buffalo.
Look at Jesus Christ.

99
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.540
Well that's why they have tusks.
Yeah,
there it is.
Yeah.

100
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.520
It's really crazy when lions take a chance.
Wow.
Doesn't the other video,

101
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:07.520
I didn't pull those three elephants killing a lion den elephant.

102
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:11.000
Just lazy as Shit.
They just killed crazy.

103
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.510
What's crazy is lions will take a chance on elephants,

104
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.240
which is just so nuts.
They,
they will take a chance to try to kill an alpha.

105
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.580
They'll jump on their back.
They'll try to jack them.
Well,

106
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:25.730
when you go to a game reserve in South Africa,
you can't,

107
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.930
it has to be big enough to sustain lines cause it's super expensive cause

108
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.360
they're just a pride of lions will eat everything.

109
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.470
So you got to keep replenishing the animals because they just,

110
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.060
they're just too effective.
Well,
you know,

111
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:42.890
after that dentists shot Cecil the lion,
it became this international outrage.

112
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:47.240
Yeah.
They um,
band the lion hunting and because of that,

113
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.810
people didn't want to go back and they weren't getting the money from it.

114
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:55.811
So they wound up euthanizing like 200 lions because they're undulate population

115
00:06:55.851 --> 00:07:00.650
was getting devastated.
But what made me think when I heard that I was like,

116
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.480
how many lions are they killing?

117
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.850
Like how many people are going over there to hunt lions?

118
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.130
It brings him good money.
I mean weird.

119
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:10.850
Is that a huge part of South Africa as you know that like part of the

120
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:13.570
conservation efforts or that you know,
big game you can fall,

121
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.600
you can hunt the big five or whatever they call it.
Yes,
that's exactly the call,

122
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.750
but it's,
but it needs a lot of money.

123
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.530
It is a lot of money and it brings them a lot of money and it brings them a lot

124
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:23.390
of money for conservation and all that stuff.

125
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.930
But what a weird activity.

126
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.890
Is there an activity that's more human in that like,

127
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.940
oh we are so conflicted and so weird that the only way we have animals that stay

128
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:39.830
alive in this part of the world,

129
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:43.670
like where they're on record populations is to set it up so you can kill them.

130
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.240
Yeah.
So like,
like we figured out some weird loophole,
look,

131
00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:50.210
we don't want the rhino to die.
Hey,
we don't want the ride or die either.

132
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.830
So let's go let a bunch of them and we kill like one a week.
Come on.

133
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.000
Yeah.
And if they could get enough rhinos where they could make a case for that,

134
00:07:59.001 --> 00:07:59.900
they would be doing that.
I mean,

135
00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:03.230
they're doing it with lions are doing it with everything cause L's.

136
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.580
I mean all the different animals that you think of plains animals in Africa,

137
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:11.510
there are record numbers there.
Neil Guy,
they bring him back to Texas.

138
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:12.620
They're all over Texas.
You know,

139
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.030
there's so many animals there and a lot of those animals were on the verge of

140
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:21.890
extinction.
But they're there because people kill them.
Like what up?
Fuck it.

141
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:26.000
He has weird drum.
It's weird.
Really the bigger issue is,
is um,

142
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.600
unbroken migratory range habitat that Masai Mara is one of the few places where

143
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:38.030
they can roam for thousands of miles.
But most of Africa now is broken up into,

144
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.100
I think there's that area in Cameroon or whatever,

145
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:42.050
but most of Africa is broken up into,
I mean,

146
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:46.220
in South Africa it's all basically with the exception of Kruger park,

147
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.850
it's all abandoned.
Um,
you know,

148
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.270
cattle lots and then they just,
there's money in it.

149
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:55.890
So you buy that lot and you just stock over the animals and then you drive

150
00:08:55.891 --> 00:09:00.750
around.
They,
it's a sustainable ecosystem,
but it's,
yeah,
you gotta yeah,

151
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.190
you gotta you still,
you do have to call the Ra,
the,
you know,

152
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.900
elephant population and lion population.
When we think about Africa,

153
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.190
right?
When we say,
oh,
elephants are going extinct in Africa,

154
00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:17.130
like Africa is so big,
it's crazy.
It's so big.

155
00:09:17.131 --> 00:09:19.810
You've seen the map where this stuff,
all the countries inside of Africa,

156
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.340
that was so shocking to me.
I know,
I couldn't believe that.

157
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:27.390
So there could be an abundance of them in one area.
And then in another area,

158
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.960
it's like saying like they have a black bear problem in New Jersey,

159
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.430
which they do.
Okay.
Do that.
Yeah,
they do,
but that doesn't affect us here.
Yeah.

160
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.310
In California.
Yeah.
Like if people just start shooting blackberries,
you're like,

161
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:41.140
hey man,
there's not that many of those.
Why are you shooting him?
Okay.
