00:00:00.344 --> 00:00:01.760
PROFESSOR: Let's
take a quick look

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.090
at the axioms of Zermelo-Frankel
Set Theory With Choice.

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:15.955
So the axioms of ZFC
define the standard theory

00:00:15.955 --> 00:00:20.140
of sets, which is now accepted
by most mathematicians

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.265
as a reliable and simple basis
for developing and justifying

00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:25.135
all of mathematics.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.730
Among the axioms, maybe a
simple want to understand

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.070
and really the motivation for
this short video is twofold.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.210
One is practice with
writing predicate formulas,

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.110
and the other is to
think a little bit more

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.920
about self application.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.110
So one of the basic
axioms of set theory

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.480
is called
extensionality, which is

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.070
capturing the idea that a set
is determined by its members.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.350
So let's consider the
assertion that two sets x and y

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.710
have the same elements,
which we could write

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.130
as a predicate formula
in set theory as for all

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.830
x, x is a member of y, if and
only if x is a member of z.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.470
Now we could use this is
a definition of equality.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.670
It's what we mean by
y and z are equal.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.480
But we don't really need
to even introduce equality

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.730
as a basic part of the
language and add axioms

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.760
about how it behaves.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.940
There's one axiom that
covers things adequately,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.620
and that is that if two sets
have the same members, then

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.540
they are members
of the same sets.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.740
So if all the members of x
and y are the same, then x

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.410
and y are members of exactly
the same thing, which

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.180
we could say this
way, for every x,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.940
y is an x, if and
only if z is an x.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.810
So that is one of the basic
axioms of Set Theory, maybe

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.710
the starting one.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.660
Another one is the
Power Set axiom,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.990
which simply says that
every set has a power set.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.790
How would you say that in
the language of predicate set

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.320
theory?

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.610
Well, you'd say
that for every x,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.790
there is a p, which is going to
be the power set effects, such

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.880
that for every set s, s is
a subset of x, if and only

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.460
if s is a member of p.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.290
Remember, we know how to
express s as a subset of s

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.050
in the language of
predicate calculus,

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.670
mentioning only membership.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.910
So this is a good axiom
that says, yes, there

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.330
is a set p consisting of
precisely the subsets of x.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.200
That set p called
the powers set of x.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.990
When you're trying to deal
with the Russell's paradox

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.230
kind of issue, where you
define a set of element

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.090
or a collection of
sets that satisfies

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.010
some property, the safe
conservative version of saying

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.870
that a set of elements that
satisfy some property really

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.030
is a set, a collection
of elements that satisfy

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.100
some property, really is a
set, the comprehension axiom's

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.450
a simple version of an axiom
that allows you to do that.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.370
So basically, it
says that if s is

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.844
a set and p of x is an arbitrary
predicate of set theory, which

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:09.760
might in fact be one of
these dangerous things

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.970
like x is not a member
of x, nevertheless,

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.690
if you look at those
elements in the set

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.630
S that satisfy P
of x, that's a set.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.390
In other words, the set of x and
s, such that P of x is a set,

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.030
it means that any
definable collection

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.760
of elements within a set
also form a proper subset.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.620
And the reason why
this matters is,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.540
remember, if I just talked
about not the set of x

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.950
in a particular set
s the satisfied P

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.790
of x, if I just talked about
the collection of x's that

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.630
satisfied P of x, that's when
I start getting into Russell's

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.110
paradox areas, when I
declare that the set of x

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.810
such that P of x is a set
for unrestricted P of x.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.600
But all I get to do is put
a bound on the elements

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.610
that x ranges over, that x is a
member of some particular set.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.280
Then it's safe to take all of
those x's that satisfy P of x.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.060
Now another particularly
interesting axiom

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.399
of ZF which addresses this issue
of self membership and self

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.880
reference is that the intuitive
idea that the elements of a set

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.470
have to come before
the set itself.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.727
They have to be simpler
than the set itself,

00:04:27.727 --> 00:04:29.310
if you think about
sort of building up

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.150
a set from successively
simpler elements to more

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.030
complicated ones.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.930
In particular, you can't have
a set be a member of itself

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.400
because then it's
not being built

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.630
from things that are
simpler than it is

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.492
or that came before it.

00:04:42.492 --> 00:04:44.200
In fact, you can't
even have a set that's

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.060
a member of a member of itself.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.530
All of that kind of indirect
membership is forbidden.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.460
Now, how do you say
that is a nice axiom?

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.870
Well, there's a very
elegant way to do it,

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.750
and that is to say
that all sets are well

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.320
founded under membership,
which means that you can't find

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.200
an infinite sequence of
sets where each one has

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.260
the next one as a member.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.430
Let's give a precise
way to formulate that.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.340
It's also good practice with
the formulas of set theory.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.880
Let me say that x is membership
minimal, epsilon minimal, in y

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.200
means that x is a member of
y, but there's no element of x

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.800
that's also in y.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.070
In other words, x is built out
of things that are not in y,

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.560
but x itself is in y.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.740
So x kind of comes before any
of the other elements in y.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.750
It's built out of non-y stuff.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.210
So to say this with a formula we
could just say that x is in y,

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.670
and for every z, if it's
in x, then it's not in y.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.240
So that's the definition of
x is membership minimal in y.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.540
And then the basic axiom of ZF,
called the Foundation Axiom,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.650
simply says that every
nonempty set has a membership

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.860
minimal element.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.852
This is actually a
kind of generalization

00:06:06.852 --> 00:06:08.310
of the well ordering
principle that

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.350
says that every nonempty
set of non-negative integers

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.030
has a least element.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.100
This is a direct analogy.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.680
Just as the in
principle for integers

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.070
implies that you can't
have an infinite decreasing

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.080
sequence of
non-negative integers,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.705
the Foundation Axiom
actually implies

00:06:28.705 --> 00:06:32.630
that you can't have an infinite
sequence of sets, each of which

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.710
is a member of the previous one.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.910
Here is a formula that's
asserting Foundation.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.670
For every x, if x is not empty,
that implies that there is a y,

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.180
such that y is
membership minimal in x.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.362
What is the Foundation
got to do with membership?

00:06:52.362 --> 00:06:53.820
Well, the Foundation
Axiom actually

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.080
will very quickly let us
conclude that no set is

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.330
a member of itself.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.460
How does that work?

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.850
Well, suppose that you are
interested in some set,

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.840
and you'd like to verify
that the set can't

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.060
be a member of itself.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.900
Well, let R be the set
consisting of just this set S

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.280
that you're interested in.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.580
R is the singleton S, its
only element in S. Well,

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.840
R is not empty.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.000
And by the Foundation Axiom,
it must have a membership

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.550
minimal element.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.190
Now suppose that
S isn't S. We're

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.930
going to reach a contradiction.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.060
The claim is that R has no
membership minimal element,

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.740
and that violates
the Foundation Axiom,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.580
so you can't have S is a member
of S. Why does this follow?

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.170
Well, look, R is supposed
to have a membership

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.040
minimal element.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.750
Well, R's only got one element.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.430
So if it's got any membership
element, it's got to be S.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.390
But S this can't be
membership minimal

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:53.830
because S is in R,
which means that S

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.690
has an element in R in it.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.370
So S is not R minimal.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.260
And the Foundation
Axiom then immediately

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:07.150
implies that you can't have
S be a member of S. S is not

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.450
membership minimal in
R. And this argument

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:13.740
extends in a nice way to
member of a member and member

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.970
of a member, and we'll throw
a feedback on one question

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.060
about that at you shortly.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.250
So looking at the Foundation
Axiom and the conclusion

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.950
that no set is a member of
itself, what we can immediately

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:32.270
conclude is that, first of
all, the collection of all sets

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:37.860
can't be a set because if
the collection of all sets

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.274
was a set, then it would
be a member of itself,

00:08:41.274 --> 00:08:44.510
and that's forbidden
by the S can't

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:48.960
be a member of S consequence
of the Foundation Axiom.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.232
The second thing it tells
us is remember the set W

00:08:51.232 --> 00:08:52.190
from Russell's paradox?

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.800
W was the collection
of those sets which

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.530
are not members of themselves.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:00.050
Well, now we've just figured
out that this is all sets

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.320
because no set is
a member of itself.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.430
So the sets that are not
members of themselves

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:10.760
is everything, and that's
why W is not a set and not

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.700
a member of itself,
which explains finally

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:19.190
how the Foundation Axiom
resolves the Russell paradox.
