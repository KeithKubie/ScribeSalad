00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.960
Hi, I’m John Green, this is CrashCourse
U.S. history and we’ve finally done it we

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.000
have reached the moment where we get to talk
about the presidency of George HW Bush.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The 2nd most important man named George Bush
ever to be President of the United States.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.850
A man so fascinating that we did not give
him a face.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.190
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, so we’re almost in
the present?

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.470
Well we’re never really gonna get to the
present Me From The Past because we’re always

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.470
in the past.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.869
But you are like 20 years in the past which
is soon going to create a time paradox that

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.140
I can not possibly deal with.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.530
So I’m just going to let Hank deal with
that over on the science shows.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.809
Intro
Anyway despite like calendars and everything,

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:53.620
the 1990s really began in 1988 with the election
of George Herbert Walker Bush, who had probably

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.949
the best resume of any presidential candidate
since Teddy Roosevelt.

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.730
I mean he was a war hero, having enlisted
in the Navy upon graduating from high school

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.920
and then going on to become the youngest pilot
in Navy history.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.140
He flew 58 missions in the Pacific during
WWII and received the Distinguished Flying

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.300
Cross for completing a mission in a burning
plane before ditching into the sea.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.310
So just consider that the next time you complete
a heroic mission in Call of Duty 4.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.869
After the war Bush went to college at Yale,
and then moved to Texas where he made millions

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:21.869
in the oil industry.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.270
Then, he became a Congressman, and then ambassador
to the UN, and then director of the CIA, and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.409
then Vice President.

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.460
The guy had more careers than Barbie!

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.869
Plus like every great American politician
George Bush grew up in hardscrabble poverty

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.499
working his way through the Depression…
just kidding he was the son of Connecticut

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:38.670
Senator Prescott Bush.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.359
But I guess after like 20 years of peanut
farmers and former actors, America was ready

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:48.039
to have an aristocrat at the helm again, as
long as he pretended to be from Texas.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.899
Like certain Crash Course teachers wearing
striped polo shirts George HW Bush was an

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.549
old school Episcopalion so he was never totally
comfortable with like public professions of

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.549
faith.

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.479
So when it came down to pick his vice presidential
candidate, Bush chose J Danforth Quayle aka

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.479
Dan.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.200
A young, family values, senator from right
here in Indiana.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.119
Now these days of course Dan Quayle is primarily
known for getting in an argument with a fictional

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.819
television character named Murphy Brown, and
also for not being able to spell the word

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.599
potato, but once upon a time he was a promising
young Republican.

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.500
Bush’s opponent in that 1988 was Massachusetts
Governor Michael Dukakis, who was perceived

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.280
as competent but kinda heartless and weak
and a little bit clueless.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.960
As this famous picture of him in a tank indicates
he was not a war hero.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.550
But at the beginning of the Democratic primary
the leading contender was actually the reverend,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.080
Jesse Jackson, who had a legitimate shot at
being the first African American Democratic

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.470
Presidential nominee.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.470
That would have to wait.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.269
Because instead the Democrats chose the northern,
liberal governor Dukakis and paired him with

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.340
Texas Senator Lloyd, I’m gonna make Dan
Quayle look good, Bentsen.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.230
Which I bring up primarily to point out that
Texas actually used to have Democrats.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.870
So negative campaign ads had existed before
1988 but the 1988 election took it to an entirely

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.049
new level and ushered in an era of going negative
in politics.

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.500
Like everybody says they hate negative ads,
but they also work like the Bush campaign’s

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.170
efforts to make Dukakis look weak on defense
and crime were brutally effective.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.480
The most infamous ad featured Willie Horton
who while on furlough from prison committed

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.920
rape and murder.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.300
And even though Dukakis’ Republican predecessor
had actually started the furlough program,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.030
the Horton crime occurred while Dukakis was
governor.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.030
The ad featured a terrifying photo of Horton
and prisoners walking through a revolving

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.030
door and it worked.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.410
Dukakis was regarded as a liberal who was
weak on crime.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.660
In fact, it was George HW Bush who was the
first to use the word liberal as an insult

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.590
in American politics, which represents the
larger shifts that were happening.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.150
So in retrospect, possibly the most important
thing about the 1988 campaign was George Bush’s

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.020
famous pledge at the Republican convention:
“Read my lips, No New Taxes!”

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.450
No way that’s gonna come back to bite him.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.380
So once he was President, it’s not surprising
that Bush focused more on foreign policy than

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.510
domestic concerns.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.780
I mean that was his background with the UN
and at the CIA.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.800
But it also makes sense in the larger historical
context because the Cold War actually ended

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.349
during Bush’s presidency.

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:03.849
Even though no one ever gives him credit for
it.

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.909
I mean the Berlin Wall came down, Poland’s
military rule ended, the Velvet Revolution

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.430
happened in Czechoslovakia during Bush’s
watch.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.220
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble
The end of the Cold War was really a failure

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.640
on the part of the USSR rather than the result
of successful American policies.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.240
But it left the U.S. in something of a policy
limbo.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.760
I mean after all, the idea of a super-powerful
malevolent Bowser Boss Soviet Union poised

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.280
to destroy the American Way of Life provided
a comfortable structure for all our foreign

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.640
relations for almost 50 years as well as providing
the reason for massive military build up and

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.200
all the jobs that came with it.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.030
One positive result of the end of the Cold
War was a reduction in nuclear weapons.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.600
Under Bush the U.S. and USSR negotiated and
implemented the START I and START II treaties,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.800
which limited the number of warheads each
country could possess to between 3,000 and

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.800
3,500.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.930
I mean that was still enough to end human
life on Earth several times over but it was

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.410
amazing progress.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.790
The collapse of the Soviet Union and end of
the Cold War led the president to declare

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.630
the dawn of a New World Order, but calling
it a New World Order didn’t make foreign

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.120
policy any easier.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.400
Without the Cold War to orient us foreign
policy issues were much more confusing and

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.400
messy.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.730
So for example, Bush kept the United States
out of Yugoslavia, which disintegrated in

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.110
1991, turning into a bloodbath.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.750
But he sent troops into Somalia to help deliver
food aid, resulting in the botched operation

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.530
described in the movie, and book, Black Hawk
Down.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.680
And then there was the foreign policy crisis
that Bush handled decisively: Saddam Hussein’s

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.460
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.260
Bush brought the issue to the UN and ushered
through a Security Council resolution that

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.520
set a deadline for Saddam to leave Kuwait.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.950
When he didn’t meet the January 15, 1991
deadline, the U.S. had already put together

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.880
a coalition of 34 nations ready to make him
leave.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.530
America first launched a spectacular air war
that destroyed much of the Iraqi defense capability.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.820
And then our technological prowess was on
display for the world on CNN, which featured

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.720
coverage of “smart bombs” blowing stuff
up.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.970
When ground troops led by General Norman z
finally moved in, they were able to defeat

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.800
the Iraqi army in just 100 hours.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.800
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.470
So the Iraq war, I guess we now have to say
first Iraq war, was a huge military success.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.510
America lost fewer than 300 soldiers.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.000
Iraq suffered somewhere between 1500 and 9500
killed in action.[1]

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.340
And the US’s military objectives had been
achieved clearly and quickly.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.390
And Bush claimed that the victory had forever
banished the so called “Vietnam Syndrome,”

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.940
the reluctance to use American military power
for fear of becoming bogged down in another

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:29.940
“quagmire.”

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.790
Now in hindsight, if the Americans had supported
Iraqi efforts to topple Saddam Hussein and

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.660
build a new Iraq, we might have achieved that
objective as well, but the mission under the

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.640
UN resolution was to get Iraqis out of Kuwait
and so that’s what we did.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.981
Bush didn’t want to take it any further.

00:06:44.981 --> 00:06:48.020
Oh it’s time for the Mystery Document?

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.560
The rules here are simple
I read the mystery document.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.840
I either guess the author correctly or I get
shocked.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.630
“Five of the seven agree with President
Bush that the war is just or at least necessary.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.870
But not one wants to fight in it.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.820
All are opposed to a draft, though a few said
one might be necessary as a last resort.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.580
They said they would gladly serve in non-military
public service jobs.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.350
“This might sound selfish, but I think it
would be a shame to put America’s best minds

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.380
on the front line,” said Jason Bell, 20,
a junior English major from Elizabethtown,

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.380
KY.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.000
“If we have to go, we have to go, but I
think it would be a shame.”

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.160
[2]
Yeah, Jason Bell, that does sound selfish.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.780
Alright Stan this is from like a newspaper
or magazine.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.580
I assume that you are using it to call attention
to the fact that this was really the first

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.640
big American military initiative without a
draft.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.960
And it also reminds us that the war was not
universally popular, I mean at least before

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.680
it was fought, after it was fought it pretty
much was.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.510
But I have no idea who actually wrote the
piece in the mystery document, how would I

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.510
know that?

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.510
Is it a famous journalist?

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.690
Is it like David Halberstam?

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:51.690
No?

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:52.690
David Maraniss?

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:53.690
Who the hell is that?

00:07:53.690 --> 00:08:00.060
Does he have a Wikipedia article?

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.740
Meredith does he have a Wikipedia article?

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.820
Alright apparently he does have a Wikipedia
article.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.340
He even won a Pulitzer Prize so congratulations
sir.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.340
Ahhh!

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.900
So the Gulf lifted the President Bush’s
approval rating to an unheard of 89%.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:17.930
And in April 1991 it looked like there was
no way that George HW Bush would lose his

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.420
re-election bid, but he didn’t consider
the domestic issues that were kind of important

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.420
to Americans.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.420
We are very happy to talk about all the wars
that we are fighting unless and until someone

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.520
raises our taxes!

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.140
So Bush wasn’t much interested in putting
together a domestic agenda – he once called

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.509
it “the vision thing” – and anyway he
would have had a hard time getting anything

00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:37.139
through the Democratically controlled Congress.

00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:41.740
So Congress continued to pass New Deal style
“liberal” legislation including expanded

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.589
funding for Head Start and welfare, as well
as a Family and Medical Leave bill (which

00:08:46.589 --> 00:08:49.410
Bush vetoed twice) but eventually passed nonetheless.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.529
With the Family Medical Leave Act of course
America joined every other country in the

00:08:53.529 --> 00:08:57.110
world in offering paid maternity and paternity
leave to new parents.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.110
What’s that?

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.110
We didn’t?

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.110
We still don’t?

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.110
We still don’t have that?

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.110
We still don’t have paid leave?

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.670
Oh god..

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:08.540
However you are no longer allowed to be fired
for 12 whole weeks while you take unpaid leave

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.689
to care for your child.

00:09:09.689 --> 00:09:13.160
That’s why Stan couldn’t replace me with
text-to-voice software after my daughter,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.160
Alice, was born.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.759
But in news that actually was sort of cutting
edge Congress also enacted the Americans With

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:20.160
Disabilities Act in 1991.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.200
Before I talk about the recession that ended
George Bush’s presidency I want to talk

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.430
about Rodney King.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.899
Because this revealed huge fissures in the
American population and called into question

00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:29.769
the achievements of the rights revolution.

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:35.870
In April 1992 an all white jury in Simi Valley
found three of four policemen not guilty of

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:41.220
beating black motorist Rodney King, even though
the incident had been recorded on videotape.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.040
After the verdict, Los Angeles erupted into
the deadliest riots seen in America since

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.750
the New York City Draft Riots.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:52.330
52 people were killed and 2,300 injured in
rioting that caused $1billion in property

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.330
damage.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.160
So obviously race remained a volatile issue
in the U.S.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.470
It was also an issue that Bush seemed unprepared
to deal with like he toured burned out LA

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:05.360
neighborhoods but had little in the way of
real comfort to offer, contributing to the

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.600
perception that he was this millionaire, Ivy
League-educated, Washington insider who was

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.490
out of touch with regular Americas.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.560
But the biggest issue to most Americans was
money.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.220
America fell into recession in 1990 and the
slump lasted until 1992.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.889
It might have been caused by the end of the
Cold War and the subsequent reductions in

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:28.329
defense spending, or by Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan’s sluggish refusal to lower interest

00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:32.139
rates, or maybe the economy just needed to
reset at a lower number after growing every

00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:36.810
year since 1982, or maybe macroeconomics is
more complicated than who is President and

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:41.079
sometimes people unjustly get blamed or credited
for things that they had very little to do

00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:42.079
with.

00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:47.270
Regardless, 4.5 million Americans lost their
jobs and the unemployment rate rose from 5.3%

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:52.860
in 1989 to 7.5% in 1992, its highest level
in almost a decade.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.209
Along with the many thousands of manufacturing
workers who lost their jobs in America’s

00:10:57.209 --> 00:11:01.399
continuing de-industrialization, white-collar
workers were thrown out of work, too, and

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:05.519
college graduates, of whom there were record
numbers, couldn’t find work as they came

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:06.839
out of school.

00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:08.550
Stop me if any of that sounds familiar.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.140
One person who struggled to find a job after
graduating during the Bush Recession was none

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:17.800
other than CrashCourse writer Raoul Meyer,
who after sending 100 resumes out got 3 job

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.740
interviews and ended up working at a small
independent school in Alabama, where he became

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.089
the teacher of … Me From the Past.

00:11:24.089 --> 00:11:28.379
Now the recession was certainly bad for Bush
politically, but what probably destroyed Bush’s

00:11:28.379 --> 00:11:31.019
re-election hopes was the whole taxes thing.

00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:36.490
In 1991, with tax receipts dropping and spending
not slowing very much, President Bush did

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.569
something that now seems unthinkable: he authorized
a tax increase.

00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:44.850
And in doing this he called his conservative
credentials into question.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.279
Especially in the eyes of small-government-wanting-libertarian-leaning
republicans.

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:53.779
They had never really trusted the faux Texan
Bush anyway, but he had said, “Read my lips..”

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:56.860
and they believed him but it turned out he
had no lips!

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.949
Now when coupled with Bush’s lukewarm support
of the evangelical wing of the republican

00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:05.339
party and his running mate’s inability to
spell the word potato it all prompted a primary

00:12:05.339 --> 00:12:08.160
challenge from conservative commentator Pat
Buchanan.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.420
Which he beat back easily, however some of
the GOP voter base, especially the evangelical

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.279
Christians, stayed home on Election Day.

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:18.699
Then there was also a third party candidate,
Texas Billionaire and muppet impersonator

00:12:18.699 --> 00:12:24.269
H. Ross Perot, who won 19% of the vote (the
best third-party performance since Teddy Roosevelt

00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:26.660
in 1912)
All of this came together to open the door

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:31.019
for a pudgy lad from Hope, Arkansas, who had
never inhaled marijuana, and didn’t cheat

00:12:31.019 --> 00:12:34.360
on his wife except for sometimes, named William
Jefferson Clinton.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.870
Looking back from today the fascinating thing
about the George HW Bush administration is

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.550
that it seems like a weird interruption in
a larger narrative.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.519
For a couple decades we had seen increasing
conservatism and rising partisanship and then

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:49.370
suddenly George HW Bush comes along and everybody
kind of works together.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:52.880
They didn’t always make good decisions when
working together, but they did make decisions!

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.459
But what’s really fascinating to me is that
if you’re from Eastern Europe or China this

00:12:56.459 --> 00:12:59.189
period was one of the most important in history.

00:12:59.189 --> 00:13:02.879
Whereas if you’re American arguably the
most important thing the leader of this era

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:05.630
ever did was raise George W Bush.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.879
For better and for worse America didn’t
really change that much as a result of the

00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:10.879
end of the Cold War.

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:13.930
But we’re creeping up now on the growth
of the Internet which would change the way

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:19.499
that Americans and everyone else imagines
history and everything else forever.

00:13:19.499 --> 00:13:20.499
Thanks for watching.

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:21.499
I’ll see you next week.

00:13:21.499 --> 00:13:24.470
