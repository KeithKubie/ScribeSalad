00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.719
For guarded transitions, earlier we looked at situations where the response to

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.760
an event is conditioned on a sub-machine being in a state. For example,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.190
with event 20 we had the response that looked like the following.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.600
If in mode music, go to speaker go in the speaker sub-machine to mode playing.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.650
This response can be coded as a transition between the silent state. And

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.110
the playing state for the speaker that occurs when event 20 happens.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.850
And there is a guard that looks like the phrase in, in music.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.380
And that particular logical expression is in square, square brackets.
