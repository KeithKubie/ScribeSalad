00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
These equations are definitions of velocity and acceleration,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but we can also use them to make some calculations.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For example, let’s suppose I drop a ball 5 meters and it takes 1 second for this ball to fall.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
For example, let's say I drop a ball 5 meters and I measured

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that it takes 1 second for the ball to hit the ground.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What was the ball’s average velocity?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And we will talk more about more why I’m using the word “average” later.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Δx is change in position, how much is ball’s position changing?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Well, it's changing by 5 meters.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
V equals change in position--5 meters--over change in time--well, it took 1 second.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, 5/1 is just 5 meters per second. Not bad. Now, how about you do one.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let’s say that Galileo drops a ball at the Leaning Tower of Pisa

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and he finds that after 2 seconds, it’s speed is 20 meters per second.

00:00:47.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I want you to tell me what was the ball’s acceleration.
