00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.170
You know, it's funny.
If you look at everything that Google does

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.178
for the iPhone and the iPad,
we really do a lot.

00:00:06.243 --> 00:00:09.607
But for some reason, people don't think of
us as an iOS company,

00:00:09.607 --> 00:00:11.280
and I don't know why that is.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.720
Oh... Yeah, right.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.370
But the fact of the matter is we have
a whole bunch of crazy smart engineers

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.660
that are building dozens of apps
for iOS devices.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.085
And we have SDKs available for everything,
from maps, to analytics, to games,

00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:26.270
that you could use to power your own app.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.690
OK guys, seriously, is there
nowhere else we could film?

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.005
Like, anywhere?

00:00:31.015 --> 00:00:33.370
But you know,
maybe some of that's on us.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.510
Maybe we need to do a better job
of reaching out to this community.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.920
And so that's why we're creating
this series of videos,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.667
just for you iOS developers.

00:00:40.777 --> 00:00:43.965
We'll be telling folks about new libraries
we're releasing for iOS,

00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:46.350
and sharing some tips
from our very own engineers.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.220
So come join us right here on Route 85,
our brand new show for iOS developers.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.780
Because when you think iOS,
think Goo... oh, come on! Really?

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.440
Can... You know what?
Forget it! Forget it! I quit!

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.894
You guys, you film your own promo!
I'm done here!

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.225
This is ridiculous!
This is so (bleep) ridiculous!

00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:05.710
I can't find one (bleep) place
in this whole campus

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.970
where I can film one stupid commercial!

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.030
<i>Route 85, the way to go for iOS developers.</i>

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.420
<i>Coming soon to the Google Developers
YouTube channel.</i>
