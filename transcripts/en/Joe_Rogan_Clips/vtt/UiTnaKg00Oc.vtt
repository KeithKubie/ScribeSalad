1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.050
Well,
it also gets to some really deep places psychologically.
Um,
there's,

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.450
there's some,
there's a weirdness to it,
right?

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.680
There's a weirdness to sending text,
particularly at anonymously,

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.690
you know,
and there's so many accounts that are just an egg,

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.170
you know,
so many accounts where they're clearly designed.
If you get,

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.620
like sometimes someone will tweet something mean to me and I'm like,
hm,

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.790
I wonder what this person's up to.

8
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.080
So I go to their site and it's just them tweeting mean shit at people all day

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.720
long.
Like it's probably some angry person at work and they're like,

10
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:32.930
I'm just going to find people and fuck with them all day.
Yup.

11
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.840
When did you realize,
or when did you realize,

12
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:40.410
I'm sure you're aware of it and when did you realize that this was almost out of

13
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:42.930
your control in terms of like the scale of it?

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.220
<v 1>Uh,
there were,
there,
there wasn't,
there wasn't one moment.</v>

15
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.020
There wasn't one moment that,
um,

16
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.690
it just felt completely resonant.
Uh,
it's just,
it's,

17
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.750
it's unfolded into the next thing and the next use case and it just keeps

18
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:05.130
surprising us with how people are using it.
Wheat,
you know,

19
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.270
it definitely.
Um,

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.840
recently I think we've identified some of the areas of the service that we need

21
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:15.190
to pay a lot more attention to.
Um,

22
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.220
Twitter is unique in that it has two main spaces.

23
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:23.640
One which is your timeline and those are the people that you follow.

24
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.870
And uh,
you know,
when you follow someone,

25
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.900
they've earned that audience and then it has this other world where anyone can

26
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.610
insert themselves into the conversation,

27
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.530
they can actually mention you and you'll see that without asking for it.

28
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.800
You can insert yourself into hashtags and to a search.

29
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.400
Um,

30
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.400
and these are areas that people have taken advantage of and these are the areas

31
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:57.621
that people have gained our systems to in some cases artificially amplified,

32
00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:03.531
but also just to spread a lot of things that weren't possible with the velocity

33
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.310
that they're not possible before.

34
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.920
<v 0>Now,
when this is all happening,</v>

35
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.180
what's the conversation like at Twitter when you recognizing that this is

36
00:02:13.181 --> 00:02:17.110
happening,
that people are kind of gaming the system?
Like what,
how do you guys,

37
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.840
how do you mitigate it?
What,
what's the discussion?

38
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.530
<v 1>Well,
early on it was,
um,
it was pretty surface level.</v>

39
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.430
Like how do we change some of the APP dynamics?

40
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.610
But more recently we're trying to go a lot deeper in and asking ourselves a

41
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:36.470
question when people open Twitter,
what are we incentivizing?

42
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.500
What are we telling them to do when they open up this app?

43
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.810
We may not explicitly be doing that,

44
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:46.190
but there's something that we're saying without,
um,

45
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.680
being as clear about it.

46
00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:52.550
So what does the like button incentivize?

47
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.470
What does the retweet incentivize?

48
00:02:54.471 --> 00:02:59.060
What does the number of followers and making that number big,

49
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.900
bold,
incentivize?
So

50
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.440
I'm not sure what we should know.
I'm not sure if we should incentivize anything,

51
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:12.880
but we need to understand what that is.
And I think,
you know,
right now we,

52
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.480
we do incentivize a lot of echo chambers because we don't make it easy for

53
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:22.330
people to follow interests and topics.

54
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.780
It's only accounts we incentivize,
um,

55
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.070
a lot of outrage and how hot takes,
um,
because of the,

56
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.740
some of the dynamics in the service.

57
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:37.300
Not allowing a lot of nuance in conversation earlier on.
Um,

58
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.370
um,
pseudonyms,
uh,
this,
uh,
this,
uh,

59
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.400
ability to not use your real name incentivizes some positive things like allows

60
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:51.130
for whistleblowers and journalists to,
uh,

61
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.780
might fear for their career or even worse their life and under certain regimes,

62
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.960
but also allows for people like the example you mentioned of just random fire

63
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:06.400
and,
uh,
you know,
spread of abuse and harassment throughout.

64
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.790
So those are the things that we're looking at and how do we,

65
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.030
how do we enable more of the conversation to evolve?

66
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.740
How do we increase the credibility,
reputation of accounts?

67
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.940
Um,

68
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.920
how do we identify a credible voices within a particular domain?

69
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.340
I'm not just through this very coarse grain,

70
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.350
blue verified badge.
But,
uh,

71
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.160
if you're an expert in a particular topic,

72
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:36.310
how do we recognize that in real time and show that so that we can provide more

73
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:40.150
context to who you're talking to and if you want to engage in a deeper

74
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:43.870
conversation or just ignore mute or block them.
