00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.740
So as we discussed, control data plane

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.710
separation can make it easier to manage the

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.410
data center by monitoring and controlling routes from

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.730
a central point and allowing virtual machines to

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.620
be migrated without renumbering host addresses. The

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.350
control data plane separation does not inherently make

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.410
it possible to build a data center with

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.560
few switches nor does it automatically balance load.
