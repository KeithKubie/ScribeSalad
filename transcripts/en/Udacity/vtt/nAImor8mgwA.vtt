00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.380
So recall that in order to resolve the conflict, the partial order planner has

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.740
decided to promote this goal over that one. As it tries to

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.630
connect these two plans, it finds that there is an open condition problem that

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.110
we just talked about On Robot Ladder, does not match On Robot Floor. So

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.830
now it needs to select an operator whose first condition will match this state.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.820
Robot On Floor. And those three conditions will match this state,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.700
Robot On Ladder. And there is just one operator that matches those conditions.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.650
And that operator is descend ladder. So now the partial order planner uses this

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.860
information to select the operator, the simulator, and now we have a complete

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.226
plan. So now you know about the algorithm for partial order planning, and

00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:48.860
how it works in practice. But what does this tell us about intelligence?

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.220
Let's consider several postulates. First, knowledge is not just about the world.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.350
Knowledge is also controlled knowledge. It is often tacit, but this controlled

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.380
knowledge helps us select between operators. Second, that goals provide

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.110
control knowledge. Goals can be used to decide between different operators, and

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.350
we select an operator that helps us move closer to the goal. Third,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.450
we can view partial order planning as an interaction between several different

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.850
kinds of agents or abilities. Each agent here represents a small micro ability.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.850
There is this agent which was responsible for generating plans for

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.880
each of the goals independently, then there was an agent responsible for

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.440
detecting conflicts between them. Then there was a third agent responsible for

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.940
resolving this conflict. So we can think of partial order

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.190
planning as emerging out of interaction between three different agents,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.340
each one of which is capable of only a small ability. So we can think of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.720
partial order planning as emerging out of interaction between free agents,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.040
where each agent is capable of only one small task.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.590
Minsky has proposed a notion of a society of mind. A society of agents inside

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.820
an intelligent agent's mind that work together to produce complex behavior,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.690
where each agent, itself is very simple. As in this case, a simple agent for

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.490
detecting conflict, or a simple agent for resolving conflicts, and

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.930
of course an agent for making simple plans with simple goals. It is one other

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.950
lesson to take away from here. When you and I solve problems like the ladder and

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.740
the ceiling problem, we seem to address these problems almost effortlessly and

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.290
almost instantaneously. So it looks really simple. What AI does,

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.600
however, is to make the process explicit.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.530
To write a computer program that can solve the same problem is very hard. It is

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.120
hard because the computer program must specify each operator, each precondition,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.820
each state, each goal, every step very, very clearly and very, very precisely.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.740
By writing this computer program is this AI agents that consults problem.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.470
We make the process that humans might be using more explicit. We generate

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.340
hypotheses about how humans might be doing it, which is a very powerful idea.
