00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.400
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Hey everyone I'm Kat.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.750
I'm from the Authors at Google team.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.670
Today we're welcoming Randy Clemens.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.700
He is the co-author of "The Craft of Stone
Brewery."

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.210
And he is also the author of “The Sriracha
Cookbook" and he's here today to talk to us

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.569
about this wonderful "Rooster Sauce."

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:21.569
Welcome Randy.

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:22.569
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Thank you.

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:29.059
[applause]
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Thank you guys for coming

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:31.710
out today and having some Sriracha.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.059
So as Kat said, I'm Randy Clemens.

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.500
I'm co-author of "The Craft of Stone Brewing
Company: Liquid Lore, Epic Recipes, and Unabashed

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.500
Arrogance."

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.600
So, That was a book I wrote last year and
one of the Googlers here, Simone, is an old

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.539
friend of mine from high school and hit me
up on Google+ and said "Hey you should come

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.550
down and do a talk for us."

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.519
And so, I came for that and parlayed that
into a talk about my other book "The Sriracha

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:55.519
Cookbook."

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:56.519
So, here I am.

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.539
So, we'll do a little bit of a talk of the
hot sauce we all know and love.

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.939
If any of you are familiar with the comic
"The Oatmeal," the guy Matthew Inman who does

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.000
it is a little crazy about Sriracha.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.780
And he's got all these really, really weird
comics about it.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.780
But anyway.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.420
So, I'm gonna talk a little bit about the
sauce.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.160
It's not just a sauce though.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.410
I mentioned that a little earlier.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.410
It's not--.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.410
It's not a brand.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.410
Sriracha's not a brand.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.410
It's actually made by a couple different companies.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.750
It's a style of hot sauce.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.810
And there's a sea-side town in Thailand called
Si Racha.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.040
It's located inside of a province called Chonburi,
which is in the The Bay of Bangkok.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.520
So, it’s about 60 miles southeast of Bangkok.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.439
And essentially it's a sea-side town.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.680
They're really well known for their seafood.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.979
And just over time they developed this hot
sauce and people were--.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.859
A lot of visitors to the town were really,
really drawn to this hot sauce and it became

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:59.859
a kind of thing.

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.320
People knew this town for their style of hot
sauce.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.619
And it became popular throughout Thailand,
throughout Vietnam and a lot of the other

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.240
South East Asian diaspora that's there.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.140
But other than that, there's not a lot that
the town's known for except their Tiger Zoo.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.140
[laughter]

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.340
So, I actually got to go while I was working
on the book.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.620
Went to the Tiger Zoo.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.320
I don't know who was more excited about being
there me, or the tiger.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.900
But I got this tour guide, this weird but
awesome tour guide, that took me to Si Racha

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.900
and when I told him I wanted to go to Si Racha,
his immediate question was "Why?"

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.900
And I told him--.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.400
I asked him if he was familiar with the hot
sauce and he said, "Yeah, of course."

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.340
I think it's like going to Seattle and asking
to go to a Starbucks.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.600
I wanted the hot sauce and he just didn't
understand why.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.550
That I had flown from America to find this
hot sauce.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.550
[laughter]

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.790
So, he gave me some weird looks and I just
said, "Oh and the Tiger Zoo" and he said,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.790
“Oh.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.400
OK, OK" So, that kind of made a little bit
more sense for him.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.180
But actually we had a long drive from Bangkok
and so I explained a little bit more what

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.180
I was working on.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.730
He still thought that I was weird but I thought
he was weird too.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.000
But we had a good time.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
[laughter]

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.350
So, right on the seaside there's this great
pier that goes out and they've got all these

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.600
amazing food stands.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.170
And naturally there's a lot of food that goes
really well with the Sriracha.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.300
So, the Shark brand Sriracha that I brought
today, like I said it's a little bit thinner

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.950
and it's a little sweeter.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.200
Got a really great garlic flavor.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.530
Got some great spice to it.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.500
But the consistency, it's much more of a dipping
sauce versus the Huy Fong foods brand.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.580
The American brand you squirt on top of everything.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.100
And with my book, hopefully in everything.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.370
So, while I was there, very similar to the
mango salad we had at lunch today, this is

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.590
green papaya salad that was there and it just
was beautiful with Sriracha.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.990
And this is a calamari dish that I had there.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.840
So again, they use it more as a dipping sauce.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.800
But the food was amazing and I totally had
this moment of Zen where I was having Sriracha

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.510
in Si Racha and I kind of freaked out a little
it.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.680
And this, this was the-- this egg dish that
I had.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.710
Just a crazy little omelet they threw together
so fast and it also went really fast.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.710
[laughter]

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.090
So, the way they make their Sriracha in Thailand
is with a couple of different kinds of peppers.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.060
These are called prik chee fah.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.550
And these are more medium style chili’s.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.590
These aren't the super-hot ones.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.490
That's these little bastards, these little
tiny peppers called prik khee nu.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.770
And those are the ones that add the heat.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.889
So, they do a blend of those.

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.260
And actually, you'll find a couple different--
I think even one of them that's here today

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.260
is labeled hot.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.710
I mean they'll have multiple different varieties.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.710
You can get mild.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.710
You can get medium.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.710
You can get hot.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.500
So, they really-- they play with their sauce
a little bit more there than we do here.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.110
The really cool thing was I actually got to
actually--.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.110
We--.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.250
My tour guide again was awesome.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.099
We found this factory and that's what I wanted
to do.

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:00.009
So, we were there and I had a bottle of the
Shark brand and had the address on it.

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.479
We went on a wild goose chase to try and find
this place.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.050
And we went all over the town and we're asking
these people--.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.539
The address is actually their office, so it's
not the factory.

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.349
And they were kind of skeevey about telling
us where it was.

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:13.949
But we still ventured out anyway.

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.069
And we kept stopping everywhere and it took
us a couple hours but we found this factory

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:20.600
in the middle of nowhere.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.099
And sure enough it was guarded.

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:26.729
There was this huge fortress of security stuff
around and the security guard there, he hopped

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.460
out for a minute and he's talking to the security
guard and he comes back in and he says, "OK.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.599
You're an American importer looking to buy
the sauce.

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:35.599
We're going in."

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:36.599
I was like, "Cool."

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:37.980
He made up this story on the fly.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.980
[laughter]

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.980
And it was awesome.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.419
We got to go in and check everything out.

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.419
So--.

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.499
And the guy was very over-zealous and having
me try everything and showing me all around,

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:46.499
which is really cool.

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:47.499
[laughter]

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:52.069
So, the essence of the sauce, these blue tubs
you see here, that's the sauce fermenting

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:53.069
away.

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:54.069
They--.

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:58.590
So, it's chili peppers, garlic, salt, sugar,
and vinegar.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.569
The chili peppers and the garlic are fermented
and it stinks so good.

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:06.169
Really, when it's in the midst of it all--.

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.330
And it was really cool 'cause he picked some
of it out and I got to try it while it was

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.330
fermenting.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.759
It's really, really great.

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:12.890
But again, my tour guide was my hero.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.710
I wish I remembered his name 'cause I owe
him a hug.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.690
So, these are some of the Thai style hot sauces
like I mentioned.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:29.099
You can see so on the middle one there I believe
it's Cock brand, that one says strong up on

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:30.400
the neck.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.289
So, they have varying levels of heat.

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.550
But the one we know and love here.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.819
So, essentially what happened is, there's
a company Huy Fong Foods.

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:45.039
It was started a while back here in California.

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:46.509
It isn't actually heaven sent--

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:47.509
[laughter]

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:48.879
As some people would believe.

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:53.080
And sorry for the little watermark down there
with my website.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.279
I sent one picture out one time without and
it went crazy on Twitter.

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:58.110
And I was like damn it, no one knows I made
that.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.110
[laughter]

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.110
And no one knows it ties it back to the book.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.479
So I have these silly watermarks and I don't
have pictures without them.

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:04.479
So.

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:06.380
So, Huy Fong Foods.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:13.770
This is a factory actually in Rosemead, and
the entire street smells amazing.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.349
You would know you were there.

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:17.180
If you're a block away you could smell it.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:23.259
So, essentially it was started back in 1980
by this gentleman in front, David Tran.

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:30.990
And he's of Chinese descent and was born in
Vietnam and was growing chili peppers in Vietnam

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.389
and not making a whole lot of money selling
them.

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:36.900
And so, he ended up starting to make chili
sauce with them.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.250
And started making a little more money there.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:46.319
Unfortunately, because of the Vietnamese War
and the aftermath, they weren't super nice

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:50.069
to foreigners even though he was born in Vietnam
because his family was of Chinese descent

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:51.629
and had immigrated.

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:54.139
He was forced to flee, as so many people were.

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:59.030
And actually he escaped on a boat, a Taiwanese
freighter called Huy Fong.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.080
And that's how he got the name of his company.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.310
So, this is in the late 1970s and eventually
got to America.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.520
He landed in Boston first and then came out
to Los Angeles when he found out there were

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.469
jalousies growing in California and started
using red jalapeños So that's one of the

00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:12.900
major flavor differences also.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.389
It's a much different chili pepper and you're
gonna get a much different flavor as a result.

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:20.110
So, he started making it in around 1983.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.330
He opened his company in 1980 and started
making Sriracha in 1983.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:28.529
He started a company with 50,000 dollars that
he -- of his family-- It was all of his family

00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:29.529
savings.

00:08:29.529 --> 00:08:32.150
He was actually denied a bank loan from a
couple different places and finally just went

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.710
all in with his family savings.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:39.620
Bought a Chevy van, a big Hobart mixer, a
little shop, storefront in Chinatown.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:45.090
But moved to Rosemead in 1987 and kept expanding.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:49.340
In 1986 he ended up taking over the spot next
to him that used to be an old Wham-O factory.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.340
And now they're in Irwindale.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.340
They're relocating.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.220
They got a huge 40 million dollar build-to-suit
factory.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.690
And the city of Irwindale was -- gave them
some huge breaks to move there.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:00.810
So, they're doing really, really well.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.450
It took them a while, but they're doing really
well.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:08.210
So, my obsession didn't kick in 'til probably
about 1999.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.840
Thanks to that lovely woman in the middle
there.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.501
On the right is my friend Phi Nguyen and his
brother Phook and his mom in the middle, who

00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:18.520
cooks the most amazing food on earth.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.850
I grew up very white and I never had any Southeast
Asian food before.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.290
And I started hanging out at Phi's house a
lot more after the first time I went over

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:27.890
and she made dinner.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.520
She makes really crazy stuff and sometimes
I would ask what I was eating, and he would

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.520
just shake his head "No."

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.440
Like, "You don't want to know."

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.230
[laughter] So, pig uterus, delicious.

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:43.630
So, she made fried rice one morning and just
put this bottle of Sriracha out on the table.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.880
And didn't say-- you know it wasn't like they
were “Here, try this."

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.380
It was just, it was out and I decided to try
it.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.060
And ever since then I started going down this
wicked spiral.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.761
Started playing around more and more with
the hot sauces.

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:59.100
And started putting it on just about everything.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.100
[laughter]

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.260
And this quickly became my mantra.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.960
You know I was just putting it on everything.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.530
And then, there was a day when I wanted to
cook with it.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.890
I-- Actually I was--.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:17.310
It was a happy accident, I was out of Frank's
Red Hot and I was going to make buffalo wings.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.560
And just thought, "Hey."

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.530
It wasn't rocket science, but I used Sriracha
instead.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.650
And I think I might have used some green onions
or something and make it more Asian.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:26.650
I don't know.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:27.650
I don't remember that much.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.940
But I remember this was probably the first
thing that I had made with Sriracha as an

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.940
ingredient.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.190
So, this is a picture from the book.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.770
It's not from that fateful day.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.630
But I did, I started using it as an ingredient
and I kinda had this idea festering in my

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.600
brain about making a cookbook about Sriracha.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.100
And I thought it would be really cool.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.970
So, fast forward a couple of years and I still
got this idea.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.300
I'm really now starting to realize if I don't
make this someone else is going to.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.300
And I kinda have to.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:58.330
So, I started thinking up recipe ideas and
started putting together a book proposal.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.250
And started coming up with these different
recipes.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.510
This is the Ultimate Sriracha burger.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.860
These are all in the book.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.500
It's photography by Leo Gong.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.010
He's a really, really talented food photographer
up in San Francisco.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:15.070
So, this is not for the health conscious.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.930
It's got Sriracha mixed into the patty.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:21.640
It's got bacon, grilled onions-- sautéed
onions, and onions are sautéed in the bacon

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.640
fat.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.980
Which makes them really tasty.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:29.310
Some arugula, beef steak tomatoes, Swiss cheese,
and then there's a blue cheese Sriracha dressing

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.700
on it as well.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.700
It's really good.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.220
And if you have fries or sweet potato fries
with it, I would make extra of the blue cheese

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.220
dressing.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.220
It's really, really good.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.670
This one's hot, just to warn you.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.360
Most of the recipes in there are pretty hot.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.830
This one's really hot.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.660
So, couple others that came to mind.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.080
I really wanted to showcase it as an ingredient,
not just as a condiment.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.240
Not that I mind putting Sriracha on everything.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.670
But again, and I've gotten that comment before,
"I could write a Sriracha cookbook."

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.620
You know make food, add Sriracha, and it could
very well be that simple.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.620
[laughter]

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.620
But I really--.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.750
I tried to really combat that and be more
creative with it.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.150
So, I've got a fire roasted corn chowder.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.750
Which, this is my favorite recipe out of the
book.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:12.200
It's, if I say so myself, it’s really damn
good.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.260
And a cheddar Sriracha swirl bread.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.360
This is a really, really cool one to make.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.070
It makes awesome toast and awesome grilled
cheeses.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:25.740
So, again, I really wanted to think outside
the box and just flex my Sriracha muscle.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.760
And just show that there was really, really
cool stuff you could do with it.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.760
So--.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:36.000
And it's funny because I found out as you
guys are here, I'm not the only one who's

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
obsessed with this stuff.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.890
There's this crazy cult following behind it.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.810
And I think a lot of that comes from--.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.750
You can find the bottles a lot more now.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:49.660
But before you'd see bottles of the Huy Fong
Foods brand, you'd see them in Pho restaurants,

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.660
or other Asian restaurants.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:57.490
But the cool thing about it, the bottle itself,
you've got all these different languages on

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.490
it.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.490
It makes it really seem exotic.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:00.490
People--.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.490
A lot of people are still surprised to find
out it's just made here in California.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.800
It's got all these different languages.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:09.680
The red bottle with the green cap really strikes
me as a jalapeños still being on the branch.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.120
And just the idea that--.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.860
I think what worked so well for them early
on is that the phone number is on the bottle.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.540
And if you called, they'd mail you a bottle.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.910
So, people would come out to L.A. a lot, they'd
steal bottles, bring them back home.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.030
Throw them in their purse, whatever.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.130
Give them to people, when they'd run out,
they'd have the phone number and call them.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:26.130
They'd ship you a bottle.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.130
No problem.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:32.300
So, I think a lot of that was really what
helped foster its cult following.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.430
This really hardcore following.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:34.430
But it's funny--.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:38.350
Again you'll see people really obsessed with
Sriracha.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:43.690
So, the stuff I've seen on Facebook and Twitter
is hilarious since writing the book.

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.440
But there's been Halloween costumes.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.500
New application methods.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.540
[laughter]

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:54.360
This guy sent this to me on Facebook.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.780
Just was amazed that it actually works apparently.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:57.780
I still haven't done it.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.770
But I think it's a really cool way to get
even application of Sriracha.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.440
And then there's some really die hard--.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.680
[ background chatter]

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.410
Some really die hard people out there.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.130
More die hard than I am somehow.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.130
[laughter]

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:14.530
So, even some Sriracha ink.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:19.660
So, Huy Fong Foods they really have--.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.810
This sauce has taken off.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:21.810
You can find it all over.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.080
You'll see it at TV shows.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.120
You'll see it--.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.030
Top Chef I think was a huge thing for them
'cause they used it so much.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:33.470
And I think Season Four or something, Casey
made this Sriracha ice cream and it was apparently

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.460
a miserable failure.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.330
But even still, I've got a recipe for a peach
Sriracha sorbet.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.820
I did an event last night and Scoops Westside--.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.550
Plus I made this cinnamon Sriracha sorbet
with pear and lime that was really good.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:46.920
So, it can be done.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:52.420
But ice cream might be a more interesting
challenge.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.560
So they're doing really well.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.890
And they're making more in that humongous
factory that they've got going now.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:02.240
I believe they're making around 20 million
bottles a year.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.070
And this new factory can quintuple that apparently.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.580
So, it's pretty exciting.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.250
But it's going all over the place.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.280
You can find it in Wal-Mart now.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.190
You don't have to steal it from a Pho shop.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.510
And it's been just about everywhere including
the International Space Station.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.350
You can see it right back there in the corner.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.960
Well, sort of in the corner by that dude's
head.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.100
That weird whatever it is hanging down.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.100
You guys see it?

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.740
It's there.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.600
It's been everywhere.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:33.040
So, it's one of my favorite things and it's
been really, really cool to be able to showcase

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.040
it.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.740
Again, not just as a condiment but as an ingredient.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.910
And to get to--.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.040
To find out more about the story.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.310
I was fascinated to find out there was this
whole back story behind it.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.360
That it wasn't just a crazy condiment.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.890
And the whole--.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.970
Oh, and another little fun tid-bit, the rooster
on the front of the bottle.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.690
So, David Tran the guy that started Huy Fong
Foods, that's his zodiac sign.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.750
So that's why everyone knows it as the rooster
sauce.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.750
[laughter]

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:57.750
So, there you go.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.860
That's my book.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.970
And that's a little history about Sriracha.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.730
You guys have any questions?

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.010
&gt;&gt;Female#1: Do you have any tattoos of the
sauce?

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:07.170
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: I don't.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.170
I've got food tattoos.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.620
But none of the sauce.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.690
I've got garlic and--.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:11.690
I've got two of the ingredients.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.990
I've got garlic and the salt hangin' out.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.500
[audience chatter]

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.310
But I'm gonna get parmesan reggiano and--.

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.840
Oh I got three of the ingredients.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.330
I've got chili peppers.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.330
[laughter]

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.330
[chatter]

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.320
So, my nice farmer tan.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.320
[laughter]

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.480
Beets, silverware, parmesan reggiano . But
no Sriracha sauce yet.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.480
[laughter]

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.480
Questions?

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.070
&gt;&gt; Female#2: Thanks for coming here again.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.070
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Sure.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.790
&gt;&gt; Female #2: I really enjoyed the beer talk
that you got earlier--

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:39.790
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Sweet.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:40.790
&gt;&gt; Female #2: as well.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:41.790
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Thanks.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.130
&gt;&gt; Female #2: I had a question to tie these
two together.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:48.630
Do you have beers that you prefer to have
with your Sriracha dishes?

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:49.710
And a two part question.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:50.710
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Yes.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:51.710
&gt;&gt; Female#2: I'm sorry.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:52.710
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: No.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:53.710
&gt;&gt; Female#2: Cocktails.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:54.710
Have you ever tried to make Sriracha based
cocktails?

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:55.710
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Yeah.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:56.910
So, with beer--.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.900
Beer's great 'cause it can help kill the heat.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.090
And actually for my book release party, Eagle
Rock Brewery made a Sriracha beer for it.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.289
It was really, really interesting.

00:17:05.289 --> 00:17:06.289
It was good.

00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:07.289
I liked it.

00:17:07.289 --> 00:17:08.289
[laughter]

00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:09.289
No.

00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:10.289
I really liked it.

00:17:10.289 --> 00:17:11.289
But four ounces of it was like the perfect
amount.

00:17:11.289 --> 00:17:14.279
I didn't want a refreshing pint of it.

00:17:14.279 --> 00:17:15.860
But no, it works really, really well with
beer.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:21.350
So, I did an event last night at Library Alehouse,
and we paired a couple dishes with beers from

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:22.659
El Segundo Brewing Company.

00:17:22.659 --> 00:17:25.270
And it was really, really interesting how
well it worked.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:31.740
So, for me, if you've got a really well made
lager, it works really well.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.889
And not the 30 pack for $12.99 stuff.

00:17:34.889 --> 00:17:41.850
If you can get a really well made lager like
Craftsman here in Pasadena, their 1903 Pre-Prohibition

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:43.110
Lager is awesome.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.029
And that works really well because, you know
it's lighter in flavor but it really helps

00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:49.690
accentuate a lot of the flavors that are already
there in your dishes.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.260
I really like hoppy I.P.As.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.370
Those work really well with spicy food anyway.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:55.370
They--.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:56.370
The citrus usually--.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.620
Flavors usually present in an I.P.A work really
well with spicy food.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:07.990
But then again we had a rum soaked, oak chips
that were soaked in rum were put into this

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.990
stout.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.750
The Hyperion Stout from El Segundo Brewing
Company.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.499
And that was paired with the sorbet, which
I wouldn't have thought of in a million years.

00:18:13.499 --> 00:18:14.620
It worked really well.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.570
So, you can play around.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:18.700
And then cocktails.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.820
I suck at making drinks.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.820
[laughter]

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.820
It's really depressing.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.800
I'm pretty good at making food and I like
drinking beer, but I can’t make a decent

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.120
cocktail other than a gin and tonic to save
my life.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.129
But my friend Chris Day, actually made a cocktail
recipe for the book.

00:18:34.129 --> 00:18:35.210
Someone is laughing.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:37.690
Someone knows Chris Day.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:38.690
He made a cocktail for the book.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:39.690
It was great.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.759
We were out one night drinking heavily.

00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:46.049
And we went back to his place and drank some
more.

00:18:46.049 --> 00:18:49.860
And I was in the middle of working on this
book and I said, "Hey, can you make a Sriracha

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:50.860
cocktail?"

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:51.860
And he didn't even answer.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.620
He just walked away and went in the kitchen
and came back in like three minutes with this

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.650
amazing drink.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:19:02.649
He used this crazy organic tomato vodka and
Sriracha, of course, and I think some jalapeño

00:19:02.649 --> 00:19:03.649
and some other stuff.

00:19:03.649 --> 00:19:04.649
I haven't made it in so long.

00:19:04.649 --> 00:19:05.649
But it came out really great.

00:19:05.649 --> 00:19:08.249
So, it's definitely something you can play
around with.

00:19:08.249 --> 00:19:10.889
It makes a really nice Sriracha-lada.

00:19:10.889 --> 00:19:13.009
Like a michelada with Sriracha in it.

00:19:13.009 --> 00:19:14.009
Really good.

00:19:14.009 --> 00:19:16.929
That's like the ultimate hammock beer for
me in the summer.

00:19:16.929 --> 00:19:18.570
&gt;&gt; Male#1: Thank you very much for coming.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.070
I was curious whether you can talk a little
more about the process of writing the book.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.300
How does it go?

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.970
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Sure.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.350
So, had this idea and I didn't really know
where to go with it.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:35.269
And the power of meeting people, I was so
lucky.

00:19:35.269 --> 00:19:36.269
I wanted--.

00:19:36.269 --> 00:19:41.610
I started looking for publishers that had
written books about spicy food or about chili

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:42.610
peppers.

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:45.510
And one of them that I came across was Ten
Speed Press.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:49.210
And I went to their website to try to get
some information on submission guidelines.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.840
Was lucky enough that they accept un-solicited
manuscripts.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.980
Which means, you don't have an agent and they're
not looking for--.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:56.980
You're pitching them directly.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.270
They’re not looking for your work.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.610
You're telling them, "This is what I have,
would you be interested?"

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:06.130
So, finding out a little information, I go
to their page and this big huge banner pops

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:10.080
up and it was "New book from Peter Reinhart"
who is a bread god.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.260
And I had the pleasure of meeting him a few
years before at a bread festival in Portland,

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.770
Oregon that I flew up for because I like bread.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:21.100
I go to Thailand for hot sauce, Portland for
bread.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.770
But I had the pleasure of meeting him and
chatting with him before and so I sent him

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:29.529
an email just out of the blue and said,"Hey,
don't know if you remember me, but, looking

00:20:29.529 --> 00:20:31.760
to write a book and I think Ten Speed would
be great.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.731
Are you able to share your contact information
there?"

00:20:33.731 --> 00:20:35.730
And he said, "No.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.169
But I'd be happy to pass it along if you want
to send it to me."

00:20:38.169 --> 00:20:42.290
So, I wrote up this book proposal, which is
a really lengthy process.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:43.480
But you kind of sell yourself.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.480
You sell the book.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.840
You sell why the publisher wants this book.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.139
Why they want it now.

00:20:48.139 --> 00:20:49.450
Why you should write it.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:50.450
How it's going to sell.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.450
Why there's nothing else like it.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.450
Why there should--.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.009
You know you lay it all out.

00:20:54.009 --> 00:20:55.460
Sent it to him.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.650
He was gracious enough to send it back with
“Fix this.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:20:59.650
Fix that.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:00.650
Move that around.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:01.650
Put this here.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:02.650
Shorten this."

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.650
I mean, he really--.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:06.330
I owe him my life.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:10.509
But so, anyway he finally passed it along
and I actually sent it on to two editors and

00:21:10.509 --> 00:21:12.669
from two different publishing houses.

00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:13.669
And I was--.

00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:16.580
They both wanted it so I tried to engage them
in a bidding war.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.580
You--.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.700
I got really lucky.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.630
So, yeah, they took it and from there, that's
when the fun part starts.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.100
'Cause that-- the contract negotiation--.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:29.460
I'm actually negotiating a contract right
now for a follow up for a vegetarian, vegan

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.309
follow up that I want to call “The Veggie
Lover's Sriracha Cookbook."

00:21:33.309 --> 00:21:37.990
But we're going throughout the contract right
now and my editor, Melissa Moore, who I love,

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.610
needs to call me back.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.549
Melissa please call me back.

00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:42.549
[laughter]

00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:43.549
So, anyway.

00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:44.750
So after that's done, that's when the fun
starts.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:48.039
You can start laying out the recipes you wanna
do.

00:21:48.039 --> 00:21:50.730
And actually I submit the recipe list with
my proposal.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.710
I pretty much know what I wanna make, I just
haven't made it.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:54.710
And I need to get on that.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.029
I've got 50 more recipes I need to write.

00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:57.220
But that's the fun part for me.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:03.259
Is putting the pieces together and testing
out different amounts and making friends chip

00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:04.259
in.

00:22:04.259 --> 00:22:05.320
I wanna put together some sort of pot luck.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.299
Have people bring dishes they tested for me.

00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:12.129
I send them the recipes, they test them, and
everyone gets together and has a good time.

00:22:12.129 --> 00:22:13.620
You know, put something like that together.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.620
You test the recipes.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:15.620
You turn it all in.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.320
They send it to a copy editor who makes sure
you're not retarded and fixes your grammar

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.330
mistakes, missing words.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:23.509
They test some of the recipes.

00:22:23.509 --> 00:22:28.460
Once that gets sent off, they start design
and layout and they do photography.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.279
Again, Leo Gong up in San Francisco, I got
to go up to his studio and just watch what

00:22:32.279 --> 00:22:38.509
he did and the food stylist Karen Shinto,
just amazing and so tolerant of me.

00:22:38.509 --> 00:22:41.690
And others who would nitpick little things,
we were trying not to.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:46.220
But literally, how can you move that little
piece of parsley over there?

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:52.040
It happened and I felt bad every time but
she was gracious the entire time because she

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.669
wants it to come out right.

00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:55.269
She doesn't take it personally.

00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:58.630
Even so, I felt like an asshole a couple times.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.990
That corn picture, which is my favorite picture
in the book too, I really was neurotic about

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.990
that one.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.990
[laughter]

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.789
But to her credit, she was great the whole
time.

00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:11.980
Goes off to a printer, books come back, it
comes out and I get a cool book release party

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.660
at Blue Palms Brewhouse in Hollywood.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:14.660
And--.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.080
I always try to tie in beer when I can.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.580
And it was great.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.110
And it's been phenomenal.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.340
It sold exceedingly well.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.990
It's exceeded every expectation I ever had.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:25.649
I'm so happy with it.

00:23:25.649 --> 00:23:30.370
It's still a blessing, the fact that I'm here
talking to people and that you're listening.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.279
It's still humbling and surprising and awesome.

00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:33.451
So, thank you guys for being here.

00:23:33.451 --> 00:23:34.451
&gt;&gt; Male#1: Thank you very much.

00:23:34.451 --> 00:23:35.451
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Sure.

00:23:35.451 --> 00:23:39.679
&gt;&gt; Male#2: Hey, I got here a little late so,
I'm sorry if you went over this already.

00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:45.379
But what are your thoughts on all the sauces
that are out there that are kind of knock-offs?

00:23:45.379 --> 00:23:46.789
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Good question.

00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:47.789
You know there--.

00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:48.789
You will.

00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:49.789
You'll see knock-offs.

00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:54.559
And actually there was a period of time when
someone was making counterfeit Huy Fong Foods

00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:55.559
Sriracha.

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:56.830
They were--.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:00.049
There's a laser etching on the bottle now
that's the date stamp and stuff.

00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:02.890
And they've done a couple other things that
make it harder to counterfeit.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:08.600
But someone was making serious knock-off hot
sauce and selling it as if it was Huy Fong

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.900
Foods.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.779
And they were getting a lot of calls that
the quality wasn't as good and what was going

00:24:12.779 --> 00:24:13.779
on.

00:24:13.779 --> 00:24:14.779
And they started looking into it.

00:24:14.779 --> 00:24:20.600
Turns out some guy was doing it.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.400
Having it made in China and having it shipped
over.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.919
And I don't know how that's cheaper because
they sell the stuff for so damn cheap.

00:24:24.919 --> 00:24:27.100
I don't know how it's cheaper to have it made
in China and shipped over.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.019
It scares me to think what was going in there.

00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:34.409
But they ended up finding this abandoned warehouse
where there was like a --. Someone, a small

00:24:34.409 --> 00:24:39.549
security guard or something, found this abandoned
pallet in the parking lot or in a storage

00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:42.029
unit or something like that and called the
company and said “Hey, you guys need to

00:24:42.029 --> 00:24:43.059
come pick up your hot sauce."

00:24:43.059 --> 00:24:45.049
So he went down to check it out.

00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:48.980
And they found it and kinda waited around
and eventually someone came to pick it up.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.369
And they stopped them and said, “Hey, where's
this going?"

00:24:51.369 --> 00:24:53.210
And they said, “We just got an order to
pick it up and take it here."

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:57.190
They went over there and someone else was
there and they were like," Oh, well this guy

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.210
is the one that paid for it."

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:01.210
And he had a personal check with his name,
phone number, address, and everything else

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:02.210
on there.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.210
And so, they--.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.460
Yeah, they ended up shutting them down and
taking them to court and all that kind of

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.460
stuff.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.690
But other knock--offs, there's a couple--.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.869
Again there's a couple different brands making
it.

00:25:12.869 --> 00:25:17.210
For me, the two that are my favorites are
the Huy Fong Foods brand and the Shark brand.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:18.940
There's other one's out there.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.749
American made and made in Thailand and other
countries too.

00:25:21.749 --> 00:25:24.960
There's a really cool one that doesn't get
exported here.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.369
You can find it in England.

00:25:26.369 --> 00:25:27.450
So, I'm hoping to get some.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:28.809
I'm going to England this summer and I hope
to get some.

00:25:28.809 --> 00:25:30.470
It's called Flying Goose.

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.830
And they actually have like seven different
flavors.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:33.830
They do a garlic.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:34.830
They do a ginger.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:38.570
They do extra hot which I'm stoked about.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.570
The cool thing--.

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:42.679
The other cool thing in the book is that there's
a homemade Sriracha recipe.

00:25:42.679 --> 00:25:43.679
So, it's different.

00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:46.340
It's different than the Huy Fong Foods brand.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.590
But it's again, play with it.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:50.289
A friend of mine made it with habaneros and
it was great.

00:25:50.289 --> 00:25:53.080
It was a lot hotter, but it was really good.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.440
But it's kinda fun to have something bubbling
on your countertop for a little--.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.759
For a week.

00:25:57.759 --> 00:26:00.480
And starting to get stinky in a good way.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.559
So, but as far as the knock-offs, for me,
I stick with the original.

00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:06.690
Well, the American original.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:09.770
And Shark brand has been around for a while.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.210
Sriraja Panich is considered by most people
to be the originator.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.210
Hello.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:16.200
&gt;&gt; Female#3: Speaking into a microphone.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.200
So strange.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.200
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Tell me about it.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.200
&gt;&gt; Female#3: Do you--.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.200
[laughs]

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.200
[laughter]

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.210
Thank you for being here first of all.

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:27.909
Do you have any restaurants in L.A. or otherwise
that serve some really good Sriracha based

00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:28.909
dishes?

00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:29.909
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Damn.

00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:33.179
&gt;&gt; Female#3: Or anything like that that's
not pho?

00:26:33.179 --> 00:26:34.179
[laughs]

00:26:34.179 --> 00:26:35.419
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Right.

00:26:35.419 --> 00:26:36.419
You know what?

00:26:36.419 --> 00:26:37.419
There's some--.

00:26:37.419 --> 00:26:42.110
To me the people that are doing the most interesting
things with Sriracha are the food trucks.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.119
So if you--.

00:26:43.119 --> 00:26:48.350
Chego, which is associated with Kogi Barbecue,
or Kogi, I don't know which one it is.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.470
Roy Choi.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.690
His pastry chef makes this Sriracha chocolate
bar.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:55.639
That sounds weird, but it's awesome.

00:26:55.639 --> 00:26:56.639
It's really good.

00:26:56.639 --> 00:27:00.539
So, I think they have a peanut caramel base.

00:27:00.539 --> 00:27:04.490
Chocolate on top, Sriracha, some sort of nougat,
I think.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.870
And then it's all just enrobed with more chocolate.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:09.860
And it's really, really good.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:13.610
I bought one then I bought four and took them
home and saved them.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:14.610
[laughter]

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:15.610
Shared it with a friend.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:19.200
So, if you go to Chego, which is the stand
alone or the brick and mortar shop they've

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.200
got 'em there.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.489
But if you're lucky enough to find the truck.

00:27:22.489 --> 00:27:27.529
There's another one called Dos Chinos and
they do a tapatio Sriracha cheesecake which

00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:28.789
I haven't tried.

00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:32.590
But I've heard it's really, really good.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.649
The Grill 'em All truck.

00:27:34.649 --> 00:27:39.529
They have a peanut butter and jelly, bacon
and Sriracha burger called the Dee Snider.

00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:43.859
Which again I haven't tried, but it's supposed
to be awesome.

00:27:43.859 --> 00:27:49.100
But yeah, as far as other restaurants, I can't
think of any off the top of my head.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.339
&gt;&gt; Female#3: Just make our own.

00:27:50.339 --> 00:27:51.349
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Yes.

00:27:51.349 --> 00:27:52.700
&gt;&gt; Female#3: It'll be good.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:53.700
[laughs]

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:54.700
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Yes.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:55.700
There you go.

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:59.889
&gt;&gt; Female#4: Would you mind just explaining
what each of the bottle are on the table right

00:27:59.889 --> 00:28:00.889
there?

00:28:00.889 --> 00:28:04.940
I know you talked a little bit about some
of the differences in texture and things like

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:05.940
that.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:09.400
But just what the different brands are there
and which ones are--.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.080
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Sure.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.299
To be honest, I've only had three of 'em.

00:28:12.299 --> 00:28:13.299
&gt;&gt; Female#3: Oh.

00:28:13.299 --> 00:28:14.570
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: So, there's some new ones
for me to try.

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:17.039
So, Chef Michael actually picked them up.

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:19.400
There's a couple great stores out in San Gabriel.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.309
Hawaii Supermarket and the San Gabriel Superstore.

00:28:22.309 --> 00:28:25.010
Which they're adventures if you ever want
to go.

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:26.419
They're really, really cool stores.

00:28:26.419 --> 00:28:28.440
But yeah, they've got all sorts of different
brands.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:34.619
So, the Shark brand is again my favorite as
far as the Thai style goes.

00:28:34.619 --> 00:28:37.529
Just to me it's really, really well balanced.

00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:41.159
And I like to use that.

00:28:41.159 --> 00:28:42.960
That actually flows a little better for cooking.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.960
I like--.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.309
If I 'm cooking something quickly, I like
to use that a little bit more.

00:28:47.309 --> 00:28:51.190
The Huy Fong Foods brand is thicker and just
a different flavor from the jalapeño peppers.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.049
And so, for me that one's more my condiment.

00:28:53.049 --> 00:28:56.769
And it's just more conducive to it anyway
because of the squirt top.

00:28:56.769 --> 00:28:59.109
The Por Kwan brand, I still can't--.

00:28:59.109 --> 00:29:01.799
I like the flavor but the texture to me is
just weird.

00:29:01.799 --> 00:29:08.080
It just comes out looking artificially thick.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.080
And not like, I don't know.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.879
You just have to check it out.

00:29:10.879 --> 00:29:12.159
&gt;&gt; Female#3: I like that one.

00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:13.159
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Yeah.

00:29:13.159 --> 00:29:14.159
No.

00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:17.779
It tastes great it's just like, it's like
shiny and glossy and gloopy.

00:29:17.779 --> 00:29:18.779
[laughter]

00:29:18.779 --> 00:29:20.429
That's the only word I can keep using for
it.

00:29:20.429 --> 00:29:21.429
But it tastes good.

00:29:21.429 --> 00:29:22.490
I don't know.

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:23.789
This little guy here I haven't had yet.

00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:24.789
I gotta check it out.

00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:25.789
It looks--.

00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:27.460
I always like when chili stuff is smaller.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.309
I am almost more scared of it.

00:29:29.309 --> 00:29:30.309
But good scared.

00:29:30.309 --> 00:29:31.309
I will always try it.

00:29:31.309 --> 00:29:33.749
But those are the only three that I've had.

00:29:33.749 --> 00:29:36.219
So, I am looking forward to trying the other
one.

00:29:36.219 --> 00:29:37.219
&gt;&gt; Female#3: Thank You.

00:29:37.219 --> 00:29:38.219
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Sure.

00:29:38.219 --> 00:29:40.119
I can tell you quick fun facts.

00:29:40.119 --> 00:29:41.119
Just so--.

00:29:41.119 --> 00:29:42.789
Thai bird chilies.

00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:45.500
The whole story behind why they're called
that.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.070
Birds aren't actually sensitive to capsaicin.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.899
Which is the heat element of chili peppers.

00:29:49.899 --> 00:29:52.119
So, they often eat them.

00:29:52.119 --> 00:29:57.510
The peppers actually grow facing up like the
prik khee nu, those little mean bastards I

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:58.510
showed you.

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.529
They grow pointing up so birds can see them.

00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:02.619
And they'll come down and eat 'em.

00:30:02.619 --> 00:30:08.590
The seeds don’t digest and so they come
out with a nice little layer of manure right

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.609
around them and they plop right down to the
ground.

00:30:10.609 --> 00:30:12.129
It helps the plant spread.

00:30:12.129 --> 00:30:15.139
But that's the whole idea around them being
called the Thai bird chili.

00:30:15.139 --> 00:30:18.210
"Cause the birds eat them and make them spread
and grow.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:21.869
So, there’s a lot of chili peppers all around
Thailand and elsewhere.

00:30:21.869 --> 00:30:23.459
But that's normally how it's spread.

00:30:23.459 --> 00:30:28.309
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: That's a really cool
fact.

00:30:28.309 --> 00:30:30.269
Reminds me of the cat poo coffee.

00:30:30.269 --> 00:30:31.269
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Yes.

00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:32.269
The Civets.

00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:33.269
[laughter]

00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:34.269
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: That we pay 25 dollars
a pound for or something.

00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:40.450
Well, thank you very much Randy for coming
here to join us at the Authors at Google program.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:45.529
We hope you finish your vegetarian Sriracha
books very soon and come back and see us again.

00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:47.289
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: Summer of 2013 it should
be out.

00:30:47.289 --> 00:30:48.289
So, I'll--.

00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:49.360
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Summer of 2013.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.840
&gt;&gt; Randy Clemens: I'll be here.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.840
[laughter]

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:51.841
[applause]
