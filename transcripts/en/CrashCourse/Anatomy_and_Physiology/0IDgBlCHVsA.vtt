00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.029
So you’re sound asleep, when your smoke
alarm goes off. Before you even know what’s

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:07.189
going on, you start to feel it. Those smoke
alarms are loud -- for a good reason. Your

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.200
heart starts to race, your breathing picks
up, you become sweaty all over your body.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.770
You are stressed. And I’m not talking about
the my-iPhone-just-died kind of stress. I’m

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.890
talking about the I’m-afraid-I-might-die
kind of stress.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.150
Even though it’s often seen as a dirty word,
stress, like pain, isn’t all bad -- it’s

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.699
actually very useful if you’re, y’know,
trying to get out of a burning building.

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.480
Your sympathetic nervous system is the part
of your nervous system that responds to stress,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.050
and it does its job exceedingly well by focusing
on what your body needs to do right now.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.819
Like, when you’re facing a life-or-death
ordeal, you don’t need to be digesting that

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:43.079
cashew cluster in your intestines, or producing
reproductive cells, or fighting off an infection.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.280
That’s all stuff that you can deal with
later, when you’re out of harm’s way.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.710
So your sympathetic nervous system sweeps
these suddenly trivial functions aside to

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.489
blast all of your energy to your brain and heart
and muscles to deal with the threat at hand.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.179
So, this is where I tell you that you’re
lucky to have a sympathetic nervous system.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.579
And that it keeps you alive. And that you would
probably die in X Period of Time if you didn’t have one.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.760
All of which is true. But here’s the thing:
the problem is, nowadays our bodies’ stress

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.180
responses are triggered all the time, practically
every day, even when we are not in mortal danger.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.190
I mean, worrying about paying your wireless
bill or being late for an important meeting

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.560
-- those things are terrible, but they will
not kill you.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.820
But, good luck explaining that to your nervous
system.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.840
Because your physiological responses to 
non-immediate stresses are largely the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.100
same as when you’re fighting for survival.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.450
So, if stress is, like, ruining your life,
that’s why. And that’s part of the reason

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.109
that should get to know how it works. Because
by learning about your sympathetic

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:38.709
nervous system, you come to understand one
of the key players in the physiology of stress.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.160
You may recall from our tour of the anatomy
of your autonomic nervous system, that in

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.350
both your sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions,
almost every signal has to cross two synapses.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.840
Each neuron travels from its root in the spinal
cord to a ganglion, where it synapses -- and

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.030
yes, that is a verb as well -- with another
nerve fiber. And that one, in turn, leads

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.490
to an effector organ, where it synapses again
to create whatever response was signaled -- like

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.020
sending more blood to your skeletal muscles,
or making your heart pump faster.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.460
But you gotta wonder -- or at least I gotta
wonder: how do these neurons and effectors

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.800
actually communicate with each other? And
how do all of those signals result in the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.210
high-octane sensations that we know as “stress”?

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.660
By and large, the stress response includes two kinds
of chemicals, both of which I’m sure you've heard of.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.820
The first, of course, are neurotransmitters. These
are made and released from neurons themselves,

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.290
and like we talked about in our lesson about
synapses, they are what neurons use to communicate

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.520
with each other -- or their effector organs
-- across a synapse.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.110
The other chemicals involved in stress are
hormones, which are secreted by your glands.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.730
There are at least 50 different hormones at
work in your body right now, and they do everything

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.500
from regulating your sleep cycles to making
your body retain water so you’re not dying

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.050
of dehydration all over the place.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.310
I’m telling you all of this now, up front,
because hormones and neurotransmitters are

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.740
100% necessary for understanding how your
sympathetic division ultimately works.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.180
BUT! When you trace a single sympathetic signal,
from the initial stimulus to the final response,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.190
those chemicals can be kind of hard to keep
track of.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.820
That’s because the very same substance can
have different effects -- actually, sometimes,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.540
totally opposite effects -- depending on where
it’s received in your body.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.120
And to make things even more fun, even though
neurotransmitters are part of your nervous

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.700
system, and hormones are products of your
endocrine system, a compound can be considered

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.250
either a neurotransmitter or a hormone -- even
though it hasn’t changed one iota -- depending

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.000
on where it happens to be operating in your
body.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.260
So all of this can make understanding your
stress responses pretty confusing! You might

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.060
even say … stressful!

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.380
All right, we’re going in.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.070
The smoke alarm wakes you up. You smell smoke.
It is time to move muscles. Fast.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.160
Your brain sends action potentials down your
spinal cord and preganglionic neuronal axons.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.520
Those signals flow all the way to their ganglia.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.920
When the signals reach the synapses inside
the ganglia, the nerve fibers then release

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.940
a neurotransmitter -- called acetylcholine,
known to its friends as ACh.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.840
If you haven’t heard of acetylcholine yet,
you’re gonna wanna remember that name.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.670
In addition to working in sympathetic ganglia
like this, it’s also what the rest of your

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.000
peripheral nervous system and lots of your
central nervous system uses to communicate.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.300
So when it comes to nervous communication, ACh
is really the coin of the realm. The premium currency.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.380
So, that acetylcholine crosses the synapse
and, if there’s enough of it, it can stimulate

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.180
action potentials in several neurons on the
other end -- in the postganglionic fibers.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.980
That’s all it does, but it’s important.
It’s basically a signal booster.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.240
Those postganglionic neurons then carry the
action potential to the effector organs -- in

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.020
this case, let’s say your leg muscles, which
are going to need an influx of blood 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.980
if they’re going to hustle you out of that house.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.180
And at the end of that second, postganglionic
neuron, the fiber releases a different neurotransmitter.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.030
This one’s called norepinephrine. And it
is always norepinephrine that’s released

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.650
from postganglionic fibers in the sympathetic
nervous system.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.970
It’s what crosses that final synapse and
creates a response in the effector, like opening

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.880
up blood vessels that lead to the leg muscles.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.920
So, the preganglionic fiber releases ACh,
and the postganglionic releases norepinephrine.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.580
Boom. Congrats. Your life is on its way to
being saved.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.100
But, your body has more than one mechanism
for responding to things, especially things

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.190
like a burning house.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.500
There’s another alternative for getting
the message out.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.990
I mentioned those hormones, remember?

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.490
In addition to nerve fibers that lead to ganglia
and then your effectors, there’s also a

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.450
set leaving the spinal cord that goes directly
to your adrenal glands.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.430
Like all preganglionic fibers, these release
acetylcholine, too. But here, the signal doesn’t

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.050
end up in another neuron that triggers blood
vessels to open or whatever. Instead, it triggers

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.210
your adrenal medulla to release a flood of
epinephrine and norepinephrine -- hormones

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.690
that rush through your bloodstream toward
your heart, lungs, and other organs.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.830
Now, hold up! Did you notice what I just said?

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.830
Yeah, I said the adrenal glands release norepinephrine
as a hormone.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.230
Whereas in that first scenario I said that
norepinephrine was a neurotransmitter that

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.139
sent the final signal to control blood flow
to the leg muscle.

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.310
Now, how can I say both of those things?

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.280
Because they’re both true.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.750
Norepinephrine is BOTH a neurotransmitter
and a hormone, and which one it is depends

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.830
on how it’s being used. If it’s being released
from a neuron and travelling across a synapse,

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.800
we refer to a messenger chemical -- no matter
what it is -- as a neurotransmitter. If it’s

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.680
being secreted by a gland into the bloodstream
for more widespread distribution, it’s a hormone.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.970
Even if it’s the same chemical. And to an
effector, hormonal norepinephrine is just

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.690
as good as neurotransmitter norepinephrine.
But as scientists, we describe them differently,

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.320
because they’re functioning differently.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.260
Now, the ways in which a neurotransmitter-slash-
hormone like norepinephrine works, is a good example

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.870
of another confusing aspect of your sympathetic
nervous system. Because it works by both stimulating

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.710
and inhibiting the same systems in your body
at the same time!

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.139
So, in our house-burning scenario, the norepinephrine
your system releases causes an increase of

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.610
blood flow in some parts of your body -- like
your leg muscles -- while restricting blood

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.240
flow in other places where it’s not urgently
needed -- like your guts.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.940
How can the same chemical cause opposite
responses? Well, it all depends on the particular kind

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.900
of receptors that an effector has for receiving
that chemical.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.240
In the case of norepinephrine, its effector
is smooth muscle -- the muscle that controls

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.580
all of your involuntary functions of hollow
organs, like the stomach, and bladder,

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.040
and also your blood vessels.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.870
On the smooth muscle cells controlling some
blood vessels, there are receptors called

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.380
alpha receptors -- when norepinephrine, or
epinephrine, bind to those receptors, they

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.580
make those smooth muscle cells contract, 
thereby restricting blood flow.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.730
But on smooth muscle cells that control other
blood vessels, there are lots of beta receptors

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.950
for epinephrine and norepinephrine, and when
they are activated, they make the muscles

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.260
relax, letting more blood flow through.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.880
So it makes sense that the smooth muscle around
your blood vessels, which feed your skeletal

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.510
muscles -- which you’ll need to get out
of that smoky house -- are covered in beta

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:50.440
receptors. Because you want those blood vessels
to relax, and provide plenty of oxygen to

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.770
the muscles in your arms and legs.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.300
And since running away is more important than
digesting your dinner, the blood vessels leading

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:01.160
to your stomach and intestines have lots of
alpha receptors, which reduce blood flow to

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.160
those areas, because that burrito can wait
until you’re out of the house.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.740
So, there’s a lot going on in your sympathetic
responses. And much of it can seem complicated,

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.040
or even contradictory.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.280
But the thing is, all of these functions work
together to create a full-body response, which

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.660
is exactly what you need in an emergency.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.460
After all, it wouldn’t do you much good
to speed up your heart without sending that

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.380
blood to your muscles, where it’s needed.
It’s up to those neurotransmitters and hormones,

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:29.080
and the receptors on the corresponding effectors,
to make sure that everyone is on the same page.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.940
So, the system works well. Really well. Sometimes,
too well.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.240
Remember when I said at the beginning, how
your body doesn’t know life-threatening

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:38.659
stress from life-annoying stress?

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:42.610
Since your body’s reaction tends to be a
full-body response either way, it can become

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.180
pretty taxing over time.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.699
I mean, we’re talking about throwing parts
of your body into overdrive, while depriving

00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:49.189
others of blood and oxygen.

00:08:49.189 --> 00:08:52.059
That’s not something you want happening
every morning.

00:08:52.059 --> 00:08:56.399
So the irony here? The real kick in the head?
It’s that non-life-threatening stressors can

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:02.040
actually end up endangering your life in the long run,
because your body’s stress response is so effective.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.600
The frequent activation of your sympathetic
nervous system, and the triggering the other

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.970
part of your stress response -- the part that’s
driven by hormones -- can have nasty consequences,

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:15.180
like high blood pressure, digestive problems,
and even the suppression of your immune system.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:21.160
So what your body needs to do is figure out
how to relax. Rest and digest. Feed and breed.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.639
That is where your sympathetic system’s more mellow
half-brother, the parasympathetic system comes in.

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:29.029
And yeah, that’s what we’re gonna be talking
about next time.

00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:32.989
For now you learned that your sympathetic
nervous system controls your body’s stress

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:37.699
response and how the signals in your sympathetic
nervous system travel to an effector, using

00:09:37.699 --> 00:09:42.019
the neurotransmitters acetylcholine in the
ganglion and norepinephrine at the effector.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.320
And you learned that other signals can go
right to the adrenal glands, where norepinephrine

00:09:45.329 --> 00:09:47.790
and epinephrine are secreted as hormones.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:51.600
And you also learned that the same messenger
chemical can evoke different responses depending

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.879
on the receptors, with alpha receptors causing
smooth muscles to constrict, for example,

00:09:55.879 --> 00:09:58.420
while beta receptors cause smooth muscle to
relax.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.209
