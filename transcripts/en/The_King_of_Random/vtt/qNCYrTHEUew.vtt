RAPTORZ YZ left a comment asking whether or not the styro-slicer' could cut through dry ice

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.319
and I'm actually not really sure what would happen if we tried.

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.598
So I got out my styro-slicer and I went and picked up some dry ice so today we can put that experiment to the test

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.120
Dry ice is just a solid block of Carbon dioxide,

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:20.729
so when we set it down on a warm surface like our countertop it releases a vapor of gas underneath which makes it float around

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.900
like an Air hockey puck

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.310
It's actually not a very good idea to touch the stuff with your bare skin, so for the rest of this experiment

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.699
I'm gonna be using gloves

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.629
now a lot of you will remember my tutorial on making the styro-slicer

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.718
This is designed to use electricity and pump a current through a thin stainless steel wire. This generates a lot of heat

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.869
and it easily slices through styrofoam. When we power on the styro-slicer this thin metal wire can reach temperatures above

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.759
1,000 degrees Celsius. On the other hand dry ice is minus 79 degrees Celsius.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.760
So what will happen when these two extremes

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.709
collide will the dry ice freeze the wire solid or will the wire generate enough heat to easily glide through the block of ice

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.589
Your guess is as good as mine. So let's flip the switch and see exactly what happens. Oh, it's like freezing to my table here

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.470
Alright, so I just got the wire set to normal power. Let's go ahead and introduce the dry ice and see what happens.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.059
Made a little bit of a squealing noise there like a little mini velociraptor

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.799
hear that?

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.269
now look at the wire it actually cools down very quickly and

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.139
Not making much progress. Let's go ahead and turn up the power. This is high power on the normal setting here we go

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.909
Yeah, you can see it only gets about an 8 maybe a sixteenth of an inch into the block and then it just stops solid

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.229
now if I rub it up and down the wire I can use this kind of like as a wire saw and

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.020
That's actually working a little bit better

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.600
But it's still not super impressive. I think it's time to crank this thing to overdrive. What happens when the dry ice touches it?

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.780
Listen to that. you hear that? It's making like a really high-pitched vibration

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.440
At this rate, it looks like we're probably moving about one inch every two minutes

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.200
So I suppose you could use it to cut a block of dry ice

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.130
But it doesn't seem very practical. you'd probably be better off using something like a bandsaw

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.149
You know what the hot wire foam cutter does get pretty hot, but I don't think it's match for a block of dry ice

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.390
I'm cranking this thing up pretty heavy to the point where the wires going to snap and we're not really making much progress.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.970
[ooh] And there goes the wire. I just snapped it so to answer your question RAPTORZ

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.290
It looks like the styro-slicer' will not cut through a block of dry ice or at least it won't do it very effectively

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:43.030
but the fact that it doesn't actually does make sense. we've got a relatively large and cold mass battling against a relatively small warm

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.860
mass and of course this is going to win every time which is really too bad because I was honestly hoping that it would I

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.080
was hoping we could cut all kinds of cool little shapes out of it

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.419
But alas hey what's amazing is like even though I cut into this block. I'm having a really hard time getting it back out

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.790
It's like the ice sealed up and somehow the wire is trapped and has to cut its way back out

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.959
In fact it takes so much energy to warm up this block of dries that even if we blasted it with a superhot propane torch

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.630
You can see the flame barely put the dent in it as well

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.859
You see two minutes of intense heat from a propane torch

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.569
And it barely even put a dent in that thing that is crazy you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.920
Yeah, cutting dry ice with the styro-slicer' not very effective wouldn't recommend it

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.679
But it was a fun experiment and I appreciate you asking so now

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.840
What are we going to do with all this leftover dry ice I do have an idea that involves going outside and using my fish

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.420
Pond and you'll see in the next video what we end up doing with it

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.679
Thanks so much for your suggestions in your comments. Keep them coming and I'll be looking for you in the next video

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.689
Talk to you then

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.999
Excuse you dry ice is so random

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.130
you
