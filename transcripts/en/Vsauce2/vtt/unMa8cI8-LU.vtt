00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:06.519
The Luxembourg Government is creating legislation
and providing $220 million dollars in incentives

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:09.580
for companies to begin mining asteroids.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:17.000
And Snotbot is a drone from DJI that is helping
researchers study whales by safely and easily

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.599
collecting their snot.

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.730
Vsauce! Kevin here. This is Mind Blow.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.439
GauntLev is a levitation glove. Bristol Interaction
Group developed the gauntlet that uses acoustic

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.490
levitation to allow a user to handle fragile
or dangerous materials without touching them.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.440
They’ve also developed other acoustic levitation
manipulation tools including the sonic screwdriver

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.370
and ultra tongs. Acoustic Levitation was first
mentioned in Mind Blow #50 back in September

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.920
2012 as a static system. These new tools allow
for basic maneuvers and human controlling

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.940
of levitating objects - representing a major
leap forward for the technology. Also it just

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.460
looks awesome.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.509
Keeping busy in Bristol researchers are developing
a shape changing handheld device. Cubimorph

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.579
uses turntable hinges on cubes that can accommodate
six touchscreen each, allowing for a variety

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:22.149
of programmable shapes to provide modular
interactivity. The successful proof of concept

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:28.060
could lead to mobile phones transforming into
game controllers as the materials and designs

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.350
get smaller, cheaper and sturdier.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.049
If you’ve ever wanted to hear the Milky
Way then thank an asteroseismologist. Astrophysicists

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.439
from the University of Birmingham measure
tiny changes in the brightness of stars to

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.810
determine their age and mass - they recently
detected oscillations in the oldest known

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:56.560
cluster of stars in our galaxy at 13 billion
years old. Here’s what they sound like.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:04.340
Let’s rock.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.830
It turns out snails use just two brain cells
to make decisions. For example, One neuron

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.750
encodes the presence of food and another one
gauges the snail’s motivational state - so

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.400
there’s food and I’m hungry leads to let’s
eat. The study can lead to building new decision-making

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.720
systems based on only two neurons - more specifically
robot brains.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.060
Exoskin is a shape-changing material that
creates tangible interfaces with tactile feedback.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.580
Developed by the MIT Media Lab the material
consists of silicone triangles on flexible

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.060
bladders that allow it to change texture.
Their first proposed use for this would be

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.780
a steering wheel that integrates GPS navigation
directions naturally - so you can actually

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.120
feel where you need to go. And ultimately
their plan is to break the divide of human-computer

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.650
interaction allowing people to physically
interact with digital systems.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.120
Solar Impulse 2 is a single-seater zero fuel
airplane which recently landed safely in New

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.480
York City after a trip across the Pacific
Ocean and will next cross the Atlantic. It

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.350
uses SunPower solar cells to collect energy
for charging lithium batteries during morning

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.160
flights at altitudes up to 28,000 feet (8,534.4
m). At night, it glides to lower altitudes

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.020
and uses the battery power until sunrise.
They hope eventually it could someday provide

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.850
a clean, renewable method of transportation.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:36.060
Mind Blow #82 in May 2014 featured Wi-Fi clothes.
Along with Wi-Fi, The BB suit concept featured

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.840
GPS and Bluetooth to turn your clothes into
an mp3 player. Well today there's a company

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.870
called Machina that's making wearable technology
including a jacket that plays music in the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.300
hood using bluetooth connected to your smart
phone and a new virtual reality jacket. The

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.130
Out of Body Experience jacket is embedded
with sensors that allow the movement of your

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.230
body to effect VR. Turning the user into an
immersive controller by wearing a normal-looking

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.580
jacket instead of some weird suit.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.340
Finally, thanks to a new algorithm, humanoid
robot Atlas can now detect partial footholds

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:19.749
and autonomously adjust itself to stay balanced.

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:30.490
I’m gonna leave you with a brain interface
for controlling robot swarms and as always

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.300
- thanks for watching.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:58.180
Hello? Hello is this the office? I can't hear
much of anything. Sounds like someone crying.

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:02.990
Oh but my dear you mustn't be so critical.
Of course it sounds strange at first, the

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.200
advertisement says it will.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.540
Well, I don't think much of it. No one will
ever use it!

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.800
You mark my words, dear. The time will come
when we will all use it! Well, we may even

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.420
talk with distant cities.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.080
With distant cities. Oh, John, you're such
a dreamer!
