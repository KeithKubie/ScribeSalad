thing David you might want to think

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630
thing David you might want to think
 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.870
thing David you might want to think
about is like if all of your scores were

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880
about is like if all of your scores were
 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.270
about is like if all of your scores were
low then there's some possibility that

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280
low then there's some possibility that
 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.709
low then there's some possibility that
you're being too hard on yourself and

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719
you're being too hard on yourself and
 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.300
you're being too hard on yourself and
what I would recommend then is get a

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310
what I would recommend then is get a
 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.029
what I would recommend then is get a
couple of friends to fill out the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039
couple of friends to fill out the
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.029
couple of friends to fill out the
questionnaire for for you to describe

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039
questionnaire for for you to describe
 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.550
questionnaire for for you to describe
you and then see if first of all if

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560
you and then see if first of all if
 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.019
you and then see if first of all if
there's any agreement see if they've

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029
there's any agreement see if they've
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.759
there's any agreement see if they've
they are easier on you than you are

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769
they are easier on you than you are
 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.299
they are easier on you than you are
yourself so but let's assume that you

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
yourself so but let's assume that you
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.040
yourself so but let's assume that you
are rather low in conscientiousness the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050
are rather low in conscientiousness the
 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.540
are rather low in conscientiousness the
next question would be well how young

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
next question would be well how young
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.310
next question would be well how young
are you because younger people tend to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320
are you because younger people tend to
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.900
are you because younger people tend to
be lower in conscientiousness so if

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
be lower in conscientiousness so if
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.450
be lower in conscientiousness so if
you're like 16 well that's low but it's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
you're like 16 well that's low but it's
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.910
you're like 16 well that's low but it's
not catastrophic if you're like 40 and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920
not catastrophic if you're like 40 and
 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.010
not catastrophic if you're like 40 and
you're not depressed then 0th is you

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020
you're not depressed then 0th is you
 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.540
you're not depressed then 0th is you
know that's low anyways if you are that

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550
know that's low anyways if you are that
 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.220
know that's low anyways if you are that
low in conscientiousness one of the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230
low in conscientiousness one of the
 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.189
low in conscientiousness one of the
things I would recommend is a make a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
things I would recommend is a make a
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.430
things I would recommend is a make a

plan and B learn how to use a schedule a
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.500
plan and B learn how to use a schedule a
calendar and do it badly to begin with

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
calendar and do it badly to begin with
 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.119
calendar and do it badly to begin with
like an electronic calendar like Google

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
like an electronic calendar like Google
 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.039
like an electronic calendar like Google
Calendar that's the best thing I know of

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049
Calendar that's the best thing I know of
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.109
Calendar that's the best thing I know of
to improve conscientiousness make a plan

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119
to improve conscientiousness make a plan
 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.690
to improve conscientiousness make a plan
so that you've got something to aim at

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
so that you've got something to aim at
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.920
so that you've got something to aim at
and use a scheduler and maybe you have

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930
and use a scheduler and maybe you have
 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.160
and use a scheduler and maybe you have
to you know talk to someone to help keep

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
to you know talk to someone to help keep
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.440
to you know talk to someone to help keep
you on track now the other question

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450
you on track now the other question
 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.630
you on track now the other question
would be do you have other personality

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
would be do you have other personality
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.070
would be do you have other personality

openness because if you're really high
 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.940
openness because if you're really high
and openness then it might be that

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
and openness then it might be that
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.190
and openness then it might be that
you're more inclined towards being

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
