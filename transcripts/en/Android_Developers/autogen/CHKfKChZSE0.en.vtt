first let's talk about data connectivity

00:22:26.909 --> 00:22:26.919
first let's talk about data connectivity
 

00:22:26.919 --> 00:22:30.159
first let's talk about data connectivity
3G and LTE is growing around the world

00:22:30.159 --> 00:22:30.169
3G and LTE is growing around the world
 

00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:32.230
3G and LTE is growing around the world
and we're very happy for that

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240
and we're very happy for that
 

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.140
and we're very happy for that
and 80% of the smartphone's growth is in

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:35.150
and 80% of the smartphone's growth is in
 

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:38.770

be over a billion devices in 2020 so

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:42.710
be over a billion devices in 2020 so
 

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:45.820
be over a billion devices in 2020 so
therefore it's important to design apps

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:45.830
therefore it's important to design apps
 

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.830
therefore it's important to design apps
that can have those low inflation

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840

this week about this I'll refer to some
of them later remove code that you're

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:05.940
of them later remove code that you're
 

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.540
of them later remove code that you're
not using it's a simple talk but

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:08.550
not using it's a simple talk but
 

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.210
not using it's a simple talk but
important we are optimizing the kernel

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.220
important we are optimizing the kernel
 

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.490
important we are optimizing the kernel
to be much better of collecting these

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500
to be much better of collecting these
 

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.680
to be much better of collecting these
code pages but it's much easier if you

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:15.690
code pages but it's much easier if you
 

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.420
code pages but it's much easier if you
haven't allocated them from the start

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:17.430
haven't allocated them from the start
 

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:21.140
haven't allocated them from the start
and don't forget to optimize for the

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:21.150
and don't forget to optimize for the
 

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.510
and don't forget to optimize for the
smaller screens that's something we

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520
smaller screens that's something we
 

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.670
smaller screens that's something we
spend quite a lot of time on and I

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:25.680
spend quite a lot of time on and I
 

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.300
spend quite a lot of time on and I
strongly recommend you do the same and

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:28.310
strongly recommend you do the same and
 

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:31.430
strongly recommend you do the same and
you may want to use multi-decade to get

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440
you may want to use multi-decade to get
 

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.650
you may want to use multi-decade to get
better targeting around this so you can

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:33.660
better targeting around this so you can
 

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.880
better targeting around this so you can
target these devices specifically and

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:36.890
target these devices specifically and
 

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:39.110
target these devices specifically and
one of the torques I strongly recommend

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120
one of the torques I strongly recommend
 

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.420
one of the torques I strongly recommend
is engineering for high-performance with

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:41.430
is engineering for high-performance with
 

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.560
is engineering for high-performance with
tools that will sell this morning if I

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:44.570
tools that will sell this morning if I
 

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:50.540
tools that will sell this morning if I
remember correctly so we've implemented

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:50.550
remember correctly so we've implemented
 

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:53.240
remember correctly so we've implemented
a lot of new functionality in Android o

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:53.250
a lot of new functionality in Android o
 

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:56.900
a lot of new functionality in Android o
to help improve memory and battery like

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:56.910
to help improve memory and battery like
 

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:58.520
to help improve memory and battery like
background check that improves the

00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:58.530
background check that improves the
 

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.490
background check that improves the
system's ability to control and manage

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:01.500
system's ability to control and manage
 

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.630

under go we strongly recommend you to

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:16.470
under go we strongly recommend you to
 

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:20.180
under go we strongly recommend you to
target under the API level 26 I know

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:20.190
target under the API level 26 I know
 

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.340

this is very hard for existing

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:22.350
this is very hard for existing
 

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.830
this is very hard for existing
applications but it will give the user

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840
applications but it will give the user
 

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.230
applications but it will give the user
quite little benefits on this platform

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240
quite little benefits on this platform
 

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:34.370
quite little benefits on this platform
if you do so important to say is that

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:34.380
if you do so important to say is that
 

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.420
if you do so important to say is that
the changes I've been talking about is

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:37.430
the changes I've been talking about is
 

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:42.350
the changes I've been talking about is
really good even for existing apps today

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360
really good even for existing apps today
 

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.770
really good even for existing apps today
there is a lot of low entry devices out

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:45.780
there is a lot of low entry devices out
 

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.050
there is a lot of low entry devices out
there in the market as we speak and the

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:48.060
there in the market as we speak and the
 

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.570
there in the market as we speak and the
experience of them is quite poor assess

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:50.580
experience of them is quite poor assess
 

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.730
experience of them is quite poor assess
so this is something you really should

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:52.740
so this is something you really should
 

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.800
so this is something you really should
be thinking about today and the market

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:54.810
be thinking about today and the market
 

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.740
be thinking about today and the market
is just growing and having said that

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:57.750
is just growing and having said that
 

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.850
is just growing and having said that
we're planning to preview undergo in the

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860
we're planning to preview undergo in the
 

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.100
we're planning to preview undergo in the
end of this year and with the first

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:04.110
end of this year and with the first
 

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:07.880
end of this year and with the first
devices shipping first half of 2018

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:07.890
devices shipping first half of 2018
 

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.730
devices shipping first half of 2018
and you should start now and we're ready

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740
and you should start now and we're ready
 

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:15.440
and you should start now and we're ready
for undergo and that's it thank

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:15.450
for undergo and that's it thank
 

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.810
for undergo and that's it thank
