00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.660
There are many millions of asteroids in our
solar system.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.669
We've looked at them, flown by them, orbited
them, and even taken samples from them.

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:12.130
It's time to step up our game and STEAL ONE.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:19.480
Howdy space cowboys, Trace here for DNews,
and NASA reckons it's about time ta git Earthers

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.660
an asteroid of our very ownâ€¦ for study,
of course.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.660
Yeehaw!!

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.390
Asteroids are massive hulks of rock and metals
floating around the solar system.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.910
They're leftovers from the formation of planets
and moons, with the major concentration appearing

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.000
in the aptly-named Main Asteroid Belt between
Mars and Jupiter.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.829
The Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune also contains
millions of objects, but it's so far away

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.920
that it's not important for a retrieval mission.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.290
But look, if we want an asteroid for our very
own, how does one go about it?

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.000
First, you have to pick one to go get.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.791
Unlike how it looks in Estar Guars, asteroids
are not actually close together in the asteroid

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:58.791
belt.

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:02.860
We can't just fly over and survey the area
-- they're 1-3 million kilometers apart on

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.860
average!

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.820
NASA hasn't picked yet but hinted a good candidate
might be 2008 EV5.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.401
This asteroid mostly orbits between Earth
and Venus, so it's not too far to go, two

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:18.650
recent papers in Icarus studied its composition
and shape with various telescopes, and as

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.060
a type-C asteroid, we know it's carbonaceous,
rocky, and metallic!

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.479
NASA's plan is still under development, but
the mission, called ARM -- Asteroid Redirect

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.150
Mission is pretty simple.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.450
A robot would fly up to 2008 EV5 and land
on the asteroid, analyze the surface, and

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.430
(in the greatest space-heist in NASA history)
will grab a "multi-ton" boulder (like the

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.150
crappy crane-game at an arcade) and skeddle!

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.490
Once back in orbit around EV5 with boulder
on lock, the ARM robot will test a gravity

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.800
tractor theory.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.340
Basically, because gravity exists everywhere,
the mass of the robot plus boulder would attract

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.820
2008 EV5 and slowly bend its orbit -- keep
that in mind, we'll come back to it.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.900
After a few tests, the robot will high-tail
it back to drop off the boulder in the moon's

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.240
orbit for study.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.409
Once it's there, we can use the new SLS and
Orion spacecraft to practice landing on it,

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.680
taking off, and eventually could send people
to spacewalk on it!

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.540
All in preparation and practice for future
Mars missions.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.480
Sidebar: ARM will also use a new solar electric
propulsion system too.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.280
(It uses solar panels to gather energy, then
shoots ions out a nozzle slowly accelerating.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.040
Really slowly.)

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.540
Grabbing an asteroid might just seem like
bragging rights, but there's more than just

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.159
learning how to do it.

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.840
The Apollo, Shuttle and International Space
Station missions are all "Earth Reliant."

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.250
Meaning, they need Earth to resupply, and
can only last a few days to a few months on

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.250
their own.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.900
If we could head to Mars from an asteroid
and not Earth's surface, it would save incredible

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.459
amounts of fuel, and allow for longer missions
into deep space!

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.499
Plus, a human-explored asteroid could tell
us a LOT about the formation of the solar

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:00.599
system, what kind of minerals existed at the
time, and could provide a source of commercial

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.620
mining that avoids the destruction of our
own planet's resources.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.269
And on a darker note, testing the gravity
tractor to tug it off course is reallllllly

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.299
important,because one is coming.

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.329
Not right now, but it's a statistical inevitability
-- it's happened many times in the past and

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.920
will in the future.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.120
An asteroid will eventually aim for Earth.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.580
So, to get ready for an asteroid impact eventuality,
we'll need to understand the threat, but also

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.150
be prepped for a response.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.989
Blowing it up ain't really a good idea (sorry
Bruce), but tugging it out of an intersecting

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:33.989
orbit?

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:34.989
Maybe...

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:35.989
? Not as sexy, but better.

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.700
Funnily enough, NASA and FEMA are already
practicing in the case of an asteroid impact.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.090
The two agencies recently held their third
emergency planning session for possible asteroid

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.090
impact.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.209
They want to suss out how government agencies
could handle this kind of natural disaster,

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.010
because unlike say, a hurricane, earthquake
or epidemic that strikes without warning -- asteroids

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.629
are a slow burn; we can know months before
it hits!

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.989
And once impact reaches 100-percent certainty...
aside from societal breakdown, what would

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:02.989
we do?

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.090
Such an interesting thought-experiment.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.139
Guys, if you love space and you probably do
cause you're watching this, check out Seeker

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.139
VR.

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.079
We sent a weather balloon to the edge of Earth,
it's in VR, it's super cool.

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.239
And if you're wondering why we don't just
use tractor beams to move asteroids around,

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:28.199
well, it's because we've only invented a couple.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.270
Let us know down in the comments if you have
any ideas of what you would do if you found

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.979
out an asteroid was coming and you only had
6 months and make sure you subscribe for more
