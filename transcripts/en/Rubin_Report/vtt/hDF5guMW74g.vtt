[inaudible]

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.031
<v 1>a priest,</v>

3
00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:09.770
a rabbi in a comedian walk into a youtube studio that was once a garage.

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.730
Bishop Robert Barron,
Rabbi David Wolpe.
Good to have you guys here.

5
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.653
Good to be here.

6
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.800
I'm very happy to be doing this because we are smack in between Hanukkah and

7
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:19.634
Christmas.

8
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.840
So it seemed like the right time to get you two together and I had you both on

9
00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:27.470
the show individually and enjoyed the very much and I thought let's have a,

10
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.520
let's have a conversation about religion and meeting and good social media and

11
00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:34.490
all sorts of other things.
So first,
um,

12
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.720
I thought we just talk a little bit about the way that people are talking about

13
00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:39.740
religion these days.

14
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:44.390
I know that you both saw at least a portion of my chat from a couple of weeks

15
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.740
ago with Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro.
Uh,
Ben is obviously Orthodox Jew.

16
00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:52.790
Jordan comes through things through a Christian perspective.
Um,

17
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.590
the idea though that people,

18
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.600
that the average people out there aren't necessarily getting the messages that

19
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:03.770
you guys talk about in the traditional way and that they're getting them in

20
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:06.320
through youtube videos and podcasts and things like that.

21
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.680
W W what do you make of that?
You know,
I'm pretty good with it actually.

22
00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:12.350
I think it's a sign of our time and it's the way people communicate.

23
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:14.560
And so those two gentlemen have found a way,
you know,

24
00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:18.740
cause you have to use the social media very creatively and if they can

25
00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:21.560
communicate some of the truth of religion,
why not?

26
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.860
And also I think with especially Jordan Peterson in mind,

27
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.110
it's a smart presentation of religious themes and speaking on my own tradition,

28
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.560
you know,
after Vatican two we kind of dumb things down,

29
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.470
which I think has been a pastoral disaster actually.

30
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.720
And one reason we've lost why young people,

31
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.490
we presented Catholicism of very flat secularized,
unintelligent way.

32
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.530
And Jordan Peterson is presenting,
you know,
at least a version of religion,

33
00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:51.710
a version of,
of biblical interpretation in a very compelling,

34
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:55.460
very intelligent way.
And look how young people are responding to it.
Like mad.

35
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.790
I think that's a very hopeful sign.
Yeah.
What do you think?

36
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.190
I think that the twist is that,
you know,

37
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.360
we were talking right before the show started about people that have debated and

38
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.610
the Harrises to some extent,
but much more the Hitchens of blessed memory,

39
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.030
um,
and,
and others would take,
would take religion,

40
00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:18.950
Richard Dawkins and say it is this collection of ridiculous dogmas and,

41
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.800
and nothing worthwhile and anything that is worthwhile in it,

42
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.960
we have in the second the world better.
And the counter argument used to be,
well,

43
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.110
you don't necessarily have to buy all of religion to realize that the themes are

44
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:32.840
deep and complicated and inspiring and beautiful.

45
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.610
And I think that they're being framed to that way.
I mean,
I don't know.

46
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.020
I'm not sure.
You know,

47
00:02:39.021 --> 00:02:42.290
I'm not sure he knows what exactly Peterson's religious commitment is.

48
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.580
But one thing that is clear is that he and many of the people who listened to

49
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:50.450
him and follow him take religious themes,
ideas,

50
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.720
and sometimes even scriptural stories as indicative of something deeper about

51
00:02:56.721 --> 00:03:00.040
the nature of the world.
Do you think that's enough?
I mean,

52
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.570
as I'm out for one enough for,
for just a human,

53
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:06.310
not just someone that's publicly talking about this,

54
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:11.311
but is that rich enough to just take the songs and the stories without perhaps

55
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.160
some of the mighty,

56
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.380
my principle concern as somebody who's associated with institutional religion,

57
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:22.381
which is like anathema to many people is when someone tells me for example that

58
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:25.000
they are spiritual but not religious.

59
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:27.220
What I always want to say to them is how much do you give to charity?

60
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.090
Because to have your own life enriched,

61
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:34.300
but for it not to be expressed in conduct is not enough.

62
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.680
So the question that I would always have is in what way does it influence the

63
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:41.830
way you treat other human beings?
How charitable you are,

64
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.180
whether you are part of a community and you both take from that community but

65
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:49.390
also contribute to it.
If it does all of those things,

66
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:52.360
then I'm much more persuaded that it's effective.

67
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.960
If all it does is get you to attend the lecture,
read a book,

68
00:03:55.961 --> 00:04:00.100
and feel like you've been elevated,
then it's not enough.
Yeah,

69
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.260
I suspect you probably agree with the premise there.
Yeah.
It's not enough.
I mean,

70
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:06.930
I think it's a good starting point.
Uh,

71
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.840
to me what Jordan Peterson does with the Bible is similar to what the church

72
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:14.380
fathers in our tradition quoted call the moral sense of,
of the scripture.

73
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.770
So you look at the Bible a number of ways and one is to uncover it's,

74
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.700
it's important for moral behavior.
We might say today for our psychology,

75
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.530
you know,
good,
wonderful.

76
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:25.930
But then there's a lot of other dimensions to read the Bible.

77
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.580
The Bible makes certain objective claims about God and it tastes the New

78
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.340
Testament about Jesus,
about eternal life.
You know,

79
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.120
and I think that's not touched on so much by Jordan Peterson.
Now again,

80
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:38.090
I don't want to bad mouth.

81
00:04:38.091 --> 00:04:40.780
I think it's a very good starting point for a lot of people.
It's a way in,

82
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.730
why not begin with the moral psychological sense.
But then I'd say,
keep going.

83
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.640
You know?
And finally you do have to make metaphysical claims.

84
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:50.380
It seems to me in in the religious realm,

85
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:53.770
you can't simply leave it at the level of subjective appropriation.

86
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:56.440
You have to say,
is it true that God exists?

87
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.310
Is it true that God's the creator of all things?
And in the case of Christianity,

88
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:04.120
is it true that the God sent his only son that we might have life in his name?

89
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.730
So you have to wrestle with those metaphysical issues.

90
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.300
But I'm flying with him as a,
as a opening of a door,
you know?

91
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.280
So it's so interesting to me that people actually care about a debate about the

92
00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:16.660
nature of truth.
You know,

93
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:19.740
it's like we live in a time when everyone's on Twitter all day,

94
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:22.690
where we can be distracted by video games and a kajillion other things.

95
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.620
And yet somehow through that,
you know,

96
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.320
that video that we did has over a million views already in a couple hundred

97
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.940
thousand on the,
on the audio podcast.

98
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.940
And it's a two hour conversation about these things.

99
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.020
So one of the things that we really focused on was the sort of,

100
00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:42.970
what I think they would both argue are the bedrock values of the Judeo Christian

101
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:45.550
society.
So when someone says that to you,

102
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.160
since I have someone from the Judeo Christian part here,

103
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.720
what does that actually mean to you?

104
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:52.750
When someone says the values of the Judeo Christian society?

105
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.120
I think deep respect for the dignity of the,

106
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.980
of the individual made in the image of likeness of God,
the

107
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.190
<v 2>call to justice,
the culture piece,
the cult to nonviolence,</v>

108
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:06.191
the call to love the call of compassion and see all that is the great trajectory

109
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:07.820
of the biblical revelation.
You know,

110
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.380
those are the behavioral implications of the more profound metaphysical claims.

111
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.790
But I'd see all that we have very much in common.

112
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.680
Anyone in a biblical frame of mind,
we'd see those things.
Yeah,

113
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.330
I completely agree.

114
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:24.200
And I think that the implication of the second half of what the Bishop was

115
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:28.760
saying is that there is,
and this is one of the reasons I think why,

116
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.840
why Ben and Jordan communicate so effectively as they agree about this,

117
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.560
that truth is not actually the truth is a objective concept that exists as

118
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:44.090
opposed to something that's entirely the invention of human beings in a relative

119
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:45.800
sense.
And depending on time and place.

120
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.290
And that doesn't mean that you have easy access to it.

121
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.480
And you may never in fact understand it,

122
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.610
but even the statement that there is such a thing as a truth is in our time

123
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:56.810
somewhat countercultural.

124
00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.490
<v 3>So one of the things that we talked about was,</v>

125
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.380
this has been argued by many people,

126
00:07:01.381 --> 00:07:03.480
but Jordan in that conversation was talking about it.

127
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.670
That there's a sense right now that all the good ideas of the world of freedom

128
00:07:08.671 --> 00:07:12.050
and the individual and all of those things came from the enlightenment and

129
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.980
enlightenment guy who can go into my room over there,

130
00:07:13.981 --> 00:07:16.010
every book that's from an enlightenment thinkers.

131
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:19.800
Some of these books right here are,
um,
but as a guy who's debated,

132
00:07:19.801 --> 00:07:21.960
some of the people that have written some of these books that have been in this

133
00:07:21.961 --> 00:07:26.670
room,
I suspect you would argue that,
that the enlightenment values alone,

134
00:07:26.671 --> 00:07:31.590
which I suppose you hold many of sure weren't,
weren't enough.

135
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.513
Right?
Is that

136
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.080
<v 2>fair?
I would say first of all,</v>

137
00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:39.081
they have more religious roots then the radical enlightenment theorists admit

138
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.010
to.
Yeah.
Can,
can you explain that a little bit?
Sure.
I mean,
when you talk about,

139
00:07:44.011 --> 00:07:47.340
for example,
the dignity of the individual,
which is very much an enlightenment,

140
00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:51.540
I did well the first statement about human nature and the Bible is that a human

141
00:07:51.541 --> 00:07:56.460
being's created in the image of God.
So,
I mean,
I hate to say for every good I,

142
00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:01.200
oh,
we had at first,
but we clearly have that first.
Um,
we being,

143
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.740
you know,
anybody who associate themselves with this tradition,

144
00:08:04.741 --> 00:08:09.630
and also by the way,
to be fair,
you know,
I've traveled in the east,

145
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.440
you find many of these ideas in places where the enlightenment never took hold.

146
00:08:13.441 --> 00:08:17.490
So to,
to argue like Jonathan Israel does,
who's at an enlightenment historian,

147
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.940
that these are all legacies of the enlightenment.
Well,
what about India?

148
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:25.470
What about,
you know,
Southeast Asia where many of these ideas also have currency,

149
00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:27.540
although in different form.
Um,

150
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.010
and the second part of it is that the enlightenment,
um,
you know,

151
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.440
the enlightenment was a,
was a mixed bag.

152
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.970
The French revolution was a horrible bloodbath just as Burke had predicted it

153
00:08:38.971 --> 00:08:39.804
would be.
Um,

154
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.840
and part of it was because the enlightenment was not so much about many of the

155
00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:51.510
values that I think we are rediscovering of community,
charity,

156
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:56.340
mutual interdependence that are,
that are much associated with religious

157
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.390
<v 1>communal work than they are with enlightenment ideas.
Yeah.</v>

158
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.080
The underpinning part,
I think you certainly agree with anything else.

159
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:06.240
So it's very close to my own perspective on it.
You know,

160
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.010
part of the problem is you say the enlightenment,

161
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.300
well of course who is against light.
Everyone wants light,
but the emphasis,

162
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.330
the implication is,
well,

163
00:09:13.331 --> 00:09:15.840
prior to that must've been just those terrible dark ages.

164
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.780
That's all a distortion because you're,
you're dead,
right?
I mean,

165
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.280
I'd say the best of the enlightenment was a sort of,
um,

166
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.520
re presentation of key ideas out of the great biblical tradition.

167
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.580
So human dignity is one.
But think of,
you know,
Jefferson,

168
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:33.390
we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal.

169
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.410
Because look in classical political philosophy,
equality is not a huge value.

170
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.810
In fact,
in Plato and Aristotle,
Cicero,

171
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:44.070
people like that inequality is fundamental and the rightly ordered society,

172
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.620
you know,
it takes into account all these deep inequalities.

173
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.300
Where's the idea come from?
How come it's totally non self evident to Aristotle,

174
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:55.320
but it's totally self evident to Jefferson what intervened in there.
But,

175
00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.120
but the Judeo Christian revelation,
you know,
um,
freedom,
equality,

176
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:03.840
human rights,
they're endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.

177
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.470
So that to me is the,
uh,
the aftereffects of,

178
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:12.120
of Christian and Jewish revelation.
That's the best of the enlightenment.

179
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:16.090
And then the alignment does carry a dark side,
excuse the,
you know,

180
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.090
mixing metaphors.
But,
um,
it does,
uh,

181
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.780
hyperindividualism a hyper rationalism,

182
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.070
a certain closing in upon a purely scientific view of the world.

183
00:10:26.071 --> 00:10:30.090
All of that is the dark side of the enlightenment.
So I would just look at it,

184
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:33.450
you know,
critically appreciating huge elements of it,

185
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.390
which I think fundamentally are grounded in the scripture.

186
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.880
And then being wary of certain,
you know,

187
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.480
negative qualities of it says maybe there's a little disagreement there just

188
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:46.890
because of the way choose generally have viewed science perhaps a little bit

189
00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:48.240
differently.
Like,

190
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.370
well the hyper hyper scientific view of the world usually doesn't become in

191
00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:58.290
conflict [inaudible] depends on age of really just use no,
I think for example,

192
00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:02.400
I mean the vast majority of Jews,
even religious Jews don't find evolution to be,

193
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.720
but that's today don't find evolution to be in conflict with the Bible,

194
00:11:06.721 --> 00:11:09.390
although some would but not,
but fewer.

195
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:14.060
And I think that Judaism is hospitable to science as a general rule.
Um,

196
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.770
what I would say though,

197
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.820
it emerges from the discussion is what you started with,

198
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.480
which is why is it that people are hospitable to these sorts of discussions?

199
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:29.481
Now the answer is because we have a world in which human power is magnified far

200
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:35.070
beyond anything we ever could have imagined before.
It to cure disease to,

201
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.130
I mean it's like I,
you know,
when I was in high school,

202
00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:41.190
I was a pretty avid atheist and I read,

203
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.030
I memorize most of Bertrand Russell and I remember Russell writing and one of

204
00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:48.420
his books people used to say that faith moved mountains and no one believed it.

205
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.120
Now they say the Adam mom moves mountains in,
everyone believes it.

206
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.040
And that was the hyper scientific view.
Well

207
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.300
<v 2>now we have a world in which you can manipulate genes,
you can,</v>

208
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:03.070
artificial intelligence is doing increasingly remarkable things and I think

209
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.900
people are recognizing,
not only recognizing,
but they're feeling on a gut level.

210
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:10.720
If we don't know what our first principles are,

211
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.800
this genie out of the bottle is going to destroy us.

212
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:18.550
So you don't fear a hyper scientific world as long as it comes within the

213
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:22.240
context.
I fear like,
like every per,

214
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.210
I almost want to rope in every thoughtful person.

215
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.600
I fear our information outrunning our wisdom.
Yes.

216
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.110
But as long as it doesn't,
then I don't fear it.

217
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.510
<v 4>And that's closely my own view about a scientism.</v>

218
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:40.190
I'm all in favor of the sciences and I always try to celebrate the fact that,

219
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:40.670
you know,

220
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.450
is yours live metro a priest formulated the Big Bang theory of cosmic origins.

221
00:12:44.451 --> 00:12:47.790
I mean,
so the myth that the Catholic Church stands against the sciences.

222
00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.290
Just that it's a myth.
Mendel.
Yeah,
right.
I mean there's so many people,

223
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.890
Copernicus himself,
you know,
but um,

224
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:58.310
scientism is the reduction of all knowledge to the scientific form of knowledge.

225
00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.020
And that is a dark side of the enlightenment.

226
00:13:00.021 --> 00:13:03.350
If you say that's the sum total of what we can know legitimately,

227
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:08.450
we know through the scientific method when in fact literature,
the Bible,

228
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:12.280
drama,
poetry,
a philosophy,
all that is,

229
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:15.290
is a bearer of wisdom.
But it's not scientific.

230
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.190
But I find dealing with the young people today,
the scientism is rampant.

231
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:24.170
So the binary option is science or nonsense.
Religion,

232
00:13:24.171 --> 00:13:27.740
clearly not science.
Therefore now read Hitchens,
Dawkins and company,

233
00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:29.750
you find that binary choice.

234
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.500
So I want to fight in favor of other ways of knowing that are not scientific.

235
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.110
<v 2>Do you both sense that the resurgence of these ideas and the and the starvation</v>

236
00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:42.640
to just hear people talk about these things honestly is also sort of a failure

237
00:13:42.641 --> 00:13:45.610
of the secular world.
I asked and in Jordan this,

238
00:13:45.611 --> 00:13:47.590
and I hate the question because I,

239
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.950
I believe so much in the secular world and I,

240
00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:54.850
and I love secular ideas that,
that free us in all of these things,

241
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:55.960
but that sort of,

242
00:13:55.961 --> 00:13:59.290
there's a feeling right now and I think it has something to do with social media

243
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.580
and that our public squares have become sort of,
they're open,
which is great,

244
00:14:03.581 --> 00:14:08.140
but then I've also become forums for hysteria and fake news and all of these

245
00:14:08.141 --> 00:14:11.620
things that it's a sort of failure of the secular world.

246
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.660
I go ahead please.
I'm yes,
I'm not sure which world hasn't failed,

247
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.200
but the secular world certainly has and it hasn't parked because of exactly what

248
00:14:20.201 --> 00:14:21.034
we've been saying,

249
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.070
which is once again removed first principles from the discussion.

250
00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:25.870
What's the only thing you can be certain?
Tough.

251
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.660
The only thing you can be certain of is your own emotional reaction.

252
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:34.060
That bothers me.
Therefore,
it's bad.
And so what you get is,
as you said,

253
00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:36.640
this hyper hysterical reaction,

254
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.150
everybody as a group to be offended because I,

255
00:14:40.151 --> 00:14:44.740
this is what I feel and the idea that we can share principles and discuss them

256
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.170
has sort of disappeared.

257
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.170
Scholasticism Tom Jurich argument that things like we made our,
you know,

258
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.010
we cut our

259
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.700
<v 1>teeth on,</v>

260
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.530
they don't exist because there's no shared space in which we can all agree about

261
00:14:57.531 --> 00:15:02.470
the same thing,
which is why because culture and,
and uh,

262
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:06.600
literature and music,
all of them are not shared.
They're all bulkinized.

263
00:15:06.601 --> 00:15:11.390
And the only thing that we all share as politics,
so everything gets politicized.

264
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:15.740
So that's exactly what my next question was going to be,
which is our politics,

265
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:20.160
our new religion and how actually dangerous is that.
Yeah,
super dangerous.
I mean,

266
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.310
I would say with Paul Tillich who said,
you know,

267
00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:25.010
religion is your ultimate concerns.
So everyone's got a religion.

268
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.820
Meaning there's something that's an ultimate value to you or put in Biblical

269
00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:32.720
language,
something that you worship,
you know,
worship comes from worth ship.

270
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.580
What's the highest worth to you?

271
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.820
And you can until said all you need to know about a person,

272
00:15:37.821 --> 00:15:40.700
you can find out by asking you one question,
what do you worship?

273
00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.040
And that's definitely right.
It seems to me,
I mean,

274
00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:47.660
what's the highest value to you when it's not God,
then we get mischief.

275
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.400
So put whatever you want in their place.

276
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:53.090
Science or politics or culture or the president or whatever.

277
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.180
Trouble Bible calls that idolatry by the way,
you know,

278
00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:00.170
so that diagnosis is still all together valid and yes,

279
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:04.280
if politics becomes your ultimate concern,
that's going to be bad for you,

280
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.360
for everyone in the conversation and for politics.
Politics will become corrupt.

281
00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:11.540
You know that that sort of explains the political situation we're in right now.

282
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.300
It does in many ways,
right?
And so that's,
that's the trouble.

283
00:16:14.301 --> 00:16:19.040
See with a secularism that creates what Charles Taylor called the buffered self,

284
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.130
the self that's in this little self contained place,

285
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:26.420
buffered from any contact with the transcendent that becomes suffocating.

286
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.000
And there's another shadow side.
If you want a hyper,

287
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:32.300
rationalistic view of the world.
Would you both argue that,

288
00:16:32.301 --> 00:16:36.330
and I think I probably asked you about this individually,
uh,
but I'm,

289
00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.500
I'm sort of struggling with this one.
This has been where I'm at lately,

290
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.200
that on a micro level,
on a personal level,

291
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.060
say a Michael Shermer right here or Sam Harris right here could be absolutely

292
00:16:47.061 --> 00:16:52.061
moral and decent and give to charity and live full rich lives that are every bit

293
00:16:53.691 --> 00:16:56.660
as meaningful as,
as any any believer,

294
00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.930
but that perhaps at the macro level that simply can't,

295
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.150
I think Sam is a good example,

296
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:06.170
I assume takes his morality extremely seriously as you know.
Um,

297
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:11.030
and,
and what I would say is that the,
there is,

298
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:16.060
there is what the mid 20th century Jewish philosopher will Herbert called cut

299
00:17:16.851 --> 00:17:20.660
flower ethics.
Yeah.
He said they stay fresh for a while,

300
00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.440
but the question is without the soil that nurtured them,
how long does that stay?

301
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:25.970
And so yeah,

302
00:17:25.971 --> 00:17:30.971
you can get individual growths that are as beautiful as any growths that ever

303
00:17:31.461 --> 00:17:35.150
existed.
But the question is transmissibility and,

304
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.870
and the thickness of the culture in which,
you know,

305
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.300
I mean if you look around the western world,

306
00:17:41.301 --> 00:17:46.160
I think there's a lot of evidence that in fact ethics aren't that effectively

307
00:17:46.161 --> 00:17:46.851
transmitted.

308
00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:51.390
And part of the reason is because there used no soil,

309
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:54.360
there is no grounding,
there is no certainty.
If you,

310
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:58.290
for even wanting to introduce ethical education into school systems,

311
00:17:58.291 --> 00:18:02.460
people would scream and yet without ethical education,

312
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:07.000
all the other things are imperiled.
So can,

313
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.110
I was helpful.
I've used that image before.
It never knowing where it came from.

314
00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.740
Cut Flowers thing because it's really good,
you know,
for awhile.
Oh sure.

315
00:18:13.741 --> 00:18:17.010
The country is kind of going on the fumes of,
of a real d system,

316
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:19.620
but if you take those flowers out of the ground,
they are going to fade.

317
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:23.040
So that's who was that again?
We'll Herbert Protestant,

318
00:18:23.041 --> 00:18:26.650
Catholic Jew help us right away.
A century.
That's right.
Yeah.
I know.

319
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.030
That's where it came from.
The way I would also say that that idea,

320
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.760
and I think again,
I'm sure that the,
I'm sure that the bishop,

321
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.790
I suspect the fishing poles agree with me,
I'm going to get to some days,
right,

322
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.700
is that religion doesn't mean that you have to walk into my synagogue.

323
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.470
Um,
you should,
but it doesn't mean that you have to,
right?
No,
but seriously,

324
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:51.240
religion has reinvented it all sorts of ways.
I mean,
um,
my,

325
00:18:51.241 --> 00:18:55.040
uh,
my niece's husband is one of the one,

326
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.640
one of the people high up in burning man and there's a lot that goes on there

327
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.320
that has a serious,

328
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.880
like a serious religious component even though they may not call it religion.

329
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:10.680
The question is can society reinvent religion or take from religion and

330
00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:14.160
reconfigure it in ways that are enduring and lasting and meaningful?

331
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.300
It doesn't have to be at the small Oh,
orthodoxy.

332
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.250
So I got a good philosophical one for it.

333
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.580
If somebody could come up with that,

334
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.070
would you guys be against it?

335
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.420
If someone could come up with that bedrock that would allow those fresh cut

336
00:19:30.421 --> 00:19:33.570
flowers to stay and stay and say a new version of all of this,

337
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.600
would it be felt more contemporary or something like that.
But,
and it,

338
00:19:37.601 --> 00:19:41.630
and it gave all of the answers that you are at this,

339
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:42.700
the,

340
00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:47.700
here you may come across a disagreement because Judaism is not solely morals and

341
00:19:47.821 --> 00:19:52.020
behaviors that tell us what people in a history and a land and a language and

342
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:52.860
lots of other things,

343
00:19:52.861 --> 00:19:56.400
and that is not going to get replaced by somebody coming up with an ethical

344
00:19:56.401 --> 00:19:59.640
system.
Right?
So then when I've seen the ground finally is God,
you know,

345
00:19:59.641 --> 00:20:01.080
so called God what you want.
I mean,

346
00:20:01.081 --> 00:20:05.190
that's the unconditioned of the unconditioned.
True,
good and beautiful.

347
00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:09.600
That's God.
And that's the ground for these great ethical commitments.
I used to,

348
00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:11.100
I never met Christopher Hitchens put,
you know,

349
00:20:11.101 --> 00:20:15.690
I read them and watched him carefully and I was always struck by the intensity

350
00:20:15.691 --> 00:20:17.700
of his ethical commitments was to me,

351
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:21.090
seemed incoherent in light of a completely atheist view of the world.

352
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:26.220
But there was a Jeremiah like passion for ethical and I would say,

353
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.680
look,
that's it.
That's the door in.
If you want,

354
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.770
you can do cosmological type arguments.

355
00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:32.610
That's had very little traction with Hitchens.

356
00:20:32.611 --> 00:20:37.560
But my way in for him was follow your own ethical passion.
You're going to come.

357
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:40.920
Finally.
What I mean by God,
which is the unconditioned good.

358
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.060
You don't want just any old justice.
You want justice all the time.

359
00:20:45.061 --> 00:20:48.130
You want justice in every way you want.
You want justice to fill

360
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.160
<v 4>the whole earth.
You know,
that's a hunger and thirst for God.</v>

361
00:20:51.161 --> 00:20:56.110
I think one of prophetic got there at the end.
What is the right answer is,

362
00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:58.780
is that they're already there.
So he's not that.
They're trying to get there.

363
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:03.190
You've already been seized by God.
If you've got that passion for justice,

364
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.580
that's God already working in you.
You know?

365
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.010
So it's not so much the quest for God out there,

366
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:13.240
but God's already grasped you at the root of your being and filled you with this

367
00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:17.180
prophetic passion.
So I would say in a way he's,
he's already been found,
you know?

368
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.330
<v 2>So let's get to some of the differences here.</v>

369
00:21:21.331 --> 00:21:23.930
So we're talking about Judeo Christian values.
Yeah.

370
00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.450
But those are not exactly the same thing.

371
00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.480
So what maybe each of you could pick perhaps one thing now I guess Judaism came

372
00:21:32.971 --> 00:21:37.950
first,
not I guess,
but Judaism,
Christianity differ,

373
00:21:37.951 --> 00:21:41.970
which is in vicarious atonement and the Jewish tradition,

374
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.600
if you don't make reparations to the person whom you've heard,

375
00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:49.580
God can't forgive you.
That's a big difference.
I mean,
I'm,

376
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:54.390
this was illustrated most famously,
not exclusively,
but most famously,

377
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:58.740
um,
when one of the prosecutors at Nurenberg asked the priest,

378
00:21:58.741 --> 00:22:00.630
does that mean that if,

379
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:04.350
say I human repented on his deathbed and accepted Jesus,

380
00:22:04.351 --> 00:22:08.550
he would be forgiven and saved.
But Anne Frank would go to hell.

381
00:22:08.551 --> 00:22:12.930
And the priest said,
that's the mystery of grace.
That's a difference.

382
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:14.310
Mm hmm.

383
00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.240
<v 4>If I were to name a difference,
uh,
it's,
it's Christ.
There's the difference.</v>

384
00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.160
So I will not reduce things to ethics.

385
00:22:22.161 --> 00:22:24.470
We find all kinds of common ground when it comes to ethics.

386
00:22:24.471 --> 00:22:28.220
But I'd resist the Conti and move to reduce religion to ethics.
I mean,

387
00:22:28.221 --> 00:22:32.680
that's a dimension of it.
It's a,
it's a consequence of it.
The difference is,

388
00:22:32.681 --> 00:22:33.750
is Jesus,
you know,

389
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:38.540
Jesus means the coming together of divinity and humanity in such a way that

390
00:22:38.541 --> 00:22:42.470
humanity is transfigured and brought up into a share in the divine life.

391
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.430
And that's the mystical heart of Christianity from that flows all kinds of

392
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:51.400
ethical implications.
But that's the central mystery I think is,
uh,

393
00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.860
divinization.
The Greek fathers called theosis,

394
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.880
the Latins called DF fecaccio that God became one of us,

395
00:22:58.881 --> 00:23:01.620
that we might become a share in his own life.
And the Jews call it

396
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:02.483
<v 2>false.</v>

397
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:08.400
That's why that's why to call someone a Jew for Jesus is,
is an oxymoron.

398
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:13.650
Because that was actually the critical dividing line between Jews and Christians

399
00:23:13.651 --> 00:23:18.230
was the acceptance of Jesus as divine or the son of God or the Messiah.
So,

400
00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.570
so what do you see,
you sort of wrong isn't the right term,

401
00:23:21.571 --> 00:23:26.571
but where do you see as conflicting with your values are conflicting with Jewish

402
00:23:26.971 --> 00:23:30.180
values?
So first of all,
a human being doesn't become God.

403
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.870
And the Jewish tradition,
God is transcendent and the imminent,

404
00:23:33.871 --> 00:23:36.960
but always the intangible.
And that does not take human form,

405
00:23:36.961 --> 00:23:40.530
never took human form.
Um,
and uh,

406
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.800
also even though Christianity talks about three and one and one and three,

407
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.370
<v 1>I remember when I was in high school and we had a,</v>

408
00:23:48.371 --> 00:23:51.350
a baptist preacher come to our high school and told us,
you know,

409
00:23:51.351 --> 00:23:54.650
you seem like nice boys and girls,
but you're all going to hell.
Um,

410
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.800
and I asked him,
I said,
well,
if something is perfect,

411
00:23:57.801 --> 00:24:01.430
it doesn't need anything added to it.
So as the father,
perfect.
And he said yes.

412
00:24:01.431 --> 00:24:05.980
And I said,
we're done.
We're grinding,
we're done.
We don't eat anything else.
Um,

413
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.990
that's,
I mean that's been the Jewish view and,
but I,

414
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:13.250
but I also want to say this is an argument that has gone on for thousands of

415
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.230
years and every now and then I'll get someone on my Facebook and say,

416
00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.780
what about this verse?
And I'll think really,
really well.
That's why,
you know,

417
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.800
it's almost,
it almost feels a little silly for me to frame a question like that,

418
00:24:21.801 --> 00:24:22.634
but I know,

419
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.410
I know that people watching don't want you guys to sit here and sort of agree on

420
00:24:26.411 --> 00:24:29.210
every shirt though you disagree on the margins or are you just,

421
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.210
are people of different faiths and that's just fine.

422
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.770
But I think there's always like this feeling of like a list.

423
00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.870
There's some core thing that is not argued about that,

424
00:24:38.871 --> 00:24:39.800
that we're missing something.
I don't know.

425
00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:42.950
I like religious argument and to do it publicly as a good thing.
Yeah.

426
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.010
And like I found it,
I've been involved in many,

427
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.290
we're putting this on youtube and the commenters are very tiny.
Oh,
believe me.

428
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.210
Uh,
but I've been involved a lot of Catholic Jewish dialogues over the years.

429
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.210
We hardly ever mentioned the j word by which I mean Jesus.

430
00:24:56.390 --> 00:25:00.200
So we tend to say it's great that we're nice to each other and we've overcome

431
00:25:00.201 --> 00:25:04.340
these old,
you know,
animosities and we stand for the great ethical principles,

432
00:25:04.341 --> 00:25:07.610
which is great and true.
And I never ever want to go back behind it.

433
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.610
But I would say,
well now what about Jesus?
Let's talk about Jesus.

434
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.000
And then people get very squirrely.
Now I certainly understand,

435
00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:17.420
given our rather regrettable history on this thing,
you know,

436
00:25:17.421 --> 00:25:20.930
that we're always worried about religious violence.
I get it.
At the same time,

437
00:25:20.931 --> 00:25:21.381
I think it's,

438
00:25:21.381 --> 00:25:26.381
it's a does it around them that we'd find a way to have a respectful and

439
00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:30.920
nonviolent argument because I think argument is a good thing.

440
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:34.130
And as you say,
quite rightly,
that doesn't bother me.
The rabbinic tradition,

441
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.500
the scholastic tradition,
they long arguments.

442
00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.780
Thomas Aquinas argues with everybody.

443
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.240
There's something very Talmudic about Thomas Aquinas.

444
00:25:41.241 --> 00:25:44.570
And I think that's a great thing that we need to recover it.

445
00:25:44.571 --> 00:25:47.120
There's something very urban about acquaintance.
You know,
he,
uh,

446
00:25:47.121 --> 00:25:49.370
theology had moved out of the monasteries into the cities,

447
00:25:49.371 --> 00:25:52.730
into places like Paris and there's a lot of different points of view and people

448
00:25:52.731 --> 00:25:53.690
shouting things from the,

449
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:58.490
from the floor and his writings reflect that lively sort of conversation.

450
00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.220
I like that.
I think that's a healthy thing,
you know?
Well,

451
00:26:01.221 --> 00:26:04.190
I think that partly explains what's happening on Youtube these days with

452
00:26:04.191 --> 00:26:04.940
conversation.

453
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.480
I mean that's what brought you guys here and the fascination with religion.

454
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.040
Now it's often done poorly.

455
00:26:10.041 --> 00:26:13.040
God knows there's people often just sharing a lot of strong feelings,

456
00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:17.780
but I liked the fact there's obviously great interest in religion.
Yeah.

457
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.430
So I thought this would be interesting.

458
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.160
I know you can't obviously tell me what you are,

459
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.010
the people of your congregation are coming to you with privately,

460
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.480
but I wonder if there's general trends that maybe are the same or different that

461
00:26:29.481 --> 00:26:30.560
you both are hearing about.

462
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:34.490
So I wonder if you could sort of tell me just a general trend of the type of

463
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:39.140
things that people are struggling with right now.
Sure.
I would say any,

464
00:26:39.141 --> 00:26:41.690
have you seen that change or let's say 20 years?

465
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:47.020
I would say the trend is finding a partner being lonely.

466
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.140
I think there is.
I think we are,
I mean,
you know he wrote,

467
00:26:52.141 --> 00:26:54.720
I don't know how many years ago Putnam wrote the book bowling alone,

468
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.560
but I think when we're bowling alone more and more and more and the more

469
00:26:58.561 --> 00:27:00.000
effective technology becomes,

470
00:27:00.001 --> 00:27:03.120
the more we can insulate ourselves and cocoon ourselves against it.

471
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:04.770
Against the world,

472
00:27:04.771 --> 00:27:08.370
you can order your food in and you can watch whatever you want.
And,

473
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.180
and yet there is this deep human desire for connection.

474
00:27:12.181 --> 00:27:15.330
The problem is that connecting takes work and it takes effort.

475
00:27:15.331 --> 00:27:20.070
And so in some ways we're becoming a less effortful society and therefore a

476
00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:23.490
lonelier society.
I get a lot of that.
Um,

477
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.740
and then there are all the range of human problems,
family problems,

478
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:33.360
marriage problems,
um,
and meaning problems.
Um,
I,

479
00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:38.040
I think there's a sense in which just like all the commandments could be reduced

480
00:27:38.041 --> 00:27:41.850
to do not steal because all of them are a form of stealing in one way or
another.

481
00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.430
All human problems can be reduced to,

482
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.760
I don't have meaning because other people give you meaning.

483
00:27:47.761 --> 00:27:50.970
Community gives you meaning a good job gives you meaning the spouse that loves

484
00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:54.780
you.
I mean,
you know,
meeting is sort of,
it's the ground.

485
00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:57.720
It's the Tilex and ground of being that we're all looking for.
Yeah.

486
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.180
What about for you?
What sort of training,
you know?
Yeah.

487
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.420
When I did find both in my ministry as a bishop,

488
00:28:03.421 --> 00:28:06.660
but also kind of the online work that I do in evangelization is the meaning

489
00:28:06.661 --> 00:28:09.270
thing.
Because the stats are all showing,
you know,

490
00:28:09.271 --> 00:28:12.900
when I was a kid back in the seventies about 3% of our country would have said,

491
00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:16.590
I have no religion.
I mean 97% of the country would have said,
I'm religious now,

492
00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.940
maybe not ardently so,
but 97% and had a religious affiliation.

493
00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.670
Now it's 25% among young people.

494
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.390
It's 40% among young Catholics.
So 30 and younger,

495
00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.520
it's 50% now say I have no religion.

496
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:35.180
And that expresses itself as a very deep hunger and alienation.

497
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:39.810
And I sense that all the time.
Um,
people want truth,

498
00:28:39.811 --> 00:28:41.850
they want meaning,
they want religious purpose,

499
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.270
but it's the cut flowers thing that more and more they're losing contact with

500
00:28:45.271 --> 00:28:49.440
the sources of that.
And it's causing enormous existential suffering.

501
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.370
The pope has talked about the existential margins.
I like that,
you know,

502
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.790
the church goes out to the margins,
he says mean economic and political margins,

503
00:28:56.791 --> 00:29:00.810
but he also named the existential margins,
people that are cut off from God.

504
00:29:00.811 --> 00:29:04.820
And I find that all the time more than when I started 30 some years ago.

505
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:07.950
But also I wonder what you think about the fact that that's true here.

506
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.860
And it's true,
certainly true for Jews here.
I mean there's no difference,

507
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.890
but elsewhere in the world that's not true.
Yeah.

508
00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:17.430
There are parts of the world where religious affiliation is exploded.

509
00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:20.800
That's right.
In the West is true.
Right,
exactly.
But in the West it isn't.
Right.

510
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.080
So what's the,
what's the pivot?

511
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.230
What's the difference?
Well,
in some ways,
you know,

512
00:29:28.231 --> 00:29:31.140
it's from maternity to post maternity or you might say that shadow of

513
00:29:31.141 --> 00:29:33.960
enlightenment,
finding more and more expression.
You know,
if,

514
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:38.100
if a hyper rationalism of scientistic view of the world,
the buffered self,

515
00:29:38.101 --> 00:29:41.560
if all that is taking more and more root in people's psyches,

516
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.970
that's going to happen.
You know,
the alienation will be deeper.
Um,
as you say,

517
00:29:45.971 --> 00:29:47.710
a lot of other societies around the world,

518
00:29:47.711 --> 00:29:51.490
religion is still very strong and growing.
Um,
but yeah,

519
00:29:51.491 --> 00:29:54.340
I think in the West that's,
it's the,
it's the aftereffects of,

520
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:58.360
of maternity and probably post-modernity.
So I also,
I want to bring in,
uh,

521
00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:03.510
Aldous Huxley here and I would love to have out of this actually [inaudible] it

522
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.280
wasn't bad.
We're going to summon him.

523
00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:13.000
He doesn't have that far to go in brave new world.
Um,

524
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:18.280
which I have to say I think about all the time as I read about China.
Yeah.

525
00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.600
They're in be including these policies.

526
00:30:19.601 --> 00:30:22.490
They're instituting these policies that increased authoritarianism.

527
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.990
They're making people,
they're satisfying the basic needs that people have.

528
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:31.180
I think that increasingly as you satisfy certain basic needs that people have,

529
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:36.130
they will give up on everything else that they don't absolutely have to have.

530
00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.870
So,
I mean,
this is why there's that great speech in,
in,
uh,

531
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:44.980
in brave new world where he says,
I want God,
I want sin.
I want messiness.

532
00:30:44.981 --> 00:30:46.660
I want unhappiness.
Um,

533
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:52.150
people are opting out of that because the truth is when people come to,

534
00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:56.290
to a synagogue or to a church and they say,
you know,
they're sad.

535
00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.940
It's so hard.
And I,
you know,

536
00:30:57.941 --> 00:31:01.210
the places too political to political by the way always means I didn't get what

537
00:31:01.211 --> 00:31:04.400
I wanted.
That's what political always means.
Nobody gets what they want.

538
00:31:04.401 --> 00:31:05.910
And it says the stupid,
um,

539
00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.630
what they're saying is the friction of dealing with other human beings in

540
00:31:10.631 --> 00:31:14.050
uncomfortable ways as something I don't have to put up with.
So I won't,

541
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.200
I'll text instead of call.
You know,
when I was,
when,
when,

542
00:31:17.201 --> 00:31:18.670
when all of us were younger,

543
00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:22.660
they used to say about a telephone that it gave you intimacy without danger

544
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.420
because you could talk on the phone,
but you didn't have to face the person.

545
00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:29.800
Now it's like multiplied many times.
Texting gives you into,

546
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.190
there is actually danger,
but not the kind of danger of facing someone.

547
00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:38.260
And so we created all these technologies that are like Soma to make people to

548
00:31:38.261 --> 00:31:42.790
low people into each individual comfort and we're paying a tremendous price.

549
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:44.320
So is this the irony though?
I mean,

550
00:31:44.321 --> 00:31:48.460
what brings us the three of us together is the Internet,
right?
I mean,
yeah,

551
00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:51.210
it's this incredibly powerful thing that now is,

552
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:56.350
is spreading the messages that you guys care about is also the very force that

553
00:31:56.621 --> 00:31:59.320
is allowing for us to be,
uh,
you know,

554
00:31:59.321 --> 00:32:03.940
alone when we're surrounded by people always goes with all things humans.
I mean,

555
00:32:03.941 --> 00:32:07.640
there's both,
couldn't bet you mentioned Huxley,
I'll mention to her,
to Sheridan,

556
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.530
you know,
the Great Jesuit,
uh,
scientists theologian,

557
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:16.210
but he talked about the Noah's fear.
He dreamed of this next stage of evolution.

558
00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:16.841
We're,

559
00:32:16.841 --> 00:32:20.950
the whole planet would be connected through a sort of brain like structure.

560
00:32:20.951 --> 00:32:23.290
And it seems so fantastic.
Back in the 1950s,
well,

561
00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:26.800
it's happened were the results of it were participating in it.

562
00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.200
And there's something beautiful about that.
He,
he,

563
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.830
he dreamed of the sense of connection that we're going to have.
And we do have a,

564
00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:33.311
I mean,

565
00:32:33.311 --> 00:32:37.180
I don't want to stress the positive side of Internet and social media and all

566
00:32:37.181 --> 00:32:41.270
that stuff is terrific in many ways.
But like all things human and biblical,

567
00:32:41.271 --> 00:32:43.070
people know that it's gonna go bad.

568
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.720
You know in time sin is going to reassert itself and the thing will be corrupted

569
00:32:47.721 --> 00:32:52.340
in some ways but,
but the positive remains and I love it.
I love the Noah's fear.

570
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:53.800
I think that's a positive development.
Yeah.

571
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.380
It's interesting because I've had obviously you both on individually,

572
00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:02.860
we both got into hot water from different communities online after we chatted

573
00:33:03.411 --> 00:33:08.090
because I had you on and I had people's say on the left who are angry that I

574
00:33:08.091 --> 00:33:10.430
even sat down with ambition gay.

575
00:33:10.431 --> 00:33:15.170
I sat down with the Bishop and you told me church doctrine and then told me a

576
00:33:15.171 --> 00:33:18.980
little bit about your personal feelings and people were just annoyed that I even

577
00:33:18.981 --> 00:33:23.981
sat down with you the first place you got into a lot of hot water because you

578
00:33:24.471 --> 00:33:28.010
said something to the effect of your head and your heart not being at exactly

579
00:33:28.011 --> 00:33:29.960
the same place with this.
And you had,

580
00:33:29.961 --> 00:33:33.140
so then you had people say more on the right are more traditional or whatever

581
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:34.760
you want to call that angry you.

582
00:33:34.761 --> 00:33:39.050
And I thought we must've done something right here because we're both getting,

583
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.600
you know,
hate,
so to speak from different quarters and that,

584
00:33:41.601 --> 00:33:45.920
that sort of the beauty and the horrors of the Internet.
Yeah.

585
00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:49.700
And um,
I mean I've sent it from the very beginning when I started doing work on

586
00:33:49.701 --> 00:33:51.980
youtube.
And as I say,
I didn't even know you could comment.

587
00:33:51.981 --> 00:33:53.210
I was that naive about it.
Youtube.

588
00:33:53.211 --> 00:33:57.950
I'd put things up there and I'm just inundated with negative comments because

589
00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.470
you know,
the vast majority of people we all know don't write in to say,
Gosh,

590
00:34:01.471 --> 00:34:04.440
I had John [inaudible] video.
God bless him.

591
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.760
No Psalm 97 per gallon.

592
00:34:06.761 --> 00:34:11.150
Now black really weren't saying 97% are going after you.

593
00:34:11.151 --> 00:34:14.150
But I mean now I'm used to it and I like it because I get some traction,

594
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.640
you know,
I can,
I can.
All right.
At the very least,

595
00:34:16.641 --> 00:34:19.220
now I can find some way to engage you and talk to you.

596
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.670
I got to remind myself all the time.
There's a person behind those,

597
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:24.320
those are harsh words.

598
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.370
You know that somebody may be in his mom's basement or who knows where he is or

599
00:34:28.371 --> 00:34:30.950
she is,
but somebody was writing those words as,

600
00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.980
as vicious and cruel as they might be.
Um,
so it's a pastoral opportunity.
I mean,

601
00:34:35.981 --> 00:34:39.410
I wouldn't want to miss that.
And I've encouraged,
you know,
my students,

602
00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:41.980
this is the cutting edge of pastoral ministry anyways.

603
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:46.280
We've got to learn how to engage that world very creatively or we're missing a

604
00:34:46.281 --> 00:34:47.360
giant opportunity.

605
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.560
So it's interesting this just talking about the gay marriage issue for a minute,

606
00:34:51.561 --> 00:34:52.730
which it's already illegal here.

607
00:34:52.731 --> 00:34:55.880
I don't even really like belaboring it because it seems like the ship has sailed

608
00:34:55.881 --> 00:34:59.390
and most people are basically okay with data at this point.
Um,

609
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:04.460
Jews sorta were ahead on this.
Generally speaking,
generally speaking,

610
00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:08.240
the secular Jews,
right?
Not thoroughly students.
Um,

611
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:10.610
you had a little bit of an insurrection in your own,

612
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:15.170
in your own tempo when you took a position pro gay marriage.

613
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:19.680
So,
so what is the,
uh,
well,
what is it?
Is it,

614
00:35:19.681 --> 00:35:22.790
is it about the history of Jews being the other or something else that allow

615
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.610
Jews generally to evolve on social issues?

616
00:35:25.611 --> 00:35:29.510
A little [inaudible] a really interesting question about why Jews tend to be,

617
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:30.500
I mean,

618
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:35.120
80% of Jews find themselves on the left of the political spectrum that has

619
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:37.190
shifted somewhat in the last,

620
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.010
<v 2>I don't know,
20,
30 years.
Um,</v>

621
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.350
but it's still true and there's been a lot of diagnoses about why that is,

622
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:47.340
whether it's limitation from the right or cheering from the left.
Um,

623
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:52.590
I think they're a little bit about exactly.
Yeah.
So I think that there is,
um,

624
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:57.540
a lot of discussion in society right now is about the perception of the other

625
00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:02.190
and I think Jews have an instinctive otherness.
Um,

626
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:07.110
there's a phrase in the,
in the Bible that's,
that uses the word Gare Tosha,

627
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.890
which means a resident alien and a classic commentary on it says,

628
00:36:10.891 --> 00:36:12.480
this is how you should always feel in the world.

629
00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.250
Like you're both resident and alien.

630
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.310
And I think that that's been the Jewish historical experience.

631
00:36:17.311 --> 00:36:20.790
They always felt like they didn't entirely belong.

632
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.400
So when they see someone else who doesn't entirely belong,

633
00:36:23.401 --> 00:36:28.230
there's an instinctive sympathy that gets played out that way.
Um,
and,

634
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:33.380
and I think that that is still true for most Jews and even Jews on who would

635
00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:38.010
find themselves on the right in this,
we'd still say that they,

636
00:36:38.011 --> 00:36:41.640
they have that instinctive sympathy.
It expresses itself in different ways.

637
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:46.500
So that written,
I'm Jewish.
Yeah,
that rings very true to me.
Does that,

638
00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:51.420
so Christianity,
which has been more of a stamp,
majority religion,
let's say,

639
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:54.270
you wouldn't inherently feel that.
Do you think

640
00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:56.360
<v 1>that has a little bit to do with no,
I think there's a,</v>

641
00:36:56.361 --> 00:36:58.130
there's a tension in what you're talking about,
you know,

642
00:36:58.131 --> 00:37:01.730
is obviously a deeply biblical intuition about compassion for the other,

643
00:37:01.731 --> 00:37:05.320
and especially for someone on the margins of all that.
It's there.
I think the,

644
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:08.870
and Catholic teaching reflects that.
The deep compassion for everybody.

645
00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:10.101
At the same time,

646
00:37:10.101 --> 00:37:13.430
the natural law tradition that comes up not just out of Greek philosophy,

647
00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:17.580
but out of biblical sources and the nature of marriage and the integrity of,

648
00:37:17.581 --> 00:37:22.190
of the sexual act,
etc. Etc.
I mean all that is deeply biblical in its origins.

649
00:37:22.191 --> 00:37:25.370
Its,
it's supported by the philosophical tradition.
And let's face it,

650
00:37:25.371 --> 00:37:29.450
there was a consensus of the people that up until about 25 years ago that this

651
00:37:29.451 --> 00:37:32.970
was the right way to understand marriage,
sexuality.
So I,

652
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.950
I wouldn't want to characterize the church's position as somehow retrograde or

653
00:37:36.951 --> 00:37:41.530
we're so behind the times.
It's,
it's coming up out of this very traditional,

654
00:37:41.531 --> 00:37:42.710
we were just talking about,
you know,

655
00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.540
so I'd make that distinction between defending the integrity of,

656
00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:51.570
of marriage classically defined and reaching out with love and compassion and

657
00:37:51.861 --> 00:37:55.220
nonviolence and welcome to everybody.
You know,

658
00:37:55.221 --> 00:37:59.200
I think that's the place the church wants to finest.
Oh,
so here's the question.

659
00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:04.160
Here's a hard,
um,
and perhaps a unpopular thing to say,

660
00:38:04.161 --> 00:38:08.270
but you're exactly right that it was only in the 1980s that Andrew Sullivan

661
00:38:08.271 --> 00:38:12.990
wrote about gay marriage.
And it's very recent in the span of history.
Sure.

662
00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:17.210
And,
and you see this dynamic being played out again and again.
So for example,

663
00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:21.200
when my daughter went to college,
um,
which was,
she's just graduating.

664
00:38:21.201 --> 00:38:25.130
So four years ago,
the first questions they asked them was,
what's your name?

665
00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:29.260
Give us a favorite animal and what is your preferred Gender Pronoun?

666
00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.540
So some people said call me them for example,

667
00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.070
and got very offended by it.
Got very

668
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.870
<v 2>offended when someone would say you.
Yeah.
Um,
and in discussions with her,</v>

669
00:38:40.871 --> 00:38:43.390
I was saying to her,
you know,
yeah,

670
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:48.480
I understand why people who are young don't yet get what it is to grow up and be

671
00:38:48.911 --> 00:38:49.960
oriented a certain way.

672
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:52.910
They won't until they're my age and then there'll be something else that the

673
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.900
young person will ask them,
but they won't be able to do.
Um,

674
00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:59.290
but there has to be a circle of compassion here,

675
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:03.340
which I understand it's hard for people who feel themselves not accepted,

676
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:09.210
but they have to realize to some extent that people are trained in lots of deep

677
00:39:09.521 --> 00:39:10.840
ways.
And I first learned this,

678
00:39:10.841 --> 00:39:15.120
I took my junior year abroad in Scotland and there was this guy who made a

679
00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:18.400
really aunt,
didn't know I was Jewish,
made a really antisemitic remarks.

680
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:20.290
So I started to talk to him.
I did exactly what you said.

681
00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.770
I took time was not a pastor,
but I took it as an opportunity.

682
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.350
And after several discussions he said to me,
you know,

683
00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:31.380
I worshiped my father and my father always told me that Jews were terrible.

684
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:37.320
And it's so hard for me to see them because I feel like I'm betraying my father.

685
00:39:37.751 --> 00:39:42.060
And it was the first time I really understood that you can be trained in such a

686
00:39:42.061 --> 00:39:45.670
way that it's hard to get out of and that the victim in quote of your training

687
00:39:45.671 --> 00:39:50.380
has to have a certain amount of compassion for the time it takes for others to

688
00:39:50.381 --> 00:39:53.260
adjust.
Oh,
that's powerful.

689
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.040
What are some of the other issues that,
that people are coming to you about?

690
00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:02.210
<v 4>Well,
the one I sent the most,
as I say,
is this quest for,
for God.
I mean,</v>

691
00:40:02.211 --> 00:40:03.590
it's a hunger and thirst for God.

692
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:07.450
I would just use the most fundamental religious language I can find.
Uh,

693
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:11.210
people are,
are dissatisfied with the goods of the world.

694
00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.630
And especially in the West.
They have them in huge quantities.

695
00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.910
They have all the wealth and pleasure and power and honor.

696
00:40:16.911 --> 00:40:21.590
They can get in many cases and then there are desperately unhappy and they want

697
00:40:21.591 --> 00:40:23.060
something which the world can't give.

698
00:40:23.061 --> 00:40:24.560
They want something to scientists can't give.

699
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:28.640
They want something secularism can't give.
And so in a way,

700
00:40:28.641 --> 00:40:29.810
there was a great opportunity.

701
00:40:29.811 --> 00:40:34.790
Now it seems to me for religious people to again publicly reassert the great

702
00:40:34.791 --> 00:40:35.710
spiritual tradition.

703
00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.300
<v 2>So how important is happiness?
I was just gonna say,</v>

704
00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:41.251
I was just going to say I'm,

705
00:40:41.251 --> 00:40:46.251
one of the things we have lost is the capacity to be creatively unhappy because

706
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.680
for most of human history that wasn't what I mean,
the pursuit of happiness made.

707
00:40:51.681 --> 00:40:54.780
Most people did not assume that they had a right to be happy.

708
00:40:54.781 --> 00:40:59.781
And in fact being unhappy was one of the wellsprings of creativity and art and

709
00:41:00.631 --> 00:41:05.340
literature and,
and social movements and so on.
And I think now,

710
00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:06.000
um,

711
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000
because our mechanisms for alleviating acute on happiness are so good,

712
00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.470
both medically and socially,

713
00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:16.620
I think we've a little bit lost the capacity to be unhappy.

714
00:41:16.621 --> 00:41:19.830
So the founding fathers kind of burdened us with the pursuit to be happening,

715
00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:23.750
right?
Like the pursuit of happy.
But it was interesting about that.
To me it's

716
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.900
<v 4>very enlightened man sort of thing.
Is it Jefferson didn't define happiness.</v>

717
00:41:26.901 --> 00:41:29.390
He said we have a right to pursue it according to our own,
you know,

718
00:41:29.391 --> 00:41:30.720
will prior to that,

719
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:34.370
to that period what preoccupied the of the great thinkers was.
Well,

720
00:41:34.371 --> 00:41:35.720
what is happiness?
You know,

721
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:38.750
so whether it's Aquinas or at Cicero or is Plato and Aristotle,

722
00:41:38.751 --> 00:41:42.050
they're deeply interested in what makes us happy.

723
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.420
There's a shift at maternity that says,
well,

724
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:47.660
we don't really know what's going to make us happy,
but you pursue it your way.

725
00:41:47.661 --> 00:41:50.330
You pursue it that way and we have a right to do it.

726
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.900
But I think that question's still haunts the human heart.

727
00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.740
How important do you think the question,

728
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:58.370
it's the only question that finally manners,
I mean,

729
00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:01.550
what do you think that's more important than the question of meaning?

730
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.550
It is the question of meaning.
It is the question,
the same thing.

731
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:06.970
What makes me find what gives me beatitude?
Oh,

732
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:10.040
now that doesn't mean psychological contentment.
I quite agree with you there.

733
00:42:10.041 --> 00:42:12.320
I mean,
we're not going to get psychological commitment very often.

734
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:15.020
And I think you're right that it's an engine of progress.

735
00:42:15.021 --> 00:42:18.860
The fact that we don't have psychological contentment,
beatitude,
oh,
is a,

736
00:42:18.861 --> 00:42:23.861
is the joy of a heart or its Shalom or it's this piece at the level of the soul

737
00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.810
that people want.
I won't get it perfectly in this life.
You know,
I,

738
00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.320
I aspire to it perfectly in the,
in the life to come,

739
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:34.850
but it's deep in me to want it.
And that's what drives me,
you know?

740
00:42:34.851 --> 00:42:37.780
And if you suppress that Saint John of the cross of that,

741
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:41.450
if you suppress that very dangerous things happen psychologically and

742
00:42:41.451 --> 00:42:43.580
spiritually,
and I think you see that all over the place,

743
00:42:43.581 --> 00:42:48.200
now that question's not important.
Don't worry about that question.
Seek wealth,

744
00:42:48.201 --> 00:42:50.450
pleasure,
honor,
power secret scientists can tell you,

745
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.990
but that's not going to satisfy the longing of the heart.
And

746
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:57.520
<v 2>Shimon Peres,
who was the president of Israel,
prime minister briefly,
um,</v>

747
00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:01.130
she had the great contribution of the Jews to the world was dissatisfaction.

748
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:05.300
And if you think about it,
I mean,
if people act towards the end of their life,

749
00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:06.680
they,
you ask them when they were happiest.

750
00:43:06.681 --> 00:43:08.870
It wasn't once they achieved the goal that they work,

751
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.370
it's always on the way there.

752
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.250
I mean there is something about unhappiness that makes you happy,

753
00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:17.060
strange as it sounds.
Yeah.
Well it gives you drive this,
right.

754
00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:19.840
And those are the moments that you think up.
Nostalgically yeah,

755
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.360
but how important,
so you said it's the same question.

756
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:26.450
I think so meaning the pursuit of happiness in the group and the pursuit of

757
00:43:26.451 --> 00:43:31.070
morality of meaning of meaning.
Do you think that's the side question?
I,
well,

758
00:43:31.071 --> 00:43:33.050
I wouldn't know.
I wouldn't use the word happy.

759
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:35.840
I would say the pursuit of meaning.

760
00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.370
I mean you can be deeply troubled,

761
00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:45.080
pained and on.
You wouldn't call yourself happy.
Um,

762
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:48.260
and yet you would say,
I'm where I'm supposed to be and this is,

763
00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:52.550
I'm looking for a different word because happy has connotation and I agree with

764
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:57.860
psychological contain exactly.
Of something too trivial,

765
00:43:57.861 --> 00:43:59.450
almost interesting.

766
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:02.570
<v 4>I would agree with you on that.
Uh,
Aquinas says,
for example,</v>

767
00:44:02.571 --> 00:44:06.290
you want to see a picture of Beata Tuto.
So the Latin for happiness,
he said,

768
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:10.970
you look in the crucify Jesus because Jesus on the cross wealth,
pleasure,

769
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.640
honor power.
He's got none of them out.
They're all stripped away,

770
00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.420
but he's doing the will of his father.
And so he says,
paradoxically,

771
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.230
that's a picture of a happy man.
Now,

772
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:23.090
no psychological contentment whatsoever on the country.

773
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:27.290
But yet we hold that image up in Catholic churches anyway and we want people to

774
00:44:27.291 --> 00:44:30.770
contemplate that image.
You know,
so not a picture of someone wealthy,

775
00:44:30.771 --> 00:44:31.980
someone powerful,
someone

776
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.970
<v 2>full of psychological pleasure.
We hold up the crucified Jesus and we say,</v>

777
00:44:35.971 --> 00:44:39.250
that's Beata Tuto that's what you're seeking,
you know,

778
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.480
to be stripped away of many of those things.
So self sacrifices,

779
00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:46.170
somebody who sacrifices themselves happy,
I don't think happy is the writer,

780
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:50.640
right is the right word,
you know?
But there is something,
right?
Exactly.
Yes.

781
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:54.440
How about Shalom?
Something fulfilled.
Yeah,
whole mean.

782
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:59.450
And maybe are you both constantly amazed that just what people can put up with

783
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.220
that they don't think they can,

784
00:45:02.221 --> 00:45:06.360
that people come to you disease or death or whatever it is,

785
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:09.450
lost their job in the house,
the whole thing.

786
00:45:09.451 --> 00:45:12.570
And they think everything's falling apart and that,
you know,

787
00:45:12.571 --> 00:45:15.240
in most cases they always make it through one way or another.

788
00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:19.220
That must be one of the things that you,
you both find that got to give you some.

789
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.050
So I just,
uh,

790
00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:26.160
just a couple of months ago I did the funeral of Max Webb who died at 101 and he

791
00:45:26.161 --> 00:45:30.870
had survived 18 concentration camps and he was a remarkable,

792
00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:36.090
just a remarkable man.
Um,
and,
and he would,
I mean,

793
00:45:36.091 --> 00:45:39.570
he,
when he,
when the Nazis came to his town,
he said to his mother,

794
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:44.010
if you hear that I was shot or hung,
it might be true.
If you hear that I starved,

795
00:45:44.011 --> 00:45:46.920
don't believe it.
And that's what he was like.

796
00:45:46.921 --> 00:45:51.330
He just had a life force that was indomitable.

797
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:56.730
And what he put up with in his life was,
you know,

798
00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:02.130
literally unimaginable to someone who didn't go through a similar experience.

799
00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.890
And so yes,
when I look at that and I see,

800
00:46:04.891 --> 00:46:09.891
and he was I think genuinely most of the time I happy man.

801
00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:11.220
Um,

802
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:15.720
and I think that that's because there was no question in his life in his,

803
00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:19.590
in his mind that life was meaningful,
that God was real,

804
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:23.040
that miracles were real,
that his survival had a purpose,

805
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.160
that he had to commemorate the people who didn't survive.
And I mean,

806
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:31.340
in some ways his life was more people by the people who weren't there then for

807
00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:34.260
most of us,
by the people who are,
what do you chalk it up to?

808
00:46:34.261 --> 00:46:36.240
The young person though or child,
you know,

809
00:46:36.241 --> 00:46:38.210
I don't know how old he was exactly when that happened.
Yeah,

810
00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:39.840
he was young that he could,

811
00:46:39.841 --> 00:46:43.360
that a young person could have that you haven't had the time to think.

812
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:47.340
So I think part of it,
I mean part of it is intrinsic nature.

813
00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.320
There are people who are,
you know,

814
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:52.740
there are people who are fortunate enough to be,

815
00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.980
to have that God given resilience.
Uh,

816
00:46:55.981 --> 00:46:58.530
and then I think that part of it was the,

817
00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:04.490
the furnace that he went through that refined his character and made him

818
00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:07.830
determined not to have lived in Maine.
It's reminds me of,

819
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:12.120
so I'll just a quick story.
Hugo Grin,
who was a rabbi in,

820
00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:15.660
in Britain when he was a child.
He was in Auschwitz and his father,

821
00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:17.430
it was Hanukkah and we've just finished Konica.

822
00:47:17.431 --> 00:47:22.290
So his father took the margarine ration and he used it to light the Hanukkah

823
00:47:22.291 --> 00:47:25.590
Menorah and green who was like 11 or 12 at the time,

824
00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:27.030
like screamed at his father and said,

825
00:47:27.031 --> 00:47:30.010
how can you were supposed to be eating this?
This is our,
this is what survives.

826
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.780
<v 1>His father said,
my child,</v>

827
00:47:31.781 --> 00:47:34.000
we've learned that you can live for three weeks without food.

828
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.340
You can live for three days without water,

829
00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:38.350
but you can't live for three minutes without hope.

830
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:44.400
So the people who learned that lesson we're different is ultimately concern.

831
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:49.090
Yeah.
I mean,
you're up against it as a religious figure all the time.

832
00:47:49.091 --> 00:47:50.650
You're up against suffering from the very beginning.

833
00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.830
I remember when I was newly ordained,
I'm 26 years old,
you know,

834
00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:58.831
and I was in the funeral directors car behind the third hearse of that week.

835
00:47:59.081 --> 00:48:02.020
I was doing my third funeral that weekend.
I remember thinking,
what am I doing?

836
00:48:02.021 --> 00:48:05.600
I'm 26 years old.
It's a beautiful day.
I'm behind my third,
you know,

837
00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:10.300
but you do it because those are those limit experiences where people have a

838
00:48:10.301 --> 00:48:14.740
sense of God.
It's often when pushed to those limits.
Uh,
just,
you know,

839
00:48:14.741 --> 00:48:17.380
recently I'm out here in Sunny,

840
00:48:17.381 --> 00:48:20.260
beautiful southern California and all my Chicago friends are,
oh,
there you go.

841
00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.180
New Montecito and Santa Barbara.
Of course,

842
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:26.410
Santa Barbara gets the terrible Thomas fire followed by the even more terrible

843
00:48:26.411 --> 00:48:29.380
mudslide that killed 20 people in one night.
Um,

844
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:33.880
I was at a funeral of a man who lost his wife and two kids in that mud slide.

845
00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:36.960
So that's,
but you know,
I mean,
we go there,

846
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:40.780
we always go to those places were called to stand in those places and have that

847
00:48:40.781 --> 00:48:45.781
awful responsibility and awful in the full sense of that term to speak a divine

848
00:48:46.241 --> 00:48:47.620
word at that moment.

849
00:48:47.621 --> 00:48:52.420
But those are the limit experiences where people often have the most powerful

850
00:48:52.421 --> 00:48:56.620
sense of God,
of the unconditioned.
Some people are able to say,
like I,
I,

851
00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.820
I had a couple of brain tumors and I went through lymphoma and people would,

852
00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:05.170
and whenever people come to my office and say,
you know,
how did,

853
00:49:05.171 --> 00:49:08.280
how did you feel?
Because people always come to your office to say,
why me?
Right.

854
00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:10.300
Always.
Yeah.
I said to them,
look,

855
00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:14.080
what I was thinking was I was born in the richest country in the world.

856
00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:18.190
I had parents who loved me.
I was never hungry.
Why me?
I mean,

857
00:49:18.191 --> 00:49:21.730
that's what I was asking.
Why me?
The other stuff,
it's like I don't expect it.

858
00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:24.880
I don't think any of us should expect an uninterrupted,
we're on a blessing,

859
00:49:24.881 --> 00:49:27.970
but what we tend to do is we count everything that's good in our lives as

860
00:49:27.971 --> 00:49:30.790
natural and everything that's bad as unfair.

861
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:36.940
Obviously there are radically unfair things,
but for most of us,
I mean,

862
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:41.840
we're very lucky to be here.
Just very lucky.
Yeah.
Just on a,

863
00:49:41.841 --> 00:49:46.810
on a purely personal level,
not just the sort of ideal level.
Um,

864
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:49.960
there's got to be those moments that,
you know,
not just when you're 26,

865
00:49:49.961 --> 00:49:53.280
but even now where someone presents something to you and it's like,
where,

866
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:55.020
where do you guys just get the,

867
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:58.480
just sort of afforded you to an energy to get up and have to be strong when you

868
00:49:58.481 --> 00:50:00.910
just don't feel like,
I know what it's like doing what I do.
I have,

869
00:50:00.911 --> 00:50:02.640
and dealing with certain amount of hate and it can be,

870
00:50:02.641 --> 00:50:05.860
I'll have a different answer.
All right.
I think so.
I mean,

871
00:50:05.861 --> 00:50:10.450
my mind is the holy hour.
So I mean,
I begin every day with an hour of prayer.

872
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:13.990
Most of it in silence before the blessed sacrament.
I mean,

873
00:50:13.991 --> 00:50:18.970
so it's just this time of communion with the Lord and I,

874
00:50:18.971 --> 00:50:22.030
I'm a morning guy.
I wake up early and so before any distractions come in,

875
00:50:22.031 --> 00:50:25.810
I'll spend an hour with a cup of coffee and the Tabernacle,
you know,

876
00:50:25.811 --> 00:50:27.650
so it's just a time of communion

877
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.320
<v 4>and that's where I bring all this stuff to the Lord.</v>

878
00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:34.700
I'll bring what I'm worried about.
I'll bring peoples needs and concerns.

879
00:50:34.701 --> 00:50:37.970
People say all the time,
you know,
to priests and bishops,
pray for me,
pray for me.

880
00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.820
So I try to do that.
Like,
Lord,
I don't remember all their names,

881
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:43.640
but everyone that asked me to pray for them,
I'm now doing it.
Right.
You know?

882
00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:47.630
But that's for me,
super important because you're,
you're absolutely right.

883
00:50:47.631 --> 00:50:51.170
There are times like I have no one to say,
I don't know what to say.

884
00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:55.190
I remember years ago now I'm a young priest and there was a,
uh,

885
00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:59.720
a man who had killed themselves before killing himself,
had killed his son.

886
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:01.680
And this is made the papers,
you know,

887
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:04.880
I was at the funeral parlor at not attending vet wake,

888
00:51:04.881 --> 00:51:06.890
but another one from my parish.
But on the way out,

889
00:51:06.891 --> 00:51:10.280
I noticed these two coffins in the room.
It's very unusual,
you know,

890
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:15.520
and then I saw the name.
I know that's,
so I went in,
you know,
and um,

891
00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:19.010
at the,
the wife and mother saw me at the collar on,

892
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:24.370
she comes over and she went
like,
okay,
you know,

893
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:26.830
religious guy or I did

894
00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:29.420
<v 5>that.
Okay.</v>

895
00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:32.160
<v 4>And that was it.
I mean,
I,
I didn't say one word to her.
I didn't,</v>

896
00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:36.210
I didn't know what I could say.
But somehow,
weirdly,
you know,

897
00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:41.240
this just the presence of a religious representative going like,

898
00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:44.620
look,
I don't know.
I mean,
I don't know either,
but,

899
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:50.150
but somehow there's a context of something here that we're both acknowledging

900
00:51:50.881 --> 00:51:55.380
through all of this darkness.
So that's what your face passed away.
I mean,

901
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:59.010
we don't get a full idea that presence is more powerful than the answers.

902
00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.950
Answers are.
But presences,

903
00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.080
<v 2>I was going to say is that I think actually part of what,</v>

904
00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:09.430
part of what I find is what I'm sure you find.
Do you think,
oh my God,

905
00:52:09.431 --> 00:52:11.680
I can't believe another gotta do another podcast today.

906
00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:14.050
How do you drag yourself in here?

907
00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:19.080
But then the doing brings its own powerful energy and so there are times when

908
00:52:21.371 --> 00:52:23.170
I'll say,
I can't believe I got to go to a wedding.

909
00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:25.600
I can't believe I got to go do a few.
I really don't want to get up.

910
00:52:25.601 --> 00:52:26.500
I really don't want to get dressed,

911
00:52:26.501 --> 00:52:30.280
but there is never a time when I'm standing up and doing it right.
I don't think,

912
00:52:30.281 --> 00:52:30.971
oh my God,

913
00:52:30.971 --> 00:52:35.971
I'm so blessed to be able to do this because there is in I am a,

914
00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:39.730
I'm a big advocate of what used to be called the James Lang theory of emotion,

915
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.560
which is not that you feel something and then you do it,

916
00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:46.830
but you do something and feeling as will then rise and swell to fill the moment.

917
00:52:47.561 --> 00:52:48.740
Then that's what happens.
You

918
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:51.120
<v 4>He,
the one that comes to my mind is the song.
They go out,</v>

919
00:52:51.121 --> 00:52:54.030
they go out full of tears carrying seed for the sewing.
They come back,

920
00:52:54.031 --> 00:52:56.070
they come back full of song carrying the sheets.

921
00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:58.550
That to me is pastoral experience.
Very often as you,

922
00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.050
you're driving to the hospital and you're like,
okay,
right,

923
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:02.550
I don't want to go to the hospital.
Yeah.

924
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:06.210
And you're kind of full of tears about it,
but then you come back,
you come back

925
00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:09.520
<v 2>singing,
right.
I mean the car singing is that there's something,</v>

926
00:53:09.521 --> 00:53:12.580
it did something to you and I think James is right as well.

927
00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.880
It must be nice for you guys just to be able to admit that briefly because I

928
00:53:15.881 --> 00:53:18.880
think people probably look at you guys until it's that woman going like this.

929
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:19.410
Yeah,
right.

930
00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:22.570
Like that you're these like super human things or something or that you're

931
00:53:22.571 --> 00:53:24.790
supposed to know everything and give them everything.
Right.

932
00:53:24.791 --> 00:53:25.980
So a moment where you can

933
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.590
<v 3>admit,
oh,
I was in the car and this,
or I didn't want to get out of bed.</v>

934
00:53:28.591 --> 00:53:32.830
He'd probably just for you guys.
So it's a little therapy here as well.
Yeah.

935
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:34.380
I don't even have a question for this,

936
00:53:34.381 --> 00:53:37.140
but I just thought this was an interesting thing that happened to me about two

937
00:53:37.141 --> 00:53:40.140
months ago.
Uh,
Jordan and I,
you know,
were on tour together.

938
00:53:40.141 --> 00:53:41.100
We were in Salt Lake City.

939
00:53:41.101 --> 00:53:46.101
And a couple came up to me before the show and they just looked very sad and

940
00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:51.720
disturbed and they came up to me and they said this was there one night out

941
00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:53.910
there.
They've been dealing with a lot.
Uh,

942
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:58.650
her father had just died within the week.
Uh,
he had been diagnosed,

943
00:53:58.690 --> 00:54:01.800
the guy that I was standing with had been diagnosed I think with testicular

944
00:54:01.801 --> 00:54:06.690
cancer and that she was pregnant with their baby that they had been told was not

945
00:54:06.691 --> 00:54:09.900
going to live,
but the child was still in utero.

946
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:13.890
And I did,
I mean,
I truly,

947
00:54:13.891 --> 00:54:16.170
I had one of those moments where I had no idea what to say.

948
00:54:16.171 --> 00:54:18.720
It was like slow motion.
I was like,
they,
you know,

949
00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:22.860
I had given them tickets to my meet and greet after not knowing any of this.

950
00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.330
So when I came up to them,

951
00:54:24.331 --> 00:54:27.960
I was like being all friendly and everything and I did not know what to say and

952
00:54:27.961 --> 00:54:31.440
it was,
and I just,
I just said,
God bless you guys.
I could not,
like,

953
00:54:31.441 --> 00:54:36.150
it was like the old would seem like the only word that add any value whatsoever.

954
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:39.960
So I don't even have a question for that was interesting that it was just what

955
00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:43.260
there was nothing left in my brain to say.
Basically.

956
00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:46.900
<v 1>That's what you said though.
That is very interesting to me.
Cause I mean,</v>

957
00:54:46.901 --> 00:54:51.700
some were in your,
in your soul,
those words came out.
You know,
even if,

958
00:54:51.701 --> 00:54:53.610
and I guess you know from what you've said explicitly,
you're,

959
00:54:53.611 --> 00:54:57.190
you're a nonbeliever,
right?
I,
at this point,
I wouldn't say I'm a nonbeliever,

960
00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:02.140
he was before the [inaudible].

961
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.073
Interesting.

962
00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:07.660
I think that's where the worth just meditating on that came from somewhere in

963
00:55:07.661 --> 00:55:12.310
your developing psyche and soul or whatever.
And that's very powerful.

964
00:55:12.311 --> 00:55:15.010
It seems to me.
And I would say to you is,
I mean,

965
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:16.543
<v 3>yes,</v>

966
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:21.060
<v 1>what you told them was the only thing you can really tell someone who's</v>

967
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:24.480
suffering,
which is you're not alone.
That's,

968
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:28.880
that is the essential human message.
You are not alone.
God bless you.
You,

969
00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:32.780
you responded,
you were present in their moment of pain and,

970
00:55:32.781 --> 00:55:34.920
and there's nothing else that someone can ask of you.

971
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:39.890
<v 3>Yeah,
it was.
It was certainly powerful.
All right,
so I want to wrap with,</v>

972
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:44.770
let's give some people some concrete steps to have these conversations for

973
00:55:44.771 --> 00:55:47.390
themselves.
Do you guys have any tricks and I,

974
00:55:47.391 --> 00:55:50.890
and I really mean this sort of within the realm of what your last book was
about,

975
00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:53.560
to help people do some of this online.

976
00:55:53.561 --> 00:55:55.510
It's one thing when they come to your offices,

977
00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:59.950
it's one thing when we sit here and do this,
but in the online world,

978
00:55:59.951 --> 00:56:01.210
which we've already discussed,

979
00:56:01.211 --> 00:56:03.790
there's some great things going on and some terrible things going on.

980
00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:08.450
How do people do this because it's just a litany of,
you know,

981
00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:12.040
you know,
one upping each other and taking each other down in the rest of it.

982
00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.910
Are there tricks that you guys have found that,

983
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.900
that you think can make these conversations a little more effective basically?

984
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:21.240
<v 1>Well,
I,
it turned the practical level.</v>

985
00:56:21.241 --> 00:56:23.410
There's sort of grander philosophical visits we can about it,

986
00:56:23.411 --> 00:56:24.550
but it's a practical level.

987
00:56:24.551 --> 00:56:29.050
That thing I said earlier is always realize you're dealing with a person behind

988
00:56:29.051 --> 00:56:32.860
the words.
It's,
it's so easy to say,
look,
those words,

989
00:56:32.861 --> 00:56:35.590
our wounding me and so I'm going to respond,
you know,

990
00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:39.760
with wounding words in my own,
there's a person,
there's a person,

991
00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:43.570
there's a person behind those words.
Um,
but secondly,

992
00:56:43.571 --> 00:56:47.920
I mean to move out of a purely emotional,
um,
ambit,

993
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:49.870
I have nothing against the emotions,

994
00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:52.960
but if you stay purely when the emotional Abbott,
we start doing this,

995
00:56:52.961 --> 00:56:55.510
this back and forth,
you know,
you've hurt me,
I'll hurt you.

996
00:56:56.470 --> 00:57:00.370
Is there something of objective truth that we can talk about?

997
00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:04.900
So even as you're objecting to me as people often do,
you know,
I think,
okay,

998
00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:10.270
a really,
really smart people in the great tradition have held the central thing.

999
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:11.110
You're saying,

1000
00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:15.670
even within all of this kind of jumble language or highly charged emotion,

1001
00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:18.880
there's a,
there's an argument in there,
there's a truth claim being made.

1002
00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:23.590
Can you identify that and doing a way that is very affirming.

1003
00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:28.360
What I hear you saying through all of this is this,

1004
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:32.830
and actually to say lots of really smart people have held this position.

1005
00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:35.670
Do I have that right?
And like,

1006
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:40.710
that kind of response I find can just disarm people and can break through some

1007
00:57:41.021 --> 00:57:42.010
of the emotion,

1008
00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:46.060
the emotionality and try to now we can begin to have an argument,

1009
00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:49.360
we can start talking about the truth claim being made.
It is,

1010
00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:53.470
it is useful to remember that no one wins arguments.
They're fun to have,

1011
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:54.070
but it's,

1012
00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:57.700
I have almost argument as a process of convincing yourself that you were right.

1013
00:57:58.150 --> 00:58:02.470
I've almost never walked away from an argument saying,
yeah,
he was right.

1014
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.440
I was wrong.
A out argued me,
I'm done.
Um,

1015
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:10.930
and so if you realize that if you argue with the person,
if you resist the,

1016
00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:14.800
the desire to just argue and you resist the desire to be clever,

1017
00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:17.860
which is really hard,
it's really hard.
You think of a clever response.

1018
00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:18.820
And to not say it.

1019
00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:21.730
My father used to tell me that there's a Yiddish phrase who is a hero,

1020
00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:25.660
one who resists a wisecrack and,
and I'm not at all heroic.
Yes.

1021
00:58:25.661 --> 00:58:29.200
This is what I wrote.
Exactly.
So very good.
Um,

1022
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:34.750
and then you use the magic.
There is a magic tool that human beings have,

1023
00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:36.250
which is the question.

1024
00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:41.470
You've just ask a question instead of arguing or you do,

1025
00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:45.310
you say,
what do you think about this?
Or how do you feel about that?

1026
00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:50.680
It's remarkable how powerful a question can be.
Um,
Hi Robbie,

1027
00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:54.340
who was a Nobel prize winning physicist at the end of his life and how arts and

1028
00:58:54.370 --> 00:58:55.570
paper and Israel,
and they said to him,

1029
00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:58.390
who has the greatest influence in your life?
And he said,
my mother,

1030
00:58:58.420 --> 00:58:59.860
because when I used to come home from a,

1031
00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:01.870
which was Jewish religious school in Eastern Europe,

1032
00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:05.260
everyday she would say to me,
gets he,
did you ask any good questions today?

1033
00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:07.570
And I always thought that was great.

1034
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:12.580
So you learn to ask questions and you might be amazed that people tell you

1035
00:59:12.581 --> 00:59:14.530
things and the respect for your opponent.

1036
00:59:14.531 --> 00:59:17.860
I'm thinking now with this conversation between a rabbi in a Catholic bishop,

1037
00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:21.980
my hero,
Thomas Aquinas,
who read everybody and dialogue with

1038
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.920
<v 4>everybody.
Uh,
the Christian version,
of course,</v>

1039
00:59:24.921 --> 00:59:29.860
but also the pagan philosophers and scientists,
also a Muslim scholars.

1040
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:34.870
Also most of my monities always refers to my monities is Robbie Moy says,

1041
00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:38.060
oh your first and very respectfully,
you know,
um,

1042
00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:41.180
which is not the communist attitude and the Christian Middle Ages,

1043
00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:45.230
but there is a quaint as having this seminar conversation with all these

1044
00:59:45.231 --> 00:59:49.220
different voices and speaking with great respect of them and to them.

1045
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:51.020
I think that's a great model for us.
No.

1046
00:59:51.250 --> 00:59:51.821
<v 3>Hmm.
All right.</v>

1047
00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:55.720
So I do have one bonus one four since we're right between Hanukkah and Christmas

1048
00:59:55.721 --> 00:59:56.554
right now.

1049
00:59:56.710 --> 01:00:00.670
I have always personally liked when Hanukkah and Christmas were at the same
time.

1050
01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:01.691
So that would just be like,

1051
01:00:01.691 --> 01:00:05.710
then everyone's sort of celebrating the exact same thing at the same time and

1052
01:00:05.711 --> 01:00:07.960
it's like whatever the differences are,
just doesn't matter.

1053
01:00:07.961 --> 01:00:10.570
Everyone's getting presents on at least one of the same days,

1054
01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.530
something like that.
This year,
Hanukkah was early.
I always say,
well,

1055
01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.140
you could probably do a show on that when they tell you the Jewish holidays are,

1056
01:00:17.141 --> 01:00:20.120
but let's say early,
I'm just curious if you,
have you done,

1057
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:21.880
have you ever thought of that or whether it,

1058
01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:24.850
do you like it better when they fall out together because maybe there's

1059
01:00:24.851 --> 01:00:27.410
something in a wider community or does it not matter at all?

1060
01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.970
<v 2>Um,
I've now,
I mean,
I,
I look,
I,
I really,</v>

1061
01:00:31.971 --> 01:00:35.960
I've always been a fan of Christmas.
I enjoy Christmas.
I like Christmas music.

1062
01:00:35.961 --> 01:00:38.270
I especially like the Christmas music that was written by Jews.

1063
01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:41.660
So it's not,

1064
01:00:41.661 --> 01:00:46.220
and I think that the reason that I like Christmas is because when your hands are

1065
01:00:46.221 --> 01:00:48.560
full,
so you don't feel like you need a handout,

1066
01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:51.530
you can enjoy other people's religious tradition when you feel secure in your

1067
01:00:51.531 --> 01:00:54.260
own.
And so it never felt like a threat to me.

1068
01:00:54.261 --> 01:00:56.630
It always felt like a beautiful holiday.
And I loved it.

1069
01:00:56.631 --> 01:01:00.470
And also because of one of the things that I always tell high school students,

1070
01:01:00.471 --> 01:01:03.920
which is that you can't spend your life living in the minds of other people.

1071
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.911
You know,

1072
01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:08.510
we spent so much time worrying about what other people will think about us all

1073
01:01:08.511 --> 01:01:09.201
the time.
I mean,
that's,

1074
01:01:09.201 --> 01:01:12.440
social media is so much about what will other people think about us,

1075
01:01:12.441 --> 01:01:15.830
but the truth is they probably think about us as much as we think about them.

1076
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:21.080
And that's not much.
And at the end of the day,
you've got to live with you.

1077
01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:24.650
So that to me is the,
and so I,

1078
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:27.980
I enjoy Christmas knowing it's not mine.
And if people don't like that,

1079
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:29.330
I feel like,
okay,

1080
01:01:29.331 --> 01:01:33.470
but they'll send me a mean email and then they won't think about me.

1081
01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:36.950
But I'll still be here.
Solid answer to a strange question.

1082
01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:40.110
<v 4>Maybe I'll just say this.</v>

1083
01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.200
I have always loved Hanukkah and what it celebrates the purification of,

1084
01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:45.900
of the temple,
which I think is really needed today.

1085
01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:50.850
Namely a recovery of worship.
You know,
I think people need a sacred space.

1086
01:01:50.851 --> 01:01:53.690
They need a temple,
a place to pray.
And uh,

1087
01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:57.210
what's happening in the hyper secularized world as they've lost a sense of where

1088
01:01:57.211 --> 01:02:02.190
do I go,
where do I go to pray?
And the temple needs to be reclaimed and purified.

1089
01:02:02.191 --> 01:02:04.890
So I think that's a beautiful thing for every one of the nice things about

1090
01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.770
Konica.
There's no Jewish holiday for the dedication of the temple.

1091
01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:10.650
There's only a Jewish holiday for the rededication of Campbell.

1092
01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.660
And when we talk about the renewal of religion,

1093
01:02:12.661 --> 01:02:14.970
what we're really talking about is Konica.
Hmm.

1094
01:02:15.790 --> 01:02:19.500
<v 3>Well,
gentlemen,
it's been an absolute pleasure.
I thank you guys.
Good.
This tape,</v>

1095
01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.940
this is a busy season for you guys.
I hope when you guys were driving here.
Well,

1096
01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:26.640
I hope when you were driving here and you were like,
ah,
I don't have to do that.

1097
01:02:26.641 --> 01:02:31.570
And you were when you woke up this morning when I got back.
Yeah,

1098
01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:34.520
there you go.
Well,
thank you so much.
We're going to link to,
uh,

1099
01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.080
to your books down below and all that good stuff.
Okay.

1100
01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.170
Thank you guys for watching and comment right down below.
Maybe they'll read it.

1101
01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:40.590
There you go.
