KYLE EWING: My
name's Kyle Ewing.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.140
I lead the Global Staffing
Programs team here at Google.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.430
It's our job to identify and
develop top talent for Google.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.940
So when I was asked
to be here tonight--

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.880
to sit here with these
guys and recognize

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.120
Michael's story, a former BOLD
intern, I was very thrilled.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.100
I know we're all really
honored and excited to welcome

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.740
Michael-- to welcome both
Jhanvi and Ketaki Shriram,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.361
the producers of the film, as
well as the director, Kevin

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:34.860
Gordon.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.422
So please join me in giving
them a nice warm welcome.

00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:43.546
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:45.670
So I think we all had the
pleasure of just watching

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.060
the film.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.910
And those of us at
Google who've known you

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.410
were so proud of Michael
and his accomplishments.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.040
But I'd love to hear more
about how you guys decided

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.750
to feature Michael
and his story.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.395
KETAKI SHRIRAM: So Jhanvi and I
attended Stanford with Michael

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:01.180
as undergrads.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.560
And when we heard he
was running for office

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.110
we were very
inspired and excited.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.310
And so we met with
him over frozen yogurt

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.700
and asked him if he'd be
OK with us following him

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.834
on the campaign trail.

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:11.750
KYLE EWING: Excellent.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.250
And what was your
reaction, Michael?

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.295
MICHAEL TUBBS: At
first I was excited.

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:17.170
But then I went home.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.880
I talked to my campaign manager.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.207
He said absolutely not.

00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:21.040
You're too reckless.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.206
They're going to catch you
in gotcha moments-- going

00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:24.940
to ruin the rest of your career.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.230
And then I remember
talking to my mom.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.920
And she said absolutely, for
you, I refuse to be on camera.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.180
I don't want them
asking me any questions.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.040
I don't want to be interviewed.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.970
And then if you
watch the movie it's,

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.590
really about my campaign manager
and my mom, which is so ironic.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.574
They were so against it.

00:01:39.574 --> 00:01:41.990
KYLE EWING: I love how the
campaign manager at many points

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.650
tried to mother you
too, throughout.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.858
MICHAEL TUBBS: He still does.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.410
KYLE EWING: Now,
Kevin, I understand

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.970
this was your first
feature-length documentary.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.794
So how did you get
involved in the project?

00:01:51.794 --> 00:01:54.210
KEVIN GORDON: I knew Jhanvi
and Ketaki through film school

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.070
at Stanford.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.640
And they reached out to me
about working on the project.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.790
And I had a background
in social justice work

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.040
and been looking for something
that would reconnect me

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.920
with that as well
my first project.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.709
And when I heard
about Michael I just

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.250
knew it was going to be a good
fit and a really fun, exciting

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.715
piece of history to document.

00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:11.340
KYLE EWING: And how
long from beginning

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.720
to end-- as far as when you
guys decided to make the film

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.410
and you had just
decided to run--

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.040
how long was that process?

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.280
JHANVI SHRIRAM: Almost
two and a half years.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.946
KYLE EWING: Wow.

00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:20.960
JHANVI SHRIRAM: We
started spring of 2012.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.110
And we just premiered at the
Tribeca Film Festival in April.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.190
So it was our first
public screening.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.488
So we're starting to take
it out more places now.

00:02:28.488 --> 00:02:29.196
KYLE EWING: Yeah.

00:02:29.196 --> 00:02:30.529
I was going to ask, what's next?

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:32.460
I mean, Tribeca--
huge congratulations.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.310
That's a huge accomplishment.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.880
JHANVI SHRIRAM: Thank you.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.590
We are taking it out
to film festivals,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.260
doing special
screenings like this,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.560
taking it to
schools, nonprofits,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.320
and also seeking
distribution right now.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.950
So we don't have any
public knowledge yet.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.000
But hopefully soon
we'll be able to make it

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.634
to theaters or streaming
in other platforms.

00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:50.800
KYLE EWING: Huge to take on.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.300
I mean, the first
of a lot of things

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.930
for all of you-- first
time to run, first time

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.264
to produce to--
feature-length film.

00:02:58.264 --> 00:02:59.680
Where were you
guys when you heard

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.290
that Tribeca had
invited you to premier?

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.900
KETAKI SHRIRAM:
We actually all--

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.390
we met up for
dinner in Palo Alto.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.266
And we brought cupcakes.

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:10.140
Michael knows us now.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.670
Whenever we bring
dessert, it means

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.600
something exciting's happened.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.610
And so that was kind of
how we broke the news.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.210
We were all very excited.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.720
KYLE EWING: Congratulations.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.049
Now Michael, you've become
an inspiration, I think,

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:24.840
from the beginning.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.055
You've inspired youth
all over the place.

00:03:27.055 --> 00:03:28.680
And I'd love to hear
how you're dealing

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.810
with your new-found
role model status.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.060
MICHAEL TUBBS: It's difficult.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.454
No, I think-- I've also
been incredibly blessed

00:03:35.454 --> 00:03:37.620
because the film does a
good job of showing just how

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.400
humble my family
and friends are.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.560
So my inner circle,
they don't care

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.580
whether Tribeca, or
Google Talk, or anything.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.530
Nothing's cool enough
for them anymore, anyway.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.540
So they really keep me
grounded and humble.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.040
OK.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.914
Don't get big-headed.

00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:51.560
OK.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.640
You just had homicide
on your street.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.300
What are you doing about that?

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.540
OK.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.480
These kids still can't read.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.730
What are you doing about that?

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.730
So I'm always pushed
to really focus on it.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.580
And I guess especially
because Stockton

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.640
is an incredibly complex
place, none of these

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.870
are easy things to solve.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.850
So it's kind of hard to be
too caught up in yourself

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.020
when you have these issues
that are really difficult.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.895
But I also think that
being a role model,

00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:14.520
to answer your
question, because that's

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.394
what you asked me about--
being a role model.

00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:18.730
I think in terms of
being a role model,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.120
I like it because it keeps
you really focused on trying

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.300
to-- not being perfect--
I'm far from that.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.030
But trying to be my
best self every day.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.858
And then when I do mess
up or say something

00:04:26.858 --> 00:04:28.316
I shouldn't have
said in a meeting,

00:04:28.316 --> 00:04:32.604
I learned how to apologize
and model that as well.

00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:34.020
KYLE EWING: You
talked a lot and I

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.150
knew you really demonstrated
how important it

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.250
is to build a
coalition of people

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.710
in the community to
really affect change.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.820
Can you tell us more about how
you define civic responsibility

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.530
for yourself?

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.030
MICHAEL TUBBS: It's
funny, actually,

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.790
just to-- see I'm
not even answering

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.451
your questions [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:50.450
KYLE EWING: That's fine.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.600
Whatever works.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.266
MICHAEL TUBBS: I
wanted to say, in terms

00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:55.230
of the coalition-building,
I learned a lot of that

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.360
actually as an intern
at Google, in terms

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.859
of building a
cross-functional team.

00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:00.150
See, I got you.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.220
KYLE EWING: I like it.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.960
KYLE EWING: But I think for me,
civic responsibility is number

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.030
one, making the right
decisions as an elected,

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.940
regardless of the
political consequences.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.370
But number two is also about
empowering the residents

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.610
because Stockton
is 300,000 people.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.940
I represent 50,000 people.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.970
But it's a part-time job.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.574
I can't be everywhere
in the district.

00:05:20.574 --> 00:05:22.240
I don't live everywhere
in the district.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.260
I don't speak Spanish well.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.410
I don't speak Hmong well.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.660
I don't speak Vietnamese well.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.670
I don't speak all the different
languages in my district

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.220
that well.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.660
So it's really about,
how do I engage everyone?

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.981
How do I engage with the
huge-- substantial undocumented

00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:37.480
population in my
district so they're

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.650
part of the
decision-making process?

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.600
So in doing so, we've done
a lot of coalition-building

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.510
around improving outcomes
for Boys and Men of Color

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.910
around my district in terms
of our Reinvent South Stockton

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.910
coalition around organizing
the black community.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.540
Because that's the only way in
our current political structure

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.164
in Stockton that the
work can get done.

00:05:56.164 --> 00:05:57.820
Because I just can't
do it all myself

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.528
KYLE EWING: Yeah.

00:05:58.528 --> 00:06:00.950
No, absolutely.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.620
You've also referenced
in the film--

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.230
and since I've known
you and certainly read

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.660
a lot of great things about
you-- how Martin Luther

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.912
King really inspired you.

00:06:08.912 --> 00:06:11.120
I'd love to hear more about
the civil rights movement

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.860
and how that's really influenced
your leadership style.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.690
MICHAEL TUBBS: This is
going to be a long answer

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.295
but I think there's
a couple things.

00:06:16.295 --> 00:06:18.420
My junior year-- junior
year was such a great year.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.725
So I interned at Google.

00:06:19.725 --> 00:06:21.264
Then I went to the White House.

00:06:21.264 --> 00:06:22.430
Then I partied in Cape Town.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.840
And then when I got back, I got
to reenact these freedom rides

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.214
with the original
freedom riders.

00:06:26.214 --> 00:06:28.830
So I spent 10 days with the
original freedom riders.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.500
And we went from
DC to New Orleans.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.240
So we went to
Montgomery, Alabama,

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.130
where people beaten
in Montgomery

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.580
that-- it was just a really
very powerful and special time.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.730
From them, I learned a lot.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.480
the first thing was
that they were all 19,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.310
20, 21, 22-years-old when
they were on this bus.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.170
And Doctor King was
26 when he started,

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.030
when he led the bus
boycott in Montgomery.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.390
So they were all really young.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.473
And they would say things.

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:54.140
And there was one conversation
in particular-- a man,

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.310
Bob Singleton.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.990
He's a professor at LMU now.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.520
We brought him out to Stockton
for Black History Month.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.978
And we were on the
back of the bus.

00:06:59.978 --> 00:07:01.175
And we were cracking jokes.

00:07:01.175 --> 00:07:02.630
And he was just staring at me.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.909
So I'm staring back
at him, like OK.

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:05.450
I'll be good.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.110
I'll be quiet.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.959
And then he says, young man.

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:08.750
And I say, yes sir.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.386
And he said, I was
arrested on August 4, 1961.

00:07:13.386 --> 00:07:14.640
I said, OK.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.700
And then he said, why
is that day important?

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.851
And I said, because
you were arrested.

00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:21.350
And that's important
for my freedom.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.720
I would not be on this bus if
you weren't arrested that day.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.225
I heard you I was listening.

00:07:24.225 --> 00:07:25.120
And then he laughed.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.380
And then he said, on that
day, Barack Obama was born.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.040
And then he said,
I was 19-years-old.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.380
I had no idea that the
decision I made at 19

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.610
would pave the way 50
years later for a kid who

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.090
couldn't get a cup of
coffee to become president.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.840
And then he said, what
are you doing today

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.980
so that 50 years from
now a kid in Stockton

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.642
has every opportunity you had?

00:07:42.642 --> 00:07:44.100
And I was 20-years-old
at the time.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.490
I was trying to figure out
life and what I wanted to do.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.930
And that really stuck with me.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.810
And then one of
my biggest mentors

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:50.852
is Marian Wright Edelman.

00:07:50.852 --> 00:07:52.935
And she's the head of
[? the Children's ?] Defense

00:07:52.935 --> 00:07:53.690
Fund.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.130
She marched with Doctor King.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.240
She was a-- first
African American woman

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.915
admitted to the
Mississippi state bar.

00:07:58.915 --> 00:08:00.290
She practiced law
in Mississippi.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.710
This huge civil rights
advocate that's been

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.040
active for the past 50 years
doing social justice work.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.272
And I was able to be
[INAUDIBLE] programs

00:08:08.272 --> 00:08:09.230
all throughout college.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.190
So I would get these
nuggets of wisdom from her.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.320
And the biggest one
she said was that it's

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.310
a privilege to
struggle for justice.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.210
And I said, huh?

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.835
She said, it's a
privilege to struggle.

00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:23.335
And she said, because you come
from a long line of struggle.

00:08:23.335 --> 00:08:25.560
And she brought it back
from Harriet Tubman, who

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.100
couldn't read but
somehow knew how

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.620
to read the stars and outsmarted
everyone and freed people.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.460
She just went down
throughout history.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.246
And then she said, justice
work is like a baton.

00:08:34.246 --> 00:08:35.870
It's a privilege to
be given the mantle

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.530
to keep the work forward.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.954
So I've just learned a
lot from the civil rights

00:08:39.954 --> 00:08:41.870
movement people in terms
of what I've studied.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.286
But also those I've been able
to have a relationship with.

00:08:44.286 --> 00:08:45.170
KYLE EWING: Yeah.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.030
Well speaking of
influence, Kevin,

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.500
I'd love to hear-- I've heard
that directors will have

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.715
a vision when they
embark on a project.

00:08:52.715 --> 00:08:55.090
And then when it's all said
and done for better or worse,

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.423
that vision has sort of shifted.

00:08:56.423 --> 00:08:57.810
And it's played out differently.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.200
Was there anything that's
different about the narrative

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.430
that we saw than what you
thought it might look like?

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.680
KEVIN GORDON: Yeah definitely.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.950
I'd say stylistically,
I wanted the film

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.272
to fit into this long
tradition of political campaign

00:09:10.272 --> 00:09:12.480
documentaries which are all
kind of that run-and-gun,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.260
chasing the candidate
kind of look.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.760
But as far as what we thought
the storyline was going to be,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.110
we definitely
thought the opponent

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.901
was going to be a bigger
part of the story.

00:09:20.901 --> 00:09:23.280
And he turned out not to be.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.220
And the bigger challenge
was the problems

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.010
facing the city as well as
Michael's own transformation

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.280
over the course of the campaign.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.590
And the other big surprise
was the campaign manager

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.920
because Nick, first
day when we were there,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.670
he didn't even want
me to film the meeting

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.795
he was having with Michael.

00:09:40.795 --> 00:09:42.690
He was like, oh, no,
it's too high level.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.689
And then by the end he was
like, OK you can film just this.

00:09:45.689 --> 00:09:47.730
And then it just kept
growing until he completely

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.150
opened up to us about
his entire life.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.520
And I'd say his back
story and his motivation

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.970
was the biggest
surprise in the film.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.870
And then Michael's
mom-- as Michael said,

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.160
she wasn't on board at first.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.800
And she had this
really amazing ability

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.300
to sense when the
camera was on her,

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.320
even if I was on the
other side of the room.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.780
She would just turn around.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.500
I was like OK, OK, don't film.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:13.270
But she gave us just enough
to have this tremendous arc

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.166
that I think's a beautiful
part of the film.

00:10:15.166 --> 00:10:15.874
KYLE EWING: Yeah.

00:10:15.874 --> 00:10:16.420
Yeah.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.585
Can you guys tell us
about the title, True Son?

00:10:19.585 --> 00:10:20.460
KETAKI SHRIRAM: Yeah.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.460
We read about Michael being the
true son returning to Stockton.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.000
And we thought that was a
really interesting parallel

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.940
and reflected a lot
of things in the film.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.229
And we sat down and
had a discussion

00:10:31.229 --> 00:10:32.520
about what the title should be.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.662
And we were like, I
think True Son is it.

00:10:34.662 --> 00:10:36.120
It started out as
the working title

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.120
and then felt like it
really fit with the vision

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.850
that we'd all been
thinking about.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.797
KYLE EWING: Celebrate
with cupcakes or Froyo?

00:10:41.797 --> 00:10:43.505
KETAKI SHRIRAM: There
were some cupcakes.

00:10:43.505 --> 00:10:43.970
KYLE EWING: I figured.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.120
KETAKI SHRIRAM: I have
a weakness for that.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.520
KYLE EWING: I do want
to open it up soon so.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.978
If you guys do have
questions start

00:10:48.978 --> 00:10:52.242
thinking about-- we'll
get the microphone to you.

00:10:52.242 --> 00:10:54.450
Because we do have some
interns here in the audience.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:55.300
It's only fitting.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.420
We've got Michael, who's
former BOLD intern.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.090
And both Jhanvi and Ketaki
were former interns,

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.170
too-- YouTube and
Google X. I'd love

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.530
to hear some words of
advice that you might have

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.700
for some people
here who are interns

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.730
and what they can do this
summer to really take advantage.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:12.730
MICHAEL TUBBS: Me first?

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:13.438
KYLE EWING: Sure.

00:11:13.438 --> 00:11:15.054
MICHAEL TUBBS: Awesome.

00:11:15.054 --> 00:11:16.220
I would say a couple things.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.820
Number one have fun.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.903
Google is such a fun place.

00:11:19.903 --> 00:11:21.606
I had the time of my life here.

00:11:21.606 --> 00:11:23.230
You thought I was
YOLO on the campaign.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.200
I was in the kitchens.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.810
I was on the slides.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.560
I mean-- my boss is
here, Ms. [? Dogga. ?]

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.000
She can attest that I did work.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.350
But I made sure I had a
good time while doing it.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.310
I think Google really--
I think number two is

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:34.500
seek out opportunities
for growth

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.590
and to challenge yourself.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.450
I remember by my
fourth week I was

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.075
leading new-hire
orientation by myself,

00:11:39.075 --> 00:11:41.491
which is kind of terrifying
because I didn't know anything

00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:42.120
about anything.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.500
And these [? nuclears ?] were
asking all these benefits

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.719
questions about the 401(k)s
and their vacation days.

00:11:47.719 --> 00:11:49.760
And I had to read through
the stuff on the Google

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.340
internal website.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.590
But seriously, I think those
challenges really helped.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.048
Also, number three, the people
you meet in the BOLD program

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:57.670
are probably the
most important part.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.480
All my BOLD friends are here.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.140
I still talk to-- we
talk to after BOLD.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.905
I met some of my
best friends in BOLD.

00:12:03.905 --> 00:12:05.780
And then even some of
the managers and people

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.571
I worked with I still
keep in contact with.

00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:10.860
And they're really
smart, amazing people.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.630
KYLE EWING: Michael walks in,
he's like, where's the MK?

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.988
You can take someone out of
Google but you can't take--

00:12:15.988 --> 00:12:18.654
MICHAEL TUBBS: I was hoping we'd
be in [? Crid ?] because I used

00:12:18.654 --> 00:12:20.940
to go-- they used to
have the Mexican food

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:21.940
with the free guacamole.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.464
That was my
favorite-- free guac.

00:12:25.464 --> 00:12:27.880
KYLE EWING: So opportunities
for leadership and guacamole.

00:12:30.491 --> 00:12:31.990
KETAKI SHRIRAM:
Yeah I guess I would

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.244
say go to as many
events as possible

00:12:34.244 --> 00:12:35.660
and meet as many
people as you can

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.800
who don't work in
your department.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.900
I think that was the most
interesting thing for me,

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.870
was really getting out and
meeting all the other interns

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.390
and all the other
full-timers and just learning

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.110
about what they do.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.400
Because everybody here has such
a unique and different role.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.524
And that was, I think, some
of the biggest learning

00:12:47.524 --> 00:12:49.340
opportunities for me
was just going to TGIF

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.756
and sitting next
to someone random

00:12:50.756 --> 00:12:53.572
and just introducing myself and
learning about what they do.

00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:55.030
JHANVI SHRIRAM:
And I will probably

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.090
echo the same sentiments.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.680
It's just meeting the
people around you--

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.950
the ones on your left and right.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.824
And I know I met Marjay--
who helped organize

00:13:00.824 --> 00:13:02.710
this-- when I was an intern.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:06.140
And you meet some of the most
creative and intelligent people

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:06.640
here.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.210
And you never know it
sometimes because you're so

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.020
buried in your computers
or your phones.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.545
And so sometimes it's
great to look up and talk

00:13:12.545 --> 00:13:14.170
to the person next
to you, whether it's

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.890
in the MK or even here today.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.880
The people are incredible.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.660
KYLE EWING: Great.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:24.140
Any questions from the
audience [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.240
he'll bring you the mic.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.410
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is
[INAUDIBLE] Jean Pierre.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.141
And I'm also a BOLD intern.

00:13:31.141 --> 00:13:33.682
And I want to thank you all for
doing the film because I know

00:13:33.682 --> 00:13:35.610
it must have took a lot
of work, and then also

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.901
hearing your inspirational
story because I also grew up

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:39.234
from a single-parent household.

00:13:39.234 --> 00:13:40.400
I'm from Brooklyn, New York.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.312
And I also want to run
for office one day.

00:13:42.312 --> 00:13:43.520
I change my mind every night.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.370
My roommates, they laugh.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.150
But coming from a
disadvantaged background,

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.815
and going to college,
and being in D.C.--

00:13:51.815 --> 00:13:53.860
and engage myself with
political leaders.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.235
I realize it's
really challenging

00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:56.776
being in that
environment, and trying

00:13:56.776 --> 00:13:59.304
to make your way into
the political sphere,

00:13:59.304 --> 00:14:00.970
and trying to get
your foot in the door.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.770
And I was wondering
what advice could you

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:07.890
give to aspiring civic
advocates or politicians

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.942
to be elected one day
in their community?

00:14:11.942 --> 00:14:12.858
MICHAEL TUBBS: Man.

00:14:12.858 --> 00:14:14.480
I forgot Google
people are smart.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.280
So you guys are asking
smart questions.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.475
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:17.475 --> 00:14:19.100
MICHAEL TUBBS: I
think a couple things.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.310
I think number one, it
has to be more than just

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.640
about an office or a position.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.200
There has to be an issue or some
policy that really motivates

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.650
you because no one
likes politicians.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.060
I don't like politicians.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.520
if you're really
just a politician,

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.920
you're not my friend
[INAUDIBLE] to work with you.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.830
The second thing I would
say is just be authentic.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.000
I think oftentimes,
people think they

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.455
need to fit into
some sort of mold

00:14:41.455 --> 00:14:42.955
of what it means
to be a politician.

00:14:42.955 --> 00:14:44.930
But especially at a
really local level,

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.400
people value authenticity.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.795
They value people who
can speak the truth, who

00:14:48.795 --> 00:14:50.750
can say they don't know
when they don't know,

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.666
who will say they want
a mimosa at brunch when

00:14:52.666 --> 00:14:54.400
they're at brunch with mimosas.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.340
People value that.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.861
I think number three--
and what I realized

00:14:58.861 --> 00:15:00.360
and I think the
film does a good job

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.050
showing it-- is that the
relationships I built before I

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.130
knew I was running for
office were so helpful.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.440
All the people that walked
and knocked on doors for me

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.474
were people I met, and
I was in high school,

00:15:09.474 --> 00:15:11.890
and I helped tutor them, or
they were kids I had mentored,

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.250
or they were people
I had gone out with

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:15.420
and we had a good time.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.407
So I think it's about really
caring about relationships

00:15:19.407 --> 00:15:20.240
in the here and now.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.510
And then number four,
I think it's also

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:22.885
about building
some sort of skill

00:15:22.885 --> 00:15:24.510
set in terms of what can you do?

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:25.390
What have you done?

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.780
Because oftentimes
people look at past--

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.330
it's just like
looking for a job.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:30.746
People look at
past success-- even

00:15:30.746 --> 00:15:34.180
if it's on a smaller scale--
to illustrate future progress.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.660
And I would say on
the skills I learned,

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.530
whether running my own
nonprofit in college,

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.821
or running my own summer
leadership program in college,

00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:44.190
or working at Google,
on the smaller scale,

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.190
it's still the same skills
I use now as a politician.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.750
And the last point
I would say is

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.340
get really good at
working with people

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.740
because-- I'm going to
tell you a funny story

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.984
and then I'm going
to stop talking.

00:15:54.984 --> 00:15:57.400
Before I came here I was in a
meeting around a health care

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.550
clinic in my district with
two ultra-conservative, older

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.850
white men who, I love.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.380
So they invite me in.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.664
And then he gives me this
pen to take notes with.

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:06.455
It says The Factor.

00:16:06.455 --> 00:16:08.010
And I'm like, this
a really good pen.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:08.770
So I was going to
try to take it.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.478
But I didn't want to
feed the stereotype.

00:16:10.478 --> 00:16:13.240
So I say-- so I gave
him his pen back.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.920
And he said, no
you could keep it.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.970
It's my premium member
O'Reilly Factor pen.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.550
I just look at him.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.035
I don't like O'Reilly that much.

00:16:21.035 --> 00:16:22.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.570
MICHAEL TUBBS: So I look
at him, whatever, it works.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.550
And then he started-- and then
they both huddled in and were

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.400
like, "we're
ultra-conservatives."

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.832
And then I say,
oh I forgive you.

00:16:31.832 --> 00:16:33.040
And we just started laughing.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.540
And I say, I'm going
to write really

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.270
progressive legislation with
your O'Reilly Factor pen.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.850
I share that story
just to illustrate

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.072
that oftentimes labels operate
as silos to stop people

00:16:43.072 --> 00:16:44.280
from working with each other.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.162
Because although we probably
don't agree on a lot of things,

00:16:47.162 --> 00:16:48.620
we agree that people
in my district

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.661
need health care clinics.

00:16:49.661 --> 00:16:52.231
And I'm glad I didn't let their
labels as ultra-conservative

00:16:52.231 --> 00:16:54.730
stop me from spending an hour
and a half with them designing

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:55.396
a health clinic.

00:16:55.396 --> 00:16:57.230
Because it's important.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.970
I'm not sure what the
point was of that.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.237
But yeah, that's my advice.

00:17:00.237 --> 00:17:00.736
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:00.736 --> 00:17:01.890
JHANVI SHRIRAM: And to
piggyback off of that.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:04.300
We do have a YouTube
channel-- shameless plug--

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.720
youtube.com/truesondoc
where we've gathered a lot

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.400
of the process pieces of the
campaign that couldn't go

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.985
on into film to show
in a web series,

00:17:12.985 --> 00:17:14.859
how do you build a
campaign as a 21-year-old?

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:16.170
So how do you do fund-raising?

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:17.525
How do you do canvassing?

00:17:17.525 --> 00:17:18.900
How do you bring
people together?

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.371
And so we've got these short
snippets on YouTube as well.

00:17:22.371 --> 00:17:23.579
MICHAEL TUBBS: So last thing.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.116
You're smart, so stay smart.

00:17:25.116 --> 00:17:27.490
Because no, seriously, because
oftentimes when people get

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.160
elected they become dumb.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.730
Seriously, some of the things
they say just don't make sense.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.140
Did you read the staff report?

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.872
So please just be smart.

00:17:34.872 --> 00:17:35.580
Do your homework.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.780
Do research.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.210
Let data guide your decisions.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.450
Because oftentimes people
make decisions off,

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.080
back when I was
a kid this works.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:42.780
We're going to do this.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:43.750
What does the research say?

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.166
A lot of people
don't do research.

00:17:47.839 --> 00:17:49.130
AUDIENCE: So I'm Arthur Peters.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.720
I'm a tech intern here.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.510
And I found the film
very interesting.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.186
And so one thing is--
first comment, which

00:17:56.186 --> 00:17:57.560
is have you
considered re-editing

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.030
all the other footage
in this into a how-to?

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:05.699
Just have a how-to film--
Campaigning for Dummies,

00:18:05.699 --> 00:18:06.240
or something.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.740
You can get access
to the trademark.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.110
Anyway, my other
question is, so you're

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.880
talking a lot about campaigns
and this sort of stuff.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.589
And I really do want to be
involved in some of this.

00:18:15.589 --> 00:18:17.880
But it's utterly terrifying
as someone who would rather

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.340
talk to a computer than a human.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.690
So what can someone
like me-- who

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:26.300
is very good with
mathematics, engineering,

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:31.381
whatever-- what can I bring
to a campaign like this?

00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:32.880
MICHAEL TUBBS: My
man, are you open?

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.380
Are you--

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.740
AUDIENCE: Well no.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.430
I mean I'm an intern,
but thank you.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:45.490
MICHAEL TUBBS: I think I'mma
talk a lot so [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.156
KEVIN GORDON: There's
definitely a place

00:18:47.156 --> 00:18:48.990
for technology in campaigns.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:51.060
Actually, at one point
Michael and his campaign

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.024
tried to be innovative
and have the first-- what

00:18:54.024 --> 00:18:54.690
did you call it?

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.356
MICHAEL TUBBS: Google
Hangout Town Hall.

00:18:56.356 --> 00:18:56.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:59.480
KEVIN GORDON: It was a Town
hall via Google Hangout, which--

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.855
MICHAEL TUBBS: It
was a disaster.

00:19:00.855 --> 00:19:01.680
But we tried.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.940
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.360
KEVIN GORDON: That was
actually the saddest thing

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.401
for me was that that didn't
make it in the movie.

00:19:06.401 --> 00:19:07.610
Because that was hilarious.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.190
So I think there's
definitely some improvements

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.190
that we could have made.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.981
JHANVI SHRIRAM: Google
Hangouts is awesome.

00:19:11.981 --> 00:19:13.565
We used it a lot to
plan for the film.

00:19:13.565 --> 00:19:15.230
Because we were all
in different places.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.770
So it was successful
in some parts

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.937
of the film of the campaign.

00:19:17.937 --> 00:19:19.311
KEVIN GORDON: I
just met somebody

00:19:19.311 --> 00:19:20.980
who's got an app
called Organizer.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.970
And they are turning everything
that Michael and his campaign

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:25.840
were doing into an app
that's unbelievable.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.402
One of the biggest things was
they have walk lists, which--

00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:30.360
Michael's campaign they
weren't even using them

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.276
when we first started.

00:19:31.276 --> 00:19:32.932
But then there was
always a disaster

00:19:32.932 --> 00:19:35.390
or often there was a disaster
because they were misprinted.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.680
And it has the name of the
person you're talking to,

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.824
their address, their
previous voting history.

00:19:39.824 --> 00:19:41.240
But now there's
an app that has it

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.761
all just on a phone
along with the script

00:19:43.761 --> 00:19:45.010
right there for people to use.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:49.027
So that really--
revolutionizing campaign work.

00:19:49.027 --> 00:19:50.110
MICHAEL TUBBS: Absolutely.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.010
Technology-- I
wish-- I was going

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:53.780
to try to get someone to teach
me how to code before here.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.800
But I got here a
little bit too late.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.200
I wish I had that skill set.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.707
Because I feel
like a lot of stuff

00:19:57.707 --> 00:19:59.540
I do could be a lot
more efficient if I just

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.217
knew the computer-y stuff to do.

00:20:01.217 --> 00:20:02.675
So to your question,
I really think

00:20:02.675 --> 00:20:04.466
there's a lot of things
with building apps,

00:20:04.466 --> 00:20:07.122
with helping people use data
and analytics more effectively,

00:20:07.122 --> 00:20:09.080
in terms of helping people
with their websites.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.615
A lot of political websites
aren't really functional.

00:20:11.615 --> 00:20:12.448
AUDIENCE: Oh my god.

00:20:12.448 --> 00:20:13.010
It's so bad.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:13.829
MICHAEL TUBBS: Man.

00:20:13.829 --> 00:20:14.620
AUDIENCE: Big ones.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.062
MICHAEL TUBBS: But my
website's high tech.

00:20:17.062 --> 00:20:18.312
Everyone's not feeling it.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.310
There's a whole, probably,
consultancy out there

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:27.190
of people who need really smart,
techie people to help them make

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.086
their campaign into
the 21st century.

00:20:30.086 --> 00:20:32.100
That could be your tag
line, making campaigns

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.117
into the 21st century.

00:20:35.117 --> 00:20:35.950
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.320
KYLE EWING: Anyone else?

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.620
The former manager--

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.495
MICHAEL TUBBS: Uh oh.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.130
AUDIENCE: So Michael, you
could have done anything.

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:53.150
You've got such a passion
to affect change and also

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.370
this ability to
connect with people.

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:58.540
So what is it-- you could have
affected change in Stockton

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.900
in so many ways.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.100
Tell us a little
bit about why run?

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.807
And why is this your
mechanism right now?

00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:09.140
MICHAEL TUBBS: That's another
long-- I'm sorry you guys.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.931
I don't really talk
this long all the time.

00:21:10.931 --> 00:21:13.350
But these are very
thorough questions.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.730
I think it was a couple things.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.816
So my senior year I was
applying for things.

00:21:17.816 --> 00:21:19.190
And after my cousin
was murdered,

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.620
I said I was going back
to Stockton one day.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.890
But it was going to be in,
like, 2020 because I wanted

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.390
to make some money
like my mom said.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.130
That was our secret plan.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.660
Or not-so secret plan.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.340
But then I was really
trying to think about,

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.800
what's the biggest way
to make an impact now?

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.410
And I figured interning
for someone or work

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.870
being as someone's staffer
could make an impact.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.540
But being on City
Council, even if I lost,

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.510
is changing the narrative and
the course of the campaign--

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:46.580
would make a real change.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:49.984
And I still could apply for
jobs and stuff afterwards.

00:21:49.984 --> 00:21:51.900
So I think that for me,
that was the question.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.920
Where can I make the
most impact right

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.320
now-- a 21-year-old
with no real experience?

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.812
And well, campaigns are really--
that's a real meritocracy.

00:21:59.812 --> 00:22:01.020
You just have to get elected.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:01.980
You don't really need
to know anything.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.890
If you get 51% of the vote,
you're now making decisions.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.629
So I thought, at
21-years-old that

00:22:06.629 --> 00:22:08.920
was the biggest way I could
make an impact on the city.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.420
Especially because
when I ran we had just

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.750
gotten to two years
of record homicide.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.230
We had just declared bankruptcy.

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.224
It was really not
the place to be.

00:22:17.224 --> 00:22:18.140
So I said, oh my gosh.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.640
This would be-- I'm kind
of weird like this--

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.050
I was like, oh my gosh.

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.950
It would be a great opportunity
to affectualize some change.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.130
But I'm not
convinced that's what

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:26.777
it's going to be
for me long-term.

00:22:26.777 --> 00:22:28.985
I think at some point I want
to do some philanthropy.

00:22:28.985 --> 00:22:31.600
Because I spend all my time
calling foundations and saying,

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.080
I need you to invest in this.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.640
So I think there's a
role for philanthropy.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.690
Also, I teach too, full-time.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.885
So I think at some point
I want to open a school

00:22:39.885 --> 00:22:41.150
or be a superintendent.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.810
So I'm really just keeping
myself really open in terms

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.970
of where can I make
the most impact.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.555
But I do think
through 2016, being

00:22:48.555 --> 00:22:51.650
on City Council is probably
the biggest way to do that.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:53.150
KYLE EWING: I have
a quick follow up

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:54.590
and then we'll hand it to you.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.279
Quickly, on that, you
talk about impact.

00:22:56.279 --> 00:22:58.570
And one of the things that
really struck me in the film

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.740
is you talk about
your life experiences,

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.590
to this point, really
teaching you to be optimistic,

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:06.440
and that things that
start out bad most of time

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.062
turn out good eventually.

00:23:08.062 --> 00:23:10.020
You've just mentioned
Stockton's homicide rate.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.920
It's down like 60%
since you've been in.

00:23:15.744 --> 00:23:17.493
MICHAEL TUBBS: I wish
I could take credit.

00:23:17.493 --> 00:23:18.762
I just came down
from Mount Sinai

00:23:18.762 --> 00:23:19.610
with the ten commandments.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:21.610
KYLE EWING: But what do
you attribute the change

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:22.607
to-- the decrease?

00:23:22.607 --> 00:23:24.440
MICHAEL TUBBS: I do
have a small part in it.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.690
And I will take a
little bit in that.

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:26.790
KYLE EWING: Take it.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.270
MICHAEL TUBBS: I think that
number one, the community

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.250
got really serious
about the crime problem.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:33.500
So we brought this thing
called Operation Ceasefire,

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.100
which is like the number
one, evidence-based,

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.210
not experience-based, not
just how-I-feel-based,

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.650
but evidence-- there's
research that shows it works--

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:41.340
based program.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.379
And we had it
about a decade ago.

00:23:43.379 --> 00:23:44.170
And it was working.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.500
And then after we
got homicides down.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.042
We let it go.

00:23:47.042 --> 00:23:48.583
So this time we're
really-- I've been

00:23:48.583 --> 00:23:50.120
adamant about
institutionalizing it.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.760
So that's been really helpful.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.929
And then this summer
we're opening this Office

00:23:53.929 --> 00:23:56.470
of Violence Prevention that I've
worked close with the police

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:59.750
chief in designing to figure
out how to become the nation's

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:03.570
leader in evidence-based
violence prevention programs.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.647
And we've also really
widened our thinking past,

00:24:06.647 --> 00:24:08.550
we need to
incarcerate everybody.

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.590
We're just going to
throw them in jail

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.730
and that's going to
solve their problem.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.410
But really look at some
of the root causes.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.480
What's going on in the schools?

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.813
What's going on in the families?

00:24:14.813 --> 00:24:17.454
And then using data
to predict things.

00:24:17.454 --> 00:24:19.370
It's almost like people
analytics in terms of,

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.920
what are some of the triggers
that make someone likely to be

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.780
a victim or approached
for a crime?

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.224
And since we have
that data, we use it.

00:24:26.224 --> 00:24:27.640
And I'm a nervous
so this is going

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.240
to be my quick [INAUDIBLE]
though we found out that of all

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.760
the homicide
victims and suspects

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.844
in Stockton, most of them
had been arrested six times

00:24:35.844 --> 00:24:37.260
and were on
probation, or just off

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.060
probation, which means
we knew who they were.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.070
We have contact with them.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.680
And we have leverage
to bring them in.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.850
So we finally used that
data to call them in

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:45.249
and say, hey we
know who you are.

00:24:45.249 --> 00:24:47.040
We know what groups
you're affiliated with.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.660
We know you guys are
beefing with this group.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.720
Here are some job training.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.095
Here's some tattoo
removal if you

00:24:51.095 --> 00:24:52.849
want resources
and opportunities.

00:24:52.849 --> 00:24:54.890
But if that doesn't work,
here's a U.S. attorney.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.024
And surprisingly,
people take opportunity

00:24:57.024 --> 00:24:58.190
when it's presented to them.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:59.400
It's like, woah.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.650
KYLE EWING: Novel, novel idea.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.115
MICHAEL TUBBS: They don't
want to be gangsters.

00:25:03.115 --> 00:25:06.410
KYLE EWING: [CHUCKLES]
Hey how's it going?

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:07.669
My name is Ally Bernstein.

00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:09.710
I'm on the Diversity
Markets team here at Google.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:13.750
And as one of the first people
that I met on my first day

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:17.835
at Google, I wanted to say ,
I'm very proud of Michael Tubbs.

00:25:17.835 --> 00:25:19.160
You've come a long way.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.900
I've been crying this whole day.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.830
So thank you for
making me proud.

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.219
I have a question
for you, actually.

00:25:27.219 --> 00:25:29.510
How have you thought about
ways to connect the problems

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:30.760
that you're solving
here in Stockton

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.560
to other cities that
are going through

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.739
the same exact problems?

00:25:33.739 --> 00:25:35.280
Because I think it's
really important

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.260
that some of the lessons
that you're learning

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.420
are lessons that can
directly, immediately

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.230
be applied to areas such
as Oakland, Long Beach,

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.615
California, where I'm from,
and other major cities that

00:25:44.615 --> 00:25:45.790
are having some of
these same issues.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:48.220
So I wanted to get your
thoughts on what you guys were

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.790
doing to spread that knowledge.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:53.430
MICHAEL TUBBS: I think
there's a couple things.

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:57.200
I'm kind of cautious because
one year or two years is cool.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.410
But you need four or
five years to really

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.090
be like, this is working.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:04.389
But generally-- I was just on a
panel with the mayor of Oakland

00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:05.680
and I told her about Ceasefire.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.230
We need to institutionalize
Ceasefire, do it right.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.370
I was just at a conference
with the mayor of Compton, Aja

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.720
Brown, this amazing,
32-year-old, USC-trained

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.410
planner who is now
the mayor of Compton.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:18.420
And I was telling her about some
stuff we're doing in Stockton.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.664
And then there's a lot of
networks and conferences

00:26:20.664 --> 00:26:22.830
and things that people are
so interested in Stockton

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:25.050
because of a lot of
challenges we face.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:27.140
And we're kind of ground
zero for a lot of things,

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.650
whether it's municipal
bankruptcy, or water issues,

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.520
or homelessness, or we're
the foreclosure capital

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.950
of the world, or homicide.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:35.810
We're really ground
zero for every problem

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.292
facing the country.

00:26:37.292 --> 00:26:38.750
But it also gives
us an opportunity

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.767
to emerge as one of
the leaders in terms

00:26:40.767 --> 00:26:42.100
of how you solve those problems.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.970
So we've been doing a good job.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.150
But I think once we have
some real concrete wins,

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:49.710
we'll do a better job of telling
our story and helping to scale.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:50.820
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.060
MICHAEL TUBBS: Go ahead.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:51.480
KETAKI SHRIRAM: Sorry, go ahead.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.320
MICHAEL TUBBS: No.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.580
KETAKI SHRIRAM: Go ahead.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.960
I was just going to say
with regards to the film,

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.540
we sort of have similar thought.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.910
So we were really hoping to
screen the films in schools,

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.993
and churches, and prisons
in different communities

00:27:01.993 --> 00:27:03.590
to try and really
get youth inspired

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.696
to take political
action or to even

00:27:05.696 --> 00:27:06.820
aspire to higher education.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.860
And when we were in New York we
screened the film at a prison

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:10.452
in Manhattan.

00:27:10.452 --> 00:27:12.160
And I think for all
of us that was really

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.510
one of the most
moving experiences,

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.051
was seeing how people
responded to it

00:27:15.051 --> 00:27:17.430
and how they were inspired
to make a difference.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.750
So on the film end, that's
what we're thinking.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.500
MICHAEL TUBBS: I'm
just going to say

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.958
that's a big reason
why I wanted it

00:27:21.958 --> 00:27:24.457
and that's my big pitch
to people in terms of,

00:27:24.457 --> 00:27:26.790
if you help Stockton, you're
really helping the country.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:28.740
Because the problems
are concentrated here.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.115
And you're not
going to find them

00:27:30.115 --> 00:27:33.180
with as much intensity in
other places as you will here.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.400
So help me here.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.760
And then we'll
scale it everywhere.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.320
So help me.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:45.770
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:46.550
My name's Jessica.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:47.530
I went to UOP.

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:49.299
So Stockton has a
very, very close--

00:27:49.299 --> 00:27:50.340
MICHAEL TUBBS: What year?

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.680
AUDIENCE: 2010 is
when I graduated.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.250
Yeah.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:54.583
So I was actually just there
for a wedding last weekend.

00:27:54.583 --> 00:27:57.040
And it has a very special
place in my heart,

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.500
so incredible movie.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:04.090
What was the job like in terms
of what you were expecting?

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.000
And then when you were
actually in the job,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.544
how did that change?

00:28:07.544 --> 00:28:09.335
MICHAEL TUBBS: Yeah
it's funny so last-- it

00:28:09.335 --> 00:28:10.835
was a couple
screenings ago, someone

00:28:10.835 --> 00:28:14.730
asked me, was it harder to
campaign or to be in office?

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:15.740
And I don't know.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.730
I don't know.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.667
Campaigning was hard
because all day every day--

00:28:19.667 --> 00:28:22.000
but being in office is hard
because it's the same thing.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.830
And now I can't just
point my finger and say,

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:24.670
this is what we should be doing.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.700
Now I'm the person
that has to do it.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.370
So if something's not
being done, it's my fault.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:32.090
I have the agency to figure
out how to change it.

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:34.270
Probably the hardest part
is that the City Council--

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.150
we're so close to the people.

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:38.720
But a lot of things are actually
not in our jurisdiction.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.890
So a lot of the things are
in the school district.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.348
It's been kind of difficult
because you're held accountable

00:28:43.348 --> 00:28:45.570
for a lot of things you
don't have direct power over.

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.400
But no one cares.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.930
So I'm, like,
calling the county,

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:49.430
calling the school
district, getting

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.350
on everyone's nerves trying
to not do everyone's job.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.750
But try-- I describe the job.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.350
People say, what's
your job like?

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.820
And I say, my job is to get
people to do the right thing.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.930
Which sounds very basic.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:01.110
But that's literally my job.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.901
I need the county jail
to work effectively.

00:29:02.901 --> 00:29:05.620
So I need to work with the
sheriff to do the right thing

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.828
and make sure our county
jail is working effectively.

00:29:07.828 --> 00:29:10.660
I need our neighborhoods--
it sounds it's difficult.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.910
Though it's really impossible.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:15.090
Because I have no leverage over
a lot of people I work with.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:16.310
I'm just a councilperson.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.920
But I'm not their
direct supervisor.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.336
I can't-- I don't get to give--
do you guys still do OKRs?

00:29:20.336 --> 00:29:21.790
Is that still a thing?

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:24.710
I don't get to do OKRs on them.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.170
I just tell people when
they're not doing their job.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.920
KYLE EWING: Maybe we
should have OKRs we--

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.280
MICHAEL TUBBS: No
that wouldn't work.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.110
Who would get promoted?

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.635
I forgot your question actually.

00:29:35.635 --> 00:29:36.760
AUDIENCE: No that was good.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.240
Thank you.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.380
KYLE EWING: There
was one back here.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.550
AUDIENCE: I have two questions
that are purely curiosity.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.060
Do you have to live
in District Six

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.650
in order to run for District 6?

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:48.100
MICHAEL TUBBS: Absolutely.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:48.933
That's where I live.

00:29:48.933 --> 00:29:50.650
AUDIENCE: So did Dell
live in District 6?

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:51.441
MICHAEL TUBBS: Yes.

00:29:51.441 --> 00:29:55.250
So District 6-- we have this
part called the Weston Ranch.

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:57.850
And Weston Ranch is
beautiful, sprawling.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:01.210
It's like two bedroom, not
two bedroom, two-story houses

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.880
that you would not even I think
it was in a bad neighborhood

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.280
because it's beautiful.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.085
But it was also hit really
hard by the foreclosure crisis.

00:30:08.085 --> 00:30:09.670
So there's a lot
of home invasions.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.330
My mom's home was
broken into there a week

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.240
after the election--
and things of that sort.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.450
So even within District
6 as well-- but

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:19.484
there's a south side
part of District 6

00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:21.150
which is what the
film really showcased.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:22.650
And then there's
Weston Ranch, which

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:25.560
is only about 14-years-old,
different income

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.926
levels and a little bit of
different challenges as well.

00:30:27.926 --> 00:30:29.550
It's like a bedroom
commuter community.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:31.860
So a lot of people that live
there work in San Francisco

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.234
and Oakland and
just commute back

00:30:33.234 --> 00:30:35.080
because the housing is
cheaper in Stockton.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.040
AUDIENCE: And my
second question is,

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.470
there's been a lot
of talk of what

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:39.820
you were going to do
to make the money.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.278
What did you plan
on doing when you

00:30:41.278 --> 00:30:44.042
went to Stanford to
make the big bucks?

00:30:44.042 --> 00:30:46.250
MICHAEL TUBBS: I didn't
really have that planned out.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.750
I just knew it was
going to happen.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:52.520
So my freshman year I was
at Credit Suisse for a week.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.010
And it was cool-- creating
[? stakes ?] in town cars.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:57.640
But I was like, I don't care.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.890
I was just like, I don't care.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:30:59.590
I'm at this computer.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:00.280
I'm just guessing.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.120
I'm reading like, a
trading game and I won.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.328
But I was literally guessing.

00:31:03.328 --> 00:31:05.262
I was like, long, short,
long, long, short.

00:31:05.262 --> 00:31:08.044
And I won.

00:31:08.044 --> 00:31:09.460
That's how we got
in the recession

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.802
the first place I think.

00:31:10.802 --> 00:31:13.660
Someone was doing
what I was doing.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:17.390
So I decided that that
wasn't the move to me.

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:19.937
And then sophomore year, I
really loved my time at Google.

00:31:19.937 --> 00:31:21.520
And then senior year,
I really thought

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.510
I wanted to be a consultant
and travel the world.

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:24.740
So I just didn't have a plan.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.729
I just knew that
somehow-- and I was

00:31:26.729 --> 00:31:28.395
going to find me a
tight, techie friend.

00:31:28.395 --> 00:31:30.476
And we were going to come
up with some startup idea.

00:31:30.476 --> 00:31:32.309
He was going to come
up with a startup idea.

00:31:32.309 --> 00:31:34.959
I was just going to
talk about it for him.

00:31:34.959 --> 00:31:36.000
And I would get acquired.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.490
But I'm just on City Council.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:39.122
But I'm happy.

00:31:39.122 --> 00:31:39.622
I'm happy.

00:31:39.622 --> 00:31:40.310
It's fun.

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.700
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.770
Seems like you're
doing great work.

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:42.269
Thank you.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:46.210
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:46.730
I'm Ory.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.170
I'm a BOLD intern.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.560
And I was wondering,
Michael, how you engage youth

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.460
as a City Council member still?

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.070
Do they help you in office?

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:57.750
So what is your relationship
like with youth today?

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.333
MICHAEL TUBBS: It's
really interesting

00:31:59.333 --> 00:32:01.320
because now I'm old to people.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.140
So I teach.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.392
And I try to engage them.

00:32:03.392 --> 00:32:04.600
But they really think I'm 35.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.680
They never believe me.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.005
Like, Mr Tubbs, you're 33.

00:32:07.005 --> 00:32:08.130
What are you talking about?

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:08.680
Read Google.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.490
I'm 23.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:10.540
It's in there.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:12.450
They don't believe me.

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:14.300
That's actually been
kind of a challenge

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:17.617
because it's kind of
hard to engage youth

00:32:17.617 --> 00:32:18.450
in a meaningful way.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.658
So what I've done-- I have
a really robust internship

00:32:20.658 --> 00:32:23.620
program where they're
given a lot of autonomy.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.500
And they-- I meet with
them once every two weeks.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.894
For example, one of my
interns-- she's the best.

00:32:28.894 --> 00:32:31.060
And she texted me today,
we have a book club meeting

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:31.860
on Wednesday.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.140
What's the lesson plan?

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.500
Do I need to pick anything up?

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.592
Are we meeting tonight?

00:32:35.592 --> 00:32:36.800
I was like, oh I'm at Google.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:37.883
And she says, OK I got it.

00:32:37.883 --> 00:32:40.837
So my interns are
really awesome,

00:32:40.837 --> 00:32:41.920
self-assured young people.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.378
And we have about
10 to 15 of them.

00:32:43.378 --> 00:32:45.790
So we do a very intensive
leadership training,

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:46.530
skill building.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:48.321
We bring different
people in and teach them

00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:50.680
things like professional
emails, and how to respond,

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.862
people don't check
their emails, how

00:32:51.862 --> 00:32:54.112
to respond to to your emails,
and things of that sort.

00:32:54.112 --> 00:32:57.280
And also, I think I've
been really, really good

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.220
at doing different
events focused at youth.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.130
There's always more
work that can be done.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:06.890
So actually, Sunday,
no Friday, Friday

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:10.385
I had this amazing meeting with
these two young organizers who

00:33:10.385 --> 00:33:12.782
were 18-years-old and
they were really pushing,

00:33:12.782 --> 00:33:13.990
what are you doing for youth?

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.820
What are you doing for youth?

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.170
And I felt like I was the man.

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:18.580
I was like wait, woah
I'm the young councilman.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.140
But they were really pushing me.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.510
That was really inspiring.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.720
And it was cool because
they felt they could push.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.220
Because I had created
an environment

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.570
where it was expected
if we're meeting,

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:29.020
don't be nice and take pictures.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:32.060
What do you need done and don't
be afraid to be pushy about it.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:36.125
So I think we've been engaging
youth in non-traditional ways

00:33:36.125 --> 00:33:37.750
and not really
organized and structured

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.572
outside the internship program.

00:33:39.572 --> 00:33:42.135
If you have any
ideas let me know.

00:33:42.135 --> 00:33:43.760
KYLE EWING: We've
got time for one more

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:47.122
question from the audience.

00:33:47.122 --> 00:33:49.990
Yeah.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:51.610
AUDIENCE: Hello, I'm Tim Keller.

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:53.217
I'm a software engineer.

00:33:53.217 --> 00:33:55.050
I don't have a direct
connection to Stockton

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.005
besides driving to it now and
then and occasionally stopping.

00:33:58.005 --> 00:34:00.509
I was wondering if you could
tell us more about what you've

00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:02.050
been able to do for
Stockton and what

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:04.100
you think your legacy will be.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.183
MICHAEL TUBBS: Absolutely.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.800
I'm trying to get you guys
out of here at a decent time

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.010
but you guys keep asking
these great questions.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:19.190
My focus in Stockton has
really been around recidivism,

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:22.139
violence prevention, and
specific things in my district.

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:26.750
So on the recidivism front,
I got 200-- I received,

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:30.880
excuse me, $250,000 from
California Wellness Foundation

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.914
to pilot this
back-to-work program.

00:34:32.914 --> 00:34:35.080
And what recidivism is, is
that throughout the state

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.010
of California, when someone
gets in jail and comes out,

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.960
they have a 70% chance
of coming back in.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.904
And especially in a
community like Stockton,

00:34:41.904 --> 00:34:43.570
that could be a real
problem, especially

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:46.770
as we try to reinvent ourselves
to get past this crime problem.

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:49.785
So we partnered with the
California Wellness Foundation

00:34:49.785 --> 00:34:51.750
and Michael G. Santos
Foundation to pilot

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:53.290
this back-to-work
program which is

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:55.429
the most simple but
beautiful concept ever.

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:57.490
Because oftentimes, when
ex-offenders get out

00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:00.001
they go through these
job training programs.

00:35:00.001 --> 00:35:01.500
But then they still
don't get a job.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.700
So they spend a year,
they spend four months,

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.580
they spend three
months, and then

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.535
they're still unemployed
and now even more frustrated

00:35:08.535 --> 00:35:10.660
because they went in with
this hope and expectation

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.952
that opportunity would
be made real for them.

00:35:12.952 --> 00:35:13.910
They served their time.

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:14.826
They did this program.

00:35:14.826 --> 00:35:19.300
So now it's this program
where they go through it.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.915
And they get a job afterwards.

00:35:20.915 --> 00:35:21.770
Wow.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.037
But you understand what a
big deal that is for them.

00:35:24.037 --> 00:35:26.120
And now we're also talking
to a couple foundations

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.578
in the Silicon
Valley to figure out

00:35:27.578 --> 00:35:29.980
if we could teach coding
to some ex-offenders

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.300
Because it's really hard--
I think coding is the one

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.640
sector where skills
trump everything.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.919
So we're working on that.

00:35:36.919 --> 00:35:38.460
Number two, I was
able to get banning

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.020
the box legislation passed.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.460
So now when people apply
for City of Stockton jobs

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.900
they don't have to disclose
whether they're an ex-offender

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:45.400
or not.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.570
And that's a big deal because
research shows that just having

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.660
the question on the
application depresses people

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.640
from applying even if they
were qualified for the job.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.765
And because of that now
the county's looking at it,

00:35:54.765 --> 00:35:57.950
institution got changed, now
different private business

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.990
are doing the same.

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:02.480
I worked with the police chief.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.562
We did this tougher
pawnshop ordinance

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:06.020
after all the gold
chain robberies.

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.774
So we sat down and
did a problem analysis

00:36:07.774 --> 00:36:09.190
in terms of, what
was the problem?

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:11.507
It was because it was
really easy for pawnshops

00:36:11.507 --> 00:36:12.340
to buy stolen goods.

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.202
So now I just added a level
of scrutiny and security.

00:36:15.202 --> 00:36:16.660
So now it's not as
easy for someone

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.243
who's walking with
a stolen gold chain

00:36:18.243 --> 00:36:20.520
to get straight cash for it.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.160
We've started this Boys and
Men of Color Alliance, which

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.050
is very similar-- I co-founded
it and co-chair it--

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.880
which is very much the same vein
as Obama's My Brother's Keeper

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:29.710
initiative.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:32.350
And we have the county, we
have the school districts,

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:35.460
we have almost every sector--
health, public health,

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.610
every sector that works
with young men of color--

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.009
we have them on the
same table every month

00:36:40.009 --> 00:36:42.050
talking about how do we
each individually improve

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:42.690
our outcomes.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:44.314
And we've seen great
changes from that.

00:36:44.314 --> 00:36:46.560
We had our first select
committee hearing

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.776
which is where the state
legislator came to Stockton

00:36:48.776 --> 00:36:50.650
to learn about the work
we were doing and how

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:52.730
to partner with
us on that front.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:55.650
We have this We Live in South
Stockton coalition, which

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.610
for the first time has
gotten everyone who's

00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:00.030
doing-- because you know how it
is in places that are really--

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.238
have a lot of challenges,
that everyone and their mom

00:37:02.238 --> 00:37:03.080
wants to come help.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.920
But it's never
coordinated or strategic.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.500
So there's no real
outcomes for it.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:09.226
So I worked with a couple
community partners.

00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:11.100
We got all the non-profits,
all the churches,

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.724
we got all the players
on the same page

00:37:12.724 --> 00:37:15.370
for the first time ever moving
towards this common vision--

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:15.870
agenda.

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.850
So we have some
things go-- today

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:19.891
two of the nonprofits
we're working with just got

00:37:19.891 --> 00:37:22.420
half a million from Wells
Fargo to rehab old drug houses

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.790
and make them new houses
for home ownership.

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:27.780
So that's a win.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.652
We have this summer--
see I'm going

00:37:29.652 --> 00:37:31.360
to be quiet
[? again in a second ?] we're

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.961
doing this summer literacy
program at the housing

00:37:34.961 --> 00:37:35.460
authority.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:39.210
So myself, the University of
the Pacific, the United Way,

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:41.440
and the housing authority
is doing a literacy program

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.690
for first- through third-graders
in two of the housing

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:44.670
projects in Stockton.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:49.770
So 100 kids are getting free
meals and extra literacy

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:50.270
training.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:52.820
Because reading by third grade
is such a great indicator

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:53.710
for outcomes.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:55.150
And all that stuff's
happened in two years.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:57.380
And there's a lot more things
in the way and in the pipeline.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.004
So it's been really
encouraging to know

00:37:59.004 --> 00:38:01.005
that, although everything
that needs to happen's

00:38:01.005 --> 00:38:02.420
not going to happen
in four years,

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.120
we have been able to
make some progress.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.550
And we are making some change.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:07.589
And we have to, especially
with the great job

00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:08.630
they've done on the film.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:10.050
The expectations are sky high.

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.984
So I refuse to have
no outcomes and just

00:38:11.984 --> 00:38:13.150
a whole bunch of screenings.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:15.205
So we're doing work to make sure
that when I come to a screening

00:38:15.205 --> 00:38:16.130
I feel comfortable.

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:18.299
OK I can talk about things
because we're actually

00:38:18.299 --> 00:38:20.340
doing work and not just
trying to be movie stars.

00:38:22.569 --> 00:38:24.110
JHANVI SHRIRAM: And
certainly there's

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:26.340
people here that have skills
or are interested in helping

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.135
Stockton or some of
the initiatives we--

00:38:28.135 --> 00:38:28.460
MICHAEL TUBBS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:31.043
JHANVI SHRIRAM: --talked about
so come up and talk to Michael.

00:38:31.467 --> 00:38:33.550
And we're so excited about
continuing the dialogue

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:34.175
about the film.

00:38:34.175 --> 00:38:36.049
So if anybody else has
questions or comments,

00:38:36.049 --> 00:38:37.240
do come up to us afterwards.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.269
And if you guys are
on social media,

00:38:39.269 --> 00:38:41.560
subscribe to our YouTube
channel, follow us on Twitter.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.685
We'd love to hear from you.

00:38:42.685 --> 00:38:45.520
MICHAEL TUBBS: That's a
good thing Jenny and Whitney

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.164
because they were
here when I was here.

00:38:47.164 --> 00:38:48.330
They were the intern bosses.

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:49.080
So thank you guys.

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:49.754
Love you guys.

00:38:49.754 --> 00:38:51.285
You guys are awesome.

00:38:51.285 --> 00:38:52.660
KYLE EWING: Well,
and actually, I

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.530
want to thank you guys for
bringing this story to light.

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:57.930
Jenny and I were actually
chatting last week--

00:38:57.930 --> 00:38:59.290
really excited to have you here.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.810
And we've been so
inspired by your journey.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:05.330
And it really caused us to
think about others who've

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:08.110
come through the BOLD program
and people who really continue

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.700
to make an impact.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.200
And we wanted to actually
present you with an award.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.620
The first ever BOLD
Distinguished Alum Award.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.760
And this really is
about people who

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.180
continue to make an
impact in their community.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.780
Your tireless commitment
to Stockton-- it's

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.217
clearly better because of you.

00:39:25.217 --> 00:39:27.550
And we're really excited to
present you with this award.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:29.091
I'm going to make
Jenny come up here.

00:39:29.091 --> 00:39:32.340
But you can just for now
sit there on the side.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.184
Thank you.

00:39:33.184 --> 00:39:34.132
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:34.132 --> 00:39:35.080
KYLE EWING: Thank you.
