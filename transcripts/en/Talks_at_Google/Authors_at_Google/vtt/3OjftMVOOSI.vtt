00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.744 --> 00:00:10.164
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.864 --> 00:00:12.780
SPEAKER 1: So welcome,
everyone, and thank you

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.640
for coming to today's talk.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.370
Today, as a member of the
IMIA Mental Health Conference

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.040
committee and one of
your well-being champs,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.540
I'm delighted to
be able to welcome

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.380
Florence Servan-Schreiber
to Google France.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.200
Florence, having
studied humanistic

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.810
psychology and sustainability
management in San Francisco.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.140
She went on to train
in positive psychology

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.680
with the renowned Harvard
professor Tal Ben-Shahar.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.440
She is the bestselling author
of "3 Kifs Par Jour" and "Power

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.690
Patate," and she joins us
today to discuss "Unleash Your

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.027
Superpowers."

00:00:45.027 --> 00:00:46.860
Please put your hands
together for Florence.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:53.662 --> 00:00:55.620
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
Thank you very much.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.990
[INAUDIBLE], you may want this.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.040
So bonjour, hello.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.590
My name is Florence.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.700
Florence Servan-Schreiber.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.550
I picked to do this talk in
English because I believe

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.350
most of you do speak English.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.820
And most talks I
do are in French,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.730
so I decided to do something
a little more difficult than I

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.470
usually do, since
we are going to be

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.300
unleashing our superpowers.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.890
So why would we talk about
superpowers, possibly?

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.720
How many of you
here are familiar

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.710
with positive psychology?

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.710
OK.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.100
So for the rest of us,
positive psychology

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.530
is not positive thinking.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.800
Just so you relax
on that matter.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.360
What is positive psychology?

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.690
Basically, about 20
years ago, a researcher

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.780
from University of
Pennsylvania, Marty Seligman,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.440
realized that when we dealt
with research in psychology,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.140
it always had to do with
mental health, of course,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.330
but with mental diseases.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.050
And basically, he was elected
at the head of the Psychology

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.020
Institute of the United States,
which basically brings together

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.100
researchers.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.680
And Seligman said,
why don't we try

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.699
and see if we could think
research differently to come up

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.150
with a preventive psychology?

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.430
Because we all know
that, in health matters,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.740
there are things that we
can do more of or less

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.590
of that will enable us to
live longer in better health.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.420
But on a mental level,
are there things

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.990
that we can do more of or
less of that will enable us--

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.840
so what can it enable us to do?

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.550
Not so much avoid the hardships
of life, because the hardships

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.900
will be coming our way.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.220
Maybe they have
already come your way.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.310
But the good news is, they
are heading towards us.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.700
So since they are
heading towards us,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.500
to know how to get
back on our feet

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.060
in order to feel more power
to be able to get back

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.750
in our daily lives after
miserable things happen to us.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.590
That's when he decides to
create a new area of research.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.170
Positive psychology is
actually brings together

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.690
researchers from
different psychology labs

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.310
who work on three things--

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.500
behaviors, personalities,
and organizations that work.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.379
It's also called the
science of happiness.

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.170
Have you heard of the
science of happiness?

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.751
OK.

00:03:17.751 --> 00:03:18.250
Wonderful.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.760
So this is what
positive psychology is.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.070
So my job-- my day job--

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.100
I have a few jobs,
but my day job

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.730
is to actually be a
happiness teacher.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.520
So what I do is look
at the research,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.420
try everything before
I get anywhere to talk

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.740
or write about it.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.350
And thanks for the author thing.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.030
I have published
books, so maybe I

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.040
am the first author that
you are seeing here.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.490
I don't know, maybe.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.810
Anyway, before I write anything,
before I talk about anything,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.250
I actually try it out.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.770
And I guess that's how
I'm able to come, then,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.500
and tell you what
we can possibly do.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.840
Positive psychology
is information.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.520
It's not therapy.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.730
Once you know that there
are certain behaviors that

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.400
can lead us to feel
this way or that,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.370
then you are completely
free to try it out.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.420
So since this is
all about happiness,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.880
let's start with happiness.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.590
What is happiness?

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.900
Basically, maybe I'll
begin with what it is not.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.269
Happiness is not the
opposite of unhappiness.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.010
If you look at your lives,
whatever day goes by,

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.900
whatever month or
year goes by, you

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.720
will be swinging from
one state to the next.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.250
Sometimes, you feel great.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.140
Sometimes, you feel awful.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.830
And maybe the day so far
has gone perfectly well.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.500
None of us here is protected
from receiving a terrible text

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.300
message where your
world goes upside down.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.320
None of us.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.190
But on the other hand, we can
wake up feeling really grumpy,

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.020
and none of us is
protected from a [FRENCH]..

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.550
You know what [FRENCH] is.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.590
Love at first sight.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.992
We have no idea what's
going to happen.

00:05:03.992 --> 00:05:05.700
The only thing that
we have to understand

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.690
is that we will be swinging
from one state to the other.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.770
And the opposite of
happiness is apathy.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.530
Apathy is when we are
stuck in the middle,

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.100
and we just don't
know where to go.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.690
And the clinical version of
apathy is called depression.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.500
And in that particular matter,
we need regular psychology

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.760
to cure us.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.340
But when we're dealing
with flourishing,

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.400
when we're dealing with, how do
we enjoy the projects that we

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.910
work on?

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.390
How do we enjoy the
relationships that we are in?

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.350
How do we dilate inside of
our little envelope here?

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.210
This is a pretty
small space that we

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.430
each use on this planet.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.590
Within that little
space, how can we

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.000
use up most of the space
that is ours, actually?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.950
And that is what positive
psychology is about.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.690
Let's expand inside who we are.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.690
So I have a question for you.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.730
Where does our ability
to be happy come from?

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.560
I'll be a little more specific.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.750
Who among you believes that our
ability to be happy is genetic?

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.790
That it is pre-programmed.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.860
Who thinks it is?

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.630
OK, who thinks it's not?

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.820
All right.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.112
And who doesn't know?

00:06:20.112 --> 00:06:21.050
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING]

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.300
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER: OK.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.112
So this is one of the first
things that regular psychology,

00:06:26.112 --> 00:06:27.820
one of the first
questions that they ask.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.530
Where does our ability
to be happy come from?

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.570
Is it genetic?

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.940
So the first thing they have
to do is scratch their head.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.840
How can we find that out?

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.520
And they realize there's
only one way to go.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.190
They are going to have
to find identical twins.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.120
And identical
twins are basically

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.090
one egg that has been
separated in two pieces.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.130
So it's the same genetic code.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.660
But we need these twins to
have been separated at birth,

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.210
adopted in different families.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.850
And we prefer them to be
older than 40 years old,

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.190
so things have happened to them.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.170
And these twins come in.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.850
And the question is, now, to
measure their happiness level.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.640
So how does one measure
a happiness level?

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.230
Basically, there's no software.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.830
There's no blood test.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.190
No saliva tests that can
tell us if you're happy.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.930
The only way to measure
happiness is self-declarative--

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.050
knowing that you are the only
person to know how you feel.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.240
So we ask you a
series of questions.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.060
And you always have to answer
on a scale from 1 to 10.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.820
So for example,
you can be asked,

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.000
how do you feel about
your current projects?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.340
Or you can be asked,
how do you feel

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.710
when you look at your peers?

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.730
Or, how do you feel about
your childhood dreams?

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.590
We can also go through emotions.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.870
How much joy do
you feel right now?

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.130
How much anger?

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.270
How much fear?

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.590
And so forth.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.620
We sum it all up, and
we have an average.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.570
That's your happiness score.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:08.020
So the twins have very
different lifestyles.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.030
They are asked all
these questions.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.980
However, they come
up 90% of them

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:21.610
declare the exact same level
of happiness as their twin.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.230
So the researchers
are very happy.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.660
And they publish, and they
say, OK, ladies and gentlemen,

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.729
happiness is just like height.

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:28.270
It's genetic.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.562
The talk is over.

00:08:32.562 --> 00:08:33.461
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING]

00:08:33.461 --> 00:08:34.919
FLORENCE
SERVAN-SCHREIBER: OK, this

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.500
is before positive
psychology comes in.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.240
So we lived with
that for a while.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.860
And then these new
scientists come

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.710
in with a slightly
different approach

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:44.940
when it comes to happiness.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.860
Basically, what they have
figured out is the following.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:53.650
The question conditions
the response.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.490
Which means that,
in if our lives,

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.950
we look for what's
wrong, we will

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.390
find what's wrong right away.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.320
But if we start looking
for what is right,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.330
then we will start
looking what is right,

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.830
and what is going
well in our lives.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.470
So what they see are
the same results,

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.480
but they read them upside down.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.240
And what they are
interested in are the 10%

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.540
of twins who have the exact same
genetic code as somebody else.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.980
However, they are
happier or unhappier.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.850
How is it possible?

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:28.590
So a woman named Sonja
Lyubomirsky works out

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.780
of UC Davis in California.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.380
And in her lab, the
only question she asks

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.540
is, where does
happiness comes from?

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.830
She has met people who have
experienced all our wildest

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.240
dreams.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.220
Winning at the lottery.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.715
Getting an entire
makeover physically.

00:09:46.715 --> 00:09:48.840
That type of crazy things
that we always think that

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.131
could possibly make us happier.

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.350
Anyway, she went through
a bunch, a bunch, a bunch

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.790
of situations and people.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.660
And basically, she was
able to figure it out.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:02.340
50% of our ability to
experience happiness

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.010
is actually pre-determined.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.600
It comes from one of our
genes called the 5-HTT.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.420
5-HTT swims up there
somewhere and is

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:18.150
responsible for manufacturing
all the neurotransmitters that

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.770
run up in our brains.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:25.170
Dopamine, endorphins,
serotonin, oxytocin.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.520
You know all these words?

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.970
Lots of "-in" words that are
basically all the substances

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.150
that our brain will actually
manufacture when we feel great.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.330
And when we feel great,
it manufactures even more.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:42.360
So the longer the 5-HTT, the
more of these neurotransmitters

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.150
our brain is able
to manufacture.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.310
The shorter it is, the
drier it is up there.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.380
So this is why there
are different types

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.030
of personalities.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:58.140
And we all have people around
us for whom everything is fun.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.580
Everything is cool.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.030
Basically, it's probable that
they have a very long 5-HTT.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.470
And then for the rest of us,
maybe it's a bit shorter,

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.280
and we don't really experience
things the same way.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.300
But you know something?

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.190
It's exactly like height.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:12.390
It is a lottery.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.150
But for example, I belong to--

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.940
let's say, I'm a short person.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.060
Well, I can tell the tall people
that, even at this altitude,

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.620
life is fine.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.130
We are fine.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.396
We will get used to
whatever our conditions are.

00:11:26.396 --> 00:11:28.020
And that's the good
thing about humans.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.940
We're great chameleons.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.130
So that's half of it--

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.420
of our ability to be happy.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.610
Now, what else do
we need to be happy?

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.550
So I'll just take orders.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.140
What would you like?

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.407
We all want the same thing,
so you can just shout it out.

00:11:43.407 --> 00:11:44.031
AUDIENCE: Love.

00:11:44.031 --> 00:11:45.364
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER: Love.

00:11:45.364 --> 00:11:46.140
Thank you.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:46.970
What else?

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:47.886
AUDIENCE: Connections.

00:11:47.886 --> 00:11:48.620
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
Excuse me?

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:48.990
AUDIENCE: Connections.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.610
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
Connections, yes.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.450
AUDIENCE: Purpose.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.010
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
Purpose, yeah.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.976
What else?

00:11:54.976 --> 00:11:55.970
AUDIENCE: Food.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:56.430
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER: Food.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.320
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING]

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.653
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER: Yeah.

00:11:58.653 --> 00:11:59.850
Absolutely, food.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:00.653
Certainly.

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:01.560
AUDIENCE: Health.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.720
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
Health, yes.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.650
To be in good health.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:04.160
Of course.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:04.912
AUDIENCE: Comfort.

00:12:04.912 --> 00:12:07.080
FLORENCE
SERVAN-SCHREIBER: Comfort.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.880
Little money, anybody?

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.600
Nah.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.700
Really not.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.470
Sunshine?

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:14.920
Just the regular stuff.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.790
There's a lot of regular stuff
that actually makes us happy.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.620
So if we talk about
regular stuff,

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:24.810
such as sunshine, comfort,
for example, even health.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:25.980
The weather.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.860
Everybody religiously
looks at the weather.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.960
It's usually 53% accurate.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.990
Not much more.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.560
However, we still look at the
weather as an anticipation

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.300
to our happiness.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.200
All those things
are circumstances.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.530
And the outside
circumstances-- even our health

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.080
is a circumstance, actually.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:53.100
The circumstances count
for 10% of our happiness.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.200
But the thing is,
we all have a list--

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.730
it's not even one arm
long, it's two arms long--

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:06.000
of things that we would like to
change, or meet, or eradicate,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.320
if it was legal.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.200
Things where we
think, yes, if I could

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.870
change my life, if
things were different,

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.030
then I would be happier.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.460
Maybe 10% happier.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.290
But then of course,
we do sometimes

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.110
need to act on our
circumstances, and we can.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:26.160
But what we cannot expect is
that changing the circumstances

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.770
will change everything
that happens.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.060
So 50% is pre-programmed.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.470
10% comes from the outside.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.662
How much is left?

00:13:35.662 --> 00:13:36.426
AUDIENCE: 40%.

00:13:36.426 --> 00:13:37.690
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
40%, yes.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:38.565
You people can count.

00:13:38.565 --> 00:13:39.960
Great.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.550
So what do these
last 40% rely on?

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:52.360
They rely on our interpretation
of what happens in our lives.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.830
And it has been determined
that the happiest people, when

00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:00.480
something does not go the way
they had planned it, what they

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.700
will do is that, rather than
considering it as a setback,

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.910
they will actually feel that
they're already moving forward

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.500
in a different direction.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.340
Meaning, when
something happens to us

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.550
that upsets us that we did
not plan, we do not want,

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.470
we will be frustrated.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:20.940
We will be angry.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.950
We will be pissed off.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:22.970
We may even cry.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.470
It's called being human.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.670
But pretty quickly, these
people will say, OK.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.990
I had planned to go
this way, I'm actually

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.250
going to have to go this way.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:36.300
And they get back on their feet,
and they start moving again.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.820
And basically, what
we have to remember

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.390
is that it is not so
much what happens to us,

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.720
but it is what we do
about what happens

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.270
to us that really matters.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:52.770
So I know a little
bit about that.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:56.340
I became interested
in positive psychology

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.410
and changed to
this new profession

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:03.120
because my previous job left me.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.420
So in such a circumstance--
at least some of you

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.630
think it's funny.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:11.550
I didn't think it was very
funny when it happened, exactly.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.565
It's always a little--

00:15:13.565 --> 00:15:14.190
lots of things.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.530
Downsizing, and-- so
no, everything's fine,

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:17.940
but it is a little humiliating.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.680
There's a lot of
stuff that happens

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.860
at that particular time.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.280
But had it not
happened, I really

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.780
don't know why or how I would
have gone back to study--

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.610
had the time to have
simply gone back

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:33.100
and studied positive psychology
for real, which is what I did.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.490
And I learned all
this material, and I

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.510
thought it was so
easy to implement,

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.020
and so interesting,
and so ongoing,

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.060
because the research
is constantly ongoing,

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.210
it's a very new science,
that I decided--

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.449
so in France, things are
sort of well-organized

00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:48.240
when you get fired.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.350
You know about that.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.600
And I had a little
time on my hands.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.600
So what I decided to
do was try everything.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.800
So I tried everything.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.160
I learned meditation.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.430
You guys know about
meditation, right?

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.507
You know that meditation
can be learned.

00:16:01.507 --> 00:16:03.090
You don't just sit
there and meditate.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.090
It's actually a skill.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.350
It's like the rest of the
things that we know how to do.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.230
I exercised more.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.150
To be honest, I
began exercising.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.300
And I did write letters
to people in my life,

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.670
because when you do
write letters to people,

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.840
you are happier.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.720
And then at the end of
this particular year--

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.460
I have a tendency
to forget things.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.200
I didn't want to
forget this time.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.920
So I decided to sit down
and write the story.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.856
And when the book came
out here in France,

00:16:32.856 --> 00:16:34.230
the book did very
well instantly,

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:35.220
so that was a surprise.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.840
But I realized
something very simple.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.500
That although we are very unique
individuals, there's something

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.630
we have all in common.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.890
With more information,
we make better decisions.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.100
And the more we know
about behaviors, the freer

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.010
we are to choose to
implement these behaviors

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.150
or to try things out.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.420
And that's how I decided
to go on and keep talking

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:02.260
about this particular topic.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:10.829
Then, as we say in French,
basically, [FRENCH]..

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:14.099
Basically, a bus ran me over.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.150
Not literally.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.430
But we will all be
run over by buses.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:21.720
And in my case, what
happened is that I had

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.119
a very close and dear cousin.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:26.700
His name was David
Servan-Schreiber.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.130
Some of you may know his name.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.230
And David was my age.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.980
And David died.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.260
He died from brain tumor.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.350
He was a doctor, and as a
doctor, when he was diagnosed,

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.410
he was diagnosed when
he was 30 years old.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:44.250
And he decided to look for ways
that he could fight cancer.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.870
His doctors said,
just go on and live

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.020
the way you live your life.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.520
And he said, no, I
don't believe that,

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.686
and I'm sure there's something
better that I can do.

00:17:50.686 --> 00:17:54.990
So he began compulsing
all the research that

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.600
has been done about
fighting cancer cells that

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.710
weren't really promoted, and
basically completely changed

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:05.240
his lifestyle and gained 20
years of life expectancy.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.970
Brain tumors usually win
the fight, and it did.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:13.440
David was a psychiatrist,
and he had built a training

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.000
school for psychiatrists.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.310
And that company was orphaned.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:20.910
And one thing that I decided
to do one morning is I woke up,

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.930
and I thought, OK, I'm going to
buy this company from his kids,

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.240
and I'm going to
continue his work.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.110
And that's when all my
little voices woke up.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.410
So one little voice here
told me, Flo, let me just

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.990
remind you, you can't count.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.060
Which is not untrue.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.090
And then another voice
here said, you did already

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.430
start a company, remember?

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.236
And the company went broke.

00:18:45.236 --> 00:18:46.860
Are you sure you want
to do that again?

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.800
And I said, OK, girls, thank
you very much for the advice,

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.880
but I'm going.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.290
I'm going to do this.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.650
And this was seven years ago.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:19:01.140
I have no other
word to define what

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.850
has happened to
us professionally

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.950
than to say that
we have flourished.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.200
You know what "flourished" is?

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.610
[FRENCH]

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.830
So how do you flourish
on a professional level?

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:11.892
What does it mean?

00:19:11.892 --> 00:19:14.100
So it means, of course, that
all the jobs were saved,

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.180
and we have created more.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.020
We've expanded.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.480
It means that we've gone
beyond our objectives.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.330
It means that we like
the way we contribute

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.150
to the area that is ours.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:28.530
And it also means that we were
able to learn to work together.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.290
Because there were people that
I had not chosen, and they

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.770
had not chosen me either.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.170
However, it did work out.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.290
So I began wondering,
how is it possible?

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:42.300
How can somebody very normal
like me-- so I know two things.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:46.080
I was trained in English,
obviously, and in psychology.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.820
But running a company?

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.260
Managing a team?

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.560
Not only did I have no
appetite, but no intuition

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.130
for that at all.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.480
But it worked.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:00.360
So that's when I began looking
at superpowers, obviously.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:05.010
And I started to wonder if there
weren't within each one of us

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.920
very simple things
that we could actually

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:13.140
count on when the storm started
coming up, and coming at us.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.150
So naturally, what did I do?

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.430
I turned to positive psychology.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.250
And what this bunch
of researchers

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.700
did when they actually began
positive psychology is they

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.110
realized that there
was no universal list

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.450
of human qualities.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.730
We did not know
what qualities were

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:36.570
to be found across the world,
and that we could actually

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:37.080
count on.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.060
So they began looking,
and they read everything

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.280
that was published in
psychology, philosophy,

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.590
religions, and put
them all together.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:49.050
And they came up with 24
common character strengths,

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:49.960
they called them.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.750
Character strengths are
qualities, basically.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.990
And so they had to make sure.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.630
They had to verify that
these qualities actually

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:00.600
really existed when you
went out to meet people.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.950
So they separated
in different teams,

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.120
and my favorite
team went to Africa.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.420
And they go and visit
Maasai warriors.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.640
Now, Maasai warriors
are people who

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.406
still hunt lions with pierces.

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:15.780
"Pierce," is that
how you say it?

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.140
AUDIENCE: Spears.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:16.740
FLORENCE
SERVAN-SCHREIBER: Spears.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.520
Spears.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.690
With a spear.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.420
And so they go to
the Maasai warrior.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:28.440
And they say, OK, this is for
a study that we are handling.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:34.390
Are you familiar with the
concept of leadership?

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.320
So the Maasai warrior
says, yes, I am.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.430
Say, no, no, no.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:43.960
Do you personally know people
who actually are leaders?

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.780
So the Maasai warrior
says, yes, I do.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.600
No, no, no.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.830
Do you know as many
men as women who

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.180
actually express leadership?

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.850
So the warrior says, yes, I do.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.920
Says, no, no, but
one more question.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.269
Would you like your children
to actually express leadership?

00:21:59.269 --> 00:22:01.935
And he said, of course I want my
children to express leadership.

00:22:01.935 --> 00:22:04.140
So they go, yeah, they
know about leadership.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.730
It's a familiar trait.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.980
And they did the same
thing with Eskimos.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.157
Eskimo [FRENCH].

00:22:12.157 --> 00:22:12.990
AUDIENCE: Fishermen.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:13.440
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
Fishermen.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.800
Thank you very much.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.440
With Eskimos and so forth.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.590
And they validated
these qualities.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.840
So let's see what qualities
we have in this room.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.270
May as well.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:28.564
Who among you is funny?

00:22:28.564 --> 00:22:31.049
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING]

00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:33.570
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER: OK.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:34.980
All right, that's not bad.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.790
You know, when you walk in
a class of elementary school

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:43.240
children and you say,
OK, who is smart?

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.360
Everybody raises their hands.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.440
So I'll ask it again.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.960
Who among you is funny?

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.530
All right, OK, there you go.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:57.000
Who among you has
a sense of justice?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.990
Yes.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:59.400
Very nice.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.020
Who among you is perseverant?

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.580
Yeah.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:06.480
OK.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.860
Wonderful.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.750
Little harder.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.614
Who among you is honest?

00:23:12.614 --> 00:23:14.290
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING]

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.540
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER: OK.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.090
Most of you are more
honest than you think.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.650
OK, let me just check.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.422
Who's ever kissed anyone?

00:23:22.422 --> 00:23:23.655
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING]

00:23:23.655 --> 00:23:26.030
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
OK, this is a happiness class.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.830
There are things that are
worth living for, you know?

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.650
Things that you
could actually try.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:35.090
So these are very
common qualities.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.220
And what is a superpower?

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:43.310
It's a very common quality,
except that it's yours.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.570
So basically, how do you use it?

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.740
So the culture that I
come from, being French,

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.040
you have to know, if you're
not from this country,

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.200
that talking about your
qualities just never happens.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.630
It's not something we do.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:57.770
It's rude.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.330
It's pretentious.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.580
It's absolutely not
something we ever do.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.800
So when we do come up
with a list like that,

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.649
it's very useful,
because all of a sudden,

00:24:05.649 --> 00:24:07.190
there's something
a little objective.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.106
Because actually, what
you do is you go online

00:24:09.106 --> 00:24:10.770
and you answer a
bunch of questions.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.470
And at the end of
the questionnaire,

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.270
you are given the
answers that tell you,

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:18.090
OK, among the 24 universal
character strengths,

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.090
this is how yours are organized.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:22.230
And then you know how it works.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:23.840
Why is it useful?

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.350
I'll give you an example.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:29.270
When I decided to
write this book,

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.370
I had no idea how
you write a book.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.280
So I actually went and
asked people, senior people

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.510
who had written books.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:39.330
They all came up with the
different ways that they do it.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.290
But one thing came
back systematically.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:45.590
All of them told me,
you sit down at 8:00 AM,

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:49.560
and you do not get
up until 12:00.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.030
So I sat down at 8:00 AM.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.711
And I had the
title of the book--

00:24:54.711 --> 00:24:55.460
"3 Kifs Par Jour."

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.316
That I knew.

00:24:57.316 --> 00:24:57.816
Tsh.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:04.080
9 o'clock.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.870
I'm sitting down.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:09.585
10 o'clock.

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.780
11 o'clock.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.250
Balance it out.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.610
11:30.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.770
12 o'clock.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:26.427
And by 12 o'clock, I feel like
a pile of dust under my desk.

00:25:26.427 --> 00:25:28.010
And I say to myself,
how do you expect

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.550
to write a book considering you
can't even stay on your chair,

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.780
basically?

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.360
And I did tell you earlier, I
think that I forget everything.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.810
One thing that I had
forgotten when I actually

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.940
studied positive
psychology-- of course

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.190
I answered this questionnaire.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:45.030
It's one of the basic
things that you do.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:48.560
And there is a quality that
a lot of you here have.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.780
And you have to
know that I'm very

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.720
impressed by how many of
you have this quality, which

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.910
is called perseverance.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:59.210
Perseverance is the ability
to start something and take it

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.360
all the way until it's done.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.770
When I answer the questionnaire,
out of the 24 strengths,

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:12.140
my 24th strength
is perseverance.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.770
Which means that, in
this life, I will never

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:18.170
experience perseverance.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:20.875
And it absolutely
does not matter.

00:26:20.875 --> 00:26:22.250
And what we have
to understand is

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:26.420
that, if we do want
to take on challenges,

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.040
to have interesting
relationships with people,

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.690
to be excited about the projects
that we're actually running,

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.240
and enjoy doing
what we're doing,

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:41.090
we have to honor the strengths
that come to us naturally.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:44.620
So in my case, I'll give
you my first top five.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.270
The number one is curiosity.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.670
Number two is creativity.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:54.020
Number three is the ability
to love, and be loved.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.260
Meaning that people
matter a lot to me.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:01.500
Number four, I did not even
know it was a strength.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.100
It's called
recognition of beauty.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.920
It means that I'm very
sensitive to beauty around me,

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.050
but also to a job well done.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:13.690
And then number
four is called zest.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.740
Joie de vivre.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.320
How do you write a
book with these things?

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.840
Basically, the way
it works is that I

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.960
do sit down at 8 o'clock,
just like the perseverance.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.000
My brain is fresher, yes.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.560
But I do exactly what I can.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.742
And when I can't take
it anymore, I do get up

00:27:30.742 --> 00:27:32.450
and I go in the room
next door, and it so

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.890
happens to be the kitchen.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.740
And with my fingers, my creative
fingers who cannot just do

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.680
intellectual stuff, I will
either cook something or make

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.550
myself a cup of tea.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:41.310
It doesn't matter.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.430
I need to use my
fingers differently.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:44.540
I come back.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.530
I sit down.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.450
And when I get stuck
again, I'll probably

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:52.250
grab a pen and start
drawing a star or whatever,

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.700
because I'm thinking already
about the cover of the book.

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:59.570
And it matters to me as much
as what's inside the book.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.560
And then I get back to work.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.990
And I live in Paris.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.136
When I get stuck again--

00:28:04.136 --> 00:28:05.510
I even live in
this neighborhood.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:06.920
You may see me walking around.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.590
When I get stuck again,
what I do is I go outside.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.560
And I need to see, I need to
count buses, and [FRENCH],,

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.950
and whatever there is,
because my curiosity needs

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:19.340
to be fed every day.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.840
And on the way back,
I will probably

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.420
call somebody, and
have a conversation

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.840
with a live person.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.820
And once I understood that
and honored that, not only

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.360
was I able to hand my book
in with the 24 hours ahead

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.360
of time, but most
importantly, I began

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.730
enjoying what I was doing.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.340
And what we each and every
one of us has to remember

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:44.930
is that we are
completely unique.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:50.660
We are a completely unique
composition of these qualities.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.880
Statistically, it's
impossible to have somebody

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.230
in this room who has the
same design of qualities

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:58.760
than you have.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:03.960
And probably, if you are stuck
in anything in your life--

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.500
whether it's a project that's
difficult, or communicating

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.900
with your kids, communicating
with your lover, whatever

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.190
it is--

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:14.600
you are probably not
using your top qualities.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.120
And you are probably using the
ones that are in the middle,

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.610
or maybe the worst
part is in the bottom.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:23.370
The French school system
is very perseverant.

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:27.290
I was a very miserable
student in school.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:30.560
But now that I can design my
own line of work, and the way

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.240
I do it, and however
I want to do it,

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.410
of course there's practically
no limit to where you can go

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:38.510
once you start respecting that.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.655
So when I was looking
for superpowers,

00:29:40.655 --> 00:29:42.280
I also began wondering
if there weren't

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.405
things that were a little
more common to everybody,

00:29:44.405 --> 00:29:47.250
not as singular as the
character strengths.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:50.780
And I ran into something very
interesting called the others.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.296
Other people.

00:29:52.296 --> 00:29:54.170
I don't know if you've
heard the fact that we

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.840
are social creatures,
meaning that we

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.300
are very interdependent.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:04.250
So if people look at
you with admiration,

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.830
you will feel admirable.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:08.330
You say that?

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:11.540
If people look at
you with criticism,

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.790
you're actually going to
feel terrible about yourself.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:14.623
That's how it works.

00:30:14.623 --> 00:30:17.260
We are that sensitive
to other people.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.050
And there's one great study--
you probably heard about this

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.250
study already--

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.350
where researchers
come into classrooms

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:25.960
where children are between
eight and nine years old.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.900
And they tell the teacher, we
came up with a questionnaire

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.440
to determine if you have
high-potential students

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.760
in your class.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.330
OK.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:37.270
So the kids answer
the questionnaires.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:42.500
They have no idea why they
are answering these questions.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.710
So they answer everything.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:48.130
Then the researchers
gather all the tests,

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.470
and they thank everybody,
and they leave.

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:53.560
They get to their lab, and
they throw everything out.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.350
They come back three
weeks later and say,

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.840
we have looked through
every single test,

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.645
which is completely untrue.

00:31:00.645 --> 00:31:02.020
We have looked
through the tests,

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.090
and we have found some
high-potential students

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:04.750
in your class.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.250
Would you like to
know who they are?

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.170
Of course, the teacher says yes.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.120
They don't even go
and see the kids.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.830
They ask for a list.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:14.590
And randomly,
completely randomly,

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.780
they point to three kids.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:19.600
She's one, she's one, he's one.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.300
Those kids, that
particular year,

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.120
made tremendous
progress compared

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.630
to their other classmates,
and later on went

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.550
for longer studies.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:31.450
Why?

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.900
Because for one year, somebody
looked at them thinking,

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.150
you are a high-potential person.

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:41.930
And I can hear you.

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:44.350
So the first thing that comes
through your mind is, OK.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.300
People should have
looked at me differently.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.500
Right?

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.480
That explains it all.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.810
OK.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.160
And if by any chance, you
have children of your own,

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.230
you are completely panicked.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.690
It is still time.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:00.850
But the question that
I would rather ask you

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:03.100
is, how do you look at people?

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.600
Because I know how
the French people

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.250
look at other French people.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:08.500
But how do you look at people?

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.730
Do you look at people wondering,
woof, look at this guy.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:17.830
Or do you wonder, what are
this person's qualities?

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:19.060
What are their superpowers?

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.040
How do I work with
these superpowers?

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.830
Because in an ideal
world, parents

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:26.110
would look at their
children like this.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:29.110
Managers would look at
their employees like this.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:32.380
Teachers would look at
their students like this.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.080
But then there's real life.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.090
I can testify.

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:42.280
When my oldest son, Arthur,
was 21, he came to me

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.020
and he said, OK.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.520
Mom, I'm going to Australia.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.360
So I'm trained in
positive psychology.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.370
The whole deal.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:56.090
And what comes out of my mouth
is, don't even think about it.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:57.640
That's real life.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.250
So what we need to do
about this information--

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.560
just remember that
here, what matters

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:06.890
are the 40% that we
actually have control over.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:10.300
I have no control
over what you're

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.250
right now thinking about me.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:13.510
None.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.080
And I never will.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.210
That, I cannot control.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:17.950
I have no influence on.

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.900
But this is what
I have control on.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.940
I can decide who I talk
to, and about what.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.340
Meaning, when
Arthur comes to me,

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.990
because his plan is
to go to Australia

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:34.600
and I'm unable to encourage
him, then his mission

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.650
is to go to somebody else who
sees him bigger than he is.

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.440
We all have in our lives
people that we actually

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.540
turn to when we want to
do something difficult

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.150
and we say, OK, this
is what I want to do.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:50.199
And then some people
will say, yeah, you know?

00:33:50.199 --> 00:33:50.740
I don't know.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.910
"I just wouldn't want you to be
disappointed" type of reaction.

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:57.295
You don't go back
to these people.

00:33:57.295 --> 00:33:59.920
And then there's another type of
person where you actually say,

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.860
I do want to go to Australia,
who would say, yes, absolutely.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.270
You have to go to Australia.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:12.639
We must know, in our lives,
who sees us bigger than we are.

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.920
We can organize
our support system.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.040
We can organize the mirror
that is actually held

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.190
in front of us, because this
is how we'll push forward.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:26.830
So let me finish with 10
happiness tips, if you want.

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:28.449
Scientifically proven, OK?

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:29.770
All of them.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:31.090
Number one.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.040
Savor more.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.600
[FRENCH]

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.130
You know what savoring is?

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:38.650
We spend so much time being
already in the "whatever's

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:41.570
coming next," or still
in what came before,

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:44.170
that most of the time, we
just forget to be here,

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:46.310
doing what we're
doing right now.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:48.670
So one way to
savor is very easy.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:51.639
When we are actually somewhere
and happy about where we are,

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:55.630
we turn to the person next to us
and we just say, this is great.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:58.120
That's savoring.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.600
Number two.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:06.430
Stop comparing
yourselves to others.

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:10.150
Not only are you
fine the way you are,

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:14.260
but it is the way you are
that we need you to be.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.450
Because that is when
you are the most

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:21.670
singular, the most attractive,
the most competent,

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:23.710
the most unique.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:27.700
There is absolutely nobody
else out there like you.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:31.820
And your only job is to live
with this particular person.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.940
So that's all you have to do.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.550
And when I say stop comparing
yourselves to others,

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:39.790
we usually compare
ourselves socially.

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:43.930
So when it comes to happiness--
this is the next tip--

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:47.170
think less about money.

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:49.210
All the economists have
looked at the situation.

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:54.980
What is the link between
wealth and happiness?

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.660
So of course, if
you are destitute--

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:01.210
if you are a refugee,
for example--

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:05.020
it will make a lot of
difference, necessarily.

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.600
But in this
particular room right

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.110
here, it probably will
not make a difference.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:16.550
Accumulating goods has
never made anybody happy.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:19.790
There is one exception.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:20.520
Shoes.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.985
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING]

00:36:25.142 --> 00:36:26.642
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
Next tip.

00:36:26.642 --> 00:36:27.526
AUDIENCE: Scientifically proven?

00:36:27.526 --> 00:36:28.480
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
Scientifically proven,

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.470
the shoes.

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:31.294
And we're waiting for
the handbag research.

00:36:31.294 --> 00:36:31.960
It's on its way.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.295
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING]

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.700
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
Next tip.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.350
There are three
components to happiness.

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:43.180
One is pleasure, number
two is engagement,

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.610
and number three is meaning.

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:47.920
Which means that
we need all three.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.300
Pleasure is not enough.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.500
Pleasure is great.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.980
Engagement means we
need to be part of.

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.390
Parts of groups,
part of projects.

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:57.550
There's something very
active about being happy.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:59.080
It's not just watching nature.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.360
Watching nature is
part of happiness,

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.680
but there's something
very productive.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.330
But it's not enough.

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:07.480
We also need to have meaning.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.000
Why am I doing all this?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.080
What does it bring to me?

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.520
What am I bringing to the world?

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.550
That's very important.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.994
So there too.

00:37:14.994 --> 00:37:16.660
If you think your
life these days is not

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:20.260
exactly how you want it to be,
do you have enough pleasure?

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.970
Sometimes we're changing the
world and we're super busy.

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:24.820
But is it pleasant
enough for us?

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:27.940
And then sometimes, we're
partying like wild people,

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.190
and we're completely engaged.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:32.230
But is there any meaning to us?

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.510
So it's a way of
adding what you need,

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:37.530
or just making sure
everything is there.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:42.400
Following tip has been
proven by Maria Montessori.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.460
She works with children.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.510
She worked with children.

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:45.890
We're big children.

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:51.410
We're never as happy as when we
have decided what we're doing.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:54.857
So the best thing to do is
to take initiatives and say,

00:37:54.857 --> 00:37:55.940
this is what I want to do.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.392
This is what I want to work on.

00:37:57.392 --> 00:37:58.600
This is what I want to watch.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.860
This is what I want to eat.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.900
The more we express
our needs and desires,

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.780
the easier it is to get there.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:11.230
Number six, cherish
your families.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:12.880
Cherish your friends.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.740
Cherish your colleagues.

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:15.590
Why do I say this?

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:20.420
Because the longest happiness
study began in 1938.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:23.530
It was decided to follow
the entire class of Harvard

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:24.220
University.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.200
All men at the time.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.380
And they all agreed to answer
a questionnaire every year

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:35.110
about their life conditions
and their happiness levels.

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:39.200
After 30 years, the
researcher retires.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.040
So the younger researchers come
in and say, so now, come on,

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.350
you've been looking at these
people for 30 years now.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.330
Can you tell us anything
about happiness?

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:49.510
Have you noticed any difference
between the ones that are happy

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:50.815
and the ones that aren't?

00:38:50.815 --> 00:38:52.030
And he said, yeah.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:52.960
Absolutely.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.790
I know everything
about these guys.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:55.777
I know where they live.

00:38:55.777 --> 00:38:56.860
I know how much they make.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.350
I know if they are alcoholic,
if they're depressed.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:02.690
I know if their mother was nice
to them when they were kids.

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:11.160
And the only thing
that matters is love.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:15.690
And when he says love, it's not
just romantic or family ties,

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:18.060
but it is the nature
of relationships

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.710
that we actually
have in our lives.

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:24.540
Following tip, "trois kifs"--

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.920
three good things.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:30.460
Count your blessings.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:35.860
A blessing is something
that you have the urge

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.590
to say thank you for.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:40.120
Usually, it's called gratitude.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.670
It usually starts with
pleasure, but pleasures just

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:43.960
fly out the door.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.980
Unless we stop just for a
second and think to ourselves,

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.290
for that, thank you.

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:54.160
When we do that, we can
gain up to seven years

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.650
of life expectancy.

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:58.510
There is a
physiological response

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:01.360
to gratitude that will
make us live longer

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.220
and in better health.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.450
The following tip,
exercise more.

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:06.430
I told you.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.040
And I'm just talking
about mood exercise.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.690
I'm not talking about
physical health.

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:12.340
Just the brain health.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:17.550
We were not designed to order
sushi and ride escalators.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.210
That was just not the plan.

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:22.240
So our bodies are
completely underused.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.060
We need to use the body in
order to irrigate the brain.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:28.750
So it's three times, 30
minutes of aerobic anything

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:29.717
that you want to do.

00:40:29.717 --> 00:40:32.300
When you live in Paris, usually
you walk around, so it's good.

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.200
You're there already.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.700
Next before last.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:41.740
When you talk about
happiness, giving is always

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.500
superior to receiving.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:48.140
Which means that every time we
do something for somebody else,

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.050
we get a little
shower of dopamine

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:54.080
up in the brain that makes
us feel absolutely wonderful.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.900
And then the last tip--

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.910
this one is physiological.

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:01.630
This one will work with
anybody, whomever you are.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:05.380
When you need to feel
better, right in a moment,

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.830
in an instant, there's
only one thing to do.

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:11.160
Smile.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.430
And when I say smile,
it's not smile.

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:17.490
But when all the muscles
in the face are engaged,

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:20.790
it's impossible to
experience dark thoughts.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:21.597
Thank you.

00:41:21.597 --> 00:41:24.032
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:30.129 --> 00:41:31.337
SPEAKER 2: Thank you so much.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:37.730
Thank you very much, Florence.

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:41.050
That was a very insightful,
very entertaining talk.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:43.130
Thank you.

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:45.830
I know you've got a short
window just for some Q&amp;A.

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:49.670
So can I open it
up to the audience?

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:51.977
Are there any questions
following this talk?

00:41:51.977 --> 00:41:53.310
Have any questions for Florence?

00:41:55.775 --> 00:41:57.400
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
So questions

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.280
can be your own stories.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.040
When it comes to happiness,
positive psychology

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.650
is just about observing
regular people.

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:07.060
So why is it useful?

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.710
Because we're so
busy with our lives

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:11.200
that we only do the
things, we do them.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:15.370
And sometimes, just hearing how
other people actually do things

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:16.470
gives us more ideas.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.990
So how can I say?

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:22.150
Your experience has as
much value as anything

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:23.400
that I have said so far.

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.901
What is this yellow box?

00:42:24.901 --> 00:42:26.150
SPEAKER 2: It is a microphone.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.110
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
Oh, it's a microphone!

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:28.750
SPEAKER 2: It can be thrown.

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.791
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
So there's a running--

00:42:30.791 --> 00:42:32.830
oh, it can be thrown, OK.

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:33.492
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:33.492 --> 00:42:34.450
I just have a question.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:37.389
Don't you think that happiness
is linked to expectations?

00:42:37.389 --> 00:42:39.430
The less you expect, then
the more happy you are?

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:40.310
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
[CHUCKLING]

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:40.750
Yeah.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:42.666
Well, sometimes it's
also fun to expect things

00:42:42.666 --> 00:42:44.260
that actually happen, you know?

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.930
There's that too.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:48.100
How can we put it this way?

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:55.570
Maybe expectations are [FRENCH],,
or can hinder happiness.

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:57.050
Yes, there is a link.

00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:01.550
But it's also great
to have expectations.

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:03.730
For example, when
people actually buy

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.540
tickets to the lottery--

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.600
so the worst thing
that can happen to you

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.020
is win the lottery, because
then you're in huge trouble.

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:14.350
Mentally, it is a big challenge
to actually win a lottery.

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:20.170
But buying the ticket is
the instant of expectations.

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:22.900
And the reason so many people
buy these tickets knowing

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.900
that they will
never win anything

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:27.820
is just for the
thrill of imagining

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.610
what you would do
if you actually

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:32.470
did win all that money.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:36.310
So anticipation, rather
than expectations,

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:38.660
is a great feeling.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.020
And that's another
tip I can give you--

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.370
but you know that already--

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:44.860
is to have things in your
life that you actually

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:49.510
anticipate that are coming
that are not there yet.

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:51.400
Sometimes we say
here in-- at least

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.200
in France-- that the
best part about love

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:57.190
is walking up the stairs, right?

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:59.104
That's anticipation.

00:43:59.104 --> 00:44:01.270
SPEAKER 2: We have another
question just over there.

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.769
Thank you.

00:44:01.769 --> 00:44:04.716
AUDIENCE: So where does
culture come in on this?

00:44:04.716 --> 00:44:07.240
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
So culture is very present,

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.040
but the brain structure
remains the same.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.900
I mean, you are probably all
very multi-cultured here.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.860
And whoever has been
raised in France

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.840
and travels to
the United States,

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:23.350
for example, realizes it's
a very different culture.

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.960
Because, for example, when
it comes to happiness--

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:29.510
and I don't want to generalize,
because each individual is,

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.219
of course, very unique.

00:44:31.219 --> 00:44:33.760
But it's true that when you do
get to sunny California, which

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.730
has been my case
many times, people

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:40.990
are by default
positive about what can

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:43.270
happen, about a possibility.

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:45.970
Whereas when you come
back to Paris, by default,

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:48.820
we are against
whatever is happening.

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:50.320
That's the basis.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:54.390
Because if we are against,
then it's much chicer.

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:55.350
It's [FRENCH].

00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:58.960
It is.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.630
Because we believe
that because we

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:04.750
come from such an
intellectual background, yes?

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:09.100
We believe that if we
mark our opposition,

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.939
it shows that we have
thought about it.

00:45:11.939 --> 00:45:12.730
That we're smarter.

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:14.650
So culture is huge.

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:18.430
But inside, the mechanisms
are the same ones.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:19.600
So we have access.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.715
Even us in Paris, we do
have access to happiness.

00:45:21.715 --> 00:45:23.260
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING]

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.968
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
It's possible.

00:45:25.949 --> 00:45:28.240
AUDIENCE: Do you mind if I
ask you a personal question?

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:28.900
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER: Try.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:29.930
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:32.480
So yesterday was
International Day of Girls,

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.590
and I would be very curious
to know what kind of girl

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:38.542
you were, and what was your
approach with happiness.

00:45:38.542 --> 00:45:40.125
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
As a child?

00:45:40.125 --> 00:45:40.810
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:42.100
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER: OK.

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:46.330
Even as a grownup, I'm a
very worried, pessimistic

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:51.280
individual, which is the reason
that I found so much value

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.230
in what I'm bringing you today.

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:54.310
I am not like that.

00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:57.610
I mean, I am
completely like that.

00:45:57.610 --> 00:45:58.960
But it comes.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.640
It comes from fear.

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:04.510
It comes from just--

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:09.430
yeah, I guess fear is probably
the best word to qualify it.

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:12.490
Because I am an
anxious person, I

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:15.430
need to do things that make
life easier for myself,

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:17.130
if that answers your question.

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:20.110
But I did have fun too.

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.410
But yes, it does
it does come from--

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:25.420
the thing about positive
psychology-- and you know that.

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.770
You all know that.

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:30.345
When life is all right,
we need none of this.

00:46:30.345 --> 00:46:31.720
We need none of
this information.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.600
We just go on leading our lives.

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.020
That's what we do.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:39.520
But when all of a sudden,
things get a little darker,

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.680
and things get a little
more complicated,

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:46.150
then it's very useful to know
that we have these resources.

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:47.530
I'll give you an example.

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:50.200
When it comes to gratitude--
my favorite absolute topic

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.760
is gratitude.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.670
When the researchers
decided to look

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:58.510
at what the impact of gratitude
can be, one thing they did--

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:00.040
they actually found out.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:04.060
They decided to go, and
five years after 9/11,

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:07.750
go meet with the
victims' families.

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:11.620
They wanted to understand
what people had done

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:12.980
in order to get back into life.

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.040
How did they get back into life?

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.900
And they found
different families.

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.340
Some were not back into life.

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:19.820
Some were already
back into life.

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:23.080
And one of the differences
between the two

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:25.720
is that the ones who
were back in motion

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:30.730
were people who, before
9/11, in their everyday life,

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:35.290
were expressing gratitude,
and feeling gratitude.

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:39.040
So this is why, when we talk
about preventive psychology,

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.670
the more in our
everyday OK lives

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:46.150
we can practice to use
gratitude, for example,

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:50.890
and to feel grateful, when
the storm hits the fan,

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:52.720
we will have more training.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.944
It will be easier for us to
actually press on the button.

00:47:55.944 --> 00:47:58.360
So this is what is so precious
about all this information.

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:02.470
Once again, it's just to train.

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:08.350
The default mode of our brain
is to first perceive negativity.

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:12.220
Whatever is wrong,
smells awful, is scary,

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:17.410
has much more impact on us
than what is nice, and good,

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:18.840
because we consider it regular.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.820
It's a safety measure.

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:22.300
It's very useful for danger.

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:25.900
But, however, for the day
we really get in trouble,

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.870
it is definitely worth,
while things are OK,

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:31.430
to start training with all
those little exercises.

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:34.420
And optimism is one
that I really work on.

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:36.160
I work on it.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.960
It's like an exercise that I do.

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.300
It's like a physical exercise
that I do on my brain,

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.381
or else I just think
the world is over.

00:48:43.381 --> 00:48:45.130
And every time one of
my kids had a fever,

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:47.080
I thought he was going to die.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.780
So this is why we need to train.

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:51.852
We all know what our levels are.

00:48:51.852 --> 00:48:53.060
We know what our buttons are.

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.644
We know what our fears are.

00:48:54.644 --> 00:48:55.810
And we can help those fears.

00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:56.685
That's the good news.

00:49:00.795 --> 00:49:01.920
SPEAKER 2: Two more people.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.450
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER: Do
you ever throw it, actually?

00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:04.020
AUDIENCE: I will.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:05.460
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
Have people thrown it?

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:05.960
Op!

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:06.570
Woo!

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:07.070
OK.

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:09.070
SPEAKER 2: That's
throwing it, yeah.

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:09.986
AUDIENCE: Here you go.

00:49:09.986 --> 00:49:11.622
AUDIENCE: Merci.

00:49:11.622 --> 00:49:13.080
I like it very much
when you shared

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.830
the story of your son
coming to you saying

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:19.590
he was going to Australia and
you were not really supportive.

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:22.950
But what happens when you
actually try to be supportive

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:25.290
but just think that someone
has a very bad idea?

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:26.840
How do you manage that?

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.550
Can I just say, go to someone
who is going to be supportive,

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:31.500
because you really,
truly, sincerely

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.869
think that it's not a
good thing for them.

00:49:33.869 --> 00:49:35.660
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
Well, of course.

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:37.750
That's called a debate.

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:39.590
And you can get
into a conversation.

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:41.010
In that case, it
was a good idea,

00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:43.050
so I had nothing more to say.

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:45.780
But of course, you debate
your ideas, necessarily.

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:47.725
And people do have
terrible ideas.

00:49:47.725 --> 00:49:49.350
And when you're a
mother, wait till you

00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:51.044
see what ideas your kids have.

00:49:51.044 --> 00:49:52.085
They have terrible ideas.

00:49:52.085 --> 00:49:53.251
AUDIENCE: I can see already.

00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:58.980
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to ask you a question.

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:03.069
So if you do some readings,
or if you go to such talks,

00:50:03.069 --> 00:50:04.610
and you feel really
inspired, but you

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:06.135
have someone that
you really love,

00:50:06.135 --> 00:50:08.510
and you see that they're stuck,
and they're in an unhappy

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:11.150
place, what can
you do to help them

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:13.400
without coaching them
or sounding like you're

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.650
giving them instructions?

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:16.400
I would be really interested.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:19.340
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
That's a real life situation.

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:21.920
We cannot change other people.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:26.160
That's the first thing we
have to admit and agree to.

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.410
We cannot change other people.

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:31.340
The only thing we can do
is do what we believe in.

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:33.040
Because if you start
coaching somebody,

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.600
they will maybe resist it.

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.120
The only thing you can
do, if you strongly

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:39.740
believe in being
a different way,

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:41.390
is to actually be that way.

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:44.870
And there's something that ends
up being contagious, or not.

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:46.452
Not everybody will follow you.

00:50:46.452 --> 00:50:48.410
But at least that's the
only thing you can try.

00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:50.140
But going to somebody saying--

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:52.550
a lot of people come to
my talks and say, ugh.

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:54.300
I have to tell my
mother-in-law about you,

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.120
because she really
needs your talk.

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.520
That type of thing
doesn't really happen.

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.770
The mother-in-law will
not make progress,

00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:03.350
because it's not her motivation.

00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:04.790
We do care for others.

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:08.240
We would like them
to be more positive.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:11.480
But you also have to
understand something, is that--

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:12.680
I have an aunt like that.

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:16.910
She adores terrible news,
but adores to a point

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:20.090
that it's insane.

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:22.580
We have to respect that too.

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:26.810
Some people feed on atrocities.

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:28.520
And it actually does--

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.920
it gives more energy
to their lives.

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.420
So I will never change her.

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:35.690
The only thing I can do, if I'm
around her, is just be the way

00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:39.560
I think that I want to be,
or that I think life can be.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.510
And sometimes miracles happen.

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:42.950
People get better.

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:44.300
And then that's another thing.

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.130
Sometimes people need help.

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:47.480
It depends.

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.940
Sometimes people need
psychological help.

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:52.610
And then we're not talking
about positive psychology,

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:55.340
but this is a mental
health conference today.

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:57.230
And mental health is a
whole different story.

00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:58.700
Sometimes, we
actually need help,

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:01.775
and we have to be
able to get it.

00:52:01.775 --> 00:52:04.280
SPEAKER 2: OK, thank
you very much, Florence.

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:04.730
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
Thank you very much.

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:05.410
SPEAKER 2: Thank you.

00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:06.951
FLORENCE SERVAN-SCHREIBER:
Take care.

00:52:06.951 --> 00:52:09.060
