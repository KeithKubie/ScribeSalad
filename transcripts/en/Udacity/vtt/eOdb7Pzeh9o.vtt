00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.090
Some delay at the beginning of a packet

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.240
stream is acceptable. And similarly, some small amount

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.060
of missing data is okay. We can tolerate

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.120
small amounts of missing data that result in

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.350
slightly reduced quality of the audio or video

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.640
stream. On the other hand, a receiver is

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.450
not very good at tolerating variability in packet

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.460
delay in the packet stream, particularly if the client

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.790
buffer is starved.
