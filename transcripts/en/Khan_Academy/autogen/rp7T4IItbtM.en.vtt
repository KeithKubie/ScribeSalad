00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.340
 In the previous video we talked a bit 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.650
 About the immune system 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.930
 In that video we focused on the non-specialized immune system 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.695
 Or innate 

00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:11.945
 So let me say that 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.310
 Even the non-specialized immune system divides it 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.870
 To the first line of barriers 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.030
 They are things like skin, or infectious acids 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.420
 Or acidic oils present in the outer part of your skin 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.640
 These are natural barriers that prevent 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.210
 Things get into your body, but once you enter them 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.520
 You can imagine that this is 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.830
 First line of defense 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.730
 And then you have the second line of defense, but these 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.970
 They remain non-specialists - and when we say non-specialist, we mean 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.680
 They do not necessarily know what kind of viruses, ie 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.460
 A type of protein, any type of bacteria 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.430
 She just knows that this body seems mysterious 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.260
 Let me take it 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.950
 Let me kill him 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.450
 Let me make an inflammatory response 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.710
 In this place, we have said that there is a response 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.230
 Inflammatory, which I will talk about after that 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.470
 We finish the specialized immune system videos 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.580
 You have your inflammatory response which is really 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.990
 You bring things to the event site and then 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.070
 You also have macrophages, which are cells 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.810
 You swallow things 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.940
 In doing so, all kinds of macrophages are occurring 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.070
 In the previous video, they are all components of cells 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.530
 White blood or white blood cells 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.670
 These macrophages are here, all the kinds I talked about 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.320
 Dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.900
 All are white blood cells 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.740
 But not all types of white blood cells exist 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.310
 We will talk more about it - and the other word used 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.920
 The white blood cells are white blood cells 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.620
 It is not specialized 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.660
 It only prevents you from entering but when you enter 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.920
 You say, stop, you're a foreign body 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.880
 I will accuse you 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.980
 I have receptors 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.170
 And you have two double nucleic acid bars floating around 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.030
 Viruses alone have two double nucleic acid strips 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.949
 I will accuse you 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.550
 I do not know which types of viruses you are 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.400
 I do not know if I've seen you before 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.000
 So they are not specialized 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.130
 And now the most exciting thing about our machine 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.240
 Immune - This non-specialized part exists in many and many 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.290
 And many varieties and types of objects, but the specialized part 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.020
 It is somewhat new adaptation 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.450
 What I will talk about is the specialized immune system 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.705
 Which is exceptionally and uniquely human 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.470
 This is our other classification 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.060
 Let me make her like this 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.070
 If you have a specialized part or you can imagine 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.690
 It is an acquired immune system 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.850
 You might have heard of something like before 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.690
 I have immunity against these bacteria or that virus 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.800
 If this is the acquisition 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.800
 It is actually built on exposure to these things 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.580
 Regarding the immune system, we talked about it a bit 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.600
 When we talked about molecules we knew about antigens 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.810
 Carried out by macrophages - this plays a role here 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.430
 We'll go into more details but I do not want to 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.230
 To confuse you 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.300
 But the key players here are lymphocytes, do not confuse 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.570
 Because of white blood cells - because they 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.180
 One of its kind 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.430
 Let me say that 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.060
 These are corneas 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.180
 Specialized, but more specialized but both 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.860
 White blood cells 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.630
 Lymphocytes are another type of 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.850
 White blood cells or white blood cells 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.150
 I do not want to confuse you with this creepy painting, but 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.510
 I want to make clear terms 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.350
 When someone talks about white blood cells, it is 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.380
 Only talking about the range of cells they found when 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.100
 Try to separate the blood components for the first time - you will get 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.470
 On your red blood cells that will be traced 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.040
 At the bottom, then you will have this layer of white kind things in 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.840
 The middle is actually made up of white blood cells 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.660
 Here at the top you have a liquid, plasma of 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.000
 Your blood, a fairly watery part 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.290
 Hence the name came out, and they have 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.350
 Other roles, but they interact with each other 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:24.890
 Now lymphocytes can be divided into B lymphocytes, usually 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.380
 B cells are called T lymphocytes 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.350
 B and T come from the name of the place where these cells evolved 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.820
 B lymphocytes were first identified in 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.820
 Fabrichus pod 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.810
 So called B 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.520
 It is really a part of the bird body contributes to 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.410
 immune system 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.520
 Thus B comes from Barsa but B applies to 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.380
 The human immune system because it is made in the bone marrow 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.790
 This is an easier way to remember 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.920
 It is manufactured in the bone marrow 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.500
 It develops in the bone marrow but historically the letter B comes from 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.290
 Vibricos pod, in case you want to learn 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.420
 But easy to remember 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.720
 The B can also express the bone marrow it is 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.000
 The place where it was produced 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.490
 T lymphocytes arise in the bone marrow 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.760
 But it develops into what it is in the thymus 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.110
 Hence the letter T 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.130
 Now in this video I will focus only on the B cells 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.260
 Because frankly if you focus on everyone 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.530
 We will have a full hour video 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.570
 But frankly B lymphocytes to some extent - a sense I do not want 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.230
 To pick and pick favorite things, but there is something inside 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.930
 Mental - I prefer B lymphocytes as per 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.570
 B lymphocytes contribute to the so-called 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.820
 Humoral response 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.050
 I will tell you what the meaning of the humorous response is 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.810
 You will see that the T lymphocytes contribute to the so-called 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.910
 Response by cells and we will talk about them in 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.160
 Video is coming 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.770
 Are actually doing other classes of T lymphocytes 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.470
 We'll see that there are T cells there and there 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.950
 Cytotoxic T cells 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.370
 I know that all this is confusing at first glance but 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.180
 So I just want to focus on 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.180
 This part is here 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.240
 We will see in the future that T cells help 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.710
 Play a role in multiplying and energizing 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.400
 This humoral response 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.540
 But the simplified way of thinking about the difference between 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.480
 The humoral response and response by cells are 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.470
 When I get injured, let's assume that I am 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.485
 Have you had a viral infection okay? 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.230
 At first when the virus enters my devices, just be 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.710
 Immersed in liquids in my devices 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.330
 The fluid in our organs is what responds to it 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:59.800
 Capsules, for the humoral fluids in your body 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.050
 If you have your viruses 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.270
 These viruses are impure 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.740
 If at the same time you are still standing, do not settle down 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.710
 Within cells, there is a humoral response 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:18.600
 Appear in place 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.070
 The same is true if we have small stray bacteria 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.860
 You have not entered the cells yet 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.320
 Are just hanging in the liquid, here will be 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.130
 The humoral response is useful 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:37.730
 Now, if we are surprised that they have entered the cells 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.580
 If the cells are now infected with the virus 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.570
 Viruses are produced using existing keystones 

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.940
 In the cell to give more and then suddenly we have to be 

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.950
 Sophisticated in dealing with these 

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.180
 Cells with these viruses will not 

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.580
 Be just bewildered anymore 

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.230
 I think we would be willing to kill this cell even though it was 

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.010
 One of our cells but now helps in the manufacture of viruses 

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.260
 Or may be colonized by bacteria 

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.490
 So in both cases, you want to kill her 

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.010
 I will talk more about cell response
