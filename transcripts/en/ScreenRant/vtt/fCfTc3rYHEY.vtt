00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.580
If the movie you're watching was made recently

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.460
portion of what you're seeing is probably computer generated

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.960
While some people argue that CGI is cheapening the medium

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.200
the market is still booming

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.860
and sadly for any science-fiction hipsters out there

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.680
it's no longer genre specific either

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.760
but despite all the criticism so many amazing things have been brought to life by CGI

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.260
that we can't help but stand in awe at the artists and engineers behind the scenes who make the vision come to life

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.000
Using a process called chroma keying

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.100
they are able to insert a person into an inviroment

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.300
but to do so some pretty hilarious things have to happen first

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.400
Before we jump into our list can you guess the movie from these emojis

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.600
stay tuned for the answer

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.880

In the meantime though here are Screen Rant's ten funniest moments where actors were replaced by CGI

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.120
That things part raptor

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.820
(dinosaur groans)

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.340
Jurassic World

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.320
If we learned anything from the first three Jurassic Park movies

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.120
it's that dinosaurs are scary

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.960
we've spent decades living in fear as a result

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.240
but then jurassic world came along and shattered the meticulously crafted facade

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.440
as they're know to do some set photos leaked onto the internet and gave us a humorous glimpse into what life is really like for a velociraptor

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.580
and it's far less gnarly than you think

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.940
it turns out they're just a bunch of dudes in grey onesies dancing around with silly dino shaped hats atop their noggins

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.820
and while that information gives us a good giggle we're also a little jealous

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.560
Allowed you

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.320
How do you know what that is

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.460
Mozzarella of course

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.140
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.880
The inflatable costume has revolutionised the wardrobe industry

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.640
and turns any regular Halloween party into a classy Halloween party

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.480
after all nothing screams posh more than having to yell all your conversations over the buzzing of a small fan near your crotch

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.800
The motion capture actors behind the new teenage mutant ninja turtles know what we're talking about

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.980
or at least their onset costumes make it look like they might

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.320
People who were familiar with the franchise as kids have all dreamed of becoming a ninja turtle

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.600
and anyone who says otherwise is lying to your face

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.760
regardless of how cumbersome a shell might be

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.880
(distant shouting)

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.360
The Revenant

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.080
Leo may have won the Oscar but everyone everywhere agrees that the bear was the Revenants real MVP

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.940
we've not met one person who disagrees and we probably never will

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.440
but in the interest of full disclosure we have to tell you something

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.960
that wasn't a real bear

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.180
we know you're disappointed we were too until we saw the costume used to simulate the creatures onset presence

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.520
and again just like with Jurassic World's raptor costumes we find ourselves overwhelmingly green with envy

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.320
now that you're in on the secret we wouldn't be surprised if you added the costume to your Amazon wish list before the sentence was over

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.640
(explosions)

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.240
Iron Man 2

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.220
We've made our love for Robert Downey Jr. crystal clear over the years

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.780
but even we have to remember that he's a flesh-and-blood human being

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.440
and as such the Iron Man costume must have been as awkward as a cow on ice

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.560
thankfully though some merciful soul in the FX Department rigged up some sweet pajamas for Downey Jr. and co-star don Cheadle

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.840
sure they still had to wear the helmets of their respective character

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.200
but at least it wouldn't take them three hours to go to the bathroom anymore

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.740
Superman Returns

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.700
So far we've seen examples of motion capture actors being replaced with cooler more interesting big-screen characters

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.620
but sometimes people's performances are utilized with the sole intention of erasing them later

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.540
that may sound counter-intuitive but in pratice it makes total sense

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.760
for example you wouldn't trust a wind machine to do the hard job of blowing Superman's cape just so as he soars through the sky

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.280
clearly that kind of work should be left to the professionals

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.420
two gentlemen puppeteers in head to toe neon spandex

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.600
(screeching) oh yeah exfoliate me

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.460
The Jungle Book

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.580
Last year's re-imagining of the Jungle Book was great for a lot of reasons

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:23.060
for one it was pretty cool to watch a then 12 year old Neil Sethi act circles around a bunch of seasoned vets

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.600
but for many the insane visual effect were the movies crowning achievment

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.040
with super convincing animals of all kinds and a steller ensemble cast

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.860
it's made almost a billion dollars worldwide

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.640
but the reality of filming Sethi's scenes weren't as technologically advanced as you might think
