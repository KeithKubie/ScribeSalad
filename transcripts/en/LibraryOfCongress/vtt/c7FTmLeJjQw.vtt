00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.180
&gt;&gt; We have a wonderful
program planned for you today,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.620
and we're doing it with one
of our long-time partners,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.040
Everybody Wins DC,
a program I've known

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.200
about for a long time
and really admire.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.420
This is part of their
career literacy series

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.990
in which they select
a partner for an event

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.530
and provide everyone
with a free book.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.450
I want to take just a moment
to thank our co-sponsor,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.440
Everybody Wins, and I'd also

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.050
like to introduce their new
executive director, Molly Teas.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.850
Molly.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.260
[ Applause ]

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.170
Welcome, and thank you, and I know
you're going to take Everybody Wins

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.070
to new heights, so we're
just delighted you're here.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.580
Thanks to Everybody Wins.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.700
You all are going to get a copy

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.740
of the national book
award-wining "March" the third.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.700
I hope I get one too.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.320
It's a graphic novel by Congressman
Lewis and his digital director

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.090
and policy advisor, Andrew Aydin.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.740
So together they have
written a fascinating account

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.280
of the civil rights marches
in Selma, Alabama, in 1965.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.970
Also with us today, and
this is a real treat,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.230
from WAMU Radio is long-time
talk show host Kojo Nnamdi.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.510
We're very lucky-- yes.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.130
[ Applause ]

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.120
We're very fortunate to have
him here today and taking time

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.070 position:56%
out of his very busy schedule, and
he is going to moderate our question

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.980
and answer period, which is when
you all will have the opportunity

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.240
to ask questions.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.080
The program is being
recorded, so please wait

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.520
for a microphone before
you ask your question.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.790
And now I want to go off
script for just two minutes.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.330
The first thing is, I just saw
the wonderful PBS documentary

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.420 position:56%
about the life of Congressman Lewis.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.230
It's really unbelievable, and
one of the things that he talks

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.700 position:56%
about in the documentary is the
great civil rights icon, Rosa Parks.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.640
And I want you to know that we,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.750
the Library of Congress
has the Rosa Parks papers

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.800
in our collection, and
they're all online.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.220
You can go to our website,
LOC.gov, and you can get all of,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.120
you can see all of Rosa Parks'
papers, and they are amazing.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.210
The second thing I want to say
is that I was in Orlando in June

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.250
when Congressman Lewis spoke at a
memorial service for the victims

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.860
of those killed in the nightclub
in Orlando, and Congressman Lewis,

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.540
I have to tell you, it was one

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.910
of the most inspiring speeches I
have ever heard, and I just want

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.930
to thank you for all you do,
and I'm just really grateful.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.260
So with that, I'm going
to turn it over to Kojo,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.530
and have a wonderful time,
and thank you so much.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.330
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.050
[ Applause ]

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.350
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: Thank
you all for coming.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.920
The third installment in
the March trilogy written

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.000 position:56%
by Congressman John Lewis and Andrew
Aydin, illustrated by Nate Powell,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.510
has won a lot of awards--

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.400
the National Book Award for
Young People's Literature,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.000
the Coretta Scott King Book Award,
the Michael L. Printz Award,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.140
the Robert F. Sibert
Informational Book Award,

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.370
the Young Adult Library Services
Association Award for Excellence

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.580
in Nonfiction, the
Walter Dean Myers Award

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.540
for Outstanding Children's
Literature Young Adult Category--

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.050
and that's just to name a few.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.580
It's a best seller that has helped
to further break down the barriers

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.080
between graphic novels or comics
and powerful work of nonfiction,

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.550
and so I am delighted to
talk with the Congressman

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.250
and Andrew Aydin today
to talk about it.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.510
Could you please welcome
Congressman John Lewis.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:37.510
[ Applause ]

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.510
And Andrew Aydin.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:46.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.480
Congressman Lewis,
I'll start with you.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.420 position:56%
You've been tireless in your work
not just on this book but in talking

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.520
about it with students, with
librarians, and journalists,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.320
and you gave a very moving speech

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.630
in accepting the National
Book Award late last year.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.610
What does the recognition this
work has received mean to you?

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.910
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: Well thank you.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.830
First of all, Kojo, it's
good to see you brother.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.610
Always good to see you.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.210
And thank you for all the good

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.280
and great things that
you continue to do.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.630 position:56%
It's good to be here at the
Library of Congress, good to see all

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.110
of you beautiful, handsome
young people.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.410
You look so wonderful.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.670
You look so smart.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:41.850 position:56%
When I go and speak about this book,
reread the book, turn the pages,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.810
and see certain drawings
and images, it takes me back

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.300
to another part of my life.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.290
You know from reading "March" book
one, book two, and book three,

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:59.140
I grew up in rural Alabama,
50 miles from Montgomery,

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.010
outside of a little
place called Troy.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.410
So [inaudible] received
[inaudible] along with Andrew Aydin

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.710
and Nate Powell, it was too much.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:18.350
We stood together, and I
was, I was lost for words.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:27.020
It took me back to rural Alabama
in 1956 when I was 16 years old

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.520
with some of my brothers
and sisters and cousins.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.690
We went to a little library
to try to get a library card,

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.100
trying to check out some books,
and we were told by the librarian

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.840
that the library was for
whites only and not for colors.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.520
I didn't go back to that library
for many, many years later,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.220
but this time I'm in the
Congress for a book signing.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.220
So hundreds of blacks and
white citizens showed up,

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.540
and after the book signing,
after we had some refreshment,

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.750
they gave me a library card.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.430
And to work with Andrew, who
is so gifted and so smart,

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:18.590
and Nate Powell, it's
been a work of love.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.930
And to see young people
standing in line to get the book,

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:29.510
to get the book signed, and to take
a seat in the middle of the floor

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:35.040
at a table, a desk, and read
the book, and as I travel

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:42.250
around America, different places,
people come up with the book,

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.420
said I'm buying this book for
my son or my brother, my nieces,

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.010
my nephews, so I think
it's a good thing.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.310
We all should read.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.660
Books are powerful.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.860
They can take us places
that we dare to go.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.450
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: I'm glad you
finally got your library card.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.750
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: Yes.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.150
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: Before we get
to the third book in the series,

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.090
let's talk a little bit about
why this project took the shape

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.240
that it did as a graphic novel.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.490
Comics actually have some
ties to civil rights movement.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.100
When did you first
encounter a comic that spoke

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.470
to the civil rights movement?

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.820
&gt;&gt; In late 1957 or
either early 1958,

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.470
I remember reading a comic book
called Martin Luther King Jr.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.440
and the Montgomery Story.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.860 position:56%
It sold for ten cents, and Andrew
would tell you through his research,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:44.950
he discovered that Dr.
King helped edit this book.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:52.600
This book became like a road map
for those of us that got involved

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.430
in the American civil
rights movement.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.500
It told the story of Montgomery.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.650
It spoke about the way of peace,
the way of love, the philosophy

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:10.330
for nonviolence, how people
organize, how people walked,

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:16.630
shared rides in cars, church
buses, [inaudible] rides,

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.230
segregated buses in Montgomery.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.090
In Montgomery during the '50's,

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:26.950
black and white people couldn't
be seated together on a city bus.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:33.450
Even here in Washington, DC, in
1961 during the freedom rise,

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.990
black people and white people
couldn't be seated together leaving

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.130
Washington to travel through
Virginia or North Carolina

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.590
or South Carolina or
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:53.510 position:56%
So public transportation, whether
the train or buses, had been a means

00:09:53.510 --> 00:10:00.970
of carrying the story in the way
of the civil rights movement.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.790
[Inaudible] those signs that said
white waiting, colored waiting,

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.960
white men, colored men,
white women, colored women.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.970
And I say to young
people all the time,

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:17.020
growing up today you won't
see those signs on a bus

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.470
or on a train or a waiting room.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.920 position:56%
The only place that you'll see
those signs today will be in a book,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.630
in a museum, or on a video.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.990
They're gone, and it's my hope
they will never, ever return.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.340
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: Andrew
Aydin, despite the fact

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:39.010
that the Congressman encountered
that graphic novel of comic

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:43.380
about Dr. King when he
was just 17 years old,

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.030
you still had a little trouble
convincing your colleagues

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.840
and even the Congressman
himself to write a graphic novel.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:59.000
Why did you think this was the
right format for this project?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.370
&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: I
grew up in Atlanta.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.120
The Congressman has
been my Congressman

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.420
since I was three years old.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:07.480
I went to Atlanta Public
Schools, and I heard the story

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.300
of the Civil Rights Movement
over and over and over again.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.210
I heard it in documentaries.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.760
I heard it in books.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.800
I heard people tell the stories.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.540
But to me, I'd grown
up reading comics.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.650
It was sort of my salvations,
my refuge, right.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.260
My father left when I was
four or five years old,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.560
and it was sort of where I turned.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.680
I wanted stories of
heroes who wanted justice

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.500
because it was the
right thing to do.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.920
And that summer [loud tone
noise], should I bebop that?

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:42.120
[laughter] That summer
of the campaign in 2008,

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.990
Barack Obama was sweeping
through the democratic primaries,

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.590
people in politics were
fundamentally reevaluating the way

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.140
in which they communicate with
young people but with everyone,

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.470
whether it's the internet,
the visual literacy that comes

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.230
with that, or simply just
how you talk to people,

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.770
like what we're willing
to talk about.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.150
And so as it came down
to the internet campaign

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.690
and the Congressman tells
me about Martin Luther King

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.070
and the Montgomery story, I
mean these were two things

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.060
that were incredibly
important in my life.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.310
Here I'd spent the whole summer
watching John Lewis tell these

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.610
stories that I had never
heard growing up in Atlanta.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.830
The story of SNCC, the
story of the young people,

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.500
which was so much different than
the story I had always been told,

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.760
and at the same time the
Congressman was telling me

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.470
that he read a comic book when he
thought about joining the movement.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.760
I mean, the 24-year-old nerd
just kind of exploded, you know.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:39.030
And it felt like it was
okay to be me, right.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:43.180
Like oh, maybe it wasn't so weird
for me to like comics after all.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.070
Maybe it was all the other people
who put them down who were wrong.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:51.730
And so when I try to think, you
know, there should be a comic book

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.850
about John Lewis' life,
it was in a sense

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:59.010
to show everyone what I
had just seen that summer,

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.260
what I had witnessed first-hand.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.110
And hearing John Lewis tell the
story, seeing him acted out,

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:10.840
seeing him in front of you, that
was a big part of it for me,

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.280
and so trying to find a way to
capture that experience and put it

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.340
down on paper, words alone
could not do it the justice

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.230
that it needed, so--

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.190
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: What do you make
of the shift and the perception

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:27.450
of graphic novels that the
"March" trilogy has been a part

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.410
of and maybe a leader in?

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.780
&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: I think we broke
the publishing system a little bit,

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:37.190
and I think in a sense "March" is
putting it back together stronger

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.050
than it was before.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:46.360
I don't think we set
out to do that, per se.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.250
We set out to tell
John Lewis' story.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.250
We set out to tell it in a way
that would reach more people

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.140
than had ever been
reached by this story.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:58.220
But the result is, is I
think comics are coming

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.970
of age because of the Internet.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.190
Because like all you all,
you all are digital natives.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.450
You grew up on the Internet.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.580
You communicate through
memes, right?

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:13.920
Like they don't admit it, but like
you have whole conversations with,

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.490
you know, success kid,
and everything else.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.740
And so, yeah, yeah,
somebody's [inaudible] okay.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:27.210
And so for this generation,
comics is there natural language.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.590
It is graphic narrative.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.650
It is, it is sequential
story telling.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.820
It is just simply how this
generation speaks to each other.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.590 position:56%
And so it was only a matter of time,
I think what we're most fortunate

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.050
about is that it was John Lewis'
story that broke down that barrier.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.380
It was a little bit ahead of its
time, and so it was right there

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.020
when it needed to be there
as opposed to, you know,

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:54.330
we could all be celebrating the, I
don't know, the great puppy wars,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.460
or something, you know, that really
wouldn't resonate with us the way

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.600
that John Lewis' story
does and that needs

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.590
to be immortalized the way
John Lewis' story does.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.310
And so I think it was a combination
of being just a little bit ahead

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:10.000 position:56%
of our time and being at the right
place for this generation to be able

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.840
to embrace it because
it's their language.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.960
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: Congressman Lewis,
did it take a lot of convincing

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.760
to get you involved in
writing what [inaudible].

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.510
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: Well, Andrew,
I think probably would say,

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.420
well, it took a little time.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.300
But he didn't give up, you know.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:31.500
He just said, Congressman,
you should write a comic book.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.680
I said, oh, maybe.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.120
He came back again, and I don't
know how many times he came back.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.420
&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: Who's counting?

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.990
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis:
We didn't keep count.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:48.220
[laughter] And I said, I
finally said something like, yes,

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:52.580
if you do it with me,
and the rest is history.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.390
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: Indeed,
a remarkable history.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:58.230
This trilogy begins as
a reflection on the eve

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.140
of President Obama's inauguration,

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.990
a reflection on the work you did
during the civil rights movement,

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:09.250
and it ends more to come here.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.320
Are we in a period
now where we're seeing

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.360
that there's more work
to be done here?

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.040
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis:
Well, I think we are.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:25.820
I just left an unbelievable meeting
when I go enter in on a discussion

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:31.240
about it, but I think in America
today right now people are saying

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.410
where are we going as a
nation and as a people?

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.710
Are we going backward?

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.470
Are we going to stand still?

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:39.250
Or are we going to go forward?

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:45.230
I think [inaudible] tell us
all that we've come a distance,

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:49.930
we've made a lot of progress,
but there are forces that want

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:56.290
to slow us down or take us back,
and we would like for people

00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:02.120 position:56%
to be hopeful, to be optimistic, and
to understand that we're one people,

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.170
that it doesn't matter whether
we're black or white, Latino,

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.830
Asian American, or Native American.

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:12.860
We all live in the same house.

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.160
Not just American house,
but the world house.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.380
There was a man by the name of
A. Philip Randolph that we speak

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:25.190
about because he was the man
who called together the march

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.600
on Washington, and he used
to say from time to time,

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.650
maybe our foremothers and
our forefathers all came

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.000
to this great land
in different ships,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.350
but we're all in the same boat now.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:41.570
We have to look out for each
other and care for each other.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:47.000
And Dr. King said on one occasion,
and he said it so beautifully,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:55.080
that we must learn to live together
as one family, as one people.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.860
If not, [inaudible] as fools.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:08.700
And I think this is message that
we try to convey in "March."

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.190
That it's better to love.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:16.560
It's better to abide by the
principles and the philosophy

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:23.400
of nonviolence and never hate for
hate is too heavy a burden to bear.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.570
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: A. Philip Randolph
was the head of the Brotherhood

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:33.430
of Sleeping Car Porters, and
as Congressman Lewis said,

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:37.480
he called the march on
Washington together in 1963.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.960
Andrew Aydin, as you were
going through this process

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.240
with the Congressman, it gave you
not only a perspective on his life,

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.690
but did it give you an
additional perspective on history

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:54.200
that allows you to better
interpret the present?

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.940
&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: Absolutely.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:02.230
When we first debuted book one,
we went to San Diego Comic-Con,

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:07.110
which is more of my people, right.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:11.910
And so we'd start off, he'd give
a little speech about, you know,

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.300
this is what my book
is about, right?

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:20.550 position:56%
And I asked, I said, have any of you
guys watched Battlestar Galactica?

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.960
You know, it's Comic-Con, so
every hand in the room went up.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.980
And I said well then, you
know, you'll remember all

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.480
of this has happened before, and
all of this will happen again.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.720
And this was in 2013.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.500
This was before Ferguson.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.800
This was before Eric Garner.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.340
This was before the election.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:44.110
This was at a time when I think
people thought it was going

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.800
to be quiet for a while.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.720
But the more you understand about
John Lewis' story and how much

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:56.820
of our politics today are a
direct result from forces trying

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.900
to oppose the progress that
he made, the more it seems

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.380
like an inevitable
conflict was coming.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:12.270
And at the same time, I hope
we conveyed the optimism

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:16.400
that the activists today need,
that the young people they need.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:23.590
I'll often ask the question or pose
it, you know, we have SCLC still.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.750
We have the NAACP still.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.250
We have the Urban League still.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:30.340
What we don't have today
is a student nonviolent

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.790
coordinating committee.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.920
We don't have an organization
of young people dedicate

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.160
to direct action that
is completely staffed

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.510
and organized and run
by young people.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.630
And so when you look
at it in that sort

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:51.900
of context today, history
is your guide.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.700
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: What
stood out to you

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.930
that maybe you didn't
know about before.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.430
I'll tell you what stood
out to me when I read this.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:02.850
I am, as many people know, from
the Caribbean, and when I read

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:07.280
about an attorney who
represented the Congressman early

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:12.110
in his [inaudible] named Alexander
Looby, Alexander Looby it turned

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.280
out was from Antigua, West India.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.250
That was like, whoa, I'm much
more interested in this story now.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.610
[laughter] Did you have those
kinds of experiences, Andrew?

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:26.360
Who stood out to you that maybe
you did not know about beforehand.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.920
&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: There
was just so many of them.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.550
I mean in Nashville I had no idea

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.800
about Will Campbell
or Kelly Miller Smith.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.830
Many of the people that
played such a formative role.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.790 position:56%
I mean Jim Lawson right off the bat.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.150
I mean I'd heard about him and the
Congressman has spoken about him,

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:45.010
but the extent of Reverend Lawson's
role internet Civil Rights Movement

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:48.270
in and of itself have
sort of been lost,

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.630
and I hope we've resurrected
his contribution

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:51.930
because it is so powerful.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:55.860
I mean he may be the
most influential figure

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.790
on the movement behind
Martin Luther King.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:05.340
But it was things like
Bayard Rustin, and you know,

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:09.790
I didn't know Strom Thurmond had
outed him as a gay man on the floor

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.110
of the United States Senate.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.410
And when you see people do
something similar to that today,

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.720
it's hard not to feel
as if they walk

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.150
in that legacy of Strom Thurmond.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:27.110
Or in that vein, I mean I came to
really appreciate the relationship

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.610
between A. Philip Randolph
and Bayard Rustin.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:31.960
You know, Randolph actually
threatened the first march

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:38.760 position:56%
on Washington in 1941, and in effect
made FDR blink and desegregate parts

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.170
of the military industrial complex.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.590
And so when it was
coming down to the end

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:47.210
of book two's research period,
I read an interview from Rustin

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.640
and asked him, what was the most
meaningful moment of your life,

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.430
and he said, you know, there was
this moment at the end of the march

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.990
on Washington and he
came back to the office

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.430
and he saw A. Philip
Randolph looking at his sign,

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.220
and he started teasing him.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.140
Hey boss, there's not
a piece of trash

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.740
or garbage that's completely
cleaned up, you know,

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.250
thinking it was a celebratory
moment, and Randolph turned around,

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:12.470
and he had tears streaming
down his face.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.310
And he just grabbed
Rustin and gave him a hug

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.120
and said, thank you Bayard.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.270
And he said that was the most
meaningful moment of his life,

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.650
and here it was buried in an
interview and a textbook somewhere.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:28.410
And I thought, what a privilege to
be able to offer our own thank you

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:33.610 position:56%
to him for his contribution, a thank
you that was long, long overdue.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.410
It's things like that.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.790
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: I should
say to the young people here,

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:43.730
when you pass through Union Station
there's a bus, A. Philip Randolph,

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:50.510
who was this unbelievable man who
was born in Jacksonville, Florida,

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:56.950 position:56%
moved to New York City and became a
champ in human rights, civil rights,

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:01.320
labor rights, and he had
the ability to organize

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.070
and move people [inaudible]
and just stated Presidents.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:11.740
It was A. Philip Randolph
that called that meeting

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.520
with President Kennedy when
we had the first meeting

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:20.210
to discuss the possibility
of a march on Washington.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:28.680
And you speak about Z.
Alexander Looby, amazing lawyer,

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:33.910
just an unbelievable human being,
and we were sitting in and marching

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:39.990
as students, his home was
bombed early one morning.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:45.600
It destroyed part of his house.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.420 position:56%
His wife was knocked out of her bed.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:53.980
It was near Fisk University,
Meharry Medical School,

00:24:53.980 --> 00:25:00.480
[inaudible] bomb his home, the
Klan tried to kill him and destroy.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:06.360
We made a decision to march
when we heard about it,

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.010
like 6:30 in the morning.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.530
We sent a telegram to the mayor
of the city in Nashville saying

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:15.550
in effect, Mr. Mayor,
meet us on the steps

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.040
of city hall at noon, and by noon--

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.210
&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: High
noon, high noon.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.930
Because you've been
watching westerns.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.550
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis:
That's right, high noon.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:25.850
That's right, Andrew.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.150
High noon.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: My favorite western.

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:29.970
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: And we
had thousands and thousands

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:34.230
of young people, black and
white, high school students,

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:39.330
colored students, parents,
teachers, college professors,

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:43.580
and the mayor said, yes,
I favor desegregation

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:47.170
at the lunch counters
and in the restaurants.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:51.710
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: There's so much
history packed into this trilogy,

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:58.770
so many names that jump out at
you, Al Lowenstein, Ella Baker,

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:05.590
James Forman, Bob Moses,
Fanny Lou Hamer.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:08.880
Talk a little bit about
any one of those people,

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:14.130
who our students here
might not know of.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.400
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: Andrew?

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.160
&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: I'd go with
Ella Baker right off the bat.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:23.750
I mean, she was the mother of
the movement and is so pivotal

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:27.180 position:56%
in a way that's not fully understood
today, and I hope we conveyed

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.440
that as much as possible because
she's one of those characters

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.590
that lives with you
through all of the books.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.840
She was there at the founding
of SNCC, and she was there

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.040
at the founding of the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.360
She was a keynote speaker at
their political convention

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.860
in August of 1964.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.950
She was so important, and I
think one of the great tragedies

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:47.410
of the history that's
been told thus far is

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.750
that women's roles during the
movement have been marginalized,

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:54.310
and I think for us it was so
important to correct that,

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:58.390
to show women like Fanny Lou Hamer
and Ella Baker and Diane Nash

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:03.210
and Genevieve Hughes and everybody
else who participated in one way

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.240
or the other because they
so often were the ones

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.900
who did the nitty gritty.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.460
They didn't push to be
the one in the photograph.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.390
They pushed to be the
one who did the work,

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:17.650
who achieved the hardest part.

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:18.950
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: Fascinating.

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:22.370
When I first came to Washington
among my mentors were people

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:26.080
who worked with the Congressman
[inaudible], and so I knew all

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.660
of those names but didn't
quite know the details

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.080 position:56%
of the history of those individuals.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.500
The trilogy helped me
to understand that,

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.440
why my friends revered Ella Baker
and why they revered Bob Moses

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.360
so much during those time.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.040
But you two worked with illustrated
Nate Powell on this series,

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:46.930
and his images are vivid,
sometimes difficult to look at.

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:50.850 position:56%
Congressman Lewis, was it difficult
for you to think back to those times

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:54.480
and see them depicted in black and
white on the pages of the series?

00:27:54.480 --> 00:28:00.050
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: Well, yes,
and it's still difficult today

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:07.060
when I pick up this book, this
is book three, but book one

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.510
and book two, and see
some of the images.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.230
Sometimes I tear up.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.930
Sometimes I cry.

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:19.680
There is an illustration in
this book depicting me marching,

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:25.760
and I love it because I
guess there's young people,

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.780
and I'm not that young anymore,
but I did look so young, so young.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:35.300
I had all of my hair, and
I was a few pounds lighter,

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.770
and to see me with my backpack.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:44.990
Back in 1965 we were attempting
to march from Selma to Montgomery,

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:51.000
I thought we was going to
be arrested and go to jail.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:59.070
So I bought a backpack from an
army surplus store, of all places,

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:05.210
and I wanted to have something to
read while I was in jail, so I had,

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.300
I thought I was going to really
go to jail, so I had two books.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:14.080
I wanted to have something to eat,
I had an apple and I had an orange.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:18.870
Since I was going to be in jail
with my friends and my colleagues,

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:21.260
I wanted to be able
to brush my teeth,

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.170
so I had toothpaste
and a toothbrush.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:31.250
And when you look at book three
and turn the page, Andrew you know,

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:36.810
I've told you this, I love
that image of this strong,

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:42.950
young John Lewis getting ready
to walk across that bridge.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:49.690
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: With
an apple and an orange.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.880
You know, reading these books,
one discovers that you often went

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.860
against the grain of what others in
the movement were doing or wanted

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:01.310
to do, skipping the signing
ceremony for the civil rights act,

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:06.490
keeping the protests going when the
so-called big fix asked you not to,

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.670
going ahead with the
aforementioned Selma

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:13.510
to Montgomery march [inaudible]
and SNCC were against it.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:18.200
And you talk a lot about this idea
of good trouble, about standing

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:22.850
up for what's right even when it's
not popular, when it's not easy.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.510
Where did you get that
strength from?

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.610
What do you want these
young people to know

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:29.130
about the notion of good trouble?

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:31.890
Maybe just as impatient, how
do you know you're getting

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:35.250
into the good kind of
trouble and not the bad kind?

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.610
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis:
Well, it's very simple.

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:41.770
When I was growing up and would
visit the little town of Troy,

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:48.550
visit Montgomery, Troy's about
ten miles from where I grew up.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:53.250
You go downtown Troy, you see the
signs that say white and colored,

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:55.320
to go to a movie on
a Saturday afternoon,

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.750
all of us little black children
had to go upstairs to the balcony,

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:03.540
and all of the white
children went downstairs.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.700
I would come home and
ask my mother, my father,

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:09.340
my grandparents, why, why?

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:13.590
And they would say, that's the
way it is, don't get in trouble.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:17.150
But I heard of Rosa Parks
when I was 15 years old,

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.090
and I met Rosa Parks when I was 17.

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:22.030
I heard of Dr. King
when I was 15 years old,

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.110
and I met him when I was 18.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.440
It changed my mind, and
so I was inspired to get

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:31.390
in what I call good
trouble, necessary trouble,

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.230
and I've been getting
in trouble ever since.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:40.320
It's very simple to me, when you
see something that is not right,

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.390
not fair, not just,
you have an obligation

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:47.410
to say something, to do something.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.500
We cannot afford to be silent.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:54.890
Because if we're silent, if you
think you like being mistreated,

00:31:54.890 --> 00:32:03.040
you have to resist, and
say that's not right,

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.160
that's not fair, that's not just.

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:12.110
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: For the students in
this room, who live in the District

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:19.200
of Columbia, a city that has
no voting license in Congress,

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:24.170
residents of whom many would
like to see this as a state,

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:30.520
these young people may one
day decide to be active now

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:34.550
and even more so when they reach
voting age, what do you make

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:38.990
of these very fundamental questions
that persist around the issue

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.160
of voting rights, not only in
the district in a very vivid way,

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.740
but in a lot of jurisdictions in
the United States when it comes

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.330
to adequate photo representation.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:53.070
The Voting Rights Act
was passed in 1965?

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:58.290
[inaudible] is a resident
of the District of Columbia.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.050
&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: Yeah,
I mean as a DC resident,

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:04.550 position:56%
I think it's long overdue that we
had full representation in Congress.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:10.160
I don't understand why we can
live in this city and pay taxes

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.980
in this city and, you know, it
seems so often that the opponents

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.580
of voting rights are
also the same people

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:20.330
who declare their rights based
on how much taxes they pay.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.680
And yet, here we are in the
district, and we pay quite a bit,

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.080
and we don't have full
representation.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.580
I think for young people

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:32.050
in particular it's a tremendous
opportunity for civil disobedience.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:34.560
I'm just saying, don't
tell your teachers.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:40.570
[laughter] But I think we
have to acknowledge the fact

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:44.080
that voting rights are under
attack all across the country,

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.930
whether it is fictitious
claims that millions

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:49.680
of people are voting
illegally, which they're not.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.070
Let's just say it, they're not.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:57.200
Or the attempts to make it
harder and more difficult

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.470
for people to register and vote.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:04.230
Full disclosure, I worked on one
of the campaigns in November,

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:09.810
and I was shocked to find
that only one party has voter

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:11.950
protection teams.

00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:16.910 position:56%
The other party doesn't need them,
their voters don't have any trouble,

00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:22.200
and that was profound to me, that
we could create a system that was

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:26.290
so lopsided in its advantages.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:31.950
But when you work for John
Lewis, it's much more than that.

00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:34.870
It is about a fundamental
American belief

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:38.210
that we are all created
equal, and in that belief

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:42.320
that we are all given the
right to vote as participants

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:47.030
in the American democracy, and
when you work against that,

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:53.790
you work against what makes America
strong and what has brought America

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:58.100
to the forefront of global
power, and it makes America weak.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:02.610
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: For those of you
in this room who may be thinking

Congressman Lewis, today we see a
lot of energy, a lot of young people

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:30.310
who would like to effect change,
but there have been those who say

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:34.010
that these current movements lack
direction and they lack leadership

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.480
and cohesion, some of the
things that people said

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.710
about SNCC back in
1960, as I recall.

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:43.320
What is your hope for
what these books

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.900
and for what you can teach
this younger generation

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:48.580
of activists and protesters.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:50.300
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis:
Well, it is my hope

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:55.150
that these books would
inspire another generation

00:35:55.150 --> 00:36:03.300
but the special young people,
the young, to learn the lessons

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.970
of the movement, what we
did and what we tried to do

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:12.360
and how we succeeded, and to
be hopeful, to be optimistic,

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:16.220
and to never give up, but
hold onto your dreams.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:22.230
It [inaudible] down to
these books being a roadmap,

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:32.500
During the '60's, I got
arrested a few times, 40 times,

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:36.420
and since I've been in
Congress another five times.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.340
My last arrest, this
young man had to--

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:45.800
I left my money some place,
so he had to lend me--

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.320
&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: I
spotted you a few dollars.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:54.060
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: A few dollars,
to get out of, to be released.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:59.270
The last arrest took place
a short distance from here,

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:02.940
over on the Capitol
grounds, where 200 people,

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.760
eight members of Congress, who
were trying to get the Speaker

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:10.870
of the House to bring forth
a comprehensive immigration

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:12.170
reform deal.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:16.290
We had brought the bill
to the floor of the House,

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:20.340
almost every single member on our
side of the aisle would have voted

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:24.800
for it, and we would have picked up
enough members from the other side,

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.590
and we would have passed it,

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:30.270
and President Barack Obama
would have signed it into law.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:39.370
It doesn't make sense for us
to have millions of people,

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:42.050
especially young people,
children, living in fear

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:48.840

to happen to them

When the Pope came and spoke to a

great debate in the days to come.

please so we can see you.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:57.620
&gt;&gt; I didn't do research on you
but was you born like around

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:04.090
when Martin Luther King was
born, or is he older than you?

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:05.520
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: When
were you born in relation

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.220
to when Dr. King was born.

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:10.050
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: Well,
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:18.890
was born in 1929, and
I was born in 1940.

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:22.510

like a big brother.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.110
I met him when I was 18 years old.

He changed my life.

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:41.070
Andrew would tell you that he
called me the boy from Troy.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:45.780
Probably in reading "March" some of
you read when I was a little boy,

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:49.370
growing up on that farm,
I wanted to be a minister,

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:51.750
and we used to raise chickens.

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:55.240
And with the help of my
brothers and sisters and cousins,

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.200
we would gather all of our chickens
together in the chicken yard,

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:04.760
like you are gathered right here
in this room, and my brothers

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:09.830 position:56%
and sisters and cousins would like
[inaudible] around the chicken yard,

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:13.140
and I would start speaking or
preaching, and when I looked back,

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:14.980
some of these chickens
would bow their heads.

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.160
Some of the chickens
would shake their heads.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.000
They never quite said Amen.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.600
[laughter] But I'm convinced that
some of those chickens tended

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:27.110
to listen to me much better than
some of my colleagues listen

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:28.410
to me today in the Congress.

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:31.750
And some of those chickens were
just a little more productive,

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.090
at least they produced eggs,

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:35.290
and Drew didn't want
me to tell that story.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:37.610

leave those lines out of the book.

one of the more fascinating parts

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.370
of the book, his relationship with
the chickens, when he was talking

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:48.080
to the chickens and the chickens,
he knew the chickens individually--

point he didn't like the fact

killed in order to be eaten.

went on a field trip to a bunch

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:37.120
of junior, or rangers' memorials
all around, all around the south,

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:41.610
and so one of the places that
we actually went to was Selma,

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:46.060 position:56%
and we walked across the bridge that
you walked across on, across on,

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:50.930
so could you tell us what
some of your experiences were

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.380
when you crossed that bridge?

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.670

you crossed the bridge.

Alabama, like so many other parts

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:07.700
of the south, people of color
could not register to vote

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:12.520
because of the color of their skin.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:19.530 position:56%
There were African American lawyers,
doctors, teachers, housewives,

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:25.510 position:56%
and farmers were told that they
could not read or write well enough.

count the number of bubbles in a bar

jelly beans in a jar.

One day more than 300 public school
teachers left school, lined up,

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:47.170
and went down to the court house
to receive a copy of the test.

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:49.000
The stood in line.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.840
The registrar closed the office,

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:57.830
and they were denied the
right to register to vote.

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:01.520
And a few days later as you
saw maybe in the movie Selma,

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:10.020
a group of people marched, it
was a protest, in the home town

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:14.850
of Mrs. Martin Luther King,
Jr., Loretta Scott King,

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:21.070 position:56%
and one protester was shot and later
died at the local hospital in Selma.

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.990
Because of what happened to
him, we made a decision to march

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:25.980
from Selma to Montgomery.

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:32.780
Six hundred of us in twos, orderly,
peaceful, no one saying a word.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:38.260
The night before the march, the
local sheriff, he was a mean man,

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:45.630
really just mean, who wore a button
on his left lapel that said never.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:49.290
He carried an electric cow prodder,
and he didn't use it on cows.

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:50.590
He used it on people.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:53.110
He would push people.

He would beat people for exercising
their constitutional right.

So on that bridge that Sunday,
we got to the highest point

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:08.180
on the Edmund Pettus bridge,
down below we saw a sea of blue,

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.950
Alabama state troopers,
and we continued to walk.

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:14.490
We came within hearing distance.

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:17.470

to disperse and return

beside me, one of the leaders

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:38.940
from Dr. King's organization by the
name of Jose Williams, said, Major,

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.620
give us a moment to kneel and pray.

troopers advance.

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.680
He said, there will be no word.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:55.910
They came, beating us with night
sticks, trampling with horses,

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:58.010
releasing their tear gas.

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:01.540
I was hit in the head by a state
trooper with a night stick.

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.010
My legs went from under me.

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:04.310
I thought I saw death.

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:06.410
I thought I was going
to die on that bridge.

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:09.510
I thought it was the
last nonviolent protest.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:13.910
And all these many years later,
I don't recall how I made it back

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:18.840
across that bridge to the little
church that we had left from,

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:22.980
but I remember being in the
church and someone asked me

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.220
to say something, and I
stood up and said something

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:29.230
like I don't understand it how
President Johnson can send troops

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:34.670 position:56%
to Vietnam but cannot send troops
to Selma, Alabama, to protect people

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:37.250 position:56%
who only desire to register to vote.

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:44.770
The next thing I knew, with 16
other people, we was transferred

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:49.520
to a little hospital where a
group of nuns took care of us.

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:54.630
And last, just before the
election, late last October,

00:45:54.630 --> 00:46:01.080
I went to Rochester, New York, to
campaign for one of my colleagues

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.040
in New York, they took me
to the mother house there,

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:12.660
some of the nuns are retired, and
I saw this stained-glass window

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:16.820
that had been in this hospital,
it's now in Rochester, New York,

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:20.920
and some of the nuns that
took care me, they was there.

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:27.130 position:56%
They remembered me, and they started
saying John, John, good to see you.

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:32.590
And we all cried together.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:35.670
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: Andrew Aydin, one
of the things that struck me most

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:38.340
in reading this trilogy
was how John Lewis

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:44.920
and the other protesters trained
themselves to respond nonviolently

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:48.130
to the most violent
attacks by both civilians

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:50.780
and law enforcement officers.

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:53.280
You are even younger than I am.

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.980
How did that strike you?

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:00.580
&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: It felt like the
most important factor we could

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:01.880
possibly convey.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:05.650 position:56%
I think many of us understand the
broad strokes of civil disobedience.

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:09.810
Maybe we have read Thoreau or
Emerson or something like that,

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:13.250
but really understanding the
nitty gritty, the details,

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:16.640
the perseverance, and
the self-control it takes

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:21.240
to be a successful protestor

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:25.750
or a successful activist
using civil disobedience.

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:28.190
And over and over and over
again as you read these texts,

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:31.870
as you read the accounts,
the defining characteristic

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:34.700
of the most successful
protest is how orderly

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.920
and how disciplined they were.

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.130
And so for us, showing
that discipline is part

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:45.040
of the visual narrative of what
allows it to be more successful

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:50.450
in the visual medium is showing
that discipline, not just telling,

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:52.820 position:56%
showing how much they had to endure,

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.860
whether it's the cigarettes
being put out in your hair,

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:58.020
the hot coffee being
poured down your back,

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.490
having you friends call you names.

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:06.710
It was the most important
thing we could convey.

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:09.300
&gt;&gt; Kojo Nnamdi: Any other
questions from students here?

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:12.310
Right here.

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:13.980
Ma'am?

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:17.290
&gt;&gt; This question is for both
of you all, you all say a lot

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:22.290
about positivity, so do you guys
see similarities in today's actions

00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:27.240
as far as protesting
you did in your day?

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.850
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: Well,
today, I see similarities.

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:40.260 position:56%
The women marched just a few days, a
few weeks ago, whether in Washington

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:45.170
or in Atlanta, around the
nation, around the world,

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:51.340
people use the same
techniques and tactics.

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:56.940
Some of the music was a
little more upbeat, and music,

00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:03.810
Andrew would tell you, research,
music is very, very powerful.

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:07.270
I said on occasion, if
it hadn't been for music,

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:11.820 position:56%
the civil rights movement would
have been like a bird without wings.

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:13.120
It brought us together.

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:17.030
It created a sense of
family, a sense of solidarity

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:21.710
that we we're all in this thing
together, and sometimes when,

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:27.190 position:56%
so during the freedom rides in 1961,
when we were arrested in Jackson,

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:31.420
Mississippi, we filled the city
jail, and later people kept coming.

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:33.220
We filled the county jail.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.230
Then they took us to the heart

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:38.700
of the delta [inaudible]
state penitentiary,

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:42.610
and the people would say, the
guards, the jailers would say,

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:45.200
if you don't stop singing
those songs,

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.380
we're going to take your mattress.

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:48.730
And people would make up songs.

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:53.290
Andrew probably, and maybe
would sing one of them.

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:56.190
&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: So
low you can't hear me.

00:49:56.190 --> 00:50:00.490
&gt;&gt; Rep. John Lewis: But today
you see people coming together

00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:05.700
in an orderly, peaceful,
nonviolent fashion.

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.050
I was so proud.

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:09.430
I marched with the
people in Atlanta.

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:12.530
More than 63,000 people showed up.

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:16.510
And hundreds and thousands from
Atlanta came to Washington.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:20.550
And people showed up at
the airport in an orderly,

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:23.710
peaceful, nonviolent fashion.

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:26.410
They learned they're
starting the movement.

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:28.630
It was very similar.

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:30.510
Andrew, I know you
have something to add.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:39.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: Well, I'm not going
to sing, but I think when you talk

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:46.010
about creating the climate,
creating the environment for change

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:55.170
to happen, music, pop culture, I
think in this day and age we have

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:56.470
to look beyond [inaudible].

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:58.090
They play a role.

00:50:58.090 --> 00:51:04.390
But at the end of the day people

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:08.420
with conscience coming
together for a purpose.

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:13.870
I marched-- I'm going to blow out
you all speakers at this rate.

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:21.930
I marched here in DC, and I've
never seen anything quite like it.

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:27.830
I was at Barack Obama's
inauguration in 2009.

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:29.750
I staffed the Congressman that day.

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:32.370
I walked through the crowds.

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:35.440
It was peaceful, and
it was optimistic,

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:39.720 position:56%
but the sense of revolution wasn't--

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:45.830
in 2009, we thought
we were finished.

00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:48.150 position:56%
Right. And that's why 2010 happened.

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:52.210 position:56%
And that's what started this tumble,
but what happened at the march,

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:57.080
the women's march, what's happened
in the days and weeks since then,

00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:03.230
it's not just about optimism,
it's about a sense of duty,

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:07.690
that we all recognize
maybe we didn't do as much

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:11.460
as we should have beforehand,
but we all say

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:14.760
with a collective voice,
it stops now.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.810 position:56%
We all have something to contribute,
and we all will contribute.

00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:24.390
I think that very much
permeated that same feeling.

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:27.590
Maybe in the latter days,
from what I understand,

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:32.630 position:56%
it got lost in the freedom highs
and things like that, but that sense

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:39.030
that we all have something to
contribute, and that we will rage

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:47.130
against injustice, together, is
the most powerful development

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:51.130
in my own life that I've ever
witnessed of our society.

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:59.530
And I hope you're prepared
because we need you next.

00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:03.820
And it's not going to be easy.

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:10.010
I spent most of the time
making "March" being afraid,

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:16.030
and the Congressman telling me,
no, no, the best is yet to come.

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:17.700 position:56%
I didn't know if we would finish it.

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:19.300
I didn't know if it
would be any good.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:22.310
I didn't know if I would do a
good enough job honoring the

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:24.480
Congressman's story.

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.320
We're telling the story of all
the people whose stories needed

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.620
to be told.

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:33.590
And that was just one small piece,
so it's okay for you to be afraid,

00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:39.460
but you got to be hopeful, and you
got to understand that the progress

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.560
of this country is on
your shoulders next.

the most important thing

that came out of the march?

Out of the march?

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.660
&gt;&gt; Yes.

of the march, because of the march,

many people to stand out,

was signed into law.

and President Obama would
have been elected President.

00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:03.110

be in Congress,

be in the Congress,

destroyed the Voting Rights Act two
