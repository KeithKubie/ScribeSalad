when patients will have they'll just

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070

weak so there are a lot of symptoms that
happen with narcolepsy we're not fully

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239
happen with narcolepsy we're not fully
 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.270
happen with narcolepsy we're not fully
we're starting to learn what's causing

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280
we're starting to learn what's causing
 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.680
we're starting to learn what's causing
it there's something in our bodies in

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690
it there's something in our bodies in
 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.449
it there's something in our bodies in
our brain called hypocretin and they're

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:55.459
our brain called hypocretin and they're
 

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:57.129
our brain called hypocretin and they're
saying that people who have cataplexy so

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:57.139
saying that people who have cataplexy so
 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:59.919
saying that people who have cataplexy so
that muscle weakness those patients tend

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929
that muscle weakness those patients tend
 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.770
that muscle weakness those patients tend
to have a lack of hypocretin it

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780
to have a lack of hypocretin it
 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.200
to have a lack of hypocretin it
decreases even more as they age so we

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210
decreases even more as they age so we
 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.520
decreases even more as they age so we
don't really know why it's happening but

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530
don't really know why it's happening but
 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.080
don't really know why it's happening but
that's one theory as to what might be

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090
that's one theory as to what might be
 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.300
that's one theory as to what might be
going on other things that happen in

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310

five-minute nap is completely refreshing
 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.080
five-minute nap is completely refreshing
for these patients but the minute they

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090

day and it's managed mostly with
 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.310
day and it's managed mostly with
medication so we use medications to help

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320
