00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.969
So, it's been a tough couple
of weeks

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:04.303
for right-wing
conspiracy theorist

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:07.573
and overly-microwaved
baked potato Alex Jones.

00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:09.542
-He...
-(laughter)

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:12.111
Aah! Looks pretty done.

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:14.113
Put it in there
for another three minutes!

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:16.149
(laughter)

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.518
The pioneer of "Pizzagate,"
who spent decades

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.053
spreading outlandish stories,

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.921
like Lady Gaga being a demon,

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:23.856
and tap water turning kids gay,

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:26.259
is embroiled
in a very public custody battle.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.294
Hey, guys, he just wants his...

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:30.263
♪ Baby back, baby back,
baby back ♪

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.432
♪ He wants his baby back,
baby back, baby back. ♪

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:36.202
Jones' ex-wife claims he is,
"not a stable person."

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:40.706
What the (bleep)?!

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.742
This guy not stable?

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:44.477
You're in the cult, bro!

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.045
You're the threat to America!

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:50.616
 You are who we're at war with,
you traitorous little rat.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.752
Sustained! Take those kids.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:54.454
(laughter)

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:55.988
They'll be fine.

00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:58.991
Jones' legal team is trying
to justify his unhinged rants

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:00.927
by claiming he is just
a performance artist

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.261
playing a character.

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:04.297
And his lawyer actually said,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.601
"Like Jack Nicholson
as the Joker in Batman."

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:11.838
-(laughter)
-Same (bleep) thing.

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.940
-(laughter)
-But that's not the Infowars

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.509
kingpin's only
specious legal argument.

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:18.578
In a deposition, Alex Jones
admitted he smokes marijuana,

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.913
but, quote, right here,

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:24.617
"to monitor its strength, which
is how law enforcement does it."

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.621
(laughter)

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:31.124
Which is why
Snoop Dogg was deputized.

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.693
-(laughter) -He's just testing
it all out for the rest of you.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:35.828
What a public service.
Comedians, what's another

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.531
bull(bleep) legal defense
you might hear from Alex Jones?

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:41.100
-Timothy Simons.
-Uh, Your Honor,

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.869
I only put those cameras
in the bathroom

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:44.637
to find out who was flushing
the baby wipes.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.772
They are really messing
with our pipes.

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.040
-(laughter) -HARDWICK:
All right, points. Yeah.

00:01:48.073 --> 00:01:49.742
(applause)

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:51.477
-Mary.
-Your Honor,

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.212
you saw
how fuzzy those bunnies are.

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:55.348
How can I be blamed
for petting them so hard

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.383
-their spines snapped?
-HARDWICK: Yeah, points.

00:01:57.416 --> 00:01:59.452
-It's not your fault. Matt.
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:02.321
Your Honor, I was only manning
that truck stop glory hole

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:04.457
to count how many perverts
are in El Paso.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.290
-HARDWICK: Yeah.
-(laughter)
