00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:06.067
Bailey: Okay, so next up
is Declan De Paor.

00:00:06.067 --> 00:00:08.501
Declan grew up in Ireland

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:11.567
but at some point
his career moved

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:13.634
to the east coast of the U.S.
and has taught

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:15.133
in a number of schools
throughout Massachusetts

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.300
and the East Coast.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.400
He's currently
a research professor

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.467
at, um, Old Dominion University.

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:26.734
He's interested in the area
of geophysics.

00:00:26.734 --> 00:00:28.634
In particular, he wants
to be able

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:30.801
to visualize stuff
on the ground,

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:34.300
which means Google Earth
isn't an overly useful tool

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.167
for him in some ways.

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:38.434
However rather than complaining
about this fact,

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:40.868
he's actually gone out
and done something about it.

00:00:40.868 --> 00:00:44.367
So using Google Earth
in combination with SketchUp,

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:47.267
he's found weird
and wonderful ways

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:49.834
to bring those visualizations
above the ground

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:52.100
and into the user's
viewpoint.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.434
And he's gonna be talking
on this

00:00:54.434 --> 00:00:57.367
and some related themes,
um, today.

00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:02.033
De Paor: Thanks very much,
John.

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:04.567
I'd like to start
by acknowledging support

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:07.901
from the NSF, CCLI,
and DAR programs,

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:13.033
who are helping me to develop
these teaching tools.

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:17.534
Last year at this conference,

00:01:17.534 --> 00:01:20.834
I showed people what I thought
of at the time

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:23.868
was a hack of a way
of looking at the subsurface

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:26.300
because geologists
and geophysicists like me

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.868
want to see what's under
the Google Earth.

00:01:29.868 --> 00:01:32.601
And so I developed a technique

00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:34.901
of basically lifting up
lots of the Earth's crust

00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:36.167
to look at what's underneath.

00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:39.100
And then the more I used this
with students,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.734
the more I realized
that it's actually

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.000
a very useful pedagogical tool.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.767
Even if we could fly
under the Google Earth surface,

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:47.300
it would still be good
for students

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.000
to lift blocks up because
that enables them

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.567
to see the data as coming
from below.

00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:58.400
They've lifted the data up
out of the ground themselves.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.334
That tactile element
is pedagogically beneficial.

00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:05.934
So the title of my talk
this year

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:07.901
"How would you move
Mount Fuji?",

00:02:07.901 --> 00:02:11.067
according to the author
of this book

00:02:11.067 --> 00:02:13.467
by William Poundstone anyway,

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.667
is typical of the kind
of question

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:19.200
that you might've been asked
at an interview

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.467
in Microsoft maybe
a decade ago.

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:24.968
Bill Gates apparently liked
asking people

00:02:24.968 --> 00:02:28.701
impossible--what he called
"the impossible question."

00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:32.634
Maybe that's so as
to choose people

00:02:32.634 --> 00:02:35.534
to develop software
that's impossible to use.

00:02:35.534 --> 00:02:37.567
That's my own personal bias.

00:02:37.567 --> 00:02:42.167
But anyway, I thought about
this question

00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:43.934
and thought a more important
question

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:46.200
really is if you could move
Mount Fuji,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.901
why on Earth
would you want to?

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:51.300
And isn't Mount Fuji quite happy
sitting there

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.367
where it evolved in Japan?

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:58.300
But as a geologist,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.667
the answer is immediately
evident.

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:04.400
And one initial answer
to that question would be

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.100
to look inside the mountain,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.901
see what the interior
of the mountain looks like.

00:03:09.901 --> 00:03:14.200
So if we want to look inside
Mount Fuji,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.067
one idea would be to lift it up
and to look underneath.

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:22.701
And I've been developing
this technique

00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:25.667
to lift blocks out
of the ground using SketchUp.

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:30.300
So this is a USGS map
of the Washington State region.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.067
If we lift up a SketchUp block
out of the ground,

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:35.734
we see USGS data models

00:03:35.734 --> 00:03:38.501
anywhere on the side
of this block

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:41.734
showing how the Juan de Fuca
plate

00:03:41.734 --> 00:03:43.601
part of the Pacific Ocean crust,

00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:47.267
is dipping down underneath
the continental crust

00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:53.100
of Washington State
and letting off volatiles

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.367
that then cause the magma ascent
to create mountains

00:03:56.367 --> 00:03:59.734
like Mount Rainier
and Mount Hood and so on.

00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:05.234
And this block is just one
of a whole set

00:04:05.234 --> 00:04:06.701
that I've developed.

00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:10.901
And I've put my web address
in the bottom left here.

00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:12.968
You can go to that link

00:04:12.968 --> 00:04:14.968
and see dozens of similar blocks

00:04:14.968 --> 00:04:17.467
for different plate tectonic
scenarios

00:04:17.467 --> 00:04:20.100
around--around the globe.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.767
You'll notice the time slider
at the top.

00:04:22.767 --> 00:04:25.300
of the, uh, image here.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.868
I'm using that time slider
to adjust

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:33.133
the altitude tag
of the SketchUp model here.

00:04:33.133 --> 00:04:34.868
So when you move
the time slider,

00:04:34.868 --> 00:04:38.901
you're basically changing
the altitude tag in KML.

00:04:38.901 --> 00:04:44.234
And that's what causes the block
to move up and down.

00:04:44.234 --> 00:04:47.000
So let's look at making
a block like this in SketchUp.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.267
We start getting rid
of the guy there

00:04:49.267 --> 00:04:51.701
and pull out a rectangle.

00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:54.701
Extrude that
into a rectangular block.

00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:56.901
And you notice that
I extrude downwards

00:04:56.901 --> 00:04:59.634
in the negative Z direction
because I want my block

00:04:59.634 --> 00:05:02.167
to start under the ground.

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:04.234
And then I select a couple
of images.

00:05:04.234 --> 00:05:06.067
Here I'm putting a map
on the surface,

00:05:06.067 --> 00:05:08.067
but you could actually grab
a bit

00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:09.734
of the Google Earth surface
itself

00:05:09.734 --> 00:05:11.200
and plant it on the top
of the block

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.267
if you wanted to look like part
of the Google Earth surface.

00:05:15.267 --> 00:05:18.167
Here I'm taking the USGS
cross section,

00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:20.033
dragging it across
as a texture

00:05:20.033 --> 00:05:22.634
across the side of the block
in SketchUp.

00:05:22.634 --> 00:05:26.234
And then we can manipulate
that texture.

00:05:26.234 --> 00:05:29.868
Expand it, scale it,
rotate it.

00:05:29.868 --> 00:05:32.400
Make it fit the block
to suit our own needs.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.400
I've more work to do
on this one here,

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.601
but you get the idea.

00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:42.200
So then we save that
as a KMZ file.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.067
And as I said,
then go into the KML

00:05:47.067 --> 00:05:50.467
and put a time stamp
in the place mark

00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:52.467
that controls the block.

00:05:52.467 --> 00:05:56.501
That's the basic idea
for a block.

00:05:56.501 --> 00:05:58.968
And as I've said,
I've made lots of these.

00:05:58.968 --> 00:06:03.033
But you notice they have
a flatter, smooth surface.

00:06:03.033 --> 00:06:07.467
Now that's okay for the scale
that we're looking at here.

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.734
Say if we were looking
at Mount Fuji from space

00:06:09.734 --> 00:06:10.834
from the space shuttle,

00:06:10.834 --> 00:06:13.467
and we're sufficiently far away

00:06:13.467 --> 00:06:16.501
that it's only really
the large scale plate tectonics

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:18.000
we're seeing here.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.667
Things like mountains
aren't represented here

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:25.334
by more than the thickness
of a line by a pixel

00:06:25.334 --> 00:06:27.400
or maybe two pixels.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.734
And so it doesn't really matter
that the top of the surface

00:06:30.734 --> 00:06:33.100
of the block is flat.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.701
The Earth is pretty flat
on this scale.

00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:39.767
But if we were to go closer up,

00:06:39.767 --> 00:06:42.534
and there's a view--
an oblique view of Mount Fuji

00:06:42.534 --> 00:06:44.801
from, let's say, helicopter
elevation--

00:06:44.801 --> 00:06:46.934
At this scale,

00:06:46.934 --> 00:06:50.234
a flat-topped block
would be senseless.

00:06:50.234 --> 00:06:52.000
It certainly would be useless
for a geologist

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.467
to convey the
three-dimensionality

00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:55.634
of the mountain.

00:06:55.634 --> 00:06:58.834
So how do we actually put
topography

00:06:58.834 --> 00:07:02.434
on the top of our block?

00:07:02.434 --> 00:07:07.367
So let's start by capturing
some terrain in SketchUp.

00:07:07.367 --> 00:07:09.701
The trick here is to get
real close.

00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:12.400
You have to be at an elevation
of five kilometers or less.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.100
Which means you might have
to patch together

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.801
a few little bits.

00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:18.934
You can then import
that terrain into SketchUp.

00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:20.367
There it is.

00:07:20.367 --> 00:07:22.367
Bump it into a three-dimensional
terrain

00:07:22.367 --> 00:07:24.801
using the SketchUp tool.

00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:29.367
And now we select it and--
select all.

00:07:29.367 --> 00:07:35.534
And explode the hidden geometry
of the block

00:07:35.534 --> 00:07:39.601
so we get down to the polygons
that define this topography.

00:07:39.601 --> 00:07:43.934
Now we could actually manipulate
each polygon one by one.

00:07:43.934 --> 00:07:47.167
We could create erosion
by moving polygons down

00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:51.801
or lava flow by moving them up.

00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:55.534
Or we could change
the location of this block,

00:07:55.534 --> 00:08:02.100
either in altitude
or in latitude or longitude.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.033
So here I've taken
a slice out of Mount Fuji.

00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:10.200
Put a very simple
student-style cartoon

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.200
of the interior of the mountain.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.968
And you see the time slider
I've just set

00:08:16.968 --> 00:08:18.501
to loop forwards and backwards,

00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:20.200
so that actually lifts
the altitude

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.334
of the block up and down.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:23.667
And meanwhile a student
can rotate it around

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:25.367
and look at it
from all sorts of directions.

00:08:25.367 --> 00:08:27.467
Can even fly inside the mountain

00:08:27.467 --> 00:08:31.734
if they want to have
a look inside.

00:08:31.734 --> 00:08:33.968
And part of the project
I'm working on

00:08:33.968 --> 00:08:35.701
with colleague Steve Whitmeyer
at JMU

00:08:35.701 --> 00:08:40.000
is to find out whether this kind
of cartoon cross section

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.400
is actually beneficial
to learning versus

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.100
real data like geoseismic
sections.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.601
Cartoons are simpler
for students,

00:08:48.601 --> 00:08:51.000
but they're clearly not real.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.133
And maybe the real data
might be more meaningful

00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:54.534
to students.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.000
Well that's the moving
of the mountain

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.400
in the vertical direction.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.067
What about the lateral
direction?

00:09:00.067 --> 00:09:01.567
Why would we want to do that?

00:09:01.567 --> 00:09:03.367
Why would we want to move
Mount Fuji

00:09:03.367 --> 00:09:05.734
to a different location?

00:09:05.734 --> 00:09:10.033
Well, the reason we would
goes back to something that

00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:14.868
Charles Lyell, one of
the forefathers of geology,

00:09:14.868 --> 00:09:16.968
said in the 19th century.

00:09:16.968 --> 00:09:19.300
He said the present
is the key to the past.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.634
If we want to understand
the past geology of our planet,

00:09:23.634 --> 00:09:25.767
we need to look
at what's happening

00:09:25.767 --> 00:09:27.267
on the Earth's surface
at present

00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:28.767
and use that as an analog.

00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:32.367
So here in this movie
I'm about to run--

00:09:32.367 --> 00:09:35.367
this is I've just taken
just little chunks

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:37.901
of the continents, put them back
to where they were

00:09:37.901 --> 00:09:39.701
1/2 billion years ago.

00:09:39.701 --> 00:09:43.801
You see Africa and South America
stuck together,

00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:45.767
Gondwana, in the bottom left.

00:09:45.767 --> 00:09:50.167
And North America in the top
center of the image.

00:09:50.167 --> 00:09:51.801
They're about to hit
into each other

00:09:51.801 --> 00:09:54.701
to make a supercontinent
we call Rodinia.

00:09:54.701 --> 00:09:57.200
And then they'll split apart
again

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.801
and come together
in a different orientation

00:09:59.801 --> 00:10:02.467
to make Pangaea which
is the supercontinent

00:10:02.467 --> 00:10:04.167
most people know about.

00:10:04.167 --> 00:10:06.367
So we're going way back
before Pangaea here.

00:10:06.367 --> 00:10:08.067
So let's--let's roll it.

00:10:08.067 --> 00:10:10.801
And I've marked
western Massachusetts

00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:13.601
in the North American block.

00:10:13.601 --> 00:10:16.267
So here they smash
into each other,

00:10:16.267 --> 00:10:19.701
drift apart, create
the proto-Atlantic Ocean.

00:10:19.701 --> 00:10:24.133
And now you see a Japan-style
arc drifting across

00:10:24.133 --> 00:10:27.634
that ocean and smashing
into North America.

00:10:27.634 --> 00:10:28.968
That's eastern Massachusetts,

00:10:28.968 --> 00:10:32.868
which came along and hit into
western Massachusetts,

00:10:32.868 --> 00:10:35.334
to create the, uh,
the state I used to live in

00:10:35.334 --> 00:10:37.434
up til last year.

00:10:37.434 --> 00:10:42.734
And--and so here's
an ideal opportunity for us.

00:10:42.734 --> 00:10:46.100
We have just down the road
from where I lived

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.934
in Massachusetts,
we have these, uh,

00:10:49.934 --> 00:10:51.701
frost-shattered lavas.

00:10:51.701 --> 00:10:54.534
They're called hyaloclastite,
but you don't need to know that.

00:10:54.534 --> 00:10:56.767
There are also pillow lavas.

00:10:56.767 --> 00:11:00.701
This are indicative
that lava flowed--

00:11:00.701 --> 00:11:03.567
bubbled into the ocean
and the frost-shattered lava

00:11:03.567 --> 00:11:06.934
shows that there was ice
around.

00:11:06.934 --> 00:11:10.067
That lava erupted under
an ice cap.

00:11:10.067 --> 00:11:14.133
So we have Paleozoic volcanics
in an arc

00:11:14.133 --> 00:11:17.734
in eastern Massachusetts
today.

00:11:17.734 --> 00:11:21.334
And the rocks indicate that
they were very like Mount Fuji

00:11:21.334 --> 00:11:23.767
when they were formed.

00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:28.167
So we can now take Mount Fuji
and represent these rocks

00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:32.234
using it as a model.

00:11:32.234 --> 00:11:36.467
Now lots of people have put
paleo-geographic maps

00:11:36.467 --> 00:11:39.334
and draped them
onto the Google Earth surface.

00:11:39.334 --> 00:11:42.467
Particularly Ron Blakey's maps
have been used,

00:11:42.467 --> 00:11:50.167
and Valerie Runisov
has animated them.

00:11:50.167 --> 00:11:52.167
And that's fine
in two dimensions,

00:11:52.167 --> 00:11:55.901
but if you actually make
this map semi-transparent,

00:11:55.901 --> 00:11:58.801
you look at the terrain
underneath,

00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:00.334
it's the new terrain,

00:12:00.334 --> 00:12:03.667
the current elevations
that are under that map,

00:12:03.667 --> 00:12:06.968
Where it says island arc there,

00:12:06.968 --> 00:12:09.667
if you pop this
into three dimensions,

00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:13.200
you won't get the mountains
and the sea in the same place.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.434
So in addition
to our paleo-geography,

00:12:16.434 --> 00:12:19.634
we need a paleo-terrain.

00:12:19.634 --> 00:12:21.367
And so that's what
I'm trying to do.

00:12:21.367 --> 00:12:25.100
I'm trying to take some,
like, Mount Fuji

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:30.100
and replicate it in order
to create a paleo-terrain.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.667
I'm particularly interested

00:12:32.667 --> 00:12:34.300
with my colleague
Steve Whitmeyer

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:40.167
in the upper right end
of this Japan-like arc

00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:43.501
because it outcrops
in my home country of Ireland

00:12:43.501 --> 00:12:45.300
in western Ireland.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.968
And there we see Paleozoic
volcanics

00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:50.167
in the image
on the top right here

00:12:50.167 --> 00:12:52.834
in a place called
Knock Kilbride.

00:12:52.834 --> 00:12:56.033
And those rocked formed

00:12:56.033 --> 00:12:58.868
in an island arc environment.

00:12:58.868 --> 00:13:03.501
So let's take Mount Fuji
and put it there.

00:13:03.501 --> 00:13:07.067
And because volcanoes grow
in a similar fashion,

00:13:07.067 --> 00:13:11.267
it's a simple matter
to simulate volcanic growth

00:13:11.267 --> 00:13:14.467
by simply moving the volcano
up out of the ground

00:13:14.467 --> 00:13:16.667
by changing its elevation.

00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:19.100
So here I'm taking a volcano.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.300
Actually this one isn't Fuji.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.033
This is Sitkin Island
from the Aleutians,

00:13:22.033 --> 00:13:23.501
but it'll do.

00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:29.167
And it's simulating
what those Paleozoic rocks

00:13:29.167 --> 00:13:30.667
in western Ireland look like

00:13:30.667 --> 00:13:34.634
at the time that they were
formed.

00:13:34.634 --> 00:13:37.434
Now in addition
to taking something

00:13:37.434 --> 00:13:39.133
like Mount Fuji,

00:13:39.133 --> 00:13:44.334
sometimes we don't want
that very recognizable Fuji,

00:13:44.334 --> 00:13:47.501
um, snow cap there.

00:13:47.501 --> 00:13:49.400
For example, we might want
the area

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.133
to look more vegetated
or less.

00:13:51.133 --> 00:13:56.601
And so we can use the match
photo tool in SketchUp

00:13:56.601 --> 00:13:59.234
to drape any kind
of image we wish

00:13:59.234 --> 00:14:03.067
over the Fuji terrain model.

00:14:03.067 --> 00:14:07.667
And so here I've taken
an image of Hawaii

00:14:07.667 --> 00:14:11.567
and draped it over the terrain

00:14:11.567 --> 00:14:14.968
to create a Fuji DM
that would be suitable,

00:14:14.968 --> 00:14:18.767
for example, to represent
an island in the Cretaceous

00:14:18.767 --> 00:14:23.501
when it would be unlikely
to have a snow cap on it.

00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:26.334
If we were looking
at a lower Paleozoic volcano,

00:14:26.334 --> 00:14:28.667
we wouldn't want
all of that vegetation

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:32.634
because it was pre--
pre-forest and grasses.

00:14:32.634 --> 00:14:35.534
And so we might take
a volcano

00:14:35.534 --> 00:14:39.300
from the Alto Plano of Chile,
for example, and drape it.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.534
We could also take our own
geological maps.

00:14:41.534 --> 00:14:43.067
I've put on the right here,

00:14:43.067 --> 00:14:45.901
a geological map that
I've just sketched myself

00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:48.033
and draped it over
the terrain.

00:14:48.033 --> 00:14:53.334
Watch the volcanic structure
grow.

00:14:53.334 --> 00:14:55.868
And with the Google Earth
plug-in,

00:14:55.868 --> 00:14:59.367
we can now control
these models with JavaScript,

00:14:59.367 --> 00:15:02.400
so I'm rotating Mount Fuji
around

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.467
three independent axes here.

00:15:04.467 --> 00:15:06.300
You might say, "Why on Earth
would you want to do that?"

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.234
But again, geologists realize

00:15:08.234 --> 00:15:10.934
that parts of the Earth's crust
get stretched

00:15:10.934 --> 00:15:14.734
and squashed and smashed
and broken up.

00:15:14.734 --> 00:15:16.968
And so we want to do
all sorts of things

00:15:16.968 --> 00:15:20.434
to--to bits of the Earth's
crust.

00:15:20.434 --> 00:15:23.767
And so I'm very excited
about the possibilities

00:15:23.767 --> 00:15:26.968
of working with
JavaScript-controlled models

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:31.968
on Google Earth
and using the plug-in.

00:15:31.968 --> 00:15:34.834
Okay, here I'm taking a map

00:15:34.834 --> 00:15:37.434
of the northwest part of Ireland
here

00:15:37.434 --> 00:15:39.701
and restoring fault
displacements

00:15:39.701 --> 00:15:44.634
so that the slices of crust
that Ireland's made up of

00:15:44.634 --> 00:15:47.767
go back to where they were
in the Paleozoic.

00:15:47.767 --> 00:15:52.067
And you know, 1/4 to 1/2 billion
years ago.

00:15:52.067 --> 00:15:55.367
And now we can do
one extra thing here

00:15:55.367 --> 00:15:59.601
and that is we can link
those paleo-places

00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:03.667
that has existed
on the Earth's surface

00:16:03.667 --> 00:16:06.834
say 400 million years ago
using what I call

00:16:06.834 --> 00:16:08.467
a back to the future
place mark.

00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:10.801
We can take those places
and link them

00:16:10.801 --> 00:16:13.801
to the present-day evidence
for that tectonic model.

00:16:13.801 --> 00:16:17.000
So in the pop-up image here,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.601
you see the pillow lavas,
these volcanic rocks

00:16:21.601 --> 00:16:23.000
that flowed underwater,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.467
and that we use as evidence
to suggest

00:16:26.467 --> 00:16:33.067
that this place used to be
an arc.

00:16:33.067 --> 00:16:38.734
So if you like the present DEM
is key to the past DEM.

00:16:38.734 --> 00:16:42.200
And we can use samples
of the present terrain,

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.033
move them around to effectively
represent past landscapes.

00:16:47.033 --> 00:16:50.100
The ultimate goal beyond
today's Google Earth

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.000
is to represent the landscape

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.100
at every place on Earth
and every moment in the past.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.033
So for example, we can see
Iceland on today's Google Earth.

00:17:01.033 --> 00:17:03.334
We'd like to see it
3 million years ago,

00:17:03.334 --> 00:17:07.200
7 million years ago,
15 million years ago.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.701
And be able to go there,
fly around,

00:17:09.701 --> 00:17:12.801
helicopter around it
just as we can with today's--

00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:15.100
with today's landscape.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.167
Okay, so if you answered
the question,

00:17:17.167 --> 00:17:19.734
"How would you move Mount Fuji?"
by saying

00:17:19.734 --> 00:17:22.701
"With Google Earth
and a Macintosh sort of PC

00:17:22.701 --> 00:17:24.767
and certainly with SketchUp,"

00:17:24.767 --> 00:17:27.667
you might not get yourself
a job in Microsoft.

00:17:27.667 --> 00:17:29.467
But on the other hand,

00:17:29.467 --> 00:17:33.968
you might get yourself a job
as a research scientist

00:17:33.968 --> 00:17:35.567
in Old Dominion working with me

00:17:35.567 --> 00:17:38.667
and trying to change
Google Earth.

00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:40.834
Thanks very much.

00:17:40.834 --> 00:17:44.100
[applause]
