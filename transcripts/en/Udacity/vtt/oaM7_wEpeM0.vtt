00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.680
Given this compound inequality,
find the solution set for x.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.780
I've already written x here,
and two less than symbols.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.820
What you need to do is fill in
numbers in both of these boxes

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.940
to show what number is less than x and

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.150
what number is greater than x that
fulfills this compound inequality.
