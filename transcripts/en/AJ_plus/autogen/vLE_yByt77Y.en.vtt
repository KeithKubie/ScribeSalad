00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
“Should someone have to have a government-issued license to drive a car?”

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.560
“HELL NO.”

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.360
“What’s next, requiring a license to make toast in your own damn toaster?

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.240
“A license to drive, you know,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.720
I’d like to see some competency exhibited by people before they drive.”

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.000
[boos]

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.240
While they’re often looked at as just a fringe group of political wackjobs

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.200
who think that the road to Stalinism is paved with drivers’ licenses,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.700
the truth is their ideology is much more influential and dangerous than you probably realize.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.920
Because libertarianism isn’t so much a political philosophy as it is a religious ideology

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.120
where the lord and savior is pure, unadulterated capitalism.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.820
Invisible hand of the free market, take the wheel!

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.900
[tires squealing and car crash]

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.940
American libertarianism is the idea that government is evil and needs to be dismantled.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.360
Libertarians don’t see society as a collective, they instead champion radical individualism.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.280
They see the free market as a force for absolute good,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.720
and government as solely a corrupting force.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.680
One of the primary ways they express these beliefs is by

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.580
shrieking about taxes constantly.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.520
“Taxation is theft.”

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.900
“Taxation, quite frankly, is theft. Or armed robbery or extortion.”

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.560
Yup. Taxes are just like robbery,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.540
except instead of taking your television away,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.980
they take your trash away.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.820
Which ... is nice. It's nice.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.400
Sure, paying taxes doesn’t feel good,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.640
but once you factor in all the bridges and schools and firefighters and roads and whatnot,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.660
it does seem like kind of a fair trade.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.740
But don’t you dare mention roads to libertarians:

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.660
“Ah, the old ‘who will build the roads.’

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.560
Roads, roads, roads.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.280
Where we’re going, we don’t need roads.”

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.860
[cheers]

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.480
Hehehe!

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.480
No seriously. We need roads.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.520
Libertarians have an almost cult-like adherence to the idea

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.940
that government is bad and the “free market” is God ...

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.100
I mean good ...

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.960
I mean God.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.020
“The free market can solve the problems of the environment.”

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.100
“When it comes to healthcare, what we we need is a real free-market approach to healthcare.”

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.000
"The Thanksgiving feast came because they had private property rights

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.920
and they had free markets and

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.300
that's how we will take care of the poor."

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.640
And lo, the burning bush said unto Moses,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.600
“Don’t worry about paying taxes, my dude,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.840
for the invisible hand of the free market will take care of everything!”

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.420
And yea, the bush soon became a forest fire

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.860
and burned down Moses’s village because there were no taxes

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.740
and thus no firefighters.”

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.660
So what would a completely free-market approach to healthcare look like

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.320
according to Gary Johnson, who was ultimately selected as the Libertarian nominee for president?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.240
“We would have health insurance to cover ourselves for catastrophic injury and illness,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.280
and we would pay as you go in a system that was very, very affordable.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.560
We would have Stitches R Us, we would have Gallbladders R Us

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.200
we would have, uh, X-Rays R Us.”

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.140
Gallbladders R Us?

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.680
“Hey are you tired of those leaky gallbladders that you have to swap out

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.880
every six months like a common windshield wiper?

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.760
At Gallbladders R Us, we guarantee a leak-free bladder for only $19.99.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.360
That's right, I said $19.99, I must be crazy!

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.420
People are like, wow, I didn't even know gallbladders could be that cheap!

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.300
But they can be because they're made out of plastic.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.180
We also got dogs!

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.500
OK, but what about poor people or old people who can’t afford organs from Gallbladders R Us?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.920
How would libertarians help them?

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.800
“How many people in here, and I actually do want a show of hands, love grandmas?

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.460
How many of you would donate money to feed grandmas?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.760
I do not see a single person that did not raise their hand.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.340
That’s how you fund Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare.”

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.740
And as for Grandpas ...

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.720
f*ck 'em.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.180
There’s a kind of charming, faith-based optimism when it comes to the way that libertarians view

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.280
private enterprise and human nature.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.840
Scary and delusional, but charming.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.960
Just listen to libertarian candidate John McAfee’s reasoning

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.120
when explaining why we don’t need government-funded social programs …

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.560
because we can [singing] rely on each other:

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.440
“None of us are going to pass a child drowning in a river,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.440
even if we’re dressed in a tuxedo, heading to our wedding.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.920
Libertarianism is not heartlessness, it’s the opening of the heart to your neighbor."

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.980
Aww.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.440
Speaking of neighbors,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.380
true story, John McAfee was wanted by police in Belize

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.400
in connection with the murder of his neighbor. So.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.000
Mm, he's sweet.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.720
The idea that we don’t need laws because people will do the right thing anyway,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.340
or that we don’t need taxes because people will fund important things anyway

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.360
or the idea that we don’t need regulations because companies will be ethical anyway –

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.720
none of that is borne out by any statistics, historical precedent or any other evidence of any kind.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.180
It’s the same kind of faith-based thinking as “Santa is real” or

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.480
“Ted Cruz is human”

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.480
and not just someone wearing a Batboy mask that got melted in a microwave.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.840
While libertarians might be anti-driver’s license, anti-Medicare and anti-public roads,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.640
the flip side of being so rigidly anti-government

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.860
is that they also end up being

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.660
anti-NSA, anti-interventionist and anti-drug laws,

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.680
which appeals to people on the other side of the political spectrum.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.676
In fact, the common elevator pitch for libertarianism is that,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.220
while fiscally conservative, they’re also “socially liberal.”

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.640
“I believe in a world where gay married couples can protect their marijuana fields

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.680
with fully automatic machine guns, baby!

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.600
[cheers]

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.780
Aw yeah.”

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.340
Yayyy!

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.800
Wait, why do we need machine guns if weed is legal?

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.880
Oh, the world's more dangerous?

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.880
The libertarian world is more dangerous. It's more dangerous.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.540
But the socially liberal side of libertarianism is less about a belief in civil rights being law

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.760
and more that civil rights are less important than property rights.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.860
Listen to libertarian darling Senator Rand Paul explain his thoughts on the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.260
“I like the Civil Rights Act in the sense that

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.100
it ended discrimination in all public domains

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.840
and I'm all in favor of that."

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.920
REPORTER: "But?"

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.560
RAND PAUL: [laughs]

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.560
"You had to ask me the but.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:26.460
I don't like the idea of telling private business owners – I abhor racism, I think it's a bad business decision

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.380
to ever exclude anybody from your restaurant, BUT

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.560
at the same time I do believe in private ownership.”

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.220
Wow.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.060
“I abhor racism BUT”

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.760
That should definitely be the new libertarian slogan.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:42.440
Libertarianism: “I abhor racism ... but.”

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.520
And this isn’t just Rand Paul. Libertarians often deflect on questions of civil rights.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.920
MODERATOR: “Mr. McAfee,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:55.440
would you have voted in favor of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, had you been in the Senate?"

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.000
“As many of you know, my wife is black,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.560
and having spent three-and-a-half years living 24 hours a day with her,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.560
I can assure you that legislation in no way ended discrimination.”

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.720
“Certainly not in my home.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.160
I have my own whites-only bathroom.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.160
She’s not allowed!!!!!!”

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:21.000
So it’s clear that libertarianism represents the furthest right-wing fringe of economic conservatism.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.680
They’re basically like the Stalinists of the right.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.760
They’re like that "tankie" Facebook friend you have that keeps sending you those Mao Tse Tung memes.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.160
The only difference is that, unlike your one lonely tankie friend,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.720
there are millions of libertarians.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.560
In fact, 1 out of 10 Americans identifies as a libertarian.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.960
Think about that.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.840
If 1 out of 10 Americans described themselves as believers of the Juche religion of North Korea,

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.800
the U.S. would declare a state of emergency.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.640
But no, these people are fine, because they don’t worship Kim Jong-un,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.200
they worship Kim Jong-Ayn … Rand.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.420
Kim Jong Ayn -  they worship Ayn Rand.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.360
The joke is good. It's a good pun.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.360
So how did such a fringe political ideology gain so much ground in America?

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.920
Well, not shockingly, it turns out that libertarianism is very popular with the very rich,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.440
specifically among the political donor class.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.480
There’s Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire and Trump supporter.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.040
There's Richard Mellon Scaife, the libertarian billionaire who, along with Thiel and the Koch brothers,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.440
helped to fund the anti-taxation party, the Tea Party.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.720
You remember them ... the guys who swept into power in 2010 and made John McCain look appealing.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.080
And of course there’s the Koch brothers,  both lifelong libertarians.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.760
Before they became the Statler and Waldorf of our political puppet show,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.080
David Koch was actually the Libertarian candidate for vice president in 1980.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.800
They’ve spent decades using their money to drastically lower personal and corporate taxes,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.840
cut social services for the needy and end government oversight of industry –

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.380
especially environmental regulation.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.840
Oh, and of course donating like crazy to Republicans.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.520
And all that could in part explain why Republican presidential candidates

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.520
now sound just as unhinged as libertarians.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.560
First, let's listen to libertarians running for president:

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.880
“We would abolish the federal Department of Education.”

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.720
"So you would have no EPA?

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.920
You would have no Environmental Protection Agency?"

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.440
"Definitely have no EPA, absolutely."

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.840
“Let’s abolish the IRS.”

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.720
All right. And now let's listen to some recent Republican candidates for president:

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.080
“I believe we should abolish the federal Department of Education.”

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.240
“I would abolish the Department of Education.”

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.160
“We’d get rid of the IRS.”

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.600
“I would abolish the Department of Energy, which has failed totally since the mid 1970s"

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.280
“I’m going to cut – big, big – Department of Education.”

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.520
"Yeah, me cut education big big!"

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.440
While Trump has yet to actually abolish any departments,

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.480
he *has* appointed Betsy DeVos, an anti-public-school billionaire,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.800
and Scott Pruitt, a climate-change denier

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.860
who constantly sued the EPA as attorney general, to head them,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.440
which is essentially putting a time bomb in both departments.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.120
And while Republicans aren’t asking us to donate to some sort of voluntary grandma fund,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.040
Republican plans for social programs include work requirements for Medicaid,

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.440
cutting Social Security and privatizing Medicare.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.720
Which is like meeting libertarians in the middle.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.760
Of the libertarian platform.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.280
Side note:

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.880
Why does their logo look like a sewer lid?

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.320
These libertarian free-market ideals are even catching on in liberal Silicon Valley.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.600
And that’s because many of the billionaires at the top of the food chain are self-described libertarians,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.640
like Thiel, or Elon Musk and former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.300
Libertarians have formed a symbiotic relationship with liberal tech companies because

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.640
they offer capitalist solutions to problems that are largely caused by capitalism.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.680
“The model of the future is Uber.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:44.880
It’s Uber everything, it's Uber accountant, it's Uber doctor, it's Uber electrician, it's Uber plumber."

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.240
Uh, does anyone else think that sounds suspiciously similar to the Galbladders R Us plan?

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.600
I'm pretty sure Gary Johnson just has one plan.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.520
The libertarian ideology has been pulling mainstream politics to the right for decades now.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:03.560
This belief that the free market is god is now so deeply embedded in our politics that liberals –

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.000
who define themselves as being against racism, sexism and classism –

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.440
now completely ignore the role of capitalism in creating racism, sexism and classism.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.520
When you ignore the effects of someone’s economic beliefs that lead to discriminatory practices

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.440
because that person says they’re socially liberal,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.880
you end up looking at people like Rand Paul and going,

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.800
"Eh, he's basically Malcom X.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.160
I mean he's fiscally conservative,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.720
but socially Malcom X."

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.920
And while libertarian ideology made the Democratic Party more corporatist,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.480
it’s made the Republican Party into Ayn Rand’s wet dream.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.600
Look, I’m not saying that the Republican Party has gone full libertarian, OK?

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.200
So before someone from Reason Magazine sees this and has an "Um Actually" stroke,

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.800
please just relax, take a breath,

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.000
rub your copy of “Atlas Shrugged”

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.040
and squeeze your Milton Friedman Dakimakura body pillow.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.800
America will never go full libertarian because going full libertarian

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.560
isn’t really what libertarian billionaires are shooting for.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.080
Libertarian candidates talk a big game about individual freedoms like

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.680
gay marriage and legalized drugs, but the libertarian donor class is happy

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.520
to throw the social part of their platform under the bus to get their economic goals fulfilled.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.640
Listen, I don’t hate libertarians. Some of my best parents are libertarians.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.920
And I actually kind of respect their idealism and the stringency of their beliefs,

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.280
you know,  the same way I respect the idealism and stringency of the Branch Davidians

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.480
or ISIS.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.640
But just like any fringe radical group,

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.800
we probably should not let them so close to the reins of power.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.480

And you know what go in the comment section and please just get into endless arguments

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.040
with the libertarians that will be trolling our page.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.480
It's going to be disastrous.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.200
But you know what, it's the free market, baby!

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.720
Woooo!
