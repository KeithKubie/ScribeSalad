00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.650
Guys and gals are flirting with each other
everywhere, but NONE OF Y'ALL can tell when

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.160
it's actually happening.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.680
What is WRONG with us?!

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.150
Howdy hotties, Trace here reporting for DNews.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.740
I'm a flirt, I've been told.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.690
I swear I don't even know I'm doing it!

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.910
And apparently, neither does anyone else according
to a new study from University of Kansas published

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.800
in Communication Research.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.980
The researchers asked pairs of over one hundred
heterosexual college students to gauge first

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.850
impressions during a 10 to 12 minute conversation.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.000
Afterward, each person filled out a questionnaire
and was instructed to indicate if they felt

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.030
they'd been flirted with, and if they'd done
any flirting themselves.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.280
*Rawr* Science is hot.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.899
In the end, only 36 percent of the males and
18 percent of the females correctly wrote

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.079
they'd been flirted with.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.079
That's everyone.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.469
This is really bad.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.010
And what's worse is, 80 percent of the time
both groups knew when they WEREN'T being flirted

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.379
with!

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.229
The researchers are showing that we suck at
flirting, or at least at knowing that it's

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.450
going on.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.130
But it's not just the people getting flirted
with - the University of Kansas researchers

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.729
showed a video of the conversations to over
250 other people for a second study.

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.369
You might think you'd spot people's attempts
at flirtation, but no.

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.450
Our wingmen and wingwomen are also crap at
flirt-dar.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.619
When women were watching men flirt, they identified
it as flirting 22 percent of the time, and

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.939
men and women were a BIT better at picking
up when the ladies were flirting...

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.130
Apparently, us dudes are just TOO subtle.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.640
Though that's not been the experience of pretty
much anyone ever.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.469
The researchers found that in fact the lady-flirters
were being more transparent about what they

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:52.469
were doing.

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.619
Why do we suck at this simple element of human
attraction?

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.469
Should we have evolved to know when another
person wants to practice breeding with us?

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.310
Well, the researchers believe it has to do
with the same mechanism as detecting a lie;

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.899
which we're also terrible at.

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.489
See, the problem is flirting is the subtle
art of body language.

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.390
Non-verbal communication is extremely important
for flirtation, which is perhaps why it's

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.950
so hard to pick up on a video.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.480
Light touches or squeezes on the arm are extremely
positive, as is eye contact, smiling, laughing,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.900
open body posture (as in the opposite of crossed
arms or legs) and mirroring the other person's

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.900
behavior.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.400
Like you both scratch your nose or tousle
your hair.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.100
The BBC writes 55 percent of flirting is done
in this way, while an additional 38 percent

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.430
has to do with the tone and speed of your
voice.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.760
Note, this is HOW you're saying it, not WHAT
you're saying -- they've found that's only

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.040
about seven percent.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.010
This supports the idea that flirting is driven
not by pick up lines, fancy cars or titles,

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.990
but by our non-verbal cues, our tones of voice
and many other subtle factors -- so it's not

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.240
surprising to me that people are bad at picking
it out.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.110
The lead research in the Kansas study said
not to assume everyone is flirting with you,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.590
but if you're at a location where flirting
is common, like a social gathering, or a bar,

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.730
and you miss the signs, then QUOTE, "that's
on you."

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.020
How do you know if someone is flirting with
you?

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.080
Do you think you can tell?

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.900
Share some flirting tips in the comments.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.940
Be sure you keep them respectful, and thanks
for watching DNews!

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.510
If you're into looking deeply into the eyes
of some Earth Science people from NASA/JPL

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.930
then tomorrow, June 24 -- you should come
to our hangout!

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.050
The links to RSVP are in the description.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.190
30 percent of NASA/JPL is Earth-focused science,
so there's a lot to talk about!

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.570
Come join us!
