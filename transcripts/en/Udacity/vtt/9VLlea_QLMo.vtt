00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.240
This is the marvelous molecule that makes up our genomes, DNA.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.520
&gt;&gt; I feel like you hear about DNA everywhere.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.420
&gt;&gt; It's true. The DNA name and structure, its visual

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.600
itself, is something that's come to permeate our culture. You've

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.050
probably heard references to it in pop culture, movies like

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.740
Jurassic Park and Gattico, or TV shows like CSI and Bones.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.655
&gt;&gt; I love those shows.

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:24.340
[UNKNOWN]

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.180
I mean I recognize the shape and I hear the name all the time, so

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah I mean the shape is it's most

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.970
defining characteristic. In fact, the structure's so well-known people all

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.220
over the world use it in works of art,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.930
design, architecture. But not only is the structure appealing, it's

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.950
very important in revealing the secrets of how DNA

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.070
does what it does in our genomes. So if we

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.780
have any hope of defining what our genome is.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.500
We need to go take a look at what DNA

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.460
is made of, and where its shape comes from.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.810
&gt;&gt; That sounds reasonable. Let's go do that.
