governmental structures we very much
 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.470
governmental structures we very much
work within those structures and because

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480
work within those structures and because
 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.979

government can't do but I think are the

role of an agency like concern is very

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399
role of an agency like concern is very
 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.510
role of an agency like concern is very
much to be I think a catalyst to help

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520
much to be I think a catalyst to help
 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.270
much to be I think a catalyst to help
bring together different agency and

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280
bring together different agency and
 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.790
bring together different agency and
we're pretty good at that maybe the

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800
we're pretty good at that maybe the
 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.180
we're pretty good at that maybe the
Irish background comes into into this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190
Irish background comes into into this
 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.670

but helping facilitating people work

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680
but helping facilitating people work
 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.010
but helping facilitating people work
well together and I think the other

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020
well together and I think the other
 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.010
well together and I think the other
thing that we do particularly well and

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020
thing that we do particularly well and
 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.109
thing that we do particularly well and
this is really our starting point in

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119
this is really our starting point in
 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.359
this is really our starting point in
many of the to put in in all of the

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369
many of the to put in in all of the
 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.120
many of the to put in in all of the
programs we do is we start by trying to

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130
programs we do is we start by trying to
 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.880
programs we do is we start by trying to
listen to the very poor people what are

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890
listen to the very poor people what are
 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.960
listen to the very poor people what are
their needs you know what are the issues

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970
their needs you know what are the issues
 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.400
their needs you know what are the issues
that they are trying to achieve what of

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410
that they are trying to achieve what of
 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.070
that they are trying to achieve what of
their resources can they bring to

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080
their resources can they bring to
 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.400
their resources can they bring to
working towards their improved welfare

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410
working towards their improved welfare
 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.400
working towards their improved welfare
and how can somehow or other we fit in

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410
and how can somehow or other we fit in
 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.190
and how can somehow or other we fit in
and in a sense harness those

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200
and in a sense harness those
 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.550
and in a sense harness those
capabilities of those very resourceful

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560
capabilities of those very resourceful
 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.300
capabilities of those very resourceful
people and so I think in terms of our

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310
people and so I think in terms of our
 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.820
people and so I think in terms of our
engagement in any of these countries it

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830
engagement in any of these countries it
 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.919
engagement in any of these countries it
is at this number of different levels at

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929
is at this number of different levels at
 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.850
is at this number of different levels at
at the level of the very much the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860
at the level of the very much the
 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.919
at the level of the very much the
household and the community level right

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929
household and the community level right
 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.279
household and the community level right
up to the top level where we would be

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289
up to the top level where we would be
 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.529
up to the top level where we would be
trying in many cases where it's feasible

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539
trying in many cases where it's feasible
 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.900
trying in many cases where it's feasible
it's not always visible where many trade

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910
it's not always visible where many trade
 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.820
it's not always visible where many trade
cases trying to influence government

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830
cases trying to influence government
 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.550
cases trying to influence government
policy many times through partners

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.310
policy many times through partners
through civil society within the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320
through civil society within the
 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.980
through civil society within the
countries we work in influence policy at

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990
countries we work in influence policy at
 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.680
countries we work in influence policy at
governmental level two

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690
governmental level two
 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.070
governmental level two
favorable toward tour support

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080
 
 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.980
 
the fundamental approach doesn't change

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990
the fundamental approach doesn't change
 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.170
the fundamental approach doesn't change
I think you go in and you you do try to

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180
I think you go in and you you do try to
 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.330
I think you go in and you you do try to
understand the context you're working in

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340
understand the context you're working in
 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.090
understand the context you're working in
and then you try to design your

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100
and then you try to design your
 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.940
and then you try to design your
intervention to deal with that put in an

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950
intervention to deal with that put in an
 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.890
intervention to deal with that put in an
emergency situation you do have to act

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900
emergency situation you do have to act
 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.920
emergency situation you do have to act
quickly and so therefore you know

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930
quickly and so therefore you know
 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.260
quickly and so therefore you know
there's some level of consultation but

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270
there's some level of consultation but
 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.270
there's some level of consultation but
at the end of the day there is an

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280
at the end of the day there is an
 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.700
at the end of the day there is an
urgency when you get the job done and

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710
urgency when you get the job done and
 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.580
urgency when you get the job done and
this is where I think experience comes

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590
this is where I think experience comes
 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.920
this is where I think experience comes

now for 40 years we've accumulated a
 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.170
now for 40 years we've accumulated a
great deal of experience as to how to

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180
great deal of experience as to how to
