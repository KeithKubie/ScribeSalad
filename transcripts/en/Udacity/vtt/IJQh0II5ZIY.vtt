00:00:00.052 --> 00:00:02.613
So let’s take a look at our Jersey Square team as

00:00:02.613 --> 00:00:05.155
an example and see how they came up with their

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:07.693
value proposition. Now, what’s interesting is if

00:00:07.693 --> 00:00:10.636
you remember value proposition describes not

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:13.090
only the features but also the pains and gains

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.615
that they see, that they’ve actually craved for the

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.502
customer and that the goal is to figure out what

00:00:18.502 --> 00:00:20.003
the MVP is.

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:21.949
And if we see the Jersey Square team,

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.834
they actually did a pretty good job talking

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:26.695
about pains and gains, a cheaper way to wear

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:29.625
officially licensed sports jerseys to a game,

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:32.057
to eliminate the risk of owning a player’s jersey

00:00:32.057 --> 00:00:34.475
who is going to be traded, or to provide an

00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:36.801
alternative to purchasing counterfeit jerseys.

00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:38.620
Pretty good for pains and gains.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.358
But what they forgot to describe is what are the

00:00:40.358 --> 00:00:42.436
features and just so we could remember the

00:00:42.436 --> 00:00:44.722
features for Jersey Square is they were going to

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:47.722
provide a single place where you could rent sports

00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:50.258
jerseys, so you wouldn’t have to own them and

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:53.074
maintain them to visit your favorite team.

00:00:53.074 --> 00:00:55.317
And what they also missed is what was the

00:00:55.317 --> 00:00:58.585
MVP or minimum viable product of what they

00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:00.268
were going to build. And in their case it was

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:03.697
going to be a website with rental and a stock of

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:06.864
jerseys of the most popular teams at first in the

00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:09.232
New York area and then nationally in the United

00:01:09.232 --> 00:01:11.999
States and then ultimately internationally.

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:13.417
So those were kind of missing, but again

00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:15.286
starting with pains and gains was pretty

00:01:15.286 --> 00:01:17.203
good for their value proposition.

00:01:17.203 --> 00:01:19.320
Notice by the way, while they were working on

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.747
value proposition, they also had some

00:01:22.747 --> 00:01:25.887
hypothesis about the customer segments.

00:01:25.887 --> 00:01:28.862
And this is a key idea, value proposition and

00:01:28.862 --> 00:01:31.610
customer segments are the first two things you

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.745
tend to work on with the business model canvas.

00:01:33.745 --> 00:01:36.263
Because these two have a special name called

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:39.395
product market fit. And product market fit just

00:01:39.395 --> 00:01:42.802
simply says what is the match between what you

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.500
are building and what customers need and

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.366
want, and who are those customers.

00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:49.896
So, while the goal in value prop is to figure out

00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:51.869
the MVP, yes, we’ll see later the goal in

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.284
customer segments is to figure out who and

00:01:55.284 --> 00:01:58.083
what the archetype of the customer is. So again

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:01.439
you could start either with customer segments or

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.821
you could start with a product and value prop

00:02:03.821 --> 00:02:06.251
itself, it really doesn’t matter. But in most teams

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.203
if they are technology driven, they tend to start

00:02:09.203 --> 00:02:11.552
on value prop and most teams if they happen to

00:02:11.552 --> 00:02:14.337
be marketers or business people, happen to start

00:02:14.337 --> 00:02:16.471
with the customer segments. There is no right

00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:20.853
place, but it’s the interaction between these two.
