00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.123
- [Instructor] In this video,
we are going to talk about one

00:00:02.123 --> 00:00:04.765
of the most common types
of curves you will see

00:00:04.765 --> 00:00:08.182
in mathematics, and that is the parabola.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.251
The word parabola sounds
quite fancy, but we'll see

00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:16.157
it's describing something that
is fairly straightforward.

00:00:16.157 --> 00:00:19.126
Now in terms of why it
is called the parabola,

00:00:19.126 --> 00:00:21.720
I've seen multiple explanations for it.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.530
It comes from Greek para, that root word,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.477
similar to parable.

00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:29.239
You could view of something beside,

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.271
alongside, something in parallel.

00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:34.552
Bola, same root as when we're talking

00:00:34.552 --> 00:00:37.656
about ballistics, throwing something.

00:00:37.656 --> 00:00:41.678
So you could interpret
it as beside, alongside,

00:00:41.678 --> 00:00:43.989
something that is being thrown.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.627
Now how does that relate
to curves like this?

00:00:46.627 --> 00:00:50.296
Well my brain immediately
imagines this is the trajectory,

00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:53.516
this is the path that is a
pretty good approximation

00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:56.042
for the path of things
that are actually thrown.

00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:57.063
When you study physics,

00:00:57.063 --> 00:00:59.541
you will see the path, you'll approximate,

00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:03.460
the paths of objects being
thrown, as parabolas,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.292
so maybe that's where it comes from,

00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:07.812
but there are other potential explanations

00:01:07.812 --> 00:01:10.919
for why it is actually
called the parabola.

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:13.012
It has been lost to history.

00:01:13.012 --> 00:01:15.582
But what exactly is a parabola?

00:01:15.582 --> 00:01:17.268
In future videos, we're gonna describe it

00:01:17.268 --> 00:01:19.314
a little bit more algebraically.

00:01:19.314 --> 00:01:21.330
In this one, we just wanna get a sense

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.678
for what parabolas look
like and introduce ourselves

00:01:24.678 --> 00:01:28.599
to some terminology around a parabola.

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:33.368
These three curves, they
are all hand-drawn versions

00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:36.468
of a parabola, and so
you immediately notice

00:01:36.468 --> 00:01:38.899
some interesting things about them.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.732
Some of them are opened
upwards like this yellow one

00:01:41.732 --> 00:01:45.457
and this pink one, and some
of them are open downwards.

00:01:45.457 --> 00:01:49.624
You will hear people say
things like open, opened down,

00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:55.658
open downwards or open
down or open upwards,

00:01:56.964 --> 00:01:59.097
so it's good to know what
they are talking about,

00:01:59.097 --> 00:02:01.938
and it's, hopefully,
fairly self-explanatory.

00:02:01.938 --> 00:02:04.771
Open upwards, the parabola is open

00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:07.564
towards the top of our graph paper.

00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:10.054
Here it's open towards the
bottom of our graph paper.

00:02:10.054 --> 00:02:11.952
This looks like a right-side up U.

00:02:11.952 --> 00:02:14.557
This looks like an upside
down U right over here.

00:02:14.557 --> 00:02:17.431
This pink one would be open upwards.

00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:19.601
Now another term that
you'll see associated

00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:21.574
with the parabola, and
once again, in the future,

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:22.955
we'll learn how to calculate these things

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:26.105
and find them precisely, is the vertex.

00:02:26.105 --> 00:02:29.933
The vertex you should view as the maximum

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:32.009
or minimum point on a parabola.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.190
So if a parabola opens upwards
like these two on the right,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.531
the vertex is the minimum point.

00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:42.489
The vertex is the minimum
point right over there,

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.223
and so if someone said what is the vertex

00:02:44.223 --> 00:02:46.692
of this yellow parabola?

00:02:46.692 --> 00:02:50.068
Well it looks like the x,
looks like the x coordinate

00:02:50.068 --> 00:02:54.303
is three and a half, so
it is three and a half.

00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:57.098
It looks like the y
coordinate, it looks like it is

00:02:57.098 --> 00:02:59.783
about negative three and a half.

00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:02.210
Once again, once we start
representing these things

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.096
with equations, we'll have techniques

00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:07.186
for calculating them more
precisely, but the vertex

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:09.116
of this other upward-opening parabola,

00:03:09.116 --> 00:03:10.314
it is the minimum point.

00:03:10.314 --> 00:03:11.644
It is the low point.

00:03:11.644 --> 00:03:14.298
There is no maximum point on
an upward-opening parabola.

00:03:14.298 --> 00:03:16.467
It just keeps increasing as x gets larger

00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:19.646
in the positive or the negative direction.

00:03:19.646 --> 00:03:22.166
Now if your parabola opens downward,

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:26.333
then your vertex is going
to be your maximum point.

00:03:27.915 --> 00:03:31.839
Now related to the idea
of a vertex is the idea

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:33.767
of an axis of symmetry.

00:03:33.767 --> 00:03:36.957
In general when we're talking
about, well not just three,

00:03:36.957 --> 00:03:39.384
two dimensions but even three dimensions,

00:03:39.384 --> 00:03:42.028
but especially in two dimensions,
you can imagine a line

00:03:42.028 --> 00:03:44.861
over which you can flip the graph,

00:03:46.628 --> 00:03:50.251
and so it meets, it folds onto itself.

00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:54.005
The axis of symmetry for this
yellow graph right over here,

00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:58.256
for this yellow parabola,
it would be this line.

00:03:58.256 --> 00:04:02.647
I'm gonna have to draw
it a little bit better.

00:04:02.647 --> 00:04:05.568
It would be that line right over there.

00:04:05.568 --> 00:04:08.195
You could fold the
parabola over that line,

00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:10.107
and it would meet itself.

00:04:10.107 --> 00:04:12.552
And that line, I didn't
draw it as neat as I should,

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:15.954
that should go directly
through the vertex,

00:04:15.954 --> 00:04:17.952
so to describe that line you'd say

00:04:17.952 --> 00:04:20.785
that line is x is equal to 3.5.

00:04:23.217 --> 00:04:28.155
Similarly the axis of symmetry
for this pink parabola,

00:04:28.155 --> 00:04:32.391
it should go through the
line x equals negative one,

00:04:32.391 --> 00:04:33.865
so let me do that.

00:04:33.865 --> 00:04:35.449
That's the axis of symmetry.

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.611
It goes through the
vertex, and if you were

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.622
to fold the parabola over
it, it would meet itself.

00:04:41.622 --> 00:04:45.124
The axis of symmetry for this green one?

00:04:45.124 --> 00:04:47.763
It should, once again,
go through the vertex.

00:04:47.763 --> 00:04:51.650
It looks like it is x is
equal to negative six.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.091
This is, let me write that down,

00:04:53.091 --> 00:04:55.508
that is the axis of symmetry.

00:04:58.711 --> 00:05:02.085
Now another concept that
isn't unique to parabolas,

00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:05.117
but we'll talk a lot about it
in the context of parabolas,

00:05:05.117 --> 00:05:08.713
are intercepts, so when
people say y-intercept,

00:05:08.713 --> 00:05:11.000
and you saw this when
you first graphed lines,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.588
they're saying where is the graph,

00:05:12.588 --> 00:05:17.139
where does the curve intercept
or intersect the y-axis?

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.033
So the y-intercept of this
yellow line would be right there.

00:05:20.033 --> 00:05:23.960
It looks like it's the
point zero comma three,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.296
zero comma three.

00:05:25.296 --> 00:05:28.068
The y-intercept for the pink
one is right over there.

00:05:28.068 --> 00:05:30.524
At least on this graph paper,
we don't see the y-intercept,

00:05:30.524 --> 00:05:33.161
but it eventually will
intersect the y-axis.

00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:37.044
It just will be way off of this screen.

00:05:37.044 --> 00:05:40.020
You might also be familiar
with the term x-intercept,

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.881
and that's especially
interesting with parabolas

00:05:41.881 --> 00:05:42.979
as we'll see in the future.

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.825
X-intercept is where do you intercept

00:05:44.825 --> 00:05:46.825
or intersect the x-axis?

00:05:48.586 --> 00:05:51.940
Here this yellow one you
see it does it two places,

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.496
and this is where it gets interesting.

00:05:53.496 --> 00:05:57.663
Lines will only intersect
the x-axis once at most,

00:05:58.787 --> 00:06:01.860
but here we see that a
parabola can intersect

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.336
the x-axis twice, because
it curves back around

00:06:05.336 --> 00:06:08.484
to intersect it again, and so for here

00:06:08.484 --> 00:06:11.712
the x-intercepts are going to be the point

00:06:11.712 --> 00:06:14.545
one comma zero and six comma zero.

00:06:16.608 --> 00:06:19.258
You might already notice
something interesting.

00:06:19.258 --> 00:06:23.984
The x-intercepts are symmetric
around the axis of symmetry,

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:27.693
so they should be equal distant
from that axis of symmetry,

00:06:27.693 --> 00:06:29.918
and you can see they indeed are.

00:06:29.918 --> 00:06:33.280
They are both exactly two and a half away

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.456
from that axis of symmetry,
and so if you know

00:06:37.456 --> 00:06:40.487
where the intercepts are,
you just take, you could say,

00:06:40.487 --> 00:06:43.445
the midpoint of the x
coordinates, and then you're going

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:46.394
to have the axis of
symmetry, the x coordinate

00:06:46.394 --> 00:06:48.922
of the axis of symmetry
and the x coordinate

00:06:48.922 --> 00:06:50.993
of the actual vertex.

00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:55.724
Similarly the x-intercept
here looks like it's negative,

00:06:55.724 --> 00:06:59.256
the points are negative seven comma zero

00:06:59.256 --> 00:07:01.673
and negative five comma zero,

00:07:03.996 --> 00:07:07.616
and the x coordinate of the
vertex, or the line of symmetry,

00:07:07.616 --> 00:07:10.699
is right in between those two points.

00:07:11.835 --> 00:07:14.279
It's worth noting not
every parabola is going

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:16.279
to intersect the x-axis.

00:07:17.162 --> 00:07:20.593
Notice this pink upward-opening parabola,

00:07:20.593 --> 00:07:23.480
it's low point is above the x-axis,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.833
so it's never going to
intersect the actual x-axis,

00:07:26.833 --> 00:07:31.000
so this is actually not going
to have any x-intercepts.

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:33.172
I'll leave you there.

00:07:33.172 --> 00:07:36.713
Those are actually the core
ideas or the core visual themes

00:07:36.713 --> 00:07:38.844
around parabolas, and
we're going to discuss them

00:07:38.844 --> 00:07:42.307
in a lot more detail when we
represent them with equations.

00:07:42.307 --> 00:07:44.888
As you'll see, these equations are going

00:07:44.888 --> 00:07:47.471
to involve second-degree terms.

00:07:48.577 --> 00:07:51.157
So the most simple parabola is going to be

00:07:51.157 --> 00:07:53.124
y is equal to x squared,

00:07:53.124 --> 00:07:54.784
but then you can
complicate it a little bit.

00:07:54.784 --> 00:07:56.898
You could have things like y is equal to

00:07:56.898 --> 00:08:01.258
two x squared minus five x plus seven.

00:08:01.258 --> 00:08:04.190
These types that we'll talk
about in more general terms,

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.155
these types of equations
sometimes called quadratics,

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:12.072
they are represented,
generally, by parabolas.
