this female is one and then there's

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970
this female is one and then there's
 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.550

cheetah in the Triangle is really very

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820
cheetah in the Triangle is really very
 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.400
cheetah in the Triangle is really very
nice and it's probably to do with the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410
nice and it's probably to do with the
 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.010
nice and it's probably to do with the
fact that we have this huge section that

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020
fact that we have this huge section that
 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.840
fact that we have this huge section that
is so short the grass is so short at the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850
is so short the grass is so short at the
 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.010
is so short the grass is so short at the
moment and that's because this is the

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020
moment and that's because this is the
 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.920
moment and that's because this is the
area that was on fire during sort of I

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930
area that was on fire during sort of I
 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.260
area that was on fire during sort of I
think as July August somewhere there and

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270
think as July August somewhere there and
 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.920
think as July August somewhere there and
so it's the perfect habitat now for

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930
so it's the perfect habitat now for
 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.080
so it's the perfect habitat now for
cheetah to be roaming around and to be

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090
cheetah to be roaming around and to be
 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.610

sort of most of the storm she was
 

00:25:11.539 --> 00:25:13.330
sort of most of the storm she was
sitting there shivering shame she was so

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:13.340
sitting there shivering shame she was so
 

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.740
sitting there shivering shame she was so
cold and I wonder if maybe this running

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:14.750
cold and I wonder if maybe this running
 

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:20.950
cold and I wonder if maybe this running
around under the hood yeah bit for ya

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960
around under the hood yeah bit for ya
 

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.530
around under the hood yeah bit for ya
it's sort of serious huntin actually

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:23.540
it's sort of serious huntin actually
 

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.000
it's sort of serious huntin actually
tries to go after anything I don't know

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.010
tries to go after anything I don't know
 

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.800
tries to go after anything I don't know
but it looks as though she's definitely

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:26.810
but it looks as though she's definitely
 

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.450
but it looks as though she's definitely
looking for something in the little sort

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:28.460
looking for something in the little sort
 

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.310
looking for something in the little sort
of pockets of grass and thickets and I

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320
of pockets of grass and thickets and I
 

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.840
of pockets of grass and thickets and I
would imagine that would be have to be

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:31.850
would imagine that would be have to be
 

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.370
would imagine that would be have to be
something like scrub his that would be

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:33.380
something like scrub his that would be
 

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.290
something like scrub his that would be
pretty much what she would go for or she

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:35.300
pretty much what she would go for or she
 

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.820
pretty much what she would go for or she
could be going off to small birds of

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:36.830
could be going off to small birds of
 

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.080
could be going off to small birds of
some Franklin's and things like that

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:38.090
some Franklin's and things like that
 

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.640

cheetah will go after those from time to

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:39.650
cheetah will go after those from time to
 

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:40.210
cheetah will go after those from time to
time too

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:40.220
time too
 

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.100
time too
but I would imagine it's mostly scrub

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:42.110
but I would imagine it's mostly scrub
 

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.600
but I would imagine it's mostly scrub
his and small antelope maybe little baby

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:43.610
his and small antelope maybe little baby
 

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:45.190
his and small antelope maybe little baby
antelope that have been hidden it'll

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200
antelope that have been hidden it'll
 

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.750
antelope that have been hidden it'll
maybe Tommy's or baby and parlors or

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760
maybe Tommy's or baby and parlors or
 

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.460
maybe Tommy's or baby and parlors or
something like that that might be hidden

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:48.470
something like that that might be hidden
 

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.170
something like that that might be hidden
in these little think it says probably

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:50.180
in these little think it says probably
 

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.610
in these little think it says probably
what she's looking for but if we kind of

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:51.620
what she's looking for but if we kind of
 

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.790
what she's looking for but if we kind of
come out you'll see that the rain is

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:54.800
come out you'll see that the rain is
 

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.770
come out you'll see that the rain is
starting to come too so from the sort of

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:56.780
starting to come too so from the sort of
 

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.240
starting to come too so from the sort of
escarpment side what's happened is the

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:58.250
escarpment side what's happened is the
 

00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:59.920
escarpment side what's happened is the
rain is shifting now around us and is

00:25:59.920 --> 00:25:59.930
rain is shifting now around us and is
 

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:00.940
rain is shifting now around us and is
gonna come along and you can actually

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:00.950
gonna come along and you can actually
 

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.620
gonna come along and you can actually
see the escarpment is starting to

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:02.630
see the escarpment is starting to
 

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.670
see the escarpment is starting to
disappear a little bit it's kind of

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:05.680
disappear a little bit it's kind of
 

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.200
disappear a little bit it's kind of
losing its shape because of the storm

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:08.210
losing its shape because of the storm
 

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:09.520
losing its shape because of the storm
that's sort of heading back in our

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:09.530
that's sort of heading back in our
 

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:11.440
that's sort of heading back in our
direction which is not ideal it went

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:11.450
direction which is not ideal it went
 

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:12.880
direction which is not ideal it went
sort of north and it's not turning back

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:12.890
sort of north and it's not turning back
 

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:14.170
sort of north and it's not turning back
again there's a bit of lightning and

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:14.180
again there's a bit of lightning and
 

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.970
again there's a bit of lightning and
stuff so hopefully you know it'll kind

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:15.980
stuff so hopefully you know it'll kind
 

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.650
stuff so hopefully you know it'll kind
of just blow over the escarpment and we

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:17.660
of just blow over the escarpment and we
 

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:18.670
of just blow over the escarpment and we
won't have to worry too much

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:18.680
won't have to worry too much
 

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.440
won't have to worry too much
Kenya though she seems to be wanting to

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:20.450
Kenya though she seems to be wanting to
 

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:21.910
Kenya though she seems to be wanting to
take us right into the middle of the

take us right into the middle of the
 

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.230
take us right into the middle of the
storm so we're gonna have to follow her

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:23.240
storm so we're gonna have to follow her
 

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.600
storm so we're gonna have to follow her
as she does I don't know where she's off

in Lauer's last year she had Cubs and

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:34.760
in Lauer's last year she had Cubs and
 

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.260
in Lauer's last year she had Cubs and
that was far south towards Tanzanian

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:38.270

fast or cheetah
 

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:45.070
fast or cheetah
well they very fast is the answer in the

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080
well they very fast is the answer in the
 

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.140
well they very fast is the answer in the
wild I think the top speed that they've

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:47.150
wild I think the top speed that they've
 

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:48.820
wild I think the top speed that they've
ever been clocked at is like in 93

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:48.830
ever been clocked at is like in 93
 

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:51.700
ever been clocked at is like in 93
kilometers an hour it's 93 or 95

somewhere there whereas in captivity
 

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:57.100
somewhere there whereas in captivity
they've gone a little bit faster one one

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:57.110
they've gone a little bit faster one one
 

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.140
they've gone a little bit faster one one
five I think is is the fastest in

00:26:59.140 --> 00:26:59.150
five I think is is the fastest in
 

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:02.350
five I think is is the fastest in
captivity but I mean they really are

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:02.360
captivity but I mean they really are
 

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.730

quick animals there's no one else that
 

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.000
quick animals there's no one else that
really can go as fast as they can and

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.010
really can go as fast as they can and
 

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:09.730
really can go as fast as they can and

is not an easy feat to travel at that
just and all that speed so they are

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:16.190
just and all that speed so they are
 

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:17.620
just and all that speed so they are
incredibly fast and I'm quite happy that

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:17.630
incredibly fast and I'm quite happy that
 

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:19.150

with you and sort of cross from your one
 

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.560

definitely think she's off to something

00:27:45.159 --> 00:27:45.169
definitely think she's off to something
 

00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:47.450
definitely think she's off to something
particular she's looking for something

particular she's looking for something
 

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.919

because you watch how she walks now and

00:27:48.919 --> 00:27:48.929
because you watch how she walks now and
 

00:27:48.929 --> 00:27:50.629
because you watch how she walks now and
she'll go and she'll look in all of

she'll go and she'll look in all of
 

00:27:50.639 --> 00:27:52.279
she'll go and she'll look in all of
these little patches you see yeah and

she's almost as if she's kind of I don't
 

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.360
she's almost as if she's kind of I don't
know what it is but she's definitely got

know what it is but she's definitely got
 

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:58.639
know what it is but she's definitely got
a bit of playfulness in her today

00:27:58.639 --> 00:27:58.649
a bit of playfulness in her today
 

00:27:58.649 --> 00:28:00.019
a bit of playfulness in her today
because she's bouncing around like that

00:28:00.019 --> 00:28:00.029
because she's bouncing around like that
 

00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:02.090
because she's bouncing around like that
all over the place and this has been the

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:02.100
all over the place and this has been the
 

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.710
all over the place and this has been the
way she's been since she woke up from

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720
way she's been since she woke up from
 

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.889
way she's been since she woke up from

catch up with her once again because the

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:23.340
catch up with her once again because the
 

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.680
catch up with her once again because the
problem with her is she takes ten

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:24.690
problem with her is she takes ten
 

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:27.110
problem with her is she takes ten
strides when she runs like that and she

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120
strides when she runs like that and she
 

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.049
strides when she runs like that and she
leaves us way way way way way behind and

00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:30.059
leaves us way way way way way behind and
 

00:28:30.059 --> 00:28:32.029
leaves us way way way way way behind and
takes us a bit of time just to catch up

00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039
takes us a bit of time just to catch up
 

00:28:32.039 --> 00:28:34.810
takes us a bit of time just to catch up
with her once again

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:34.820
with her once again
 

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.940
with her once again
and one start trying to give her quite a

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:36.950
and one start trying to give her quite a
 

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.100
and one start trying to give her quite a
bit of a lead space and not get too

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:39.110
bit of a lead space and not get too
 

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:41.260
bit of a lead space and not get too
close to for the simple reason that if

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:41.270

cheetah and if you look at the years and

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:12.530
cheetah and if you look at the years and
 

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.650
cheetah and if you look at the years and
her general sort of appearance she's not

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:14.660
her general sort of appearance she's not
 

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.020
her general sort of appearance she's not
tatty in any way whatsoever so the ears

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:17.030
tatty in any way whatsoever so the ears
 

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.120
tatty in any way whatsoever so the ears
are in good condition her sort of

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:19.130
are in good condition her sort of
 

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:20.710
are in good condition her sort of
general body's in good condition and so

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720
general body's in good condition and so
 

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.540
general body's in good condition and so
as far as I remember she's in she's

as far as I remember she's in she's
 

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.370
as far as I remember she's in she's
quite young so I think she's somewhere

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:24.380
quite young so I think she's somewhere
 

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.830
quite young so I think she's somewhere
around 67 but I'm not 100% sure like I

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:26.840
around 67 but I'm not 100% sure like I
 

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.180
around 67 but I'm not 100% sure like I
said I'll have to double check it maybe

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:28.190
said I'll have to double check it maybe
 

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:29.710
said I'll have to double check it maybe
some of you have an answer for us I know

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:29.720
some of you have an answer for us I know
 

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.770
some of you have an answer for us I know
James you often will you know the

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:32.780
James you often will you know the
 

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.600
James you often will you know the
cheetahs of the Mara quite well so maybe

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:34.610
cheetahs of the Mara quite well so maybe
 

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:36.670
cheetahs of the Mara quite well so maybe
you can help us out with that and see if

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:36.680
you can help us out with that and see if
 

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.490
you can help us out with that and see if
we were an age for her but she's she's

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:39.500
we were an age for her but she's she's
 

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.020
we were an age for her but she's she's
old enough to have had obviously in a

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:41.030
old enough to have had obviously in a
 

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.430
old enough to have had obviously in a
caesarean and nerrit Orion for them to

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440
caesarean and nerrit Orion for them to
 

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.110
caesarean and nerrit Orion for them to
have braids and then she's had obviously

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:44.120
have braids and then she's had obviously
 

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.390
have braids and then she's had obviously
multiple litters and son hasn't had too

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:46.400
multiple litters and son hasn't had too
 

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.160
multiple litters and son hasn't had too
much success with him but it's really

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:48.170
much success with him but it's really
 

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:48.940
much success with him but it's really
nice that we've kind of

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:48.950
nice that we've kind of
 

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:50.500
nice that we've kind of
caught up with a cheetah given that it

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:50.510
caught up with a cheetah given that it
 

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.060
caught up with a cheetah given that it
was international cheetah day a few days

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:52.070
was international cheetah day a few days
 

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:53.710
was international cheetah day a few days
ago so it feels like it's a good thing

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720
ago so it feels like it's a good thing
 

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.090
ago so it feels like it's a good thing
that we've caught up with one quite

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:55.100
that we've caught up with one quite
 

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.590
that we've caught up with one quite
close to it and that we can kind of

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600
close to it and that we can kind of
 

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.240
close to it and that we can kind of

these animals of course they are having

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:00.380
these animals of course they are having
 

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.590
these animals of course they are having
a tough time around Africa there the

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:02.600
a tough time around Africa there the
 

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.200
a tough time around Africa there the
numbers were depleted and they then kind

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:05.210
numbers were depleted and they then kind
 

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:08.230
numbers were depleted and they then kind
of responded quite well and we're they

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240
of responded quite well and we're they
 

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.360
of responded quite well and we're they
were repopulated even though it was from

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:10.370
were repopulated even though it was from
 

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:12.220
were repopulated even though it was from
such a weak gene pool that it's left

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:12.230
such a weak gene pool that it's left
 

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:13.360
such a weak gene pool that it's left
them to have a little bit of a

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:13.370
them to have a little bit of a
 

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:17.740
them to have a little bit of a
susceptibility to various things but you

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:17.750
susceptibility to various things but you
 

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.360
susceptibility to various things but you
know they've done quite well in certain

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:19.370
know they've done quite well in certain
 

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:21.129
know they've done quite well in certain
areas and other areas not so well and so

00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:21.139
areas and other areas not so well and so
 

00:31:21.139 --> 00:31:23.860
areas and other areas not so well and so
the general numbers are a bit of a worry

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:23.870
the general numbers are a bit of a worry
 

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:25.659
the general numbers are a bit of a worry
with cheetah and they obviously are an

00:31:25.659 --> 00:31:25.669
with cheetah and they obviously are an
 

00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:27.039
with cheetah and they obviously are an
endangered species you can see she's

00:31:27.039 --> 00:31:27.049
endangered species you can see she's
 

00:31:27.049 --> 00:31:28.750
endangered species you can see she's
watching an ostrich at the moment that's

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:28.760
watching an ostrich at the moment that's
 

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.519
watching an ostrich at the moment that's
way off in the distance and she's walked

00:31:30.519 --> 00:31:30.529
way off in the distance and she's walked
 

00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:32.230
way off in the distance and she's walked
past that ostrich twice already so she's

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240
past that ostrich twice already so she's
 

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.730
past that ostrich twice already so she's
not just looking to hunt it I don't

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:33.740
not just looking to hunt it I don't
 

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.500
not just looking to hunt it I don't
think she's just kind of watching and

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:35.510
think she's just kind of watching and
 

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.019
think she's just kind of watching and
moving about and but you know and then

00:31:38.019 --> 00:31:38.029
moving about and but you know and then
 

00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:39.610
moving about and but you know and then
here in the Triangle it's an interesting

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:39.620
here in the Triangle it's an interesting
 

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.529
here in the Triangle it's an interesting
thing because you know that the cheetahs

00:31:41.529 --> 00:31:41.539
thing because you know that the cheetahs
 

00:31:41.539 --> 00:31:42.759
thing because you know that the cheetahs
of the triangle are not nearly as

00:31:42.759 --> 00:31:42.769
of the triangle are not nearly as
 

00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:45.430
of the triangle are not nearly as
consistent as the Cheetahs on the other

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440
consistent as the Cheetahs on the other
 

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.019
consistent as the Cheetahs on the other
side of the river in the National Park

00:31:47.019 --> 00:31:47.029
side of the river in the National Park
 

00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:49.840
side of the river in the National Park
area and it's probably many reasons for

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:49.850
area and it's probably many reasons for
 

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.269
area and it's probably many reasons for
that I think probably the terrain and

00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279
that I think probably the terrain and
 

00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:54.930
that I think probably the terrain and
then the the shortness of the grass here

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:54.940
then the the shortness of the grass here
 

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.220
then the the shortness of the grass here
influences the numbers of cheetah that

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:57.230
influences the numbers of cheetah that
 

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:59.049
influences the numbers of cheetah that
we see if you go onto the other side of

00:31:59.049 --> 00:31:59.059
we see if you go onto the other side of
 

00:31:59.059 --> 00:32:00.759
we see if you go onto the other side of
the river it's much shorter in a lot of

00:32:00.759 --> 00:32:00.769
the river it's much shorter in a lot of
 

00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:02.350
the river it's much shorter in a lot of
the places particularly towards the

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360
the places particularly towards the
 

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.149
the places particularly towards the
northern boundary where we see a number

00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159
northern boundary where we see a number
 

00:32:04.159 --> 00:32:05.889
northern boundary where we see a number
of different cheetahs hanging about and

00:32:05.889 --> 00:32:05.899
of different cheetahs hanging about and
 

00:32:05.899 --> 00:32:08.139
of different cheetahs hanging about and
so probably is it to do with that the

00:32:08.139 --> 00:32:08.149
so probably is it to do with that the
 

00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:09.279
so probably is it to do with that the
cheetah here probably struggle a little

00:32:09.279 --> 00:32:09.289
cheetah here probably struggle a little
 

00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:10.690
cheetah here probably struggle a little
bit more to see other predators as well

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:10.700
bit more to see other predators as well
 

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.850
bit more to see other predators as well
as to find food anyway and we'll see how

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:12.860
as to find food anyway and we'll see how
 

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.110
as to find food anyway and we'll see how
she goes we gonna keep up with a like a

it's such an interesting thing because

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.360
it's such an interesting thing because
 

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.470
it's such an interesting thing because
it's going through stages first we know

00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480
it's going through stages first we know
 

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.990
it's going through stages first we know
that the Lions got hold of this animal

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000
that the Lions got hold of this animal
 

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.320
that the Lions got hold of this animal
we know that they clean

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:03.330
we know that they clean
 

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:05.480
we know that they clean
love as much as they could the parts

love as much as they could the parts
 

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:07.670
love as much as they could the parts
that they like then we know that the

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:07.680
that they like then we know that the

vultures got what they could the bigger
poles then we have the hooded vultures

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.010
poles then we have the hooded vultures
 

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:16.640

come down take out these little bits and
now we have flies even coming through to

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:21.150
now we have flies even coming through to

you watch this morning show you would
have seen that there was a lot of the

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460
have seen that there was a lot of the
 

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.610
have seen that there was a lot of the
sample left now that's interesting

00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.620
sample left now that's interesting
 

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.010
sample left now that's interesting
obviously I have James Henry on camera

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:01.020
obviously I have James Henry on camera
 

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.880
obviously I have James Henry on camera
here he's taking Direction very well and

I said to him I'd love to show you guys
this hoof because you can you really get

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.300
this hoof because you can you really get
 

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.780
this hoof because you can you really get
the opportunity to see what the roof

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:11.790
the opportunity to see what the roof
 

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:13.850
the opportunity to see what the roof
actually looks like Oh in any case a

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:13.860
actually looks like Oh in any case a
 

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.300
actually looks like Oh in any case a
what a track actually looked like or the

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:17.310
what a track actually looked like or the
 

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:18.950
what a track actually looked like or the
foot that makes the track looks like we

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960
foot that makes the track looks like we
 

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.980
foot that makes the track looks like we
always see the track and I like to see

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:21.990
always see the track and I like to see
 

00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:24.260
always see the track and I like to see
this because we can actually see this is

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:24.270
this because we can actually see this is
 

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:28.430
this because we can actually see this is
the shape and size of it I think very

00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440
the shape and size of it I think very
 

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:35.600
the shape and size of it I think very
cool and we we know that shape from when

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:35.610
cool and we we know that shape from when
 

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:36.950
cool and we we know that shape from when
were tracking him you can see the soft

00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960
were tracking him you can see the soft
 

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.350
were tracking him you can see the soft
but in the front we often don't get to

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:39.360
but in the front we often don't get to
 

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.910
but in the front we often don't get to
see we all only see that kind of I don't

00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:43.920
see we all only see that kind of I don't
 

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:51.169
see we all only see that kind of I don't
know what you see like shape almost

00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:51.179
 

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:55.710
obviously the smell is horrendous but

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:55.720
obviously the smell is horrendous but
 

00:34:55.720 --> 00:35:05.820
obviously the smell is horrendous but
for you guys I will tolerate it

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:05.830
 

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:10.500
those flies do look massive matome air

looked at for a while and then she
 

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:07.850
looked at for a while and then she
ignored that and then she perked up

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:07.860
ignored that and then she perked up
 

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.290

source but it'll be interesting to see

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:23.970
source but it'll be interesting to see
 

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:25.610
source but it'll be interesting to see
where she goes from here as to whether

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:25.620
where she goes from here as to whether
 

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.570
where she goes from here as to whether
she kind of moves a little bit further

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:28.580
she kind of moves a little bit further
 

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:30.920
she kind of moves a little bit further
northwards or if she goes up towards the

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:30.930
northwards or if she goes up towards the
 

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:32.930
northwards or if she goes up towards the
escarpment area it'll be very

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:32.940
escarpment area it'll be very
 

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:38.880
escarpment area it'll be very
interesting

obviously we know that the five boys

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.400

they stick around they hunt a lot of the
 

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.400
they stick around they hunt a lot of the
migration but what is interesting as I

was having a chat with some of the other

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:56.450
was having a chat with some of the other
 

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:58.330
was having a chat with some of the other
kind of guides Archer that are acting

00:41:58.330 --> 00:41:58.340
kind of guides Archer that are acting
 

00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.380
kind of guides Archer that are acting
gone by and they were telling me that

00:41:59.380 --> 00:41:59.390
gone by and they were telling me that
 

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:01.420
gone by and they were telling me that
often what they see with the Cheetahs is

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:01.430
often what they see with the Cheetahs is
 

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:04.090
often what they see with the Cheetahs is
that during the migration period if

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:04.100
that during the migration period if
 

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.280
that during the migration period if
they've got young Cubs they may tend to

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:06.290
they've got young Cubs they may tend to
 

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.080
they've got young Cubs they may tend to
move away they don't like staying here

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:08.090
move away they don't like staying here
 

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:10.690
move away they don't like staying here
and it's normally because during that

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:10.700
and it's normally because during that
 

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.490
and it's normally because during that
phase with small Cubs is that the

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:12.500
phase with small Cubs is that the
 

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.380
phase with small Cubs is that the
stampeding of them of the migration

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:14.390
stampeding of them of the migration
 

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:16.450
stampeding of them of the migration
often leads to death within these

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:16.460
often leads to death within these
 

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.070
often leads to death within these
cheetah clubs apparently and and so I

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:18.080
cheetah clubs apparently and and so I
 

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.200
cheetah clubs apparently and and so I
mean I haven't seen this firsthand but

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:20.210
mean I haven't seen this firsthand but
 

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:21.730
mean I haven't seen this firsthand but
and they say that that's what often

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:21.740
and they say that that's what often
 

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.200
and they say that that's what often
happens is when their mothers have very

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:23.210
happens is when their mothers have very
 

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:24.610
happens is when their mothers have very
small Cubs they tend to move away from

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:24.620
small Cubs they tend to move away from
 

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.320
small Cubs they tend to move away from
the migration and then as the migration

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:26.330
the migration and then as the migration
 

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:28.720
the migration and then as the migration
sort of turns and changes then they

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:28.730
sort of turns and changes then they
 

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.250
sort of turns and changes then they
start to come back into those areas and

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:30.260
start to come back into those areas and
 

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.650
start to come back into those areas and
it would be I suppose make some sense in

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:32.660
it would be I suppose make some sense in
 

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:34.390
it would be I suppose make some sense in
that we haven't seen much cheetah action

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400
that we haven't seen much cheetah action
 

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.070
that we haven't seen much cheetah action

ranges that actually work at the various
 

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.540
ranges that actually work at the various
places within the within the system and

cheetah sightings over the last orbits

00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:58.310
cheetah sightings over the last orbits
 

00:42:58.310 --> 00:42:59.200
cheetah sightings over the last orbits
and maybe there's some correlation

00:42:59.200 --> 00:42:59.210
and maybe there's some correlation
 

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:01.930
and maybe there's some correlation
within the migration being but hectic

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:01.940
within the migration being but hectic
 

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:03.520
within the migration being but hectic
pujita and so they decide no they'd

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:03.530
pujita and so they decide no they'd
 

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:05.200

rather kind of move off and find

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:05.210
rather kind of move off and find
 

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.570
rather kind of move off and find
somewhere else to go and spend time but

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:07.580
somewhere else to go and spend time but
 

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.430
somewhere else to go and spend time but
it's it's certainly an interesting topic

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440
it's it's certainly an interesting topic
 

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.800
it's it's certainly an interesting topic
and one that's I'm sure there are many

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:11.810
and one that's I'm sure there are many
 

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:14.140
and one that's I'm sure there are many
theories on I would imagine that many

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:14.150
theories on I would imagine that many
 

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:16.690
theories on I would imagine that many
people have some sort of theory on where

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:16.700
people have some sort of theory on where
 

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.480
people have some sort of theory on where
the cheetahs go and why they move around

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:18.490
the cheetahs go and why they move around
 

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:21.300
the cheetahs go and why they move around
during kind of migration periods and I

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:21.310
during kind of migration periods and I
 

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:25.060
during kind of migration periods and I
would hope that it's got not too much to

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:25.070
would hope that it's got not too much to
 

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.070
would hope that it's got not too much to
do with the migration I don't imagine it

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:27.080
do with the migration I don't imagine it
 

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.530
do with the migration I don't imagine it
is a food source for adults but maybe

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:29.540
is a food source for adults but maybe
 

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.390
is a food source for adults but maybe
with Cubs that makes sense to me if

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:31.400
with Cubs that makes sense to me if
 

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.340
with Cubs that makes sense to me if
there's Cubs around then sure I would

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:33.350
there's Cubs around then sure I would
 

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:35.290
there's Cubs around then sure I would
imagine that that would be the case you

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:35.300
imagine that that would be the case you
 

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.180

know they try and kind of keep they cubs

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:37.190

on that burn section earlier is
 

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.690
on that burn section earlier is
primarily because of the fact that there

was hyenas around so just before we went
 

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.940
was hyenas around so just before we went
live we saw hyenas and so that's

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:15.950
live we saw hyenas and so that's
 

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:19.510

more sort of I would describe it as a

00:44:59.080 --> 00:44:59.090
more sort of I would describe it as a
 

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:01.600
more sort of I would describe it as a
home range rather than a fixed territory

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:01.610
home range rather than a fixed territory
 

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:03.040
home range rather than a fixed territory
and so the home range is an area that

and so the home range is an area that
 

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:04.600

cheetah change hunting due to weather

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200
cheetah change hunting due to weather
 

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.839
cheetah change hunting due to weather
and as that's is that what it was just

00:49:52.839 --> 00:49:52.849
and as that's is that what it was just
 

00:49:52.849 --> 00:49:59.410
and as that's is that what it was just
double check before I launch into this

00:49:59.410 --> 00:49:59.420
 

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.880
okay so hansung behavior in rainy

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:01.890
okay so hansung behavior in rainy
 

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:05.630
okay so hansung behavior in rainy
weather it's much like any cats

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640
weather it's much like any cats
 

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:08.299
weather it's much like any cats
they are opportunistic and so I suppose

00:50:08.299 --> 00:50:08.309
they are opportunistic and so I suppose
 

00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:10.400
they are opportunistic and so I suppose
in hunting weather there's I mean in

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:10.410
in hunting weather there's I mean in
 

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:13.819
in hunting weather there's I mean in
three rainy weather hunting with cheetah

00:50:13.819 --> 00:50:13.829
three rainy weather hunting with cheetah
 

00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:16.039
three rainy weather hunting with cheetah
typically doesn't take place you

00:50:16.039 --> 00:50:16.049
typically doesn't take place you
 

00:50:16.049 --> 00:50:17.480
typically doesn't take place you
normally see with cheetah when it rains

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:17.490
normally see with cheetah when it rains
 

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:19.460
normally see with cheetah when it rains
they hunker down and they just kind of

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:19.470
they hunker down and they just kind of
 

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:20.839
they hunker down and they just kind of
get into a ball and they wait for the

00:50:20.839 --> 00:50:20.849
get into a ball and they wait for the
 

00:50:20.849 --> 00:50:22.940
get into a ball and they wait for the
rain to stop as the rain stopped they

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:22.950
rain to stop as the rain stopped they
 

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:24.380
rain to stop as the rain stopped they
then start to become a lot more active

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:24.390
then start to become a lot more active
 

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:26.029
then start to become a lot more active
and a lot more kind of mobile and

00:50:26.029 --> 00:50:26.039
and a lot more kind of mobile and
 

00:50:26.039 --> 00:50:27.559
and a lot more kind of mobile and
they'll actually use that sort of

00:50:27.559 --> 00:50:27.569
they'll actually use that sort of
 

00:50:27.569 --> 00:50:28.910
they'll actually use that sort of
slippery ground to their advantage

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920
slippery ground to their advantage
 

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.740
slippery ground to their advantage
because they have these long sort of

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:30.750
because they have these long sort of
 

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:32.390
because they have these long sort of
claws that act like running spikes and

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400
claws that act like running spikes and
 

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.819
claws that act like running spikes and
can keep them quite safe in comparison

00:50:34.819 --> 00:50:34.829
can keep them quite safe in comparison
 

00:50:34.829 --> 00:50:36.589
can keep them quite safe in comparison
to you know something with a small hoof

00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599
to you know something with a small hoof
 

00:50:36.599 --> 00:50:38.779
to you know something with a small hoof
that can slip very quickly on a muddy

00:50:38.779 --> 00:50:38.789
that can slip very quickly on a muddy
 

00:50:38.789 --> 00:50:40.760
that can slip very quickly on a muddy
surface and so you'll find when it's

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:40.770
surface and so you'll find when it's
 

00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:42.589
surface and so you'll find when it's
raining that they'll hunt just after but

00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599
raining that they'll hunt just after but
 

00:50:42.599 --> 00:50:44.900
raining that they'll hunt just after but
during rain for the 90% of the time a

cheetah is literally just going to
 

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.230
cheetah is literally just going to
hunker down and just try and sit there

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240
hunker down and just try and sit there
 

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.720
hunker down and just try and sit there
for as long as possible and stay as sort

of dry as it can it was quite funny when

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400
of dry as it can it was quite funny when
 

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.130

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.380
to this nearest little thicket and then
she just buried herself in a thicket and

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:03.390
she just buried herself in a thicket and

down and then she was just there for
 

00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:09.170
down and then she was just there for
quite a while and she lay there until

quite a while and she lay there until
 

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.059
quite a while and she lay there until
the rains of the most of the rain passed

00:51:11.059 --> 00:51:11.069
the rains of the most of the rain passed
 

00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:13.010
the rains of the most of the rain passed
and then she was quite happy to sort of

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.020
and then she was quite happy to sort of
 

00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:16.130
and then she was quite happy to sort of
sit stolen and then start to move so you

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140
sit stolen and then start to move so you
 

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.049

know they they typically won't hunt too

00:51:18.049 --> 00:51:18.059
know they they typically won't hunt too
 

00:51:18.059 --> 00:51:20.150

much when its bucketing down like you

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160
much when its bucketing down like you
 

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.890
much when its bucketing down like you
would see with even lion and leopard and

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:21.900
would see with even lion and leopard and
 

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.960
would see with even lion and leopard and
both of those do do it when it's

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:23.970
both of those do do it when it's
 

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:26.059
both of those do do it when it's
bucketing down you will see both lion

00:51:26.059 --> 00:51:26.069
bucketing down you will see both lion
 

00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:28.000

and leopard actually try and hunt

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:28.010
and leopard actually try and hunt

particularly Lions with Buffalo you see

00:51:32.599 --> 00:51:32.609
particularly Lions with Buffalo you see
 

00:51:32.609 --> 00:51:35.180
particularly Lions with Buffalo you see
it's quite often with them doing it but

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:35.190
it's quite often with them doing it but
 

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:37.670
it's quite often with them doing it but
with cheetah not so much they typically

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680
with cheetah not so much they typically
 

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.450
with cheetah not so much they typically
wait until it gets a little bit a little

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:41.460
wait until it gets a little bit a little
 

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:43.940

bit sort of what would the word be dry

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:43.950
bit sort of what would the word be dry
 

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:46.370
bit sort of what would the word be dry
is probably a good way to put it before

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:46.380
is probably a good way to put it before

they attempt too much hunting for the

00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:49.230
they attempt too much hunting for the
 

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:51.829
they attempt too much hunting for the
day so they're more sort of fair where

that I mean like I said when it's a bit
 

00:51:55.079 --> 00:51:56.480
that I mean like I said when it's a bit
slippery out there it's actually not bad

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:56.490
slippery out there it's actually not bad
 

00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:58.549

she's kind of looking for Ruth knows so

01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:14.460
she's kind of looking for Ruth knows so
 

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:15.650
she's kind of looking for Ruth knows so
if she's looking for a male cheetah we

01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:15.660
if she's looking for a male cheetah we
 

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:17.150
if she's looking for a male cheetah we
would hear a calling and we'd hear we'd

01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:17.160
would hear a calling and we'd hear we'd
 

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:19.460
would hear a calling and we'd hear we'd
see her scent marking excessively she'd

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:19.470
see her scent marking excessively she'd
 

01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:21.050
see her scent marking excessively she'd
be spraying everywhere she went

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:21.060
be spraying everywhere she went

be spraying everywhere she went
and that will be obviously even attract

01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:22.740
and that will be obviously even attract
 

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:26.900
and that will be obviously even attract
the attention of a male to scent but

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:26.910
the attention of a male to scent but
 

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:28.460
the attention of a male to scent but
she's not doing any of those things

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:28.470
she's not doing any of those things
 

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:30.800
she's not doing any of those things
she is just more kind of moving around I

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:30.810
she is just more kind of moving around I
 

01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:32.090
she is just more kind of moving around I
think she's looking for a certain type

01:05:32.090 --> 01:05:32.100
think she's looking for a certain type
 

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.100
think she's looking for a certain type
of food maybe she's got a certain

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:34.110
of food maybe she's got a certain
 

01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:35.720
of food maybe she's got a certain
technique that she likes to employ much

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:35.730
technique that she likes to employ much
 

01:05:35.730 --> 01:05:38.270
technique that she likes to employ much
like the fire boys use each other and to

01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:38.280
like the fire boys use each other and to
 

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.970
like the fire boys use each other and to
be able to hunt down wildebeest and topi

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980
be able to hunt down wildebeest and topi
 

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.830
be able to hunt down wildebeest and topi
maybe she's got in a way of doing things

01:05:42.830 --> 01:05:42.840
maybe she's got in a way of doing things
 

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.080
maybe she's got in a way of doing things
as well that she likes to kind of go

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:45.090
as well that she likes to kind of go
 

01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:46.550
as well that she likes to kind of go
from Bush to Bush and she sort of

01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:46.560
from Bush to Bush and she sort of
 

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:49.670
from Bush to Bush and she sort of
surprises things like scrub is and tries

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680
surprises things like scrub is and tries
 

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.860
surprises things like scrub is and tries
to kind of make them sort of move around

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:51.870
to kind of make them sort of move around
 

01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:54.020
to kind of make them sort of move around
so that's what I would imagine would be

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:54.030
so that's what I would imagine would be
 

01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:55.730
so that's what I would imagine would be
the case I mean I think that's what

01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:55.740
the case I mean I think that's what
 

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:57.200
the case I mean I think that's what
she's looking forward to moment of it

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:57.210
she's looking forward to moment of it
 

01:05:57.210 --> 01:05:59.360
she's looking forward to moment of it
like I say I probably in all likelihood

01:05:59.360 --> 01:05:59.370
like I say I probably in all likelihood
 

01:05:59.370 --> 01:06:01.220
like I say I probably in all likelihood
going to leave her fairly shortly and

01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:01.230
going to leave her fairly shortly and
 

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:03.650
going to leave her fairly shortly and
later kind of carry on for the night it

01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660
later kind of carry on for the night it
 

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:06.020
later kind of carry on for the night it
is starting to get quite dark Ian and so

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:06.030
is starting to get quite dark Ian and so
 

01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:07.880
is starting to get quite dark Ian and so
you know at the end of the day she's

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:07.890
you know at the end of the day she's
 

01:06:07.890 --> 01:06:09.200
you know at the end of the day she's
also heading into an area that's going

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:09.210
also heading into an area that's going
 

01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:11.180
also heading into an area that's going
to be quite tricky to follow it gets

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:11.190
to be quite tricky to follow it gets
 

01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:12.920
to be quite tricky to follow it gets
quite rocky as you get over this Ridge

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:12.930
quite rocky as you get over this Ridge
 

01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:14.030
quite rocky as you get over this Ridge
where you can see there's a little

01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:14.040
where you can see there's a little
 

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.830
where you can see there's a little
drop-off there that's where it starts to

01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:15.840
drop-off there that's where it starts to
 

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.140
drop-off there that's where it starts to
get almost impossible to be able to

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:18.150
get almost impossible to be able to
 

01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:19.730
get almost impossible to be able to
actually follow it's quite tricky to

01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740
actually follow it's quite tricky to
 

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:22.130
actually follow it's quite tricky to
kind of get down into that area so you

01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:22.140
kind of get down into that area so you
 

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:23.510
kind of get down into that area so you
know we'll try and kind of figure it out

01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520
know we'll try and kind of figure it out
 

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.180
know we'll try and kind of figure it out
and see where she's gonna go but either

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:26.190
and see where she's gonna go but either
 

01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:28.460
and see where she's gonna go but either
way very very cool to kind of followed

01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:28.470
way very very cool to kind of followed
 

01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:29.690
way very very cool to kind of followed
her for as long as we have and we've

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:29.700
her for as long as we have and we've
 

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.580
her for as long as we have and we've
been thoroughly treated by her this

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:31.590
been thoroughly treated by her this
 

01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:33.740
been thoroughly treated by her this
afternoon that's for sure

it is much lighter so the leopard would

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:00.390
it is much lighter so the leopard would
 

01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:02.690

tall and then weigh very little whereas

01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:28.800
tall and then weigh very little whereas
 

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.710
tall and then weigh very little whereas
a lipid very thick heavy sit big

01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:34.220
forearms big chest
weighs a lot more a lot more power so

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:34.230
weighs a lot more a lot more power so
 

01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:36.080
weighs a lot more a lot more power so
it's its kind of game between power and

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:36.090
it's its kind of game between power and
 

01:07:36.090 --> 01:07:38.630
it's its kind of game between power and
speed and then and so it depends on what

01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640
speed and then and so it depends on what
 

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.340
speed and then and so it depends on what

you want to compare to give you an idea
 

01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:41.540
you want to compare to give you an idea
of how big they are

01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:41.550

far in the distance so we're gonna just

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:47.670
far in the distance so we're gonna just
 

01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:50.150
far in the distance so we're gonna just
try and see I can just get one last view

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160
try and see I can just get one last view
 

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.210
try and see I can just get one last view
of her before she disappears into a

horrible section she's gone into like a
 

01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:57.140
horrible section she's gone into like a
little thicket now and if she's gonna go

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:57.150
little thicket now and if she's gonna go
 

01:07:57.150 --> 01:08:00.560
little thicket now and if she's gonna go
interesting at this stage she's just

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:00.570

into and she's sniffing about in there

01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:08.940
into and she's sniffing about in there
 

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:11.060
into and she's sniffing about in there
as well and it's funny because when you

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:11.070
as well and it's funny because when you
 

01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:12.110
as well and it's funny because when you
are watching the serval happened the

01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:12.120
are watching the serval happened the
 

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.250
are watching the serval happened the
other day this is exactly the same

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:13.260
other day this is exactly the same
 

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:15.710
other day this is exactly the same
technique that that serval employed as

01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720
technique that that serval employed as
 

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.570
technique that that serval employed as
well is that it would go so all of these

01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:17.580
well is that it would go so all of these
 

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:20.000
well is that it would go so all of these
little grassy and and bushy little areas

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:20.010
little grassy and and bushy little areas
 

01:08:20.010 --> 01:08:22.160
little grassy and and bushy little areas
and it would look around for all kinds

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:22.170
and it would look around for all kinds
 

01:08:22.170 --> 01:08:23.750
and it would look around for all kinds
of food items hidden and within those

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:23.760
of food items hidden and within those
 

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.420

to do the exact same the same thing so
 

01:08:29.759 --> 01:08:31.430
to do the exact same the same thing so
wondering if maybe that's her technique

01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440
wondering if maybe that's her technique
 

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.959

way around and tolki Kenya just decided
 

01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:00.310
way around and tolki Kenya just decided
all of a sudden just to flop down in the

01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320
all of a sudden just to flop down in the

it's amazing if she sits like this you

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:06.110
it's amazing if she sits like this you
 

01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:08.350
it's amazing if she sits like this you
would not see her if you were I mean we

01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:08.360
would not see her if you were I mean we
 

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.330
would not see her if you were I mean we
close to the moment we're probably 20

01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:10.340
close to the moment we're probably 20
 

01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:12.370
close to the moment we're probably 20
meters but if you were hundred meters

01:19:12.370 --> 01:19:12.380
meters but if you were hundred meters
 

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.590

away there's absolutely zero chance of

away there's absolutely zero chance of
 

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.450
away there's absolutely zero chance of
you being able to spot her in this grass

01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:16.460
you being able to spot her in this grass
 

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:18.790
you being able to spot her in this grass
and so it's probably it's a wonder how

01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800
and so it's probably it's a wonder how
 

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.830
and so it's probably it's a wonder how
many cheetah we probably drive pass or

in the mire system because in other
roads quite far apart and so you often

01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:27.560
roads quite far apart and so you often
 

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.260
roads quite far apart and so you often
get this situation I mean if she lies

01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:29.270
get this situation I mean if she lies
 

01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:31.690
get this situation I mean if she lies
down flat you would have no idea that

01:19:31.690 --> 01:19:31.700
down flat you would have no idea that
 

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.910
down flat you would have no idea that
she is even here other than those little

01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920
she is even here other than those little
 

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.500
she is even here other than those little
black ears that are moving every now and

black ears that are moving every now and
 

01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:37.510
black ears that are moving every now and
then so you know they are around it's

01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520
then so you know they are around it's
 

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.220
then so you know they are around it's
just sometimes I suppose we miss them a

just sometimes I suppose we miss them a

just sometimes I suppose we miss them a
little bit but she's kind of moved and

I was wondering if maybe she was waiting

01:19:55.810 --> 01:19:55.820
I was wondering if maybe she was waiting
 

01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:57.280
I was wondering if maybe she was waiting

01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:57.290
for it to get a little bit more dingy
 

01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:58.990
for it to get a little bit more dingy
before she moved back on to the dark

01:19:58.990 --> 01:19:59.000
before she moved back on to the dark
 

01:19:59.000 --> 01:19:59.500
before she moved back on to the dark
patch

01:19:59.500 --> 01:19:59.510
patch
 

01:19:59.510 --> 01:20:02.169
patch
I mean onto the burn section in order to

01:20:02.169 --> 01:20:02.179
I mean onto the burn section in order to
 

01:20:02.179 --> 01:20:05.470
I mean onto the burn section in order to
try and potentially hunt again there it

01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:05.480
try and potentially hunt again there it
 

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.910
try and potentially hunt again there it
was a little bit easier for her to move

01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:06.920
was a little bit easier for her to move
 

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.560
was a little bit easier for her to move
around without being spotted because she

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:08.570
around without being spotted because she
 

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:10.540
around without being spotted because she
was being spotted very easily on that

01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:10.550
was being spotted very easily on that
 

01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:13.899
was being spotted very easily on that
burn section but I suspect maybe it's

01:20:13.899 --> 01:20:13.909
burn section but I suspect maybe it's
 

01:20:13.909 --> 01:20:15.939
burn section but I suspect maybe it's
just that you know she wanted to pay and

01:20:15.939 --> 01:20:15.949
just that you know she wanted to pay and
 

01:20:15.949 --> 01:20:17.500
just that you know she wanted to pay and
do a little look around and loop around

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:17.510
do a little look around and loop around
 

01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:19.149
do a little look around and loop around
because she went quite far north and

01:20:19.149 --> 01:20:19.159
because she went quite far north and
 

01:20:19.159 --> 01:20:20.919
because she went quite far north and
she's turned and she's ran south quite a

01:20:20.919 --> 01:20:20.929
she's turned and she's ran south quite a
 

01:20:20.929 --> 01:20:22.780
she's turned and she's ran south quite a
long way again so we've gone a long way

01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:22.790
long way again so we've gone a long way
 

01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:26.439
long way again so we've gone a long way
back to where we kind of started I'm not

01:20:26.439 --> 01:20:26.449
back to where we kind of started I'm not
 

01:20:26.449 --> 01:20:27.760
back to where we kind of started I'm not
sure what she's up to you know just

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:27.770
sure what she's up to you know just
 

01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:29.439
sure what she's up to you know just
looking around maybe just checking who's

01:20:29.439 --> 01:20:29.449
looking around maybe just checking who's
 

01:20:29.449 --> 01:20:31.720
looking around maybe just checking who's
around seeing if there's any sounds or

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:31.730
around seeing if there's any sounds or
 

01:20:31.730 --> 01:20:34.360
around seeing if there's any sounds or
signs should I say off cheetah are the

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:34.370
signs should I say off cheetah are the
 

01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:37.090
signs should I say off cheetah are the
cheetahs in the area so in terms of when

01:20:37.090 --> 01:20:37.100
cheetahs in the area so in terms of when
 

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.530
cheetahs in the area so in terms of when
if he's looking for any signs of her

01:20:38.530 --> 01:20:38.540
if he's looking for any signs of her
 

01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:40.180
if he's looking for any signs of her
daughter's and see written and naritai

01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:40.190
daughter's and see written and naritai
 

01:20:40.190 --> 01:20:42.070
daughter's and see written and naritai
and if they've been around but there's

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080
and if they've been around but there's
 

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.419
and if they've been around but there's
nothing else that's kind of followed

01:20:43.419 --> 01:20:43.429
nothing else that's kind of followed
 

01:20:43.429 --> 01:20:45.189
nothing else that's kind of followed
I've been looking to see because she

01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199
I've been looking to see because she
 

01:20:45.199 --> 01:20:46.750
I've been looking to see because she
kind of looked over his shoulder got

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760
kind of looked over his shoulder got
 

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.250
kind of looked over his shoulder got
nervous and ran southwards and I thought

01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:48.260
nervous and ran southwards and I thought
 

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:50.709
nervous and ran southwards and I thought
maybe there was some hyenas or maybe a

01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719
maybe there was some hyenas or maybe a
 

01:20:50.719 --> 01:20:52.300
maybe there was some hyenas or maybe a
you know a lion or something but there's

01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:52.310
you know a lion or something but there's
 

01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:53.979
you know a lion or something but there's
definitely not of keep looking kind of

01:20:53.979 --> 01:20:53.989
definitely not of keep looking kind of
 

01:20:53.989 --> 01:20:55.570
definitely not of keep looking kind of
where she's come from and there's

01:20:55.570 --> 01:20:55.580
where she's come from and there's
 

01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:57.850
where she's come from and there's
definitely nothing coming behind us so

01:20:57.850 --> 01:20:57.860
definitely nothing coming behind us so
 

01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:59.800
definitely nothing coming behind us so
maybe just the wind that's giving her

01:20:59.800 --> 01:20:59.810
maybe just the wind that's giving her
 

01:20:59.810 --> 01:21:02.470
maybe just the wind that's giving her
the the crazies and why she's running up

01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480
the the crazies and why she's running up
 

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:03.850
the the crazies and why she's running up
and down but I get that camouflage isn't

01:21:03.850 --> 01:21:03.860
and down but I get that camouflage isn't
 

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:06.129
and down but I get that camouflage isn't
that amazing so you can see why if she

01:21:06.129 --> 01:21:06.139
that amazing so you can see why if she
 

01:21:06.139 --> 01:21:07.570
that amazing so you can see why if she
hunted in this section could be a lot

01:21:07.570 --> 01:21:07.580
hunted in this section could be a lot
 

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:09.790
hunted in this section could be a lot
easier for her in many respects because

01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:09.800
easier for her in many respects because
 

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.770
easier for her in many respects because
she'd be able to move around quite

01:21:11.770 --> 01:21:11.780
she'd be able to move around quite
 

01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:13.959
she'd be able to move around quite
easily without really being seen if she

01:21:13.959 --> 01:21:13.969
easily without really being seen if she
 

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:15.729
easily without really being seen if she
just gets nice and low and she kind of

01:21:15.729 --> 01:21:15.739
just gets nice and low and she kind of
 

01:21:15.739 --> 01:21:18.580
just gets nice and low and she kind of
stalks that way she would definitely be

01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:18.590
stalks that way she would definitely be
 

01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:20.590
stalks that way she would definitely be
able to get herself into a much better

01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:20.600
able to get herself into a much better
 

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.810
able to get herself into a much better
spot to be able to hunt who is on that

01:21:22.810 --> 01:21:22.820
spot to be able to hunt who is on that
 

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:24.610
spot to be able to hunt who is on that
open area it would be a lot more tricky

01:21:24.610 --> 01:21:24.620
open area it would be a lot more tricky
 

01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:26.290
open area it would be a lot more tricky
but in saying that obviously we know

01:21:26.290 --> 01:21:26.300
but in saying that obviously we know
 

01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:28.270
but in saying that obviously we know
that sheets are don't spend a huge

01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:28.280
that sheets are don't spend a huge
 

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:31.750
that sheets are don't spend a huge
amount of time ambushing their prey so

01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760
amount of time ambushing their prey so
 

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:33.550
amount of time ambushing their prey so
they don't have to get as close as long

01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:33.560
they don't have to get as close as long
 

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:34.899
they don't have to get as close as long
as they can get within a certain

01:21:34.899 --> 01:21:34.909
as they can get within a certain
 

01:21:34.909 --> 01:21:37.450
as they can get within a certain
distance and they pretty happy to hunt

01:21:37.450 --> 01:21:37.460
distance and they pretty happy to hunt
 

01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:39.100
distance and they pretty happy to hunt
even in the most open sections and those

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:39.110
even in the most open sections and those
 

01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:40.870
even in the most open sections and those
five males are proof of that I mean they

01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880
five males are proof of that I mean they
 

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.850
five males are proof of that I mean they
hunt right out in the open but they do

01:21:42.850 --> 01:21:42.860
hunt right out in the open but they do
 

01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:44.470
hunt right out in the open but they do
also have the advantage of having five

01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480
also have the advantage of having five
 

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.600
also have the advantage of having five
of them which is always much easier when

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:46.610
of them which is always much easier when
 

01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:48.220
of them which is always much easier when
it comes to hunting and funny enough if

01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:48.230
it comes to hunting and funny enough if
 

01:21:48.230 --> 01:21:49.390
it comes to hunting and funny enough if
you're wondering about the five boys

01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:49.400
you're wondering about the five boys
 

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:51.580
you're wondering about the five boys
they actually been quite busy this week

01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:51.590
they actually been quite busy this week
 

01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:53.350
they actually been quite busy this week
they've been mating with a female and

01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360
they've been mating with a female and
 

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.600
they've been mating with a female and
poor females I feel sorry for her

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:55.610
poor females I feel sorry for her
 

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:57.189
poor females I feel sorry for her
because if you look into all the kind of

01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199
because if you look into all the kind of
 

01:21:57.199 --> 01:21:59.410
because if you look into all the kind of
photos and pictures of it you'll find

01:21:59.410 --> 01:21:59.420
photos and pictures of it you'll find
 

01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:00.260
photos and pictures of it you'll find
that there's

01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:00.270
that there's
 

01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:02.600
that there's
the scrum of cheetahs together and

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:02.610
the scrum of cheetahs together and
 

01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:04.190
the scrum of cheetahs together and
there's per female at the bottom of it

01:22:04.190 --> 01:22:04.200
there's per female at the bottom of it
 

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.020
there's per female at the bottom of it
and males are just kind of going crazy

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:06.030
and males are just kind of going crazy
 

01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:07.640
and males are just kind of going crazy
and a lot of the time when the psyche

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:07.650
and a lot of the time when the psyche
 

01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:09.130
and a lot of the time when the psyche
that is actually not really mating

01:22:09.130 --> 01:22:09.140
that is actually not really mating
 

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:11.240
that is actually not really mating
taking place even though you'll see five

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:11.250
taking place even though you'll see five
 

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:12.890
taking place even though you'll see five
of them on top of this female and all of

01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:12.900
of them on top of this female and all of
 

01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:14.660
of them on top of this female and all of
them are kind of trying to mate with her

01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:14.670
them are kind of trying to mate with her
 

01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:16.160
them are kind of trying to mate with her
what really happens is when they

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:16.170
what really happens is when they
 

01:22:16.170 --> 01:22:17.600
what really happens is when they
actually starting to properly mate is

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:17.610
actually starting to properly mate is
 

01:22:17.610 --> 01:22:19.220
actually starting to properly mate is
that they'll separate off slightly so

01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:19.230
that they'll separate off slightly so
 

01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:20.540
that they'll separate off slightly so
one male will go with that female

01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:20.550
one male will go with that female
 

01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:22.370
one male will go with that female
they'll then mate and then they'll kind

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:22.380
they'll then mate and then they'll kind
 

01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:24.320
they'll then mate and then they'll kind
of the males will rejoin and that female

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:24.330
of the males will rejoin and that female
 

01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:25.670
of the males will rejoin and that female
will go off but it's very seldom will

01:22:25.670 --> 01:22:25.680
will go off but it's very seldom will
 

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:29.000
will go off but it's very seldom will
you see all of them in a scrum face like

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:29.010
you see all of them in a scrum face like
 

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:30.650
you see all of them in a scrum face like
that that there's actually any serious

01:22:30.650 --> 01:22:30.660
that that there's actually any serious
 

01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:32.420
that that there's actually any serious
mating taking place it's it's more just

01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:32.430
mating taking place it's it's more just
 

01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:35.810
mating taking place it's it's more just
kind of the initial stages and all the

01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:35.820
kind of the initial stages and all the
 

01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:38.090
kind of the initial stages and all the
boys vying for position in order to get

01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:38.100
boys vying for position in order to get
 

01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:41.090
boys vying for position in order to get
themselves a female to be able to mate

01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:41.100
themselves a female to be able to mate
 

01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:42.260
themselves a female to be able to mate
with so it's quite an interesting

01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:42.270
with so it's quite an interesting
 

01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:44.630
with so it's quite an interesting
process and and I must be honest I wish

01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:44.640
process and and I must be honest I wish
 

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.460
process and and I must be honest I wish
we saw those five boys on the triangle

01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:46.470
we saw those five boys on the triangle
 

01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:48.200
we saw those five boys on the triangle
side it would be such a wonderful thing

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:48.210
side it would be such a wonderful thing
 

01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:49.670
side it would be such a wonderful thing
to see them but they don't come down

same direction to where we originally
 

01:30:57.150 --> 01:31:00.530
same direction to where we originally
started which is a long long long long

01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:00.540
started which is a long long long long

way away from where we are now the road
 

01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:06.440
way away from where we are now the road
is pretty distant so if you look on the

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:06.450
is pretty distant so if you look on the
 

01:31:06.450 --> 01:31:08.120
is pretty distant so if you look on the
horizon that's where the road is that's

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:08.130
horizon that's where the road is that's
 

01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:11.780
horizon that's where the road is that's
how far we've got to go off the road in

01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:11.790
how far we've got to go off the road in

01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960
so it has a titanium and abandon it's
 

01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:00.080
so it has a titanium and abandon it's
and so what I did is I thought well I'll

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:00.090
and so what I did is I thought well I'll
 

01:33:00.090 --> 01:33:01.489
and so what I did is I thought well I'll

be fine with it everything will be good
 

01:33:01.499 --> 01:33:04.100
be fine with it everything will be good
and then the little link broke and so I

01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:04.110
and then the little link broke and so I
 

01:33:04.110 --> 01:33:05.540
and then the little link broke and so I
went to try to get it fixed because it

01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:05.550
went to try to get it fixed because it
 

01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:07.370
went to try to get it fixed because it
broke halfway through the day and I went

01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:07.380
broke halfway through the day and I went
 

01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:08.779
broke halfway through the day and I went
to try get it fixed and they said they

01:33:08.779 --> 01:33:08.789
to try get it fixed and they said they
 

01:33:08.789 --> 01:33:10.850
to try get it fixed and they said they
couldn't fix it before my departure time

01:33:10.850 --> 01:33:10.860
couldn't fix it before my departure time
 

01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:12.950
couldn't fix it before my departure time
that evening and so my poor watch is

01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960
that evening and so my poor watch is
 

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:14.209
that evening and so my poor watch is
still sitting at the Judah and I'm

01:33:14.209 --> 01:33:14.219
still sitting at the Judah and I'm
 

01:33:14.219 --> 01:33:16.989
still sitting at the Judah and I'm
timeless should I say yes which is

01:33:16.989 --> 01:33:16.999
timeless should I say yes which is
 

01:33:16.999 --> 01:33:19.129
timeless should I say yes which is
depressing in many respects I keep

01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139
depressing in many respects I keep
 

01:33:19.139 --> 01:33:20.989
depressing in many respects I keep
looking and seeing no watching then

01:33:20.989 --> 01:33:20.999
looking and seeing no watching then
 

01:33:20.999 --> 01:33:23.120
looking and seeing no watching then
panicking and then what so randomly

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:23.130
panicking and then what so randomly
 

01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:24.169
panicking and then what so randomly
because you know the weight of a watch

01:33:24.169 --> 01:33:24.179
because you know the weight of a watch
 

01:33:24.179 --> 01:33:26.629
because you know the weight of a watch
is always kind of there and so I keep

01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639
is always kind of there and so I keep
 

01:33:26.639 --> 01:33:28.669
is always kind of there and so I keep
feeling like it's not it's too lights

01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679
feeling like it's not it's too lights
 

01:33:28.679 --> 01:33:30.200
feeling like it's not it's too lights
and then I don't panic because I think

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:30.210
and then I don't panic because I think
 

01:33:30.210 --> 01:33:30.479
and then I don't panic because I think
it's

01:33:30.479 --> 01:33:30.489
it's
 

01:33:30.489 --> 01:33:31.439
it's
falling off somewhere and then I

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:31.449
falling off somewhere and then I
 

01:33:31.449 --> 01:33:33.450
falling off somewhere and then I
remember no actually it's just being

01:33:33.450 --> 01:33:33.460
remember no actually it's just being
 

01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:36.299
remember no actually it's just being
fixed and that's I'll get it back when I

01:33:36.299 --> 01:33:36.309

thoroughly making sure that her scent is
 

01:35:58.120 --> 01:35:59.730
thoroughly making sure that her scent is
all over that piece of grass either it's

that applies to domestic cats as well as

that applies to domestic cats as well as
 

01:46:27.119 --> 01:46:29.270
that applies to domestic cats as well as
to the big cats I mean remember that

01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280
to the big cats I mean remember that
 

01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:30.709

we normally Drive and fold the
windscreen well then you get what is

02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320
windscreen well then you get what is
 

02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:53.780
windscreen well then you get what is
called a massive accident and the

02:06:53.780 --> 02:06:53.790
called a massive accident and the
 

02:06:53.790 --> 02:06:56.240

and so we've done that a few times and
 

02:06:58.560 --> 02:06:59.840
and so we've done that a few times and
broken them and that's why we do not

02:06:59.840 --> 02:06:59.850
broken them and that's why we do not
 

02:06:59.850 --> 02:07:01.580
broken them and that's why we do not
have windscreen wipers unfortunately

02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:01.590
have windscreen wipers unfortunately
 

02:07:01.590 --> 02:07:02.780
have windscreen wipers unfortunately
because otherwise you break them every

because otherwise you break them every
 

02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:04.160

when they had to leave the building and

when they had to leave the building and
 

02:46:55.930 --> 02:46:57.569
when they had to leave the building and
come out to the road and I used to pride

02:46:57.569 --> 02:46:57.579
come out to the road and I used to pride
 

02:46:57.579 --> 02:47:01.139
come out to the road and I used to pride
myself on getting it exact whether it

02:47:01.139 --> 02:47:01.149
myself on getting it exact whether it
 

02:47:01.149 --> 02:47:04.979
myself on getting it exact whether it
was 3 minutes and 15 seconds or whether

02:47:04.979 --> 02:47:04.989
was 3 minutes and 15 seconds or whether
 

02:47:04.989 --> 02:47:09.269
was 3 minutes and 15 seconds or whether
it was 40 seconds I used to count all

02:47:09.269 --> 02:47:09.279
it was 40 seconds I used to count all
 

02:47:09.279 --> 02:47:10.889
it was 40 seconds I used to count all
the way down until I got there and I

02:47:10.889 --> 02:47:10.899
the way down until I got there and I
 

02:47:10.899 --> 02:47:12.179
the way down until I got there and I
always managed to get it right

02:47:12.179 --> 02:47:12.189
always managed to get it right
 

02:47:12.189 --> 02:47:14.130
always managed to get it right
probably because I was the one doing the

probably because I was the one doing the
 

02:47:14.140 --> 02:47:15.809
probably because I was the one doing the
counting down and therefore could bias

02:47:15.809 --> 02:47:15.819
counting down and therefore could bias
 

02:47:15.819 --> 02:47:19.410
counting down and therefore could bias
that completely into the right direction
