individual amazing schools but this was
 

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:51.690
individual amazing schools but this was
about transforming a system and so that

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:51.700
about transforming a system and so that
 

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.070

school would be unlockable across a
 

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.140
school would be unlockable across a
larger system and and the school was set

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:58.150
larger system and and the school was set
 

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.360
larger system and and the school was set
up with supports from central office in

of it could be spread out across the

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:06.160
of it could be spread out across the
 

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.010
of it could be spread out across the
system the whole model could be taken to

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:08.020
system the whole model could be taken to
 

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.510
system the whole model could be taken to
other schools and that we could really

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520
other schools and that we could really
 

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.490
other schools and that we could really
have a spread of innovation across the

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:11.500
have a spread of innovation across the
 

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:15.030
have a spread of innovation across the
system and we started this an

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:15.040
system and we started this an
 

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.650
system and we started this an
environment that the Chancellor had

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:16.660
environment that the Chancellor had
 

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.720
environment that the Chancellor had
already set up where as principals we

already set up where as principals we
 

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:22.200
already set up where as principals we
had complete autonomy over what we could

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:22.210
had complete autonomy over what we could
 

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:25.440
had complete autonomy over what we could
do that we could teach you while we have

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:25.450
do that we could teach you while we have
 

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:27.150
do that we could teach you while we have
state standards how we address those

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:27.160
state standards how we address those
 

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.830
state standards how we address those
standards was completely up to us that

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:28.840
standards was completely up to us that
 

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.060

our job to find where we were getting
 

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:47.100
our job to find where we were getting
stuck and that they would move the

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:47.110
stuck and that they would move the
 

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:49.650
stuck and that they would move the
system for us so when we hit a block

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:49.660
system for us so when we hit a block
 

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.580
system for us so when we hit a block
with a state regulation we went to the

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:51.590
with a state regulation we went to the
 

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.320
with a state regulation we went to the
office and said we can't do what we know

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:53.330
office and said we can't do what we know
 

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:54.970

is another student's best interest and
 

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.279
is another student's best interest and
they helped us as much as they could to

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:57.289
they helped us as much as they could to
 

00:27:57.289 --> 00:27:59.380
they helped us as much as they could to
find workarounds for all of those blocks

00:27:59.380 --> 00:27:59.390
find workarounds for all of those blocks
 

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.019
find workarounds for all of those blocks
and then enabled us to come up with a

00:28:02.019 --> 00:28:02.029
and then enabled us to come up with a
 

00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:04.899
and then enabled us to come up with a
very unique instructional model our

00:28:04.899 --> 00:28:04.909
very unique instructional model our
 

00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:06.970

carbon network leader and I was just

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:52.660
carbon network leader and I was just
 

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.570
carbon network leader and I was just
wondering from a school design or

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:54.580
wondering from a school design or
 

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:57.090
wondering from a school design or
curriculum design perspective what

00:56:57.090 --> 00:56:57.100
curriculum design perspective what
 

00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:00.690
curriculum design perspective what
surprised you that you needed to teach

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:00.700
surprised you that you needed to teach
 

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.270
surprised you that you needed to teach
students and what I was thinking about

00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280
students and what I was thinking about
 

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.830
students and what I was thinking about
was you both of you mentioned that

00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:04.840
was you both of you mentioned that
 

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:07.230
was you both of you mentioned that
students were doing research did you

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:07.240
students were doing research did you
 

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.870
students were doing research did you
find that you had to do a lot of

00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880
find that you had to do a lot of
 

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.730
find that you had to do a lot of
research scaffolding for students or did

00:57:11.730 --> 00:57:11.740
research scaffolding for students or did
 

00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:13.110
research scaffolding for students or did
they know how to do that and the same

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:13.120
they know how to do that and the same
 

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.420

with teachers what skills did the

00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:15.430
with teachers what skills did the

teachers not have that surprised you and
it's a little bit different than just

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:19.450
it's a little bit different than just
 

00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:21.570
it's a little bit different than just
the technology because both of you

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:21.580
the technology because both of you
 

00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:23.340
the technology because both of you
talked about the pedagogy in terms of

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:23.350
talked about the pedagogy in terms of
 

00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:26.070
talked about the pedagogy in terms of
that the center of what the kids are

00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:26.080
that the center of what the kids are
 

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.680
that the center of what the kids are
doing is about thinking so just if you

00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:28.690
doing is about thinking so just if you
 

00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:33.390
doing is about thinking so just if you
can talk to that a little bit our first

00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400
can talk to that a little bit our first
 

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.760
can talk to that a little bit our first
big surprise was that our kids don't

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:35.770
big surprise was that our kids don't
 

00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:37.980
big surprise was that our kids don't
know how to read online that you give

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:37.990
know how to read online that you give
 

00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.990

text to make sense for comprehension and
 

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:52.340
text to make sense for comprehension and
you give them that same text online and

00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:52.350
you give them that same text online and
 

00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:55.070
you give them that same text online and
they have nothing and so we have to

00:57:55.070 --> 00:57:55.080
they have nothing and so we have to
 

00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:58.190
they have nothing and so we have to
teach 14 year olds who can read on a 14

how to read online and that takes most
 

00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:03.860
how to read online and that takes most
kids a few months to learn how to

metacognition and when teaching kids

00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:19.080
metacognition and when teaching kids
 

00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:22.310
metacognition and when teaching kids
online they have to learn at a much

00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:22.320
online they have to learn at a much
 

00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:25.430
online they have to learn at a much
higher level when they know something

00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440
higher level when they know something
 

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.530

00:58:55.110 --> 00:58:56.720
do teach research skills but I've never
been in a school where we didn't teach

00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:56.730
been in a school where we didn't teach
 

00:58:56.730 --> 00:58:58.370
been in a school where we didn't teach
research skills I mean I feel like we

00:58:58.370 --> 00:58:58.380
research skills I mean I feel like we
 

00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:00.650
research skills I mean I feel like we
have to we don't assume students know

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:00.660
have to we don't assume students know
 

00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:05.870
have to we don't assume students know
anything but they know I do it and that

00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880
anything but they know I do it and that
 

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:09.890
anything but they know I do it and that
we have to teach a lot um I think also a

00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:09.900
we have to teach a lot um I think also a
 

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:12.680
we have to teach a lot um I think also a
question about technology is it whenever

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:12.690
question about technology is it whenever
 

00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:15.320
question about technology is it whenever
you're hiring teachers teachers every

00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:15.330
you're hiring teachers teachers every
 

00:59:15.330 --> 00:59:16.970
you're hiring teachers teachers every
teacher even the best teacher we hire is

00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:16.980
teacher even the best teacher we hire is
 

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:19.730
teacher even the best teacher we hire is
going to need growth in some area and so

00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:19.740
going to need growth in some area and so
 

00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:22.460

as a school leader hiring teachers we

00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:22.470
as a school leader hiring teachers we
 

00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:23.870
as a school leader hiring teachers we
have to decide where do we want to focus

00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880
have to decide where do we want to focus
 

00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:26.930
have to decide where do we want to focus
our instruction with teachers and to me

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:26.940
our instruction with teachers and to me
 

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:28.940
our instruction with teachers and to me
it's much easier to teach a teacher how

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:28.950
it's much easier to teach a teacher how
 

00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:31.160
it's much easier to teach a teacher how
to use a smart board then it t is to

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:31.170
to use a smart board then it t is to
 

00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:34.610
to use a smart board then it t is to
teach a teacher to believe that kids can

00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:34.620
teach a teacher to believe that kids can
 

00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:36.230
teach a teacher to believe that kids can
learn from working together and

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240
learn from working together and
 

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:40.010
learn from working together and
struggling with a problem and learn that

00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:40.020
struggling with a problem and learn that
 

00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:43.580
struggling with a problem and learn that
way so we hire very much to a belief

00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:43.590
way so we hire very much to a belief
 

00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:45.740
way so we hire very much to a belief
about how students learn and then with

00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:45.750
about how students learn and then with
 

00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:46.820
about how students learn and then with
the notion that we will have to teach

00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:46.830
the notion that we will have to teach
 

00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:48.740
the notion that we will have to teach
them how to use the technology

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:48.750
them how to use the technology
 

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:50.510
them how to use the technology
integrate the technology and and in fact

00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:50.520
integrate the technology and and in fact
 

00:59:50.520 --> 01:00:00.140
integrate the technology and and in fact
that's for us much easier to teach hi my

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:00.150
that's for us much easier to teach hi my

using we're very interested to learn
more about that platform actually

01:02:31.550 --> 01:02:31.560
more about that platform actually
 

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.760
more about that platform actually
because I think it has a lot in mosaic

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:33.770

to that so that's I think that's the

01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:49.500
to that so that's I think that's the
 

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.990
to that so that's I think that's the
kind of the next generation platform

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000
kind of the next generation platform
 

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.990
kind of the next generation platform
