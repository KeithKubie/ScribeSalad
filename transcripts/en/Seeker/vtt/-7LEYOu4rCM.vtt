Do you have friends who are climate science
deniers? Well slap a smile on that face and

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.300
listen up, because we're here to help you
school 'em.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:13.010
[MUSIC]

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.089
Hey y'all, Trace here for DNews with all the
ammunition you need when someone cites the

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:21.710
severe winter we've had this year as the reason
there's no such thing as global warming. The

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.079
most important thing to get across, is TODAY
doesn't mean a load of bantha crap. It's TRENDS

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:34.320
that matter. CLIMATE is weather over time,
and as time marches on, the climate has changed,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.860
thus CLIMATE CHANGE. That change happens to
be a warming trend and thus why they call

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.550
it GLOBAL WARMING. Again, the WEATHER happening
TODAY doesn't tell us what's happened over

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.800
the last several dozen years. Though earlier
this year it was colder in Manitoba, Canada

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.000
than it was on MARS -- in Australia they're
getting the hottest temperatures ever! In

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.550
the same year, at the same time. So, rather
than quoting anecdotes and laughing, bring

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.980
the data.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.790
According to the University Corporation for
Atmospheric Research, we're experiencing more

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.310
record highs than ever before, indicating
we're on a warming trend. Not to mention the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.600
overall global temperature, which is currently
a balmy 57.9 degrees Fahrenheit (14.4 C) making

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.799
this year, globally, the eighth hottest year
on record, ALL of which have been since 1998.

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.210
Again, it's getting hotter.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.639
That alone might not convince a lot of people,
because most will hit back with disagreements

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:30.639
among scientists. This is when you mention
Albuquerque. From 1991 to 2012 there were

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:37.639
nearly 14,000 peer-reviewed published scientific
papers exploring climate science. 24 of those

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.340
said global warming is fake. To put it in
perspective, that's like saying every person

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.639
in the United States agrees with climate change,
except the population of Albuquerque. Silly

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:52.139
Albuquerque. If a movie had 98-percent approval,
would you go see it? There are more people

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:58.319
who hated Wall-E than there are climate scientists
denying climate change. Have you EVER met

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.679
someone who hates Wall-E?! Me either.

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.499
Keep smiling during your friend's talking
about how climate is cyclical, and we can't

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:10.450
possibly know because we weren't there. At
this point, you can throw them off by agreeing.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.870
Because they're right, climate IS cyclical.
100 million years ago the tropics stretched

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.390
from Alaska to Antarctica, then it cooled.
55 million years ago, it was hot again; temperatures

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.260
rose by 6 degrees celsius in 20,000 years
because of massive methane release -- then

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.780
it cooled again. And finally, a report by
NASA from 2012 says 20 million years ago,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.050
Antarctica had trees, and then it cooled.
All this is absolutely true. We're on a cycle

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.260
of boom and bust, like in economics, but based
on the study of fossil evidence, corroborated

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.610
by ice cores from Antarctica, the boom of
heat we're getting now is WAY faster than

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.510
it should be. Normally, barring an asteroid
impact, major volcanic ash cloud, or some

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.470
other global disaster this cycle is millions
of years long... So really, they're proving

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.540
your point, because we just came out of an
ice age 60,000 years ago, and unlike a slow

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.570
plodding increase in temperature -- in THIS
warming, the heating has sped up in the last

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.670
100 years.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.700
Finally, while your worthy opponent reels
from you showing them how their own evidence

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.280
supports your claims, make sure you mention
global warming isn't REALLY the best term.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.230
It's climate change. Because we have to look
at these changes over lifetimes, and while

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.420
YES the globe is warming -- it's ALSO going
to cool off, causing more snow, more ice,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.390
more drought, and, generally, more extreme
weather. Some lawmakers are pushing to change

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.500
the term to "global climate disruption," but
that's just a title. The important thing is,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.000
no one hates Wall-E, but until we learn to
work with nature, no one wants to live on

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.890
his planet either.
