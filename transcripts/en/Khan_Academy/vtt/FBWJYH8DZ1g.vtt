00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.500
- [Instructor] We are now going
to discuss price elasticity

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.040
of demand, which sounds
like a very fancy concept,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.090
but really, it's a way
for economists to sense

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.380
how sensitive is quantity
to change in prices.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.030
And in this video, we're gonna
denote it as a capital E,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.030
so E, price elasticity of demand.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.160
And the easy way to think about it is

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.670
it is your percent change
in, I'll use the Greek letter

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.230
delta as shorthand for change in here,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.610
percent change in quantity over

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.290
your percent change in price.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.240
And so, you might say,
wait, how does this relate

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.610
to the everyday idea of elasticity?

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.420
Well, imagine two bands.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.010
So, let's imagine an inelastic band,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.220
inelastic, right over
here, and let's imagine

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.323
an elastic band right over here.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.340
So, in an inelastic band, if
we apply some amount of force,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.940
you're not going to be
able to stretch it much,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.970
it might stretch a little
bit, while an elastic band,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.530
if you apply that same amount of force,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.150
you might be able to
stretch it a lot more.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.910
And so, the analogy here
is we're not using force,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.160
but we're saying how much
does quantity stretch

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.410
for a given amount of price change?

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.810
And so, something where
the quantity changes a lot

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.460
for a given price change
would be very elastic.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.800
So, this, the magnitude
of this will be larger.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.330
And if the percent change in
quantity doesn't change a lot

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.230
for a our given percent change in price,

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.300
well, then we're dealing with an inelastic

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.750
price elasticity of demand.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.480
And we'll be able to
internalize these more

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.030
as we work through the numbers.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.480
And actually, let's do that for this

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.670
demand schedule that we
have right over here,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.190
and it's visualized as our demand curve.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.260
In the vertical axis, we
have price of burgers;

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.140
and then in our horizontal axis,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.730
we have quantity, in
terms of burgers per hour.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.420
And so, let's just use
this definition of price

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.560
elasticity of demand to calculate it

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.540
across different points
on our demand curve.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.400
So, I'm gonna make a new column here,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.820
so price elasticity of demand.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.430
And the way I'm gonna do it is really

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.290
the simplest method for calculating this.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.360
In other videos, we can go into more

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.070
in-depth methods, like
the midpoint method.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.550
And I'll show you the weakness

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.060
in what we're doing right here.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.470
But for the sake of, say, an AP economics,

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.860
microeconomics course,
this would be sufficient.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.460
So, let's think about our
price elasticity of demand

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.340
as we go from point A to point B.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.510
Well, remember, that's just
going to be our percent change

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.770
in quantity over our
percent change in price.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.620
So, what is our percent
change in quantity?

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.490
Well, we're starting at a quantity of two,

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.840
so I'll put that in our denominator.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.780
And we're going from two to
four, so we are adding two.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.470
So, we have two over two, we could

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.100
multiply that times 100% if we like.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.150
So, this would give us, we
have 100% change in quantity

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.920
over, now what was the corresponding

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.530
change in price, percent change in price?

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.520
So, our corresponding
percent change in price,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.230
our initial price is nine,
and we go from nine to eight,

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.410
so we're going down by one.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.580
And then we multiply that times 100%.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.470
So, this is going to
be about a negative 11%

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.030
change in price.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.930
And this math is
reasonably straightforward

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.700
because the 100%s cancel
out, this is just a one.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.420
One over negative 1/9 is just going

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.280
to be equal to negative nine.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.280
So, you have a negative nine
price elasticity of demand.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.670
So, before I interpret that more,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.710
let's look at the price
elasticity of demand

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.010
at other points, or
starting from other points

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.720
to other points on this curve.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.840
So, let's think about it going from,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.400
actually let's think about
it going from E to F.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.160
So, as we go from E to F, we're going

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.770
to do the same exact exercise.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.130
What is our percent change in quantity?

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.320
Well, our initial quantity is 16.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.920
And we're going from 16 to 18,
so we have a change of two.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.550
So, two over 16 times 100%,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.840
that is our percent change in quantity.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.733
And what is our percent change in price?

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.823
Well, our initial price is two.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.170
And we're going from two to one,

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.170
so we have a price change
of negative one times 100%.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.430
And so, what you see here
is this is 1/8 times 100%,

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.740
this would be 12.5% up here.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.080
So, this is 12.5% up there, and then this,

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.330
over here, is going to be negative 50%.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.660
So, when price went down by 50%,

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.660
you had a 12.5% increase in quantity.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.920
12.5% is 1/4 of 50%, so
this is going to give us

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.950
a price elasticity of
demand of negative 0.25.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.130
So, there's a couple of interesting things

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.690
that you might already be realizing.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.350
One is even though our
demand curve right over here

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.210
is a line, it actually
has a constant slope,

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.510
you see that the price
elasticity of demand changes,

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.520
depending on different parts of the curve.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.340
Now, the reason why this is,

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.420
is really just boils down to math.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.260
When we're going from A to B,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.990
our initial prices were relatively high.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.240
So, even though you had
a price decrease of one,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.410
it was from an initial price of nine.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.670
So, your percentage change
in price looked fairly low,

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.670
while your percentage
change in quantity was high

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.920
'cause you're going from
a low quantity of two,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.210
and you're adding two to it,

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.520
so you had 100% change in quantity.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.130
When you go to the other end our curve,

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.620
and you go from E to F,
it's the other way around.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.070
Your price starting point is low,

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.050
so your percent change in price,

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.610
when you decrease price by one,

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.240
it looks like a fairly large magnitude;

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.920
while your percent change in quantity

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.170
when you go from E to F
because you are already

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.680
at a quantity of 16, adding two to that

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.880
is not that large of a percentage.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.680
Now, another thing you
might be appreciating

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.250
is if we tried to calculate
the price elasticity of demand

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.710
up here on the curve, and
instead of going from A to B,

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.400
if we went from B to A, we would've gotten

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.370
a different value because
our initial prices

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.150
and quantities would have been different.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.030
Our initial price, we would've
put an eight right over here,

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.210
and our initial quantity, we
would've put a four over here,

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.150
and we would've gotten a different value.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.560
And that's one of the
negatives of the technique,

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.060
which is arguably the simplest
technique, that I just used.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.430
There's other techniques,
like the midpoint technique,

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.360
that can give you a
more consistent result,

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.810
whether you're going
from A to B or B to A,

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.970
but I won't cover it just yet.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.010
But let's think, now, about
how to interpret this.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.700
And the best way to
interpret it is to think

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.200
about the absolute value of
the price elasticity of demand.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.710
So, over here, the absolute value of our

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.910
price elasticity of
demand is equal to nine,

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.620
and then, over here, the absolute value

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.620
of our price elasticity of
demand is equal to 0.25.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.380
And a general rule of thumb
is if your absolute value

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.810
of your price elasticity
of demand is less than one,

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:39.153
you are dealing with an
inelastic, inelastic,

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.090
elastic situation;

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.520
and if your price elasticity of demand,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.010
the absolute value of
it, is greater than one,

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.430
you're dealing with an elastic situation.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.740
Why does that make sense?

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.430
Well, in this first scenario, it's saying

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.180
for a given percentage change in price,

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.210
you have a smaller percent
change in quantity;

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.820
while here, for a given percent in price,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.150
you're going to have a larger than that

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.470
percentage change in your quantity.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.040
So, once again, it goes back
to these rubber band analogies.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.630
So, when we're going from A to B,

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.460
the absolute value of our
price elasticity of demand

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.040
is definitely larger than one.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.910
So, economists would consider this

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.550
to be an elastic situation;

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.990
while when we go from point E to point F,

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.630
our price elasticity of demand,

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:34.430
or the absolute value of it,
is definitely less than one,

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:39.123
so this going to be an
inelastic situation.
