00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.602
Solve for x and y.

00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:03.560
And we have the system
of equations right here.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.240
We have 2x minus
y is equal to 14,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.780
and negative 6x plus 3y
is equal to negative 42.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.850
So we could try to solve
this by elimination,

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.100
and let's see if we
can eliminate our y

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.040
variables first.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.530
We have a 3y here, and we
have a negative y up here.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.920
And they won't eliminate.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.100
If you just add negative y
plus 3y, that won't eliminate.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.310
But if we could turn this
negative y into a negative 3y,

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.320
then it would cancel
out with the 3y.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.840
And the best way to turn a
negative y into a negative 3y

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.330
is to multiply this
entire top equation by 3.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.310
So let's do that.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.580
Let me get some space
over to the left

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.080
Let's multiply this
entire top equation by 3.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.810
So I'm going to
multiply it by 3.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.620
So I multiply 2x by 3.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.110
I get 6x.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.930
I multiply negative y by 3.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.080
I get negative 3y.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.880
And then I multiply 14 by 3.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.330
3 times 14 is 42, right?

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.020
3 times 10 is 30,
plus 12, it's 42.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.410
And then we can add
both of these equations.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.330
Something interesting
should already maybe

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.550
be showing up on your radar.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.205
But let's add both
of these equations.

00:01:16.205 --> 00:01:17.880
Let's add the left-hand side.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.440
Negative 6x plus 6x?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.890
Well, those cancel out.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.080
We get 0.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.910
Then we have 3y minus 3y.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.890
Those cancel out.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.000
We get another 0.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.160
And then finally, you
get negative 42 plus 42.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.090
Well, that's a 0.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.230
So we end up with just
0 is equal to 0, which

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.470
is clearly true, but it's
not putting any constraints

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.810
on the x or y.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.640
And that's because whenever
you have a situation like this,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.160
where you just get something
that's obviously true-- 0

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.810
equals 0, or 1
equals 1, or 5 equals

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.970
5-- what we're dealing
in this situation

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.580
is where both of
our constraints,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.720
both of our equations, are
actually the same equation.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.195
So this right here is
a dependent system.

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:02.720
And you see it right over here.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.160
If you take that first
equation, you multiply it by 3,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.919
you got 6x minus
3y is equal to 42.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:13.620
If we then multiplied
it by negative 1,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.060
you would get the
exact same equation

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.860
as the second equation.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.560
You would get negative 6x plus
3y is equal to negative 42.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.950
Or another way to
think about it,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.670
if you want to go from
the first equation

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.860
to the second equation,
you just multiply

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.630
both sides of the
equation times negative 3.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.280
So both of these constraints are
actually the same constraints.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.960
They're just kind of a scaled-up
multiple of each other.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.560
So if you were to
graph them-- and I

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.800
might as well graph
them for you right here.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.840
This first equation right
here, let me do it over here.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.200
It's 2x minus y is equal to 14.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.020
You could subtract
2x from both sides,

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.030
and you would get-- let
me just subtract it.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.770
Subtract 2x, subtract 2x.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.820
On the left-hand side, you're
left with just negative y.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.710
On the right-hand side, you
have negative 2x plus 14.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.170
Multiply both sides
by negative 1,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.730
and you get y is
equal to 2x minus 14.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.610
So this first
equation over here,

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.890
if I were to draw my axes--
so that is my y-axis, and then

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.440
that is my x-axis.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.650
This graph right over here,
its y-intercept is negative 14.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.460
So this is 0, negative 14.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.190
And it has a slope of 2.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.200
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.559
It's going to look
something like that.

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:37.100
And then this second
equation, if you

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.960
were to graph it, because
this is a dependent system,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.606
it's the exact same line.

00:03:41.606 --> 00:03:43.980
If you were to put this in
slope-intercept form and graph

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.240
it, you would get
the exact same thing.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.650
It would go right on top of it.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.120
So there's actually an
infinite number of solutions.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.600
These two lines
are the same line.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.120
So they intersect everywhere on
each of the respective lines.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.839
They're the same line.

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:59.380
And when you get
something like this,

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.090
0 equals 0 or 1 equals 1, that's
the telltale sign that you're

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.990
dealing with a dependent system.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.360
If you got something
like 0 equals 1,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.990
then you would have no solution.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:17.741
So this one right here would
be an inconsistent system.

00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:19.074
And this would be the situation.

00:04:19.074 --> 00:04:20.282
So let me make it very clear.

00:04:20.282 --> 00:04:21.579
This is the situation.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.470
We're dealing with
the same lines.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.857
The lines are the same lines.

00:04:26.857 --> 00:04:28.940
This is a situation where
you have parallel lines.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.790
And so they never intersect.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.689
And then, obviously, you
have the easiest situation.

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.980
I think this is one most of
us are familiar with, where

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.724
you have something like x is
equal to 1, or y is equal to 2,

00:04:43.724 --> 00:04:44.640
or anything like this.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.880
It doesn't have to be 1 or 2.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.600
And then this is
clearly a situation

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.790
where you have an
independent system, where

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.690
you have two
different lines that

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.380
intersect in exactly one place.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.470
Anyway, this-- there's an
infinite number of solutions.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.780
Any x and y that satisfied
the first equation

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.700
will also satisfy
the second equation,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.498
because they're fundamentally
the same constraint.
