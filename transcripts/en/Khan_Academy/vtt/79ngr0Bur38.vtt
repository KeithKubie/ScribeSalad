00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.780
What we will talk
about in this video

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.910
is the product
rule, which is one

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.960
of the fundamental ways
of evaluating derivatives.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.570
And we won't prove
it in this video,

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.700
but we will learn
how to apply it.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.860
And all it tells us is that
if we have a function that

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.250
can be expressed as a product
of two functions-- so let's

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.960
say it can be expressed as
f of x times g of x-- and we

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.610
want to take the derivative
of this function,

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.270
that it's going to be equal
to the derivative of one

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.350
of these functions,
f prime of x--

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.530
let's say the derivative
of the first one times

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.400
the second function
plus the first function,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.900
not taking its derivative,
times the derivative

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.770
of the second function.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.120
So here we have two terms.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.560
In each term, we took
the derivative of one

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.220
of the functions
and not the other,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.470
and we multiplied the
derivative of the first function

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.800
times the second
function plus just

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.520
the first function
times the derivative

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.320
of the second function.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.890
Now let's see if we can actually
apply this to actually find

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.790
the derivative of something.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.700
So let's say we are dealing
with-- I don't know--

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.227
let's say we're dealing with
x squared times cosine of x.

00:01:12.227 --> 00:01:13.560
Or let's say-- well, yeah, sure.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.320
Let's do x squared
times sine of x.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.960
Could have done it either way.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.340
And we are curious about
taking the derivative of this.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.910
We are curious about
what its derivative is.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.710
Well, we might
immediately recognize

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.430
that this is the
product of-- this

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.880
can be expressed as a
product of two functions.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.320
We could set f of x
is equal to x squared,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.840
so that is f of x
right over there.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.175
And we could set g of x
to be equal to sine of x.

00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:45.050
And there we have it.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.054
We have our f of x times g of x.

00:01:48.054 --> 00:01:50.470
And we could think about what
these individual derivatives

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.140
are.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.520
The derivative of f of x is
just going to be equal to 2x

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.270
by the power rule, and
the derivative of g of x

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.920
is just the derivative
of sine of x,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.545
and we covered this
when we just talked

00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:03.600
about common derivatives.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.740
Derivative of sine
of x is cosine of x.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.250
And so now we're ready to
apply the product rule.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.260
This is going to be equal to
f prime of x times g of x.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.390
So f prime of x--
the derivative of f

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:24.260
is 2x times g of x, which
is sine of x plus just

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.360
our function f,
which is x squared

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.810
times the derivative of
g, times cosine of x.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.860
And we're done.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.430
We just applied
the product rule.
