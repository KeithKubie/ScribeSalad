00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.380
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carla Hayden: Good
afternoon and thank you

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.670
for coming and welcome to
the Library of Congress.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.970
I'm Carla Hayden.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.510
The 14th Library of
Congress and we're looking --

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.050
[ Applause ]

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.350
Thank you.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.650
And we're looking
forward to a very,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.590
very exciting afternoon
celebrating the 50th anniversary

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.360
of the signing by
President Lyndon Johnson

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.510
of the Public Broadcasting
Act of 1967.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.630
And we have four star
studded panel s in store

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.360
for you featuring
many great names

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.370
of public broadcasting
both in radio,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.680
on radio and in television.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.820
And I want to take this
opportunity to single out one

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.240
of our guests here today.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.540
His name is Mr. Henry
Morgenthau, III.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.550
And he said I could
tell you this.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.510
He is 100 years old.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:36.610
[ Applause ]

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.780
And he was working
at WGBH 50 years ago

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.800
when the act was passed and
his grandfather was Henry

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.500
Morgenthau, Jr. who was
FDR's treasury secretary.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.020
And I am proud to
say that the Library

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.640
of Congress has the
papers of his grandfather.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.580
And so sir, we are truly honored
that you are here with us today.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.380
Thank you.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.910
[ Applause ]

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.940
Many of you may know
that the Library

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.200
of Congress is the largest and
most comprehensive collection

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.830
of motion pictures, television
programs, radio broadcast

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.180
and sound recordings
in the world is honored

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.060
to host this event with WGBH,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.800
Educational Foundation
our collaborators

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.720
in the American Archive of
Public Broadcasting or AAPB.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.130
The Library received its first
public television programs in -

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.490
and at the Library of Congress
I get my centuries mixed up.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.480
1964 from the precursor to PBS,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.810
the National Educational
Television and Radio Center

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.290
and incidentally just last
month we digitized two

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.880
of these programs so that they
could be more accessible via the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.680
Library's website.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.590
Now the Library's public
broadcasting holdings have grown

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.600
exponentially since 1964 to
include tens of thousands

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.630
of film, video and
audio masters from NET,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.590
PBS, NPR, WNET and WETA.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.500
And in addition to the thousands

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.630
of access copies we routinely
acquire as copyright deposits

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.520
from public broadcasting
stations

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.430
and producers across the nation.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.490
And as the chief steward of
Americas and the World's Record

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.600
of Knowledge we took
to heart the television

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.030
and video preservation study
commissioned 20 years ago

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.730
by the Library of Congress,

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.950
which characterized
public television

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.220
as "the richest audio visual
source of cultural history

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.380
in the United States".

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.860
And so we are proud to
join with WGBH to ensure

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.680
that public television's legacy
survives for future generations.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.300
Now at this time I'd
like to make some news

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.300
and that's why I'm
kind of excited.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.060
I want to announce some
exciting new acquisitions

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.900
and projects related to public
broadcasting preservation.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.380
First of all, and as a Library
you don't get to break news

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.770
that often, so you news
people bear with me.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.360
I want to thank Mr.
Dick Cavett for donating

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.130
to the Library his collection,

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.510
ooh I heard a little
something going on.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.090
[ Applause ]

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.920
&gt;&gt; Mr. Dick Cavett for
donating to the Library

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.210
of Congress his collection
of approximately 2,500 shows

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:57.200
from 1968 to 1996, including
the 1,000 shows he made for PBS.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.090
He interviewed more than
5,000 guests for these shows.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.890
And the list is astonishing,
and a testament to his ability

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.630
to draw people not normally
seen on late night television,

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.490
Katherine Hepburn,
Alfred Hitchcock,

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.460
Angela Davis, Marlon Brando.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.660
And on one of the more memorable

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.510
and notorious shows Gore
Vidal and Norman Mailer.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.090
[ Applause ]

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.640
And he also featured rock and
roll musicians to a degree,

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.390
pretty unusual for the
time including John Lennon

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.610
and Yoko Ono, Jimi Hendrix,
Janis Joplin, David Bowie,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.090
Judy Collins and Joni Mitchell.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.050
So, I was pretty excited to
announce also that today,

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.780
the AAPB will launch an amazing
new exhibit on its website

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.270
that will make public
television's first coverage

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.910
of the senate Watergate
hearings available -

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.130
I'm breaking news all over.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.320
Television's full coverage

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.050
of the senate Watergate
hearings available online

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.720
for the very first time.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.520
This was one of the -

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.040
[ Applause ]

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.310
This was one of the
most popular series

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.180
in public broadcasting history.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.560
And the Library of
Congress has digitized all

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.280
of the master videotapes of the
coverage we received from WETA

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.010
in 1989 and with their
permission are making them

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.430
accessible online to
anyone in the United States.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.270
The broadcast created what Dick
Cavett has called Watergate

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.700
junkies, to refer to
himself and others

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.730
who watched the hearings
obsessively.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.010
The exhibit was created
this summer by a Library

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:05.400
of Congress junior fellow,
Amanda Ricobec, a history major

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.930
from Yale who is with us today.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.510
Could you please
stand up Amanda?

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:20.230
[ Applause ]

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.550
We sent the detailed background
essay she wrote to Jim Lehrer,

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.940
who anchored the coverage
with Robert MacNeil.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.990
Jim also is here today.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.980
And after reading the
essay he wrote back "It is

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.570
as terrific as it is accurate".

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.830
And two years after
hearings MacNeil

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.430
and Lehrer worked together again

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.350
on another landmark public
broadcasting program.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.140
I think you've all heard
of it and the rest of it is

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.290
as they say is history.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.130
Jim has commented
that without Watergate

00:07:54.130 --> 00:08:00.460
"there would have been no
anything called MacNeil Lehrer".

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.290
Jim will be on a panel later
today and will show a few clips

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:05.900
from the Watergate coverage.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.160
AABP also is in the process

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.910
of making available online
full interviews conducted

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.070
for a number of landmark
PBS series.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.040
Ken Burns' the Civil
War, Eyes on the Prize

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.410
and the definitive series on
the Civil Rights Movement,

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.670
Eyes on the Prize and the
American Masters Biography

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.660
Series and American Experience.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.400
So, they are telling me to get
off the stage because there is

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.140
so much more I could tell
you about the project,

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.980
but I've run out of time.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:45.110
So I want to think Ms. Patricia
Harrison, President and CEO

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.320
of the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting for their support

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.110
of the Library of Congress.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:52.750
Unfortunately we're learning

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.680
that Pat's flight has been
delayed and she won't be able

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.140
to join us this afternoon

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.510
but could you please give
her a hand in absenteeism?

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:07.040
[ Applause ]

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.230
And I'd like to introduce
Letitia King,

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.600
Senior Vice President of
Communications for CPB

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.510
to speak on her behalf.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:32.050
[ Applause ]

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.730
&gt;&gt; Letitia King: Thank you
Dr. Hayden and thank you

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.990
for your leadership and also for
hosting this important gathering

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.160
at the Library of Congress.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.130
I would like to recognize
Senator Markey and thank him

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.630
for his important support,

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:47.360
not only for his home
town station WGVH but also

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.210
for his leadership
advocating for and helping

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:54.510
to sustain a vital public
media system for all Americans.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:01.370
[ Applause ]

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.430
It is largely because of his
and others consistent support

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.900
of public media that we are
here today celebrating the 50th

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.340
anniversary of the
Public Broadcasting Act.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.430
The 1967 Act articulates
a vision

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.760
of a strong public media
service providing access

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.480
to every American to the
highest quality of educational

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.220
and informational content
for free and commercial free.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:30.620
The goal then as is now, to
strengthen our civil society

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.220
through content that
would result

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.540
in educated informed
and engaged citizens.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.460
The three pillars of
a vibrant democracy.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:45.770
From 1967 to 2017 the Act
continues to provide us

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.220
with an evergreen
mission and vision

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.750
for public medias important
role in American life.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.670
And one that the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting,

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.930
CPB is proud to advance.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:02.460
Because the Act created CPB and
designated us as the steward

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.260
of the Federal Appropriation,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.490
tasking us with insuring
these funds went

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.280
to public media stations
to serve underserved

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.430
and unserved communities,
from our youngest

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.840
to our oldest citizens.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.800
We are directed to utilize
technology and innovative ways

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.700
of connecting to new
generations to serve

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.260
as American's largest classroom

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.530
to help inspire life-long
learning and to invest

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.720
in journalism that is fact
based, in depth and committed

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.390
to editorial integrity.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:39.150
Today PBS, NPR and nearly
1,500 local public television

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.770
and radio stations in rural,
small town and urban communities

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.480
across the country are
fulfilling the mission

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.400
and vision of the
Public Broadcasting Act.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.630
Reaching 99% of an increasingly
diverse America with content

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:57.520
that continues to be a value
long after the initial broadcast

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.770
or digital presentation.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.670
Content that has cultural and
historical relevance provides us

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.440
with insights about
the way that we were

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.780
and about the way we
are now as a people,

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.700
as a civil society,
as a democracy.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.420
The value of this
content is priceless.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.840
But it was deteriorating and
would no longer be accessible

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.910
to future generations.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:26.100
That is why following a two
year pilot that began in 2009,

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:31.400
CPB provided almost $3
million in grants in 2011

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.240
to public media stations
so they could inventory

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.510
and protect their
station archives.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.350
That first step helped
to build the foundation

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.310
for the American archive
of Public Broadcasting.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:49.100
But CPB did not do this along
and we are appreciative of WGBH,

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.740
the Library of Congress
and many others

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.510
for their ongoing commitment
to this important initiative.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.690
So in addition to thanking Dr.
Hayden and Senator Markey I want

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.450
to thank Jon Abbott
the President and CEO

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.750
of WGBH for his leadership.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.810
WGBH is an innovative community
focused station providing public

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.600
broadcasting for New England

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.020
and is also PBS's leading
content provider, producer

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.950
and a major supplier of
programming for public radio

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.530
and digital content nationwide.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.920
Jon's leadership has resulted
in a strong partnership

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.520
with the Library of Congress

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.210
to preserve public
media's legacy content

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.150
through the American Archive
of Public Broadcasting.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.000
And we are so appreciative
of his commitment.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.800
Please welcome Jon Abbott.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:45.530
[ Applause ]

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:46.830
&gt;&gt; Jon Abbott: What a gathering.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:51.620
What an honor to be with so many
of these extraordinary leaders

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.260
through the history of
public broadcasting.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.560
Thank you Tish.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.780
Let me add my welcome to all
of you who have joined us today

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.040
for this extraordinary
meeting, this opportunity

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.560
to share these panels and these
reflections, this history.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.430
And my special thanks to
Dr. Hayden for hosting us.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.660
The Library of Congress
is a fitting location

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.040
to mark this milestone
for public media.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.170
As many of you know WGBH and
the Library came together

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:20.020
as Tish mentioned four years
ago to form the American Archive

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.670
of Public Broadcasting

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.550
to collect the significant
historical content created

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.680
by public television and radio
stations over these 50 years.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.440
Because of the vision and
support of Pat Harrison,

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.620
CPB and its board the American
Archive is preserving the

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.090
programs that witness
our collective history

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.840
and tell America's stories.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.070
More than 100 public
television and radio stations

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.350
across the country from Maine

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:51.190
to Guam have shared their
content with the archive.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:55.930
The collection now has over
50,000 hours of content

00:14:55.930 --> 00:15:00.270
and we are adding
25,000 hours every year.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.570
And in keeping with the mission

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:04.900
of public media the American
Archive is available directly

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:09.700
to the public with some
23,000 programs in addition

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:15.660
to resources available daily
for educators and researchers.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.880
WGBH is proud to be working in
partnership with the Library

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.250
of Congress to preserve
these historic treasures

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.070
and to make them available
for future generations.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.140
And I'd like to acknowledge our
dedicated American Archive team

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:33.510
Sue Canterwicz, Karen Cariani
and Casey Davis-Sucoughlin.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:40.670
[ Applause ]

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.400
And on this anniversary as
we celebrate the legislation

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.930
that created public
broadcasting,

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.710
we note with gratitude the
federal government's investment

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:53.340
in our work, consistent,
persistent and forward looking.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.600
For SGBH one individual in
particular of course embodies

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.310
that support and that is
our senator Edward Markey.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.880
Now he had very much
hoped to be with us today

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.740
and we're sorry he
couldn't join us.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.810
He has served on the advisory
council for the American Archive

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:11.880
and has served on the hill for
40 of the public broadcasting,

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.500
of public broadcasting's
50 years.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.250
He knows our work very well

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.820
and throughout he has been
a star work champion of all

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.790
that we aspire to do
for the American people

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:24.230
across the country.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.980
Our thanks to all of you for
being with us here today.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.650
I'm very much looking
forward to hearing

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:29.950
from our extraordinary group

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.610
of panelists assembled
for this occasion.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.140
So, I'll turn this back to
our host Dr. Carla Hayden

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.520
who may squeeze in a few more
releases of new information.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.360
It seemed like she -
she only got half-way

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.120
through her list I think,
which is very exciting.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.650
Dr. Carla Hayden to begin our
proceedings and thank you again

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.510
to the Library of Congress.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:59.500
[ Applause ]

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.720
&gt;&gt; Karen Cariani: Unfortunately
everybody Carla had

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.020
to leave, so it's me.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.750
You just get me.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.600
I'm Karen Cariani,
Senior Director

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.060
of the WGBH Media Archive
and the WGBH Project Director

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.310
for the American Archive
of Public Broadcasting.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.770
Alan Gevinson, my
esteemed colleague is

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.480
in the back managing our
audio/visual materials.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.600
He is the special assistant
to the Chief of the Library

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.140
of Audio/Visual Conservation
Center,

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.010
a Culpeper for the Library of
Congress and Project Director

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.810
for the American Archive
for the Library of Congress.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:28.110
So, welcome everybody.

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:30.340
Thank you so much for
being here celebrating our

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.640
50th anniversary.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.560
Our first panel is about the
origins of public broadcasting

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.930
and we're going to start it off
with a clip from Newton Minow,

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.590
because in many ways we
wouldn't be having this event

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.220
if it wasn't for Newton Minow.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.130
He serves on our
executive advisory council

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.850
for the American
Archive and this was -

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.990
he kind of planted the seed
for this event in our minds.

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:49.660
So, here we are and we're going

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.850
to roll a clip with
Newton Minow.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.690
He was the FCC Chairman
during 1961 to 1963

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:57.680
and very instrumental in
getting the Public Broadcasting

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.980
Act launched.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:04.200
&gt;&gt; Mr. Chairman hasn't something
happened this week speaking

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.680
about the government
and television

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.780
that has really revolutionized
the passing of this bill

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.100
for educational television?

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.160
&gt;&gt; Yes, the President
this week signed a bill,

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.710
which for the first time
will commit to federal funds

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:24.220
for the construction of
if you'll pardon the term,

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.470
educational television stations.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:29.370
And to link these
stations together.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:33.050
This will be the first time
that it's on a matching basis

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.760
with states and private
institutions.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.600
The federal funds, public
funds will be committed

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.420
with this purpose.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.340
I think it's a landmark.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.660
You know in many
countries the government

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.960
operates broadcasting.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.120
We've taken a different course
in this country of ours.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.480
We said that broadcasting
should be in private hands,

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.370
and the commercial side
for private profit.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.950
But in the public interest and
now we're hoping to develop

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:04.320
and build an alternative service
for those people who want it.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.100
&gt;&gt; Newton Minow: Wish I
could be with you in person

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.220
to welcome you to this
important anniversary.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.230
But in my 90's it's tough
to travel so I'm going

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:18.280
to communicate a little
history to you this way.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.310
What I want to do really
is to tell you a couple

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.920
of stories about history.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:32.590
My involvement really
stems 61 years ago.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:38.190
In 1956 during the
presidential campaign,

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:42.760
my roommate in the campaign
travels was Robert Kennedy

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:47.260
who had been sent by the
Kennedy family to learn

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.370
about national campaigns.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.430
They were looking
forward I think

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.880
to Jack Kennedy becoming
a candidate one day.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.900
And Bob and I were the same age,

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.250
so we were often
roommates on the travel.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:08.020
We got to Springfield, Illinois
and Bob turned to me and he said

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.750
"You and I have heard the
same speech 5,000 times.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.220
If we've got time to walk

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.670
over to Abraham Lincoln's
house so I could see it.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.920
I've never been in Springfield
and then we'll get back

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.220
in time to catch the plane".

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:26.220
I said, "It's only six or
seven minutes, let's go".

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.190
So we went over and
saw Lincoln's house

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:31.910
and on the way back
Bob Kennedy said to me,

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:37.770
he said "You know you and I each
have young children, families".

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:41.020
He said, "When I grew
up", Bob said, he said,

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:45.140
"I thought there were three
great influences on a child.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:50.620
The home, the school
and the church".

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.770
He said, "I realize now raising
my own children there's a

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.950
fourth, and its television".

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.760
He said, "My kids
are on television -

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.170
watching television, they're
fascinated by television.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.930
Can't we do something
to improve it?

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:08.320
Make it more educational
and informative for kids"?

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.630
Well that started
a relationship.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:17.270
Then four years later when his
brother was elected president

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:22.590
the day after the election I
got a call saying would I please

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.870
consider joining
the administration.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:30.870
And I really said no,
because I couldn't afford it.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.750
We had young children,
had no money.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:37.040
But they pressed and they
knew how interested I was

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.940
in television and they
offered me the job at age 34

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:45.720
of being Chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission,

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.270
how could I resist that?

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.580
We moved to Washington.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:55.950
The FCC had been in
a series of scandals.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.370
The place was a mess.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:01.790
And my job was to clean it up.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.220
The first day I was on the job,

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:09.110
the first issue I faced was
senate wanted our testimony

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:13.250
on a pending bill
to use federal funds

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:17.660
to help what was then called
educational television.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.310
My colleagues all
said, in other words

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.790
at that time there were
seven commissioners.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:25.680
They all said "No we don't
take a position on that".

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.150
I said, "Wait a minute,
our job here is

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.550
to protect the public
interest, certainly this is

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.350
in the public interest".

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:39.040
So by a vote 6:1 with my
single descent we testified

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.550
to the senate.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:43.720
I was the one who said
that we were very much

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.060
for this legislation.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.600
And I brought today something

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:55.100
that long preceded the public
television act of 19 - later -

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.950
this is the first act.

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:01.740
You see President Kennedy; I'm
sort of hidden in the background

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.910
with the senators
and congressman.

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.630
This was passed and
the President signed it

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.790
on May 1, 1962.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:15.390
President John F. Kennedy
signing the TV Educational Bill

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:21.060
Senate 205 on May 1, 1962.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:25.060
The - I was privileged
to do that in person.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:33.410
I realized I had come to the FCC
from Chicago where we had WTTW.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:36.110
President Kennedy had
come to the White House

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.800
from Boston, that was WGBH.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:45.040
Little did we know that there
was no public television station

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.810
in Washington DC, the
capital of the United States,

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.090
not in New York City,
the largest city

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:53.030
in the United States, not

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:57.680
in Los Angeles the largest
city on the West Coast.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.690
There were very few stations.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:05.510
So I felt the first thing we
had to do was get more stations

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.820
and the way we did that
was to pass two laws.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.670
One was called the All
Channel Receiver Act

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:15.730
which made television
sets have a UHF tuner,

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:18.940
which enabled news
stations to come on air.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.380
The other was to provide
some funding for communities

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.660
to build public television
station.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:31.370
So, we launched what later
became what is now today the

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.030
Nationwide system.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:35.740
We also helped public radio

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:40.020
which had preceded
television in any way we could.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:47.400
I always think that without
a station in New York

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.410
and without a station in Los
Angeles, without a station

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.110
in Washington it
would be impossible

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.630
to build a national system.

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:56.960
So, I'm very proud of that.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.670
President Kennedy
was very proud of it.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:03.590
And later when I
left the government,

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.270
went home to Chicago,
I became involved

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:11.930
in our local station WTTW,
later became Chairman of it.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.950
Public broadcasting
has grown and developed

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.870
because it was bipartisan.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:22.370
I tell our board here at WTTW

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:29.150
that the most important asset
we have is that the word trust.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:32.500
It doesn't show up in
a financial statement.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:37.960
But everyone trusts us, everyone
trusts PBS, everyone trusts MPR

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.670
as being honest and fair.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:44.380
And that's why it's so
important that now we archive

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.490
and preserve the great
things we've done.

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.330
We celebrate the
50th anniversary

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:54.510
of the Public Television Act.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:26:03.150
[ Applause ]

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:05.090
&gt;&gt; Karen Cariani: So if the
first panelist could come

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.460
up to the stage,
that would be great.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.020
In that first piece with Eleanor
Roosevelt was actually thank you

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.270
to Henry Morgenthau, it
was one of the programs

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.510
that he produced for WGBH.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:21.160
[ Applause ]

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.710
Our first panel is about the
origins of public broadcasting

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:25.990
and our moderator
will be Cokie Roberts.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.200
Cokie Roberts is a
political commentator -

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.500
&gt;&gt; Don't do all that.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.530
&gt;&gt; Karen Cariani: Please, please
I have it all written out.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:36.710
Well I'm dying to at least say
she was cited by American Women

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.790
in Radio and Television as
one of the 50 greatest women

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.390
in the history of broadcasting.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:43.150
And in 2008 the Library

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.640
of Congress named
her a living legend,

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.510
which we totally agree with.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:53.470
[ Applause ]

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:55.930
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts:
Well I am thrilled

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.060
to be moderating this
panel because this is one

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.970
of the rare times in my
life that I'm the kid.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:12.160
I joined NPR 10 years after
the Public Broadcasting Act was

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.210
signed, so I've been
there 40 years.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:21.000
And these gents preceded me as -

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.300
&gt;&gt; Pre-deceased you?

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.600
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: No, no, no.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.750
Not - I didn't say deceased.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:29.930
They were there at
the beginning.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.390
And so they each have a
wonderful story to tell.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.950
Ervin Duggan who is
immediately to my left was

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:40.470
in the White House at the
time that the bill was passed.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.050
And then has been very active

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:49.470
as both an FCC Commissioner
and as head of PBS.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:56.120
Nick Johnson was at the FCC
and a troublemaker all the time

00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:01.890
and did PBS programs
as well as columns.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:04.510
But was very involved
with public broadcasting

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.490
after he left the FCC.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.740
Bill Siemering was really
one of the founders of NPR

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.730
and was the creator of
all things considered.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:17.410
And Bill is still at it
running developing radio.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.030
He would be happy to
accept contributions.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:24.010
And so I think we'll
just start Ervin with you

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:25.980
and tell us what it was like.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.940
How did you get the bill passed?

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:34.300
&gt;&gt; Ervin Duggan: Well we had
Lyndon Johnson who was a master

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:38.370
of politics and there
is really a hidden story

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.400
about how this came about.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.350
And I hope that someday
a historian will delve

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.000
into what we call the
legislative task force.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.540
As much as the great society
legislation including the Public

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.850
Broadcasting Act was crafted
outside the White House

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:56.320
and even outside Washington.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.440
The Carnegie Corporation
Commission

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.510
on Public Broadcasting
for example,

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.140
the corporation headed
in New York.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:07.120
Johnson decreed and Bill Moyers
was I think the point man

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.420
on this.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.150
That the great society
legislation should be crafted

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:14.330
by these legislative task
forces in the universities

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.970
and the foundations
all across the country.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:20.690
This really accomplished two
things; it removed the process

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:25.140
of drafting policy from
the eyes of the press

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.740
and from the atmosphere
of partisan politics.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.970
It hid the process somewhat -

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:31.270
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: It was secret.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:33.770
&gt;&gt; Ervin Duggan: I would
call a benign secrecy.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:35.940
And I don't think the
history has ever been written,

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.020
but if you look at
the 15 members

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:42.640
of the Carnegie Commission
you see the man JC Kellum

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:47.290
who headed LBJ's
television stations in Texas.

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:52.250
You see a Texan Oveta Culp
Hobby, you see the President

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:53.880
of the United Auto Workers.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:59.090
Why? Because Johnson wanted
a tremendous lobbying push

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:04.330
and if the chairman of the UAW
in Detroit was one of the people

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.880
who crafted the idea
for the Corporation

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.280
for Public Broadcasting.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.610
That meant that the
immense lobbying power then

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:13.960
of the United Auto Workers
would be behind the bill

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.440
when it came to the hill.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:20.670
So, all of this was a part
of LBJ's legislative genius

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:24.010
and as I said earlier I hope
someday a historian will delve

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.540
into these legislative task
forces because it seems

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:27.870
to me one of the most creative

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:30.960
and really praise worthy
despite the secrecy,

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.650
one of the most praise worthy
things in that history.

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.940
And it's all a part
of a larger story.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.930
Were it not for the
dark cloud of Vietnam,

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:44.640
I think the LBJ presidency
would be remembered

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.460
as the new deal is remembered,
as a flowering of creativity

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.200
and positive legislation
on behalf of the well-being

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.500
of the American people.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.430
I see it - I see the
great society chapter,

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.900
which really ended at about 1967

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.850
after the Congress changed
its composition in '66.

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:07.240
I see it as the concluding
chapter of the new deal.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.310
Johnson told Bill Moyers on the
plane coming back from Dallas

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:12.020
that he wanted to
do all the things

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.990
that Franklin had
been unable to do.

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:18.830
And so there was this tremendous
election majority that brought

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:21.760
on the coattails into the
congress a tremendous working

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:26.790
majority and he used that
majority to pass Medicare,

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:31.710
more than 60 education bills
including the great corporation

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.770
for public broadcasting bill.

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:38.040
The other thing and Newton Minow
mentioned it was bipartisanship.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.130
The commission was made up
of Republicans and Democrats.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:46.230
The support on Capitol Hill came
from Republicans and Democrats.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.680
To this day if you look at
the trustees of the stations

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:53.000
around the country, when
I was traveling for PBS,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.740
speak to trustees and
fund raising dinners

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.170
around the country
for the stations.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.760
It was city arts and
business leadership

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.740
of every metropolitan
area in the country made

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.950
up largely of Republicans.

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.100
And what they could
be counted upon

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.950
when these periodic
outbursts of insanity occur

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:15.660
of misguided people wanting
to wound, they can't kill,

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:18.420
but wanting to wound
public broadcasting.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.930
These Republican trustees
from all over the country get

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:23.100
on the phone and say
"What are you doing"?

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.400
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts:
They're still doing it.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.700
&gt;&gt; Erven Duggan: They are.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.000
And we can count on that.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.440
John, Senator Warner then of
the previous Senator Warner

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.040
from Virginia told me once

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.980
that the Congress would never
kill public broadcasting

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.900
because it now is the
only way that a member

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.600
of Congress can get
on television

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.400
in his local community.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.480
And so I hope that they
are inviting their members

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.750
of Congress to appear
frequently.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:49.100
But I went to the White House

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.710
after the great landslide
of '64.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:58.100
A really sort of gopher for
Douglas Cader who was in charge

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.190
of shepherding the corporation

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:04.080
for public broadcasting
into realty.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.560
And our office in the basement

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.860
of the west wing really
became a sort of workshop

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.160
where the members

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.900
of the Carnegie Commission
first John Gardener

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.610
of the Carnegie Commission
and then Ellen Pfeifer

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:17.300
around the conference
table in the office.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.900
I would like to claim
some creative role in this

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.480
but I really was - I came

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.330
to the White House having
been a green reporter

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:26.440
for the Washington Post;
so I was a kind of gopher.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.300
But I was also a watcher.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.700
And what I watched was visionary
people doing amazing things

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.390
and it had a shaping influence.

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:37.090
It was a great graduate
school of my life.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:40.200
And my boss hated
to write speeches

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.400
and because I had been a
newspaper reporter he would

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.190
shove all the speech
writing off to me.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.890
And when we passed the
legislation and Johnson had

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:53.990
to make a speech, signing the
bill, I was given the task

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.290
of writing the speech.

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:58.150
And about 48 hours before the
speech was locked up and sent

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.650
into what was called the
presidents night reading,

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:05.040
John Gardner by now the
Secretary of HEW called

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.320
and he said "We need
to extend the vision

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.260
of this speech beyond
broadcasting and talk

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.500
about all public media".

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:19.150
And he didn't even know
what that meant at the time,

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:22.500
but he suggested language and I
want to quote a little bit of it

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.330
and then I will stop talking.

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:28.690
Because it is so prestian and so
visionary and so symbolic of all

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:32.270
that was going on in that
fertile period of our time.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:33.930
Right in the middle
of the speech,

00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:36.540
signing the bill
Johnson said these words,

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:40.470
"I want to create a great
network for knowledge.

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:44.390
Not just a broadcast system but
one that employs every means

00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:47.450
of sending and storing
information.

00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:50.210
Think of the lives
that this could change.

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:53.580
The student in a small
college could tap the resources

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.420
of a great university.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:57.030
The country doctor
could get help

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:00.240
from a distant laboratory
or teaching hospital.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.800
A scholar in Atlanta
might draw instantly

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.110
on a library in New York.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.250
Now all this is 30 years
before the internet.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:12.080
But suddenly the chrysalis
is beginning to form.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.730
And the creative vision of
a network for knowledge.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:20.420
The stations of NPR and PBS
have not always been receptive,

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.560
I'm sorry to say
to new technology.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.650
They are more on the
broadcast technology

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:26.980
and a station manager once
said to me when we were trying

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.700
to create PBS.org, "Every hour
that a viewer spends looking

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.910
at a computer screen is an hour

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:35.820
that he is not watching
my station".

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:39.190
And so there's been
a certain hostility.

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:43.140
But we know that right
there in the womb,

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.900
when the bill was
signed the President

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.310
of the United States was
envisioning something called

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:49.370
networks for knowledge.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:53.130
May that increase, may it
grow, may the commitment

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.970
of all public broadcasters

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:58.460
to public media flourish
in the future.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.190
But it was great fun to be

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:02.820
in on the beginning though
I can't claim anything other

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.120
than a gopher's role.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.050
But what a great thing we did.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:08.370
It is now embedded
in the culture.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:13.680
It is a part of American life
in the way that Medicare,

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:17.510
other great achievements
at that time are sewn

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:19.520
into the fabric of
American life.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.830
And heroes of that
movement are in this room,

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:25.510
may their tribe increase.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:33.040
[ Applause ]

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.670
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: So
Nick, what was the role

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:37.160
of the FCC in all of this?

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.460
&gt;&gt; Nick Johnson: Well I would

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.470
like to go back a
little further.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:42.380
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Okay.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.670
&gt;&gt; Nick Johnson: Since
I believe Mr. Morgenthau

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:55.130
and I are amongst the more - age
of experience you know and so -

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:56.690
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: The wise men.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:37:01.270
&gt;&gt; Nick Johnson: Well not
necessarily as we often see,

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:06.770
but to go back to
the 18th century.

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:11.410
Because there are other
presidents involved

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:14.350
in this besides Lyndon Johnson.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:18.000
With regard to whom I might add
an anecdote that he brought me

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.830
in February of '64 and
shortly thereafter a memo went

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.100
out to all presidential
appointees,

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.340
you may recall this
saying "I want you

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.820
to tell me what you think
would be in the best interest

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:36.160
of our nation with the area for
which you have responsibility".

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.210
And in my case at
that time it was ports

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:42.010
and ship building and shipping.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:45.000
He made me Maritime
Administrator,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.130
just exactly what
you would think a boy

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:52.070
from Iowa would -
the coasts of Iowa.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:57.330
The coasts of Iowa and - should
the experience be limited

00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:02.290
to operating a canoe on the Iowa
River but not very successfully.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:05.630
Something that thankfully the
commerce committee found fully

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.950
adequate to justify
the appointment.

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:15.250
But I think that's another thing
to say about Lyndon Johnson.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:19.930
That compared with
other presidents perhaps

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:23.450
who will go unnamed, that there
would actually be that focus

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:24.980
on what's in the best
national interest.

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:28.490
But I want to go
back to Madison,

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:31.690
who I just learned today is
referred to by those who work

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:35.770
at the Library of
Congress as Jimmy Madison.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:39.490
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: He was
Jimmy, spelled J-E-M-M-Y.

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:41.140
&gt;&gt; Nick Johnson: Is that
right, was it James Madison?

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.440
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Jemmy.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.740
&gt;&gt; Nick Johnson: I'll be darned.

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.040
What, did your father
tell you that?

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.230
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts:
No I write history -

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.480
&gt;&gt; Nick Johnson: He was a
great - they would be so proud

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.740
of you now and everything
you've done.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.570
No, I'm serious.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:56.620
Hale and Lindy Boggs,
great people.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:03.500
Well anyhow I wanted to
go back to Jemmy Madison,

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.720
however you spell his name.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.690
And there is an inscription
as you came

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:09.640
into this building
you may have noticed.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.000
And I'm going to link this
up with Thomas Jefferson

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.020
and then ultimately with public
broadcasting and try to do it

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.550
in five minutes or less
if that's all right.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:20.850
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: All right.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.150
&gt;&gt; Nick Johnson: Yeah,
let's less would be better.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.450
Less is more.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:27.360
Yeah. And it contains
this line "People who mean

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.040
to be their own governor's must
arm themselves with the power

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.260
which knowledge gives".

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.430
That's Madison's quote.

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:39.490
Jefferson and many
of you may know this,

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:43.940
but when writing his own
epitaph chose to be remembered

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:48.800
as the father of the University
of Virginia and made no mention

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.730
of the fact that he'd been
President of the United States.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:55.050
Now this is very
significant I think

00:39:55.050 --> 00:40:00.490
because what these folks
were doing was recognizing

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:03.510
and establishing
and making efforts

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:08.830
to maintain fundamental
pillars of democracy.

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:12.200
Many of which have
always been and continue

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.430
to be today under attack.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.710
One obviously is
extending the franchise

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:24.030
from originally white
male land owners over 21

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:26.890
to where now we even
let women vote.

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:28.880
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Took a while.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.630
&gt;&gt; Nick Johnson: It
did take a long while.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:38.770
And 18 year olds,
but then the addition

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:44.400
of free public education,
a fundamental element

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.260
and pillar of democracy.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:52.590
And then the idea of
independent media protected

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:56.160
by the First Amendment.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:01.120
For Jefferson also said
famously as you all know

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.920
and writing Edward
Carrington, "Were it left to me

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.610
to decide whether we should have
a government without newspapers

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:10.960
or newspapers without a
government I should not hesitate

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.830
a moment to prefer the latter".

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:16.520
And then went on in the
next sentence to say,

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.670
"But I should mean that every
person should receive those

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:22.630
papers and be capable
of reading them".

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:29.530
Again, tying it to education,
subsequently we added the idea

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:35.410
of free public libraries where
every American could have access

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:38.270
to the resources of kings.

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:42.810
And indeed, this library was
contributed to by Jefferson

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:47.370
in 1815 as you probably know.

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:52.950
Something that is often not
thought about in this context

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:54.930
but relates to what
John Gardener -

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:58.200
incidentally he wrote two
wonderful books - he wrote a lot

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:03.080
of stuff but that our paperback
books, one called Excellence,

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.530
one called Self-Renewal,
which I think are always worth

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:10.170
re-reading at least
every 20 or 30 years.

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:20.630
Because the other thing we did
was to establish reduced rates

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:24.530
for sending newspapers
and books and magazines

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:26.640
through the postal system.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:33.930
Subsidizing what was at that
time the communications network

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:39.050
of the 19th century
was the post office.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.880
And then we added telegraph
and telephone and so on.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:50.520
But that was how it began and as
all of you know the early time

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:54.260
of radio and I want to tell
just one story about Iowa City

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.610
and then I'm done, is that okay?

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:57.500
Yeah, all right.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:03.890
The early days of radio
involved numerous,

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:08.990
72 in the very early days,
educational institutions

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:12.460
that did not only the
technological work

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:15.320
of creating this box in
which little people lived

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:20.250
and could talk, but also the
programming and the focus

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:25.210
on the use of this as an
instrument of education.

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:29.640
Iowa City, Iowa from whence
I come, a city designated

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.170
by the United Nations as
one of three global cities

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:38.800
of literature, was created the
first educational radio station

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.270
west of the Mississippi.

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:44.410
That was in 1911, all right?

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:47.750
So this goes back before 1967,

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:51.860
for those who are younger
among us here today.

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:58.900
In 1971 WSUI became
a charter member

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:03.550
of NPR, one of the early few.

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:08.780
And one of the 90 stations to
carry the inaugural broadcast

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.520
of Bills, All things considered.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:17.770
In 1916 it began transmitting
educational content,

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:21.810
ultimately including my
father's lectures in the 1940's.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:24.440
By the last 1920's,
remember this,

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:30.890
1920's they had educational
television broadcasting

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:36.440
television images of
classroom content.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.710
A station that would
ultimately be one

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:44.220
of the founding stations
creating Iowa Public Television

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.510
and thus end the
reading for today.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:56.100
[ Applause ]

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.280
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Well Bill,
that nicely gets us to you.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.610
The fact is that we heard
all about educational TV

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:07.000
and even though radio came
before it was something

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.900
of an afterthought in terms
of public broadcasting.

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.470
And you are the person
who changed that.

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:13.120
&gt;&gt; Bill Siemering: It
was actually Scotch taped

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.620
at the last minute
onto the legislation.

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:18.320
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: And radio.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:22.620
It's like the Civil Rights
Law putting "and sex" in

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:24.690
and changing women's
lives forever.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:26.150
But so -

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:31.020
&gt;&gt; Nick Johnson: If I can note,
I took the position at that time

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:35.500
that we ought to forget about
television and start with radio.

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:39.790
You've got literally 10
times more for your dollar

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:41.670
with radio than with television.

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:42.970
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts:
That's still true.

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:44.270
&gt;&gt; Nick Johnson:
Really, that's right.

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:49.370
Build a really strong national
political base in support

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:53.470
of public radio that would
then clammer and demand

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:55.840
of Congress Public Television.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.330
But to start with Public
Television and under fund it,

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:04.000
I didn't think was the
right political move, Bill.

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:08.040
[ Applause ]

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.340
&gt;&gt; Bill Siemering:
Because you're all,

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:12.500
or many of you are
historians and we've -

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:16.540
the history of the university
is I'd like to just go back.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.730
A couple weeks ago I
was out in Madison,

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:21.280
Wisconsin celebrating
the 100th anniversary

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.920
of the oldest station in the -

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.600
the oldest educational
station, continuous -

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.680
&gt;&gt; Nick Johnson: But
east of the Mississippi.

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.200
&gt;&gt; Bill Siemering: That's right.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.530
We can arm wrestle
about this one.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:36.540
And tracing this back
to the university

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.060
because I think it
raises a good point.

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:44.130
About 11 years before radio
was invented the university

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.310
president of [Inaudible]
at Wisconsin said,

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:49.190
"I want the beneficence
of the university to be

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:51.690
in every home in the state".

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:55.260
And it became the motto of
the so called Wisconsin idea.

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:58.870
The boundaries of the campus
are the boundaries of the state.

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:03.720
And so that was the idea of
extending those resources.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.410
And at that time the
very first broadcast east

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:08.710
of the Mississippi

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:13.110
and educational station
was information to farmers,

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:18.760
weather information, 60%
were - 61% literacy rate

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.020
at that time in Wisconsin.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:25.280
And as just a side
bar Cokie mentioned

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.980
that I have an organization
developing radio partners

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:31.200
and we're working in Zambia
to improve the weather

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.930
and farming information where
the literacy rate is 61%.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:39.050
So, radio continues
to be used this way.

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:44.390
So anyway, that idea continued

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:47.510
and so the beginnings
really were there

00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:52.930
and I started my career in
public radio as an engineer

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:57.470
in 1952 working my way through
the University of Wisconsin.

00:47:57.470 --> 00:48:03.140
So, that's where I - my roots
are there and there was a center

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:08.090
for innovation and
audio invitation,

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:10.040
innovation and so on.

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:15.030
They're producing radio
plays by David Mamet

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:18.010
and Arthur Colpert and so on.

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:24.750
Anyway, it was that
experience that informed me.

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:26.820
I left there and was in Buffalo

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:31.430
and developed a store front
center broadcast facility

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:33.420
in the heart of the
black community

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:37.320
where 27 hours a week
came from that source.

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:40.410
So I was, at that time giving
voice or helping give voice

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:43.420
to folks that had no - there
were no people of color really

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:46.550
in media at that time.

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:49.490
And we had discussions
about race on air,

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:52.980
what is it like to be an
African American in our society.

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:54.280
I had done some -

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.580
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: What
year are we in now?

00:48:55.580 --> 00:49:00.510
&gt;&gt; Bill Siemering:
We're in 1964 and 1964.

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:02.970
And I did a series on
the Iroquois Confederacy,

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:06.860
some portraits of that - of that
culture, Nation within a Nation.

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:11.140
Anyway, so when I was tasked as
a member of the founding board

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:16.430
to write the mission statement I
felt very strongly about radio,

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:18.650
that our first meeting
with a corporation

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:19.950
for public broadcasting.

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:22.010
I was on the radio
advisory committee.

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:24.890
And John Macy said to us,
"Well you know, of course,

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:26.790
television has to go first".

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:29.990
Of course, television
always goes first.

00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:36.750
And I was really always
frustrated by this of course,

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:39.260
because - so I started a program

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.970
in Buffalo called
"This is radio".

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:45.380
This is radio dammit,
pay attention.

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.790
Look what - listen
to what radio can do.

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:51.120
I'm still saying the same
thing in development.

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:57.420
Anyway, so the task was to try
to, for me, differentiate it

00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:01.010
from the educational radio,
from commercial radio,

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:04.280
from PBS that was of
course up and running.

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:08.870
To capitalize on the strengths
of radio as a sound medium,

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:12.660
getting out of the
studio, telling stories.

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:18.180
And to be somewhat
aspirational but also practical.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.400
So that was what
I was trying to do

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.060
when I wrote the
mission statement.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:28.410
If you don't mind I'll just
read a few paragraphs of that.

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:31.610
National Public Radio
will serve the individual.

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:33.900
It will promote personal growth.

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:37.100
It will regard individual
differences with respect

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:40.940
and joy, rather than
division and hate.

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:44.530
It will celebrate the human
experiences infinitely varied

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:45.830
rather than vacuous [Inaudible].

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:49.090
It will encourage
a sense of active,

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:51.680
constructive participation
rather

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.030
than apathetic helplessness.

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:57.130
The total service
should be trustworthy,

00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:59.420
enhanced intellectual
development.

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:04.630
Expand knowledge, deepen
oral aesthetic enjoyment,

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:09.120
increase the pleasure of living
in a pluralistic society.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.440
And result in a service
to listeners,

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:15.090
which makes them more
responsive informed human beings

00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:17.610
and intelligent responsible
citizens

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:20.530
of their communities
and the world.

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:23.130
And then in the first
description of what became

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:25.740
of all things considered I said

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:28.500
that it would not substitute
superficial blindness

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:33.080
for genuine diversity of
regions, values and cultural

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:37.230
and ethnic minorities, which
comprise American society.

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:42.610
It would speak with many
voices and many dialects.

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:47.120
The editorial attitude would
be that of inquiry, curiosity,

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.050
concern for the quality
of life, critical,

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:54.650
problem solving and life loving.

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:57.050
The listener should come
to rely upon it as a source

00:51:57.050 --> 00:51:59.280
of information of consequence.

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.220
That having listened
has made a difference

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:04.560
in their attitude toward their
environment and themselves.

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.810
And then the concluding
paragraph for now,

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:12.400
philosophically time is measured
by the intensity of experience,

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.050
waiting for a bus and walking

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:17.380
through an art gallery may
occupy the same duration of time

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:20.910
but not the same
time experience.

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:23.190
Listeners should feel
that the time spent

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:28.350
with NPR was among their most
rewarding in media contact.

00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:32.750
National Public Radio will not
regard its audience as a market

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:35.670
or in terms of its
disposable income,

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:39.710
but as curious complex
individuals who are looking

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:46.510
for some understanding, meaning
and joy in the human experience.

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:58.250
[ Applause ]

00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:59.550
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Well

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:02.250
so now you have a good
sense of how it all began.

00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:05.650
And since these gentlemen
have been broadcasters we're

00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:09.870
finishing right on time at 3:00,
in time for the next panel.

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:11.670
Thank you gentlemen
very, very much.

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:16.150
[ Applause ]

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:17.450
&gt;&gt; Henry Becton: Good
afternoon everyone,

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:21.900
I'm Henry Becton the chairman of
the executive advisory council

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:25.000
for the American Archive
of Public Broadcasting.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.070
And when I arrived at WGBH Henry
Morgenthau was in his heyday

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:33.350
as an executive producer and
so he was one of my mentors.

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:37.560
And one thing that Carla Hayden
didn't have time to tell you is

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.690
that he still has
the urge to create.

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:42.200
He's just published
a book of his poetry,

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.130
his first book of poetry.

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:46.370
I've got a copy of it there
and what she didn't tell you is

00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:50.200
that this is actually a
stop on his book tour today.

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:54.700
It is my great pleasure to
introduce this next panel

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:57.330
and its moderator,
Judy Woodruff.

00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:01.510
One of our very special
colleagues in public media.

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:07.040
[ Applause ]

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.730
Judy began her distinguished
career

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:11.220
at the CBS affiliate in Atlanta.

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:14.960
And went on to be White
House correspondent for NBC.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:18.500
Was the host of Frontline
in its early days,

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:22.950
host of inside politics for CNN,
guest correspondent for NPR,

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:26.110
author of several books and
co-founder and chairperson

00:54:26.110 --> 00:54:28.560
of the International
Women's Media Foundation.

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.450
And along the way
has been honored

00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:32.760
by many distinguished
organizations.

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.850
So, thank you Judy for
helping us today and we promise

00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:38.380
to get you out of here
and back ready to prep

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.080
for the news hour tonight.

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.380
All yours.

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:43.510
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff: Henry
Bectin, thank you very much.

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:48.130
[ Applause ]

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:49.680
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff: Henry
Bectin of course being one

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:52.480
of the pillars of public
media for so many years,

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:56.230
Boston and the whole country
has so much to thank you for.

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:57.530
Thank you Henry.

00:54:57.530 --> 00:55:00.750
So I'm the lucky one now,
because I get to preside

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:05.180
over this panel of five
mega stars in public media,

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.900
the Pantheon of News
and Public Affairs.

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:11.890
Each one of them has played
an absolutely essential role

00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:15.320
in keeping public media,
public television and radio

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.490
at the center of American life.

00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:19.270
None of them needs
an introduction

00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:21.060
so I'm going to be very brief.

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:26.020
Starting with my mentor, the
man you just saw in that clip,

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:29.540
the former anchor and executive
editor of the News Hour

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:32.770
with Jim Lehrer and
before that the co-anchor

00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:36.110
and executive editor of the
MacNeil Lehrer News Hour,

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:41.430
the MacNeil Lehrer Report from
1975 until 2011, the face of

00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:46.570
and the singular driving force
behind daily journalism at PBS.

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:48.580
All of this following
a distinguished career

00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:50.510
in newspapers, Jim Lehrer.

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:58.060
[ Applause ]

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:01.460
&gt;&gt; He still needs a
haircut obviously.

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:03.870
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff:
Next my boss today.

00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:07.050
I don't feel any
pressure at all up here.

00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:10.630
The President and CEO of WETA,

00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:13.670
Washington DC's flagship
public television

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:17.190
and radio stations since 1989.

00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:19.950
Before that she served as a
member and chair of the board

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:23.650
of the corporation of public
broadcasting as well as a member

00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:26.930

the National Latino
Public Radio Network.

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:49.790
In 1976 he was the
moving force of a group

00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:53.890
of Latino farmworkers,
artists, activists and teachers

00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:57.920

00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:08.150
Someone who is already
been applauded here,

00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:12.270
the longtime host of the Dick
Cavett Show, over five decades.

00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:15.860
His remarkable career in
television has spanned networks

00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:19.660
from ABC, USA, HBO
and of course PBS.

00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:23.140
He's appeared in
movies, TV specials

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:25.510

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:35.690
And finally the aforementioned
living legend,

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:39.420
the woman who moderated
the last panel

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:43.630
with a mm-mm year background
along with me in broadcasting,

00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:46.950
political commentator for
ABC News and of course

00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:50.260
for NPR contributor to the
MacNeil Lehrer News Hour,

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:52.540
advisor to the American Archives

00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:55.510
of Public Broadcasting,
Cokie Roberts.

00:57:55.510 --> 00:58:01.040
[ Applause ]

00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.730
So what we're charged with
doing is looking at how news

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:06.460
and public affairs
came into being

00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:08.190
and how it evolved
in public media.

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:09.820
Jim, I'm going to
start with you,

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:12.100
you were there almost
at the beginning.

00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:15.470
When you came to Washington
it was all about Watergate.

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:18.270
We saw that clip, what happened?

00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:19.570
&gt;&gt; Jim Lehrer: Well
the Watergate -

00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:22.770
the Watergate hearings
really did -

00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:25.420
that was the water
shed event for news

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:27.880
and public affairs
on public television.

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.990
Up to that point the stations

00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:32.680
and the public was
generally divided

00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:37.220
over whether they even needed
any more news and public affairs

00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:39.770
on television beyond
what was already there

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:41.370
on commercial television.

00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:44.070
The Nixon Administration
particularly didn't think there

00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:46.910
was a need for any more
news and public affairs

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:48.470
on public broadcasting.

00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:49.770
But the Watergate -

00:58:49.770 --> 00:58:51.920
the Watergate hearings
changed everything.

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.490
And the reason it changed was

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:58.370
because there are several
individuals who had the courage

00:58:58.370 --> 00:59:00.110
to make some really
tough decisions.

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:03.650
And one of them was not to
necessarily broadcast them gavel

00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:05.450
to gavel because many

00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:08.610
of the stations would
not broadcast it live

00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:12.620
because they had educational
TV on during the day time.

00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:17.190
But somebody and I was part
of the mix of the somebody's,

00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:20.190
said "Why the hell don't
we run them at night?

00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:22.560
Repeat them at night"?

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:24.190
And that was a big, big deal.

00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:25.700
It was a big decision.

00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:29.400
And the people who were running
PBS were nervous about it

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:31.750
so they said, "Let's
poll the stations".

00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:34.950
So but we - we did
poll the stations

00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:37.450
but we polled the stations
in a very clever way.

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:41.420
We polled the stations with
a question that was kind

00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:45.570
of phrased in such a way
"Do you want to be patriotic

00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:51.980
or do you want to be a jerk" And
we still barely won a majority.

00:59:51.980 --> 01:00:00.890
But as MacNeil said at the time
and I quote him almost verbatim,

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:04.490
well the option - because it was
summertime and PBS didn't have

01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:07.810
that much to run at night anyway
- they had no original programs

01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:09.660
to run at night anyhow.

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:12.470
So he said, "Well
all they would run

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:17.940
if they didn't run the hearings
would be" - how did he put it,

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:27.010
English speaking people
talking, animals mating,

01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:30.810
and occasionally English
speaking people mating

01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:32.610
and animals talking.

01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:38.040
[ Laughter ]

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.960
So why not replace it with
the Watergate hearings?

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.970
That's why when I said 3:00
a.m., the hearings weren't going

01:00:44.970 --> 01:00:47.950
on till 3:00 a.m., that
was the repeat every night.

01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:50.530
We would do it live
all day but we only had

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:53.470
about maybe half the
stations were watching it,

01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:55.120
were broadcasting it.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:59.260
But at night the -
and it wouldn't -

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:03.900
it was the old story you know,

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:07.540
the big stations wouldn't
take it, but then they started

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:08.840
because the word got out

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.430
and then suddenly it
became a big deal.

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:16.700
And the big deal was that
it proved beyond a shadow

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:20.180
of a doubt that there was a
role for news and public affairs

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.530
on public broadcasting because
of those hearing and out

01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:24.380
of that came the news
hour and everything else.

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.680
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff: So
when you and Robin cooked

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.960
up the MacNeil - it was
MacNeil - Robert MacNeil report

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:31.450
and quickly the McNeil
Lehrer Report and then -

01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:33.060
&gt;&gt; Jim Lehrer: It began
as I said a million times,

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:35.760
it began with the worst title
in the history of television,

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:40.180
Robert MacNeil Report and I was
the Washington Correspondent

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:43.690
and then it became
-my mother interceded

01:01:43.690 --> 01:01:46.210
and it became the
McNeil Lehrer Report.

01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:49.530
It was one story a day for
30 minutes when we started

01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:51.760
and then - that was '75.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.500
And then in '83 it went to an
hour, became the news hour.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.800
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff: And
that's where I want to bring

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.680
in Sharon Rockefeller because
Sharon you were already active

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.040
in public broadcasting
and you knew what Jim

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.910
and Robert were trying to do.

01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:06.240
What were you up against when
they tried to go to an hour?

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.480
&gt;&gt; Sharon Rockefeller: The
stations in many senses.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.080
I was working - I was familiar

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.440
with West Virginia Educational
Broadcasting Authority,

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.970
not on the board at that time

01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:17.440
because my husband
wasn't governor.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.710
And that was a gubernatorial
appointment.

01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:25.070
At the time actually I asked
for one thing from my husband,

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:30.170
"Can I be appointed to the
WVEBA" and he said, "Yes".

01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:33.070
And no one ever thought
twice about it,

01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:34.570
but that was my training.

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:36.800
That's where I learned.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.500
But the Watergate
hearings actually,

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.720
I watched every single
day, all day long.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:45.940
Jay had lost an election by the
largest margin in the history

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:50.740
of the state in 1972, we
had four years in exile

01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:54.430
in Buckhannon, West Virginia,
three hours north of Charleston,

01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:56.730
three hours south of Pittsburgh.

01:02:56.730 --> 01:02:59.360
But an hour and a half from
the Morgantown West Virginia

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.330
University Station.

01:03:01.330 --> 01:03:04.280
So, when the Watergate
hearings were on in that,

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.060
I could not receive the
Washington Post by mail

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:12.060
until two days after
it was published.

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:14.600
I started watching full time.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.710
My kids were watching
Sesame Street.

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:21.710
I loved history, Adam's
Chronical, Masterpiece, but news

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:25.610
and public affairs was
my main attraction.

01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:27.510
It was what we had to offer.

01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:32.440
We at that point was
little old public television

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.790
and it was the turnaround.

01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:39.150
I also came on the WETA
board at the same time

01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:41.080
through another vehicle,
a friend of mine

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.470
on the Stanford University
Board, which had one woman

01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:47.040
on the board and I
was taking her place.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:52.080
She was the founder of - this
is in the 70's, lest we forget.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.380
She was the founder of
KQED, Caroline Charles,

01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:56.680
so she said "Where do you live"?

01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.650
I said, "West Virginia",
San Francisco, thank you.

01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:02.210
She said, "Where's that"?

01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:06.560
She said, "Is that
near the Dakotas"?

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:10.520
"Is it near the Carolinas".

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:13.070
But she knew Mrs. Campbell

01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:16.340
and she called her
immediately and I was 29.

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:19.540
She said "You have to
talk to this young woman".

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.060
I didn't know what about.

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:24.790
But Mrs. Campbell called me
in a very authoritarian way,

01:04:24.790 --> 01:04:28.810
"You must come to Washington
right now", which I did.

01:04:28.810 --> 01:04:32.090
I've always taken my orders
from Elizabeth Campbell.

01:04:32.090 --> 01:04:35.520
And that's how I got
involved with WETA.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.740
So I had a very small
[Inaudible] and at

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:43.730
that point WETA was not
as wealthy as it is today.

01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:48.020
It had a budget of 4 million;
now we're at 97 million.

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:50.030
But we've clawed our way up.

01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:52.030
And it's really through
news and public affairs.

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:56.320
The Watergate hearings put
public television on the map

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:01.170
and WETA and the News Hour,
which came about in 1983

01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:03.920
because we thought we
should be the first,

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.550
and that all stations were
going to go to one hour of news.

01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:13.720
In fact, they never did, we did
but we won, if you recall Robin

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.830
and Jim and I went around to
visit stations, speak to them

01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:21.730
and they didn't really want it.

01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:23.370
We did not want it -

01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:26.650
&gt;&gt; Jim Lehrer: We divided
up - we divided up the 300

01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:29.610
and some public television
stations

01:05:29.610 --> 01:05:34.730
and we called every station
manager or program manager

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:40.190
because Irv's successor
as president of PBS said

01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:42.720
"It's a great idea
to go to an hour,

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.610
but I don't have
the power to do it.

01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:46.360
You're going to have to
get the stations to -

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.660
get the stations to do it".

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:50.340
So we physically called
them on the phone,

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:52.210
and then there was a vote.

01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:54.500
We won by six votes.

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:59.150
To go to an hour and
out of 300 and some

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:02.230
and that felt like,
oh never mind.

01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:04.530
&gt;&gt; Sharon Rockefeller:
All you need is one more

01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:05.830
than the other guy.

01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:07.130
&gt;&gt; Jim Lehrer: Democracy won.

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:08.430
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff: And as
they say the rest is history.

01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:12.410
So, Dick Cavett, while all this
was going on in the daily news,

01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:15.970
daily journalism world, you
had a very successful career

01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:18.890
as an interviewer in
commercial television.

01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:22.040
What was the appeal
of public television?

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:25.490
&gt;&gt; Dick Cavett: Well I noticed
in something about today

01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:28.030
that among the things
that I thought might come

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:32.750
up would be the question
of why I moved my show

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:37.030
from network television to PBS.

01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:38.830
I was fired.

01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:44.060
[ Laughter ]

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.880
I hope that's not too
loquacious a way to put it

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:49.320
but that's pretty
much what happened.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:54.280
So opened the door, paved the
way, whatever cliché you prefer.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:07:00.790
It was a wonderful change
with network television.

01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:02.820
I was of course delighted
to get a show.

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:06.060
Terrified and very
nervous at first.

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:08.330
And the trouble there,
the kind that would come

01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:12.350
up on network so-called
non-public television

01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:15.270
so to speak starting
on the first day.

01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:19.110
I thought I had a
wonderful show,

01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:23.230
Present them is my first show
to be played about a week later.

01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:27.000
Mohammad Ali, Gore Vidal

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.710
and Angela Lansbury did a
wonderful talking lively show.

01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:36.500
And foolish boy from Nebraska
that I am, I went backstage

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:41.000
to be congratulated by
ABC Vice President sort

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.760
of shepherded the show.

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.170
And I saw his expression
didn't seem appropriate

01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:47.860
for a show that he loved.

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:54.880
I think it was worded "Who the",
let's say hell gives a damn,

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:59.210
that's a better word
"what Mohammad Ali

01:07:59.210 --> 01:08:03.330
and Gore Vidal think
about Vietnam"?

01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:06.660
Well obviously that had come up.

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:10.010
Second brilliant part
of his reaction was

01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:13.350
"We can't really air that as
the first show because of that"

01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:16.560
and "We're going to air
it as the second show".

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:19.590
And I seem to remember
saying "Are you going

01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:20.890
to be like this all along".

01:08:20.890 --> 01:08:27.190
And I saw agent Sam Kohn
wince over in the corner.

01:08:27.190 --> 01:08:29.720
And they did.

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.020
They did that.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:34.790
I did a second show that was
nice and we had them both

01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:37.840
and they aired the
second show first.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:43.150
And it got mildly
enthusiastic reaction.

01:08:43.150 --> 01:08:45.520
And then they aired the
first show the second night

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.680
and reviewers were
reviewing the whole week,

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:51.860
so almost everybody said
about the second show,

01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:55.510
"the Cavett show really found
itself on the second show".

01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:59.300
[ Laughter ]

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:02.770
I was sure that - the man who
had been waiting backstage for -

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:06.930
to congratulate me, got a
copy of that [Inaudible].

01:09:06.930 --> 01:09:11.150
So that sort of thing happened
and then there were other kinds

01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:13.250
of troubles that I
would not have gotten

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:17.030
on and didn't on PBS.

01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:20.440
One involved that
lovable old couple;

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:24.430
the John Lennon's
and they come on.

01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:26.650
And that was an event and
other people were jealous

01:09:26.650 --> 01:09:29.070
and the reviews were big
and the ratings were big.

01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:33.610
And that was nice, and
they even came back.

01:09:33.610 --> 01:09:36.880
John when I met him a week
earlier before the first one

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:40.190
said - I said, "Why do you
want to do this really?

01:09:40.190 --> 01:09:42.890
There can't be much you
need at this point".

01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:47.430
And he said, "You have the
only half-way intelligent show

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:48.730
on television".

01:09:48.730 --> 01:09:50.030
And I said, "Why
would you want to be

01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:53.300
on a half-way intelligent show"?

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.140
And he laughed as
many of you did

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:57.940
and we were friends
from that point on.

01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:03.330
But, on the second show who'd
have guessed the agreement had

01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:05.110
been that we would do
one of their songs.

01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:09.380
And John said, "Why don't
we do one of Yoko's songs"?

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:13.910
It had the catchy title "Woman
is the Nigger of the World".

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:20.320
And I thought are they kidding.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:26.670
By God, we did the song
and nothing happened.

01:10:26.670 --> 01:10:30.970
But, before it was aired I was
told that it would not be aired,

01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:34.710
the song, and I complained.

01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:37.630
And they said, "Well all
right, we will air it,

01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:40.100
but our decision is that
you will make a statement

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:46.160
beforehand" about the dangers
of watching it I guess.

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.990
I remember one of the -

01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:56.490
and there were 412 perhaps
protests about the song.

01:10:56.490 --> 01:11:00.630
None of them about the song
though, but as one woman put it,

01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:03.090
about that mealy
mouthed speech you made -

01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:07.110
delivered just before.

01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:10.050
By delivery sort
of encouraged that?

01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:15.280
So, getting to PBS was going
into a green meadow in a way.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.910
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff: Well
I want to hear more

01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:19.890
about the green meadow, but
Cokie I want to come to you

01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:21.380
because we heard Bill Siemering

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:25.030
and I think Ervin Duggan
both say words to the effect

01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:29.980
that they felt that NPR should
have had the early head start,

01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:32.390
early boost that PBS did.

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:34.180
Did you feel that
when you first went -

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:35.480
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Oh sure.

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.780
It's still true to some degree.

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:40.970
But it turned out to be a
blessing I think in the end;

01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:43.890
Bill could probably
talk about this more.

01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:49.240
That it was kind of a secret
at first because at the point

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.880
when Nixon did go
after television

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:56.650
and basically the television
network committed suicide.

01:11:56.650 --> 01:11:58.680
The NPR was still there.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.960
And there was no
necessity to disband it

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.050
because it wasn't on the radar.

01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:09.330
And so the ability to just grow

01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:13.750
and thrive was much
easier in that environment.

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:15.050
But then the growing

01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:18.630
and thriving became something
quite dramatic and as

01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:22.370
of today we are listened
to by more people

01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:24.910
than the three you know
morning editions listened

01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:29.690
to by more people than the three
network morning shows combined.

01:12:29.690 --> 01:12:32.270
It is listened to by more
people than anything other

01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:35.220
than Rush Limbaugh and
I keep saying you know,

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:37.700
Steve Inskeep should get
what Rush gets, right?

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:40.620
But because of the
different in ratings is

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:42.940
about a half million people.

01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:48.620
And so it is wildly successful
and really the primary source

01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:50.570
of news for millions
and millions

01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:51.870
of people around the world.

01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:53.480
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff: And
commercial radio has pulled back

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.500
from that dramatically
over the years.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:56.800
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts:
That's also true.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.100
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff:
Leaving a big opening.

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:01.310
So you Hugo Morales, you
were paying attention

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:03.520
to all this in California.

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:07.400
But you and some of your
friends decided there was

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.700
something missing.

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:10.000
What did you see?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.060
&gt;&gt; Hugo Morales: First
of all I was a little -

01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:17.120
at that time little or no news
on radio and that is true today.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:21.320
In Spanish language commercial
radio there is no news.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.540
I mean that sounds - we still
have [Inaudible] those of us

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:26.910
who believe in the
mission, but it's absent.

01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:31.470
I mean it's a shocking truth
that there is - there is no news

01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:33.360
in Spanish radio
except for [Inaudible].

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:39.310
And when we got started back
in '76, let's take the -

01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:45.600
we got started in 1976, but -
we got started on July 4, 1980.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:50.580
But 1980 the population
of Latinos in the US was

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:56.920
around 15 million which is about
6.5 % of the US population.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:03.670
Now it's 58 million and 185
of the population and 72%

01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:07.860
of Latinos speak
Spanish at home.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:11.310
So, this is not something
of the past, you know some

01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:14.110
of us were young at
that time, right?

01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:15.910
And that we had big dreams.

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:21.370
And - but rather something
that is very relevant today.

01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:24.790
And yet there is no news

01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:28.240
in Spanish language
commercial radio.

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.010
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff: Stunning.

01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:32.370
&gt;&gt; Hugo Morales: It is
very, very stunning.

01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:37.060
It's a story that some of us
don't want to perhaps believe

01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:43.270
but it is true and so back in
1976 when we started organizing

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:47.160
or I started organizing
Bilingue in Fresno.

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:52.500
It's a community that I came to
because I was born in Oaxaca,

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:56.570
and raised in Sonoma County
where the fires were recently.

01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:59.250
And then went to
the Silicon Valley

01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:01.490
because it was the largest
concentration of farm workers

01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:05.340
in the United States, which
is still it, is today.

01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:09.260
You know it's - in the amount
of people that I came in contact

01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.060
with they saw the same thing.

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:15.340
All these Chicanos,
Mexican Americans,

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:17.740
all of them were US
born except for me.

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.410
I was the only immigrant.

01:15:19.410 --> 01:15:24.680
And all of us were
bilingual and educated.

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:28.660
We were the first
generation of Latinos

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:31.980
to be open the doors
to higher education.

01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:35.720
So that contributed a lot to
why Radio Bilingue was founded

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:39.740
because we saw this
degree of limitation

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:42.100
of public broadcasting,
but not public -

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:45.380
just public broadcasting
but I mean you know,

01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:48.430
English language media
that we as Latinos,

01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:53.870
our families could not access
just because of the language

01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:56.840
and so - but it's not
just the language.

01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:02.920
The language and I see everybody
here you know there's much more

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:05.170
than the language, the
culture, the history

01:16:05.170 --> 01:16:07.600
and the nuances of language.

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.320
There's a literature,
there's a poetry,

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:11.520
there's arts, there's all that.

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:16.380
And that was absent in terms of
- and we as young people thought

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:20.120
"Well wow, it seems
like our treasures,

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.990
our community treasures,
our hidden treasures",

01:16:22.990 --> 01:16:26.610
we have so much you
know wealth of history.

01:16:26.610 --> 01:16:29.200
We have so much wealth of art.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.810
And so forth in our communities
and we should be able to share

01:16:33.810 --> 01:16:35.360
that and learn from one another.

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.310
So that's why we
establish Radio Bilingue

01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:41.680
in 1976 [Inaudible]
on the air in 1980.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:42.980
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff:
And it's still going.

01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:44.280
&gt;&gt; Hugo Morales: And
it's still going.

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.580
And we also believe of course,

01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:47.550
that public affairs
[Inaudible] had to be part of it

01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:51.430
because what we wanted to do
is just like in this situation,

01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:56.680
we wanted to us, as Chicanos,
Mexican Americans and Latinos

01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:01.050
to tell the story have our
own narrative to be inclusive.

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:02.350
I mean if you look

01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:05.310
at for example the
prison population today

01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:06.610
in the United States.

01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:11.250
You know something
like 1% of the

01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:15.070
in prison population
in the US is Latino.

01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:19.470
So a lot of our communities in
need, the highest dropout rates

01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:24.540
from high schools continue to
be Latinos in the United States.

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:27.900
And yet you see the figures
of how we are significant now

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:31.930
in number of - and we'll
project it to go even larger.

01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:33.550
So, that's when we
find it rather bleak

01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:35.040
because we wanted
that to happen.

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:39.340
So, we've been able to document
and follow some of the stories

01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:42.540
that some of the
other media have not.

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:49.000
For example there's a case
of indigenous woman living

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:55.590
in the south who was denied
you know, parenting her child

01:17:55.590 --> 01:18:01.510
at birth because she could
not communicate in English

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:06.940
or Spanish because she
spoke a native language

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:10.060
from my home state of Oaxaca.

01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:13.330
So it's that kind of a case

01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:18.190
where you some community
folks there

01:18:18.190 --> 01:18:21.950
from I think it was
Alabama called our station

01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:23.250
and told them the story.

01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:26.940
We broke the story and the
news media picked it up

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:30.530
and eventually she recovered
her child but that's the kind

01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:32.220
of stories that we covered.

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:35.590
Or, right now what's happening
is talk about the need,

01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:40.090
there's a lot of fear
among our families

01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:42.790
about you know deportations.

01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:46.610
And maybe to those of us in this
room it's just another topic

01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:48.770
but to people who listen to us

01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:52.620
or listeners it's
very, very personal.

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:54.620
I mean just I think
about a month,

01:18:54.620 --> 01:19:00.270
a couple months ago we had a
call from a mother, from Teresa,

01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:04.560
California, where we opened the
lines and also given information

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.090
that at that time the
opportunity to renew [Inaudible]

01:19:06.090 --> 01:19:09.790
and she was saying
that her son had gone

01:19:09.790 --> 01:19:12.450
into depression after
the election.

01:19:12.450 --> 01:19:14.800
He knew what was
about to happen.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.230
And he was a [Inaudible]
recipient.

01:19:17.230 --> 01:19:21.220
And he had quit his college
upon after the election.

01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:25.780
And soon later he quit his job.

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:28.460
So the mother was very
worried about her son

01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:30.000
and what was about to happen.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.340
So that's the kind of stories

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:33.370
and narratives that
are [Inaudible].

01:19:33.370 --> 01:19:34.990
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff:
You're touching stories

01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:39.370
of all American lives and
that's what public broadcasting,

01:19:39.370 --> 01:19:41.610
public media was founded to do.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:46.300
Jim let's talk next for a
few minutes about how hard

01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:50.260
or not it's been to survive
as public media as news

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:52.270
and public affairs
and public media.

01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:54.260
A lot of competition
out there, the news,

01:19:54.260 --> 01:20:00.320
the commercial news environment
has changed so drastically.

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:05.090
Why has public media remained,
news and public affairs remained

01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:07.040
as strong as it has
do you think?

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:10.530
&gt;&gt; Jim Lehrer: Well first of
all we - MacNeil and I said

01:20:10.530 --> 01:20:15.110
at the very beginning and
that if people started -

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:17.920
if commercial television came
along when cable started growing

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:21.690
in fact, particularly if they
started doing what we're doing

01:20:21.690 --> 01:20:22.990
we quit doing it.

01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:28.440
There's no point in our doing
what's available elsewhere.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:30.200
We'll go on and do
something else.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:34.630
And we had a lot of ideas about
the things that we could do,

01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:39.940
but as we sit here now
nobody is doing it right.

01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:42.500
And in fact there is more -

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:48.260
now more than ever they would
say the kind of journalism

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:52.080
that is practiced on the
news hour is more needed now

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:55.020
than ever before
because journalism

01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:59.760
on television has had its
own growth and its own kinds

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:04.300
of changes and those changes
have been away from the kind

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:08.990
of separation of straight
reporting from analysis,

01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:11.620
from opinion and that sort
of thing which is still true

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:14.320
of the news hour but not
true in some elements

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:18.560
of commercial television,
particularly cable television.

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:24.760
And so the reason for our
being, let's cut to the chase,

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.190
the reason for our
being is stronger now

01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:30.380
than it has ever been.

01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:31.680
&gt;&gt; Good point.

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:32.980
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff: I will
let that just sit there

01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:34.780
because I think it's right.

01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:38.220
[ Applause ]

01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:41.160
Sharon, as somebody who
has to look at this both

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:44.320
as you know journalists very
well, but you have to think

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:47.100
about it as a manager,
as an executive.

01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:51.510
How hard has it been to keep
news and public affairs going?

01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:55.110
And we should add, I mean you
- you over see the Ken Burns,

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:58.830
it's not just the news
hour and Washington Week.

01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:01.390
It's the Ken Burns
Show and many others.

01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:02.690
&gt;&gt; Sharon Rockefeller:
I think what's one

01:22:02.690 --> 01:22:03.990
of the things that's great

01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:05.380
about the public
television audience is

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:07.850
that it's pretty well educated.

01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:10.900
Above all, it continues
to want to learn.

01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:14.770
So keeping up on a daily
basis is important,

01:22:14.770 --> 01:22:18.230
but putting in context
weekly as we do

01:22:18.230 --> 01:22:21.780
on Washington Week
is very important.

01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:25.910
And history, the arts, science,

01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:30.320
kids all of the rest means we
serve so many different people

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.620
in so many different ways

01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:36.370
but our signature is the
news and public affairs.

01:22:36.370 --> 01:22:38.850
It's the hardest to fund and

01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:43.550
yet our membership money
essentially helps subsidize

01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:46.230
although we raise d a
lot for the news hour.

01:22:46.230 --> 01:22:49.080
We raised a good bit
for Washington week,

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.530
but we never make a profit,
let's put it that way.

01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:54.270
We always reinvest
in the product

01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:57.400
and could spend a lot
more than we take in.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:01.030
I think it is our
trademark, our signature.

01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:04.120
We're very proud of it and I
think our audience is proud

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:07.450
to be associated
with what we do.

01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:08.990
&gt;&gt; Jim Lehrer: But it's
always been difficult

01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:11.250
to keep it funded, always.

01:23:11.250 --> 01:23:15.900
We never had - we don't even -
the word surplus doesn't even -

01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:18.040
it's not even in our vocabulary.

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:22.000
We're always under - way over
- either over budget or having

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.200
to cut back and that's
been from day one.

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.820
And I hate to say this
but at the very beginning

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:33.750
when we first started which was
now 37-38 years ago there was a

01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:36.850
commercial television guy
named Marvin Kalb I ran

01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:38.150
into him socially.

01:23:38.150 --> 01:23:41.530
We'd been on the air a
year or two at that point

01:23:41.530 --> 01:23:43.720
and I didn't know Marvin Kalb.

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:46.540
And he said, "Well you
guys are doing things" -

01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:49.280
he said "Let me give
you a warning"

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.580
and I said, "Yeah what's that"?

01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:53.990
He said, "Don't let them
give you too much money".

01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:57.480
And I said, "That's
not a problem.

01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:01.030
But just for the hell
of it tell me why"?

01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:05.560
And he told quick story
and he had scads of them.

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:10.260
But one in particular
nightly news, CBS news,

01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:14.070
Czechoslovakia has been invaded.

01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:16.630
He was going to do a minute,
a minute and a half thing on

01:24:16.630 --> 01:24:19.100
and it's going to
be a major story.

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:21.050
They kept cutting it
back, cutting it back,

01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:23.820
cutting it back, and
about a minute before air

01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:28.110
or two minutes before air they
got some great fire footage

01:24:28.110 --> 01:24:29.730
from downtown Little Rock.

01:24:29.730 --> 01:24:34.740
Now nobody was hurt in the fire,
just great pictures of fires.

01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:38.350
And they cut his report
back to 20 seconds.

01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:41.410
And he said if they
hadn't had the money to buy

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:46.200
that fire footage I would
have had my minute and a half.

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:49.150
So it - and it was -
it stuck in my mind

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:51.170
because I just told
the story again.

01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:54.510
And - but - and McNeil
always said that too.

01:24:54.510 --> 01:24:59.120
If you get too fat and
sassy you'll - you will -

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:04.220
you'll do things that you would
do - you'll do things that you -

01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:05.710
that are not required.

01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:09.690
This way you're limited
by - money limits you

01:25:09.690 --> 01:25:12.280
to do what you must rather

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.490
than what you just
kind of want to do.

01:25:14.490 --> 01:25:16.630
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: In radio
that's really not true

01:25:16.630 --> 01:25:19.440
because what we're doing
is opening bureaus all

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.740
over the place.

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:24.170
And when we're living in
a world where what happens

01:25:24.170 --> 01:25:29.720
in Syntagma Square in Athens
affects your 401k then you need

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.620
to have more international
coverage rather than less.

01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:35.590
And of course more national
coverage understanding what's

01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:37.190
going on in this country.

01:25:37.190 --> 01:25:40.150
And so really the money goes

01:25:40.150 --> 01:25:44.780
to those very expensive
foreign bureaus which are very,

01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:50.310
very difficult to do but I would
argue essential in this time.

01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:53.700
And so we need all the
money we can get, thank you.

01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:59.170
&gt;&gt; Jim Lehrer: It's probably
a story I shouldn't have told.

01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:00.760
&gt;&gt; Sherry Rockefeller: Judy
the one thing I would say is -

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:05.610
sorry to interrupt, that
corporations in the early days,

01:26:05.610 --> 01:26:10.800
we went to AT&amp;T, etc.,
etc. without huge amounts

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.760
of money in retrospect.

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:15.690
That has diminished drastically

01:26:15.690 --> 01:26:18.590
but foundations have
really upped the ante.

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:22.440
And they understand, they're
more visionary, they have a lot

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:26.610
of money now and it's not
we've never had a surplus.

01:26:26.610 --> 01:26:31.110
But foundations and individuals
who support the program.

01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:34.180
We have, you know you
can give as an individual

01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:38.060
to support the PBS news hour,
which was never possible before.

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:40.910
But we're doing that in
a membership kind of way.

01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:46.650
&gt;&gt; Did the funding situation
effect the work you were able

01:26:46.650 --> 01:26:50.190
to do, do you think
in any way, you?

01:26:50.190 --> 01:26:52.250
&gt;&gt; Dick Cavett: I
recognized my name,

01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:56.480
but it wasn't - see
I like fires.

01:26:59.010 --> 01:27:02.060
What a story that is.

01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:06.640
I was never thoughtful
or thinking

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.450
about such things as funding.

01:27:09.450 --> 01:27:13.810
It's a bad habit sort
of frame of mind for me.

01:27:13.810 --> 01:27:18.570
And I had to be urged every now
and then to make a phone call

01:27:18.570 --> 01:27:20.500
or make an effort,
something like that.

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:24.640
But I was thinking of
shows that I was able to do

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:25.940
and people said,
"Oh you're going

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:28.930
under public television now,
that's for intellectuals".

01:27:28.930 --> 01:27:33.840
I - intellectual is a very
dangerous label to have put

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:37.000
on you when you're in
television whether it's public

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.550
or the other sort.

01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:44.080
But I remember appreciating
the fact

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:48.440
that ABC would have gotten a
little nervous when I would have

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:54.120
on England's great entertaining
performer, actor, philosopher,

01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:56.880
teacher, John - the
great Jonathan Miller -

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:59.370
one of the greatest
intellectuals in captivity.

01:27:59.370 --> 01:28:03.060
And would have him on five
nights in a row a couple

01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:06.050
of times and people wanted more.

01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:12.240
I can imagine trying to do
that elsewhere shall we say.

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:14.850
So, I really wasn't
conscious of funding in ways

01:28:14.850 --> 01:28:16.660
that probably were harmful to me

01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:19.070
because I'm sure I might have
been able to help with it

01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:22.950
if I had pitched
in in certain ways.

01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:24.510
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff: But
did you feel the freedom

01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:25.810
to do pretty much
what you wanted

01:28:25.810 --> 01:28:27.210
when you were working at PBS?

01:28:27.210 --> 01:28:31.420
Interview the people you
wanted and do the kind

01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:33.630
of programming you wanted to do?

01:28:33.630 --> 01:28:34.930
&gt;&gt; Dick Cavett: I did ; yes.

01:28:34.930 --> 01:28:38.200
I usually just did the kind
of program I wanted to do

01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:40.430
and in the [Inaudible]
I got away with it.

01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:43.470
I'm not aware of any
particular gripes

01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:45.860
of the sort I was
used to on ABC.

01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:51.440
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff: Well
good, we'll take that.

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:53.810
&gt;&gt; Dick Cavett: Am I
disgustingly happy?

01:28:53.810 --> 01:28:57.350
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff: I'm
going to come back to Hugo

01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:59.870
because I mean how do
you see this picture,

01:28:59.870 --> 01:29:01.170
question of resources?

01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:03.370
I mean how much of
an issue was it?

01:29:03.370 --> 01:29:04.870
Are you able to ignore it?

01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:09.180
I mean how does it affect
what you're able to do?

01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:10.480
&gt;&gt; Hugo Morales: Well
first of all I want to say

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:12.630
that is really, really
important that we maintain

01:29:12.630 --> 01:29:14.950
that independence of public
broadcasting whether it be

01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:16.250
on radio or television.

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:18.880
That's a value that
we always have shared

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:21.200
in something we have
to be militant about.

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:23.060
And that is true also
for Radio Bilingue,

01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:25.820
so how do you build
not just a station

01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:27.830
but in this case a network?

01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:29.890
We have [Inaudible] and
we have 60 affiliates.

01:29:29.890 --> 01:29:31.190
How do you build a network?

01:29:31.190 --> 01:29:33.880
What are you serving people

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:37.840
with literally no
disposable income, right?

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:41.370
I mean so it's - so part

01:29:41.370 --> 01:29:45.460
of it is the employees
subsidize the service in part,

01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:48.690
spend the history of public
television, public radio

01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:49.990
at least at the beginning.

01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:51.290
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff:
Subsidized how?

01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:54.670
&gt;&gt; Hugo Morales: Well
with salaries for example.

01:29:54.670 --> 01:29:57.460
For starters, and the
other is to be able -

01:29:57.460 --> 01:30:01.660
to keep those employees,
you know that's a real,

01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:03.320
real challenge for us.

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:07.340
But the other is that it's
foundations that have -

01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:10.750
we manage to attract
but as the competition

01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:15.960
for that has grown our
share of that has lower

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:19.050
for public affairs and for news

01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:21.240
and for information
from the foundation.

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:22.810
That's competition
for this [Inaudible].

01:30:22.810 --> 01:30:25.660
So it's really, really
difficult for us.

01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:30.430
And so I would say that -
that for news and information

01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:33.460
in Spanish [Inaudible] is
really, really difficult

01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:35.360
for us to maintain that.

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.660
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff: So that leads

01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:37.960
to my last question
for all of you.

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:39.940
How do you see the
future of news?

01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:42.940
The future of public affairs
in radio and television?

01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:44.830
Do you feel confident about it?

01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:48.290
I mean I like to feel
very confident about it

01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:50.110
because wherever I go I get -

01:30:50.110 --> 01:30:52.460
I hear good things
about the news hour.

01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:56.490
But what do you want,
what do you hear?

01:30:56.490 --> 01:30:58.220
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: I think
that one of the things

01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:02.540
that we're learning is that
Congress actually likes NPR.

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:09.750
And they can't always say it
out loud, but the truth is

01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:12.210
that it gets back to what
Nick was saying earlier,

01:31:12.210 --> 01:31:14.360
they're all - they're on.

01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:18.630
And it's in all of the districts
and it is the source of news.

01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:23.480
But of course the federal
funding is a tiny percentage

01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:24.780
of NPR money.

01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:28.260
It's really just for the
satellite, but the stations rely

01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:31.840
on it a lot particularly
the small rural stations.

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:35.160
And that's an important
thing to keep in mind

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:39.000
that these are people
who really are desperate

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.370
for this kind of information.

01:31:41.370 --> 01:31:45.660
And sometimes it's also the
only emergency signal, you know?

01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:52.470
All of that and so I think
that the fact of the service is

01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:57.670
so widespread and diverse and
so well listened to by people

01:31:57.670 --> 01:32:00.700
in all areas of American life

01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:02.900
that I feel very
confident about the future.

01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:06.010
But I do think it
requires resources.

01:32:06.010 --> 01:32:07.740
&gt;&gt; Sherry Rockefeller:
I was going to say

01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:09.870
that the last two
years, the last year

01:32:09.870 --> 01:32:14.300
and a half have proven more
than ever indeed for what we do.

01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:21.140
It is so complex, depressing
too many, hopeful to those

01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:22.740
who thought they
were electing someone

01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:24.670
who would stand for them.

01:32:24.670 --> 01:32:28.340
But the country is
changing so fast.

01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:31.660
The political system is
practically impossible

01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:33.490
to understand.

01:32:33.490 --> 01:32:37.410
We despair of being
ungovernable,

01:32:37.410 --> 01:32:41.380
but who brings some sense
and order and rationale

01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:45.810
to what happened today and
this week and this year,

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:52.620
plus analysis, plus thoughtful,
complex sensitive ideas

01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:55.010
about what might
happen in the future.

01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:58.700
We are doing that in a
way that nobody else is.

01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:02.770
And if we just stay true to our
mission, stick to the straight

01:33:02.770 --> 01:33:05.270
and narrow I think
we've got a great future

01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:06.570
in news and public affairs.

01:33:06.570 --> 01:33:08.370
&gt;&gt; I agree 100%.

01:33:08.370 --> 01:33:15.710
[ Applause ]

01:33:15.710 --> 01:33:18.970
&gt;&gt; Dick Cavett: I'm sorry,
two vaudevillians competing.

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.930
&gt;&gt; Jim Lehrer: I was
just going to say amen

01:33:25.930 --> 01:33:27.310
and add a couple of lines.

01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:32.890
The basic need for
the Free Press was set

01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:34.440
up by the founders.

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:39.060
And the key to our democratic
society is an informed

01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:41.020
electorate, an informed public.

01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:45.820
The only device that the
founders created by the -

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:48.430
through the first
amendment was the free press.

01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:50.930
That's the device for
people to get information

01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:54.910
to cast informed votes and
all levels of government.

01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:59.500
And we are - but we in
public broadcasting,

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:03.690
but we in journalism, we
who facilitate journalism,

01:34:03.690 --> 01:34:06.160
we who practice it and
we who participate in it

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:10.150
at any level are part
of a democratic process

01:34:10.150 --> 01:34:13.850
that is particularly critical
right now with this explosion

01:34:13.850 --> 01:34:17.330
of information that's
coming out, with the Tsunami

01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:20.140
of electronic this
and that gadget,

01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:21.440
and all this kind of stuff.

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:27.040
This is a critical time and I
agree with what Sharon said,

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:31.100
we must not lose sight
of what our purpose is.

01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:33.330
And it isn't about
making people laugh,

01:34:33.330 --> 01:34:35.800
it isn't about people
making - make them cry.

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:40.420
It's about keeping them
informed enough to function

01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:45.510
as informed people in this
country, informed citizens.

01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:51.050

01:34:52.350 --> 01:34:53.650
&gt;&gt; Dick Cavett: I
too agree with Sharon

01:34:53.650 --> 01:34:57.670
on that particularly in this -

01:34:57.670 --> 01:35:00.330
&gt;&gt; Jim Lehrer: You
don't agree with me?

01:35:00.330 --> 01:35:02.910
&gt;&gt; Dick Cavett: I'll
get to you in a second.

01:35:02.910 --> 01:35:07.820
As we are all living in this
sea - what's seeming time

01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:13.400
of plague certainly there
has to be the service

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:18.550
that only a public broadcasting
can do so well and can continue

01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:20.800
to be this great garden

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:26.000
of thrilling varied
wonderful things

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.640
that are not available
elsewhere on television.

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:35.440
They're still not
beholden and they are -

01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:39.550
public television is
still vital to our lives.

01:35:39.550 --> 01:35:43.510
It sounds corny but
I believe it.

not optimistic you can't speak.

&gt;&gt; Hugo Morales: I am
optimistic and I agree

01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:57.670
with this distinguished panel.

01:35:57.670 --> 01:36:03.410
And in terms of Spanish
language news and information.

01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:06.970
I think the need is there
for basic information along

01:36:06.970 --> 01:36:10.790
with news and information
to the Latino community

01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:16.180
and I think the future for
Spanish language mediais

01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:19.450
to be able to communicate
that informed, so thank you

01:36:19.450 --> 01:36:24.330
for the invitation or what the
reality is and the need for that

01:36:24.330 --> 01:36:27.570
because it's so critical and
so thank you very, very much.

01:36:27.570 --> 01:36:28.870
&gt;&gt; Judy Woodruff: So
critical, so critical.

01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:30.820
I just want to - I want to
thank all the panelists.

01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:34.710
But I also want to quickly read
a little bit of an an email.

01:36:34.710 --> 01:36:36.250
We, at the News Hour
got yesterday

01:36:36.250 --> 01:36:37.780
from our colleauge Jeff Brown

01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:42.490
who had been interviewing
inmates at San Quentin Prison

01:36:42.490 --> 01:36:43.990
for a story they're working

01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:46.710
on about a pod cast
they're producing,

01:36:46.710 --> 01:36:48.010
which is going ot
appear on the News Hour.

01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:51.160
But what I want to share with
you is Jeff wrote all of us

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:54.560
to say that several
dozen inmates

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:56.910
in different partsof the
prison, different places

01:36:56.910 --> 01:36:59.560
from different parts of
the country came up to him

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:04.450
and the crew while they
were there to say "Hey PBS,

01:37:04.450 --> 01:37:07.680
we don't know what we
would do without PBS".

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:19.210
But they went on to say how much
the program means while Jeff is

01:37:19.210 --> 01:37:22.970
interviewing an inmate in one
cell they can hear the program

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:25.520
in the next cell
being listened to.

01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:29.780
So, I just want to say that we
are reaching - we reach people

01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:32.380
in public media in every
corner of this country.

01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:34.800
We're not just in the
intellectual capitals

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:38.160
and the political capitals and
the places of great wealth.

01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:41.830
We are in parts of the country
where people are struggling

01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:43.900
and trying to get their
lives back together.

01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:47.070
And those are the stories
that we will always tell along

01:37:47.070 --> 01:37:49.670
with all the others, so
what an amazing panel.

01:37:49.670 --> 01:37:50.970
Thank you.

01:37:50.970 --> 01:37:53.570
&gt;&gt; Jim Lehrer: If they were
- some of those inmates were

01:37:53.570 --> 01:37:59.250
to join their local public
broadcasting it would be a

01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:01.900
wonderful funding -

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:04.430
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: I will
just tell you one quick story

01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:06.660
because it's so funny
but it gets

01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:09.240
to the excellent
point you just made.

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:11.890
At one point when Susan
Stanburg was the regular host

01:38:11.890 --> 01:38:15.980
of all things considered and she
took a leave to write a book.

01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:20.510
A farmer wrote to her and said
"My cows won't give milk".

01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:24.210
[ Laughter ]

01:38:24.210 --> 01:38:27.990
He was always going into
the milking barn and turning

01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:32.360
on all things considered and
they heard Susan and gave milk.

01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:35.240
And without Susan no milk.

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:38.510
So -

01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:50.060
[ Applause ]

01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:51.360
&gt;&gt; Karen Cariani:
Thank you everybody

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:52.660
and thank you to the panels.

01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:54.680
We're going to take
a short break now.

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:56.480
However, we hope you
will stay to watch some

01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:59.250
of the clips we've put together
to wrap up this previous panel

01:38:59.250 --> 01:39:02.920
and launch the next panel, which
is documentary style and use

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.950
of archives, which
will begin at 4:00.

01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:06.910
Thank you.

01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:10.650
So welcome back our next
panel is called documentaries,

01:39:10.650 --> 01:39:13.010
style and the use of archives.

01:39:13.010 --> 01:39:15.560
And Pat Aufderheide
will moderate.

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:18.420
Pat is a univeristy professor
of communication studies

01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:21.000
at the school of communicationat
American University

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.540
in Washington DC.

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:25.650
She founded the school cneter
for media and social impact.

01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:29.110
Her books include reclaiming
fair use, how to balance back

01:39:29.110 --> 01:39:31.310
in copyright with Peter Yazzie.

01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:34.000
She coordinates the Fair
Use and Free Speech project

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.370
at the center with
Professor Peter Yazzie

01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:38.460
of the Washington
College of Law.

01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:40.090
Pat, take it away.

01:39:40.090 --> 01:39:41.900
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide: What
a great pleasure it is.

01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:44.220
I feel like my entire
life is passing before me

01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:47.100
as I look around the crowd.

01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:49.250
But this - to be on a panel

01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:53.900
with these people is
really extraordinary.

01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:57.240
Each of the people
here has been able

01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:03.050
to not nearly make
great documentary.

01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:06.140
But create a future
for a different kind

01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:09.300
of documentary then was ever
possible on any other kind

01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:11.920
of television to be made.

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:20.190
And each of them has contributed
differently to - todoing that

01:40:20.190 --> 01:40:23.510
and also in some cases
supporting each other,

01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:26.520
which is really - doesn't
- I dno't want to know

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.820
if I'm giving away secrets here,

01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:31.470
but that doesn't always
happen in public television.

01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:35.350
Anyway, and I've had the
pleasure of working with some

01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:40.100
of these people as well
because as Karen mentioned

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:42.870
over the last decade Peter
Yazzie and I have been working

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:46.770
with different organizations to
make fair use more available,

01:40:46.770 --> 01:40:51.760
particularly in archival
ways to makers.

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.900
And public TV broadcasters
including some

01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:59.680
of these people have really
been incredibly supportive

01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:05.130
and early adopters in being able
to make better use of material,

01:41:05.130 --> 01:41:09.920
third party material
to tell America's story

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:11.820
in so many different ways.

01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:14.010
I want to start first
with Clayborne Carson.

01:41:14.010 --> 01:41:16.910
So Clayborne Carson
is the founder,

01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:18.990
director of the Martin
Luther King, Jr. research

01:41:18.990 --> 01:41:20.600
and education institute.

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:27.340
He was the senior advisor for
Eyes on the Prize at a time

01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:32.120
when no one thought
it could be made.

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:37.280
I would like to ask each of you
starting with Clayborne to talk

01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:43.290
about what - what - what did you
have in mind for these series,

01:41:43.290 --> 01:41:46.220
each of you have
this experience.

01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:51.400
The series that ended up really
providing a template for how

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:54.170
to do things in the future
for filmmakers and had -

01:41:54.170 --> 01:41:56.390
really hadn't been done.

01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:57.950
&gt;&gt; Clayborne Carson:
Well to start out one

01:41:57.950 --> 01:42:00.230
of the things that's so
interesting to listen

01:42:00.230 --> 01:42:01.890
to the previous panel is

01:42:01.890 --> 01:42:05.560
that you know just yesterday
I was lecturing at Stanford

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:09.030
to my students who
were born well

01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:11.060
after all this had happened,

01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:14.600
and I think that
they were telling me

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:17.730
about a period before
I came on the scene.

01:42:17.730 --> 01:42:21.110
And so I suddenly felt
young, younger in the sense

01:42:21.110 --> 01:42:26.100
that when I was - I got a
call from Henry Hampton.

01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:28.760
And, who should be here I -

01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:32.750
unfortunately passed
away way too early.

01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:37.090
But he was the visionary
of Eyes on the Prize.

01:42:37.090 --> 01:42:41.350
And I had just accepted
an invitation

01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:45.100
from Coretta Scott King to edit
Martin Luther King's papers.

01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:48.340
So, it wasn't like I
was looking for work.

01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:51.480
I - I realized that this
was going to take decades

01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:56.410
and it has taken decades to
edit and publish his papers.

01:42:56.410 --> 01:43:02.950
But what he was - he talked
about his idea for a series.

01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:06.210
And I think one of the
themes that I see running

01:43:06.210 --> 01:43:10.030
through all the discussions
this afternoon is

01:43:10.030 --> 01:43:14.630
about democratization
of information

01:43:14.630 --> 01:43:17.320
and the interpretation
of history.

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:22.690
Of the way in which ifyou think
back to the days before PBS,

01:43:22.690 --> 01:43:30.730
before NPR, before the
modern documentary style most

01:43:30.730 --> 01:43:34.270
information about the past
came from a few sources.

01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:42.470
If you saw a documentary
it was usually made by a -

01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:46.270
well they didn't have large
scale documentaries made

01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:48.900
by anything other than
large corporations.

01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:52.980
A lot of them, things
like CBS Reports,

01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:56.850
things like that were done
by the commercial networks.

01:43:56.850 --> 01:44:00.840
And what he was proposing was
to do something very radical.

01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:04.810
And that is to get away
from the notion of history

01:44:04.810 --> 01:44:09.570
as a master narrative told
by a handful of people

01:44:09.570 --> 01:44:11.900
and written in textbooks.

01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:16.210
And everyone kind of took
that as authoritative.

01:44:16.210 --> 01:44:18.830
One of the first things he
said is there's not going

01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:22.920
to be any what we now
call talking heads

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:24.920
in Eyes on the Prize.

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:29.560
That our job was not to
come there and pontificate

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:33.500
and the four of us who were
the senior advisors were all

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:34.800
really young.

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:36.880
And I don't think we
would have welcomed

01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:38.870
that role in the first place.

01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:42.330
But what our job was to go

01:44:42.330 --> 01:44:49.410
and find how history was made
during the 1960's, 50's and 60's

01:44:49.410 --> 01:44:53.690
and to go to the sources
and find those people

01:44:53.690 --> 01:44:55.530
and let them tell the story

01:44:55.530 --> 01:45:00.930
of how they made history,
not to interpret it.

01:45:00.930 --> 01:45:02.890
And that was a -

01:45:02.890 --> 01:45:04.190
&gt;&gt; It was a breakthrough -

01:45:04.190 --> 01:45:06.650
&gt;&gt; Clayborne Carson: It was a
breakthrough because even now

01:45:06.650 --> 01:45:10.190
when you look at documentaries
you see that many of them kind

01:45:10.190 --> 01:45:12.270
of go back to that notion

01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:15.580
by having the authoritative
historian kind

01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:18.380
of give this interpretation
that's going

01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:20.330
to guide you through.

01:45:20.330 --> 01:45:23.130
And - but there's
this other story

01:45:23.130 --> 01:45:28.300
of these ordinary
people who make history.

01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:33.390
And the real joy of
doing it was that for us

01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:39.230
as historians we were in our own
work, you know my first book was

01:45:39.230 --> 01:45:41.210
on the student on violent
coordinating committee

01:45:41.210 --> 01:45:43.100
which was not about King.

01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:45.920
It was kind of the
counter king story.

01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:50.550
So, I welcome that kind
of an approach and I think

01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:53.920
that has influenced
the documentaries

01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:57.310
that have been made since
then, that many of them do take

01:45:57.310 --> 01:46:01.130
up that maddle of
allowing ordinary people

01:46:01.130 --> 01:46:05.270
to tell the story
of making history.

01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:08.750
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide: And from
what you're telling is we'll net

01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:12.590
- so one characteristic of this
is ordinary people telling this

01:46:12.590 --> 01:46:15.740
story and also in
an oral history way.

01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:19.730
I mean there was so much rich
oral history that had not been -

01:46:19.730 --> 01:46:22.570
that would have escaped
us forever that was done.

01:46:22.570 --> 01:46:23.870
&gt;&gt; Clayborne Carson:
And now it's interesting

01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:25.640
because I could go
into my classroom

01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:31.910
as I did just this week
and use those interviews.

01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:34.600
I rarely use Eyes on the
Prize in the classroom,

01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:37.930
butI use the interviews that
we did for Eyes on the Prize.

01:46:37.930 --> 01:46:43.660
And often that works so much
better in the sense of it will

01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:44.960
like get it to the point

01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:48.380
where it fits what I
want to talk about.

01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:52.660
I want to talk about Coretta
Scott King for example.

01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:55.690
There's this wonderful interview
we did, extended interview

01:46:55.690 --> 01:47:01.400
with her that maybe we used
at most five minutes of it

01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:03.900
over the Eyes on the Prize.

01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:07.500
And I find that my
students are so drawn

01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:12.340
to the just seeing her
talk about ordinary things,

01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:17.850
you know what was it like
talking to the President

01:47:17.850 --> 01:47:22.770
of the United States when
your husband is in jail

01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:25.460
and you've never spoken
to him before and he calls

01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:29.730
on the phone, and your
young son answers the phone

01:47:29.730 --> 01:47:31.770
and starts babbling away.

01:47:31.770 --> 01:47:33.460
And you have to kind
of get him off

01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:35.750
and say the President is there.

01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:41.080
That kind of story is going
to get through and stick

01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:43.940
in the minds of students
far more

01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:48.320
than simply me giving a
lecture about Martin Luther King

01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:51.590
and going to jail and writing
the letter from Birmingham jail.

01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:52.890
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide: Something
else that I think was

01:47:52.890 --> 01:47:54.790
so important about Eyes
on the Prize in terms

01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:57.890
of standard setting was that
I think it was John Else

01:47:57.890 --> 01:47:59.660
but probably strongly
supported by Henry

01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:03.090
and others really arguing
that every single image had

01:48:03.090 --> 01:48:05.670
to be exactly what
you claimed it was.

01:48:05.670 --> 01:48:09.640
It couldn't be like something
that looks sort of like that,

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:11.840
which was very common.

01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:16.170
&gt;&gt; Clayborne Carson: Yeah
there was no reconstruction.

01:48:16.170 --> 01:48:21.400
We had to - and in fact that was
when - there's a story actually

01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:24.940
that kind of illustrates that.

01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:28.350
We were interviewing
Ralph Abernathy

01:48:28.350 --> 01:48:30.620
about the march on Washington.

01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:35.190
And he told this wonderful
story about coming back

01:48:35.190 --> 01:48:37.680
after that day at the March.

01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:43.370
I was there too and
[Inaudible] particular meeting

01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:45.210
when he talked about coming back

01:48:45.210 --> 01:48:47.870
after all the people
had departed.

01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:51.710
And in the evening seeing
the rustling of the -

01:48:51.710 --> 01:48:55.280
you know the papers and
all the leftover things

01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:59.380
and then he says it was
just the most beautiful day

01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:01.470
of my entire life.

01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:05.290
And I remember David
Garrow kind of saying

01:49:05.290 --> 01:49:10.300
that it couldn't have
happened that way.

01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:14.860
Why? Because we know where
Ralph Abernathy was every moment

01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:20.320
of that day and so we had
this debate about whether

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:25.300
to trust his recollection
as opposed

01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:28.590
to our historical
reconstruction.

01:49:28.590 --> 01:49:32.480
And we decided to use it.

01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:35.550
We said - history
might not have happened

01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:39.760
that way, maybe it should have.

01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:46.010
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide: Well let me
jump to David if you don't mind.

01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:50.490
Who I - I remember when he
was the brash young Australian

01:49:50.490 --> 01:49:51.790
who was here -

01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:53.090
&gt;&gt; David Fanning:
South African -

01:49:53.090 --> 01:49:54.390
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide:
South African, sorry.

01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:55.690
Sorry, you know us Americans,

01:49:55.690 --> 01:49:58.020
what's the difference
with other countries.

01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:00.220
&gt;&gt; David Fanning:
We draw the lines.

01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:01.920
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide: Brash
young South African here

01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:03.820
to bring us a whole new -

01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:07.590
new format that was
possibly too challenging

01:50:07.590 --> 01:50:10.340
for public television.

01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:11.640
&gt;&gt; David Fanning: You
know I'm a creature of -

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:13.380
I'm a baby of public television.

01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:16.330
I walked into a public
television station in 1973

01:50:16.330 --> 01:50:19.580
in Huntington Beach as a young
filmmaker from South Africa

01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:21.840
by way of London and the BBC.

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:24.930
And I walked in and volunteered.

01:50:24.930 --> 01:50:27.400
I got my hands on the tools,
that camera and that [Inaudible]

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:31.530
that were there and began
working with Peter McGee

01:50:31.530 --> 01:50:35.240
at WJBH found me ther ein
1977 and brought me to Boston

01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:38.220
to start a series called World,

01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:40.210
which was an international
documentary series.

01:50:40.210 --> 01:50:42.150
And the idea was to do a series

01:50:42.150 --> 01:50:44.750
about the world as
others see it.

01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:46.390
And it was this wonderful idea.

01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:48.680
I came to WGBH to
find a place that was

01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:52.650
as extraordinary institution
that was dedicated to ideas.

01:50:52.650 --> 01:50:55.070
And I had never been around
anything quite like it.

01:50:55.070 --> 01:50:57.610
It was also that each of
the people that were working

01:50:57.610 --> 01:50:59.900
in the different genre's
from science to history

01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:09.090
to even Julia Child who was in
the back corner of our offices,

01:51:09.090 --> 01:51:13.150
were doing things because of
they cared about the ideas.

01:51:13.150 --> 01:51:18.210
And it was extraordinary
privilege and it is to this day.

01:51:18.210 --> 01:51:21.850
This amazing privilege that the
reason there's a front line is

01:51:21.850 --> 01:51:26.540
because we were trusted with
enough resources for long enough

01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:31.050
to work it out, to try to figure
out how to do the best work.

01:51:31.050 --> 01:51:33.620
And the privilege of being
able to give that resource

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:36.780
and to say how you get to
spend it and justify it.

01:51:36.780 --> 01:51:40.120
And if you can't make the
best film you could make

01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:42.860
about this subject,
then don't make it.

01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:44.260
And it was as simple as that.

01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:47.550
It wasn't me, it was all the
talented people that I could go

01:51:47.550 --> 01:51:51.080
out and feret out and
bring to public television.

01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:54.490
I tried that out with
World, we did 60 films.

01:51:54.490 --> 01:51:58.770
And along the way but there was
a moment when I sat in a meeting

01:51:58.770 --> 01:52:01.340
at the corporation of public
broadcasting with a man

01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:05.950
who must be remembered Louis
Freedman was then the head

01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:11.560
of programming and
he walked into it

01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:15.030
and he said he was inundated
with thousands of proposals,

01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:16.930
and he just couldn't
sort through it all

01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:20.080
and he made a decision
to do three big strands.

01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:22.990
One was going to be drama and
it became America Playhouse.

01:52:22.990 --> 01:52:25.810
The second was childrens
and it became Wonder Works

01:52:25.810 --> 01:52:30.100
and the third was a news
and documentary idea.

01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:32.890
And I walked in with World
looking for a little bit

01:52:32.890 --> 01:52:35.840
of funding to do eight
shows for the next season

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:39.610
and he made me sit down at his
table with a sandwich and figure

01:52:39.610 --> 01:52:43.170
out what the budget for a 36
week series would look like.

01:52:43.170 --> 01:52:46.610
And we counted it up
to 3 million dollars

01:52:46.610 --> 01:52:50.740
at the time in 1970 - 1981.

01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:55.310
And we came up with that figure
and said we could probably do it

01:52:55.310 --> 01:52:57.880
for that much money; and he
said "Great I'm going to put

01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:59.350
out a request for proposals".

01:52:59.350 --> 01:53:00.650
And he put out proposals

01:53:00.650 --> 01:53:05.200
to various people including our
friends at WET or proposed it

01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:08.280
and we proposed it
and we got the money.

01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:11.200
And the guarantee was that
we would have the money

01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:12.770
for three years.

01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:14.930
If we could persuade
the stations

01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:16.760
to match the money progressively

01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:18.120
over the course of
the three years.

01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:22.040
It was a visionary idea and you
left us the freedom to do that.

01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:27.500
And we made our mistakes and
we you know, bumped our heads

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:31.450
and we did some good things
and we found some smart people

01:53:31.450 --> 01:53:33.140
and slowly this idea grew.

01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:37.790
It grew of simply that idea;
so to Lewis, to Peter McGee

01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:40.390
who found me on the beach in
Huntington Beach and brought me

01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:43.840
to Boston, you know are the
people I thank for Frontline.

01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:45.710
That's what made it happen.

01:53:45.710 --> 01:53:49.240
And it really has
been as simple as that

01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:51.270
and as complicated as that.

01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:52.570
And -

01:53:52.570 --> 01:53:53.870
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide:
Although Frontline has -

01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:58.880
it developed almost a brand that
you really did put your stamp

01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:02.740
on a kind of documentary
that became a style

01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:04.150
of making documentaries.

01:54:04.150 --> 01:54:05.450
&gt;&gt; David Fanning:
Well I don't know,

01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:06.750
you see I think there
were lots and lots

01:54:06.750 --> 01:54:08.220
of different styles
of films within them.

01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:10.900
They were observational films,
they were repertorial films,

01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:14.970
they were investigative
films, they were films

01:54:14.970 --> 01:54:18.720
like you know Marian Marzynski's
wonderful six hours called

01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:23.200
Shtetl and they were
extraordinarily different films

01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:24.500
that came about.

01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:27.300
And I always thought that
we needed to make a series

01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:31.450
that young and older
producers, reporters

01:54:31.450 --> 01:54:35.850
and filmmakers would look at
and say "I can learn from that".

01:54:35.850 --> 01:54:37.150
And the people who come to me

01:54:37.150 --> 01:54:38.840
and say "How do you
make these films?

01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:40.330
I'd like to get into
documentaries".

01:54:40.330 --> 01:54:43.820
I say just watch a lot of them
and try to deconstruct them

01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:47.200
and look for the different ones
that suit you for who you are

01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:49.280
and the kind of film you make.

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:51.880
Because ultimately these
are works of authorship.

01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:54.460
And if you encourage authors
and then encourage them

01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:56.650
because they do good work
by giving them another film

01:54:56.650 --> 01:55:00.420
to make then you begin to buid
a body of work at the time.

01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:05.830
And Frontline has intiially -
Judy was anchoring the series

01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:09.520
after Jessica Savage
in the first season.

01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:12.870
But there's a certain point
we felt like we would sort

01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:17.300
of take the extra time and
we began to use Will Lyman

01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:20.430
as a voice and we made
that strategic decision

01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:22.410
that you would hear this
- there'd be something

01:55:22.410 --> 01:55:24.810
in the quality of the
words or the qualitiy

01:55:24.810 --> 01:55:26.410
of the story telling
would say ah ha that's

01:55:26.410 --> 01:55:27.710
that different thing.

01:55:27.710 --> 01:55:31.790
That's that show and so
there was a value to that.

01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:34.630
There are people who
qustion that Will is kind

01:55:34.630 --> 01:55:39.750
of old fashioned and the
patriarchy and all kinds

01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:41.780
of reasons that black people
would say we should be using

01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:43.530
other voices, and we do.

01:55:43.530 --> 01:55:46.980
But ultimately you needed t have
some kind of connective tissue

01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:48.970
at times that would
hold a string

01:55:48.970 --> 01:55:50.720
through the sets of films.

01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:52.690
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide: So you're
arguing if you could have some

01:55:52.690 --> 01:55:56.970
of these marking features
then you could have a lot more

01:55:56.970 --> 01:55:58.920
freedom, artistic
freedom in other areas.

01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:00.220
&gt;&gt; David Fanning:
Freedom without it,

01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:02.090
but yet you'd still - there
would be something other

01:56:02.090 --> 01:56:04.390
than an anthology series
and the most important thing

01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:06.680
about it was it was going
to be a work of journalism.

01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:09.170
It wasn't going to be
an anthology series made

01:56:09.170 --> 01:56:11.820
by independent filmmakers
who would come to us

01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:13.690
with films pretty much
made and we would do -

01:56:13.690 --> 01:56:17.440
we would actually initiate
and we would subject them

01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:20.020
to the rigors of an
editorial process,

01:56:20.020 --> 01:56:23.950
which mean that the journalism
had to be transparent,

01:56:23.950 --> 01:56:27.180
we needed to go right into
it at any point and be able

01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:30.630
to understand the source
materials inside that film,

01:56:30.630 --> 01:56:33.570
and that was at the heart of -

01:56:33.570 --> 01:56:35.560
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide: Margaret
Drain, American Experience.

01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:37.390
&gt;&gt; Margaret Drain:
I also wanted to add

01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:41.110
that there is another binding
agent in front line and I think

01:56:41.110 --> 01:56:45.230
when I came to GBH I discovered
this because I had come from CBS

01:56:45.230 --> 01:56:48.620
where I worked at CBS
Reports and then a couple

01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:51.090
of iterations of magazine shows.

01:56:51.090 --> 01:56:57.380
And CBS Reports closed and
shut down because TV Guide.

01:56:57.380 --> 01:57:00.420
You remember TV Guide,
an artifact of the past,

01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:02.320
ran a front page story -

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:05.970
I mean a cover story saying
the documentary is dead.

01:57:05.970 --> 01:57:09.410
And this was in 1985 I think.

01:57:09.410 --> 01:57:10.710
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide: That's

01:57:10.710 --> 01:57:12.010
when documentary was
still a bad word.

01:57:12.010 --> 01:57:13.310
&gt;&gt; Margaret Drain:
It was a bad word.

01:57:13.310 --> 01:57:16.280
So everybody went scurrying
and I got a great job offer

01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:22.130
from WGBH again from Peter McGee
who really needs to be mentioned

01:57:22.130 --> 01:57:25.260
as many times as
posisble because he sort

01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:28.450
of set the standards at WGBH.

01:57:28.450 --> 01:57:33.360
And they wanted - Peter and
Judy Clayton was the original

01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:37.690
executive producer, wanted
to do a history series

01:57:37.690 --> 01:57:39.670
but the binding agent

01:57:39.670 --> 01:57:42.770
in the history series
was good story telling.

01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:45.430
It had to have a beginning,
a middle and an end.

01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:47.720
Narrative, narrative, narrative.

01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:50.310
We even constructed the
documentaries and acts

01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:54.280
which was something that most
documentarians had not been

01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:57.270
doing, you know they - they had

01:57:57.270 --> 01:58:00.350
on commercial television you had
a lot of documentaries that were

01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:03.940
like NBC White Paper
and ABC - I forget what

01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:05.240
that series was called.

01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:06.540
And they were surveys.

01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:08.920
They were mostly surveys
from the top down.

01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:11.660
They weren't stories, they
weren't actual stories

01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:16.590
where you had characters that
you could follow and I think

01:58:16.590 --> 01:58:20.120
that was an element that
was emphsized at GBH

01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:23.090
and in particular I
know American Experience

01:58:23.090 --> 01:58:26.540
because as we were talking
before you want to hear

01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:29.240
from as many people as possible
who are as close to the subject

01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:33.000
as possible and then
construct it very carefully

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.920
to have a story arc.

01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:38.040
What happened then,
what happened next,

01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:41.710
what happened after that?

01:58:41.710 --> 01:58:43.530
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide: So
you're - let's point out then

01:58:43.530 --> 01:58:48.050
that public television
is - the real innovator

01:58:48.050 --> 01:58:49.960
of this character
driven story model

01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:53.810
that now is standard
expectation for documentary.

01:58:53.810 --> 01:58:56.040
&gt;&gt; Margaret Drain: Yeah I think
so because I mean I don't want

01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:57.600
to take the credit for
it because it was -

01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:59.580
I didn't invent the
narrative style.

01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:03.920
But it was something that was
embraced wholeheartedly by WGBH

01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:07.840
and they gave all of us the
resources to figure it out.

01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:09.720
Because when you tell
-when you're in the process

01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:12.440
of telling a story you need time
to figure out what the story is,

01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:15.520
who the main characters are, who
the secondary characters are,

01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:18.770
where the at break is,
what's going to happen next,

01:59:18.770 --> 01:59:22.760
how to conclude it and
without being - you don't have

01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:25.610
to tel lthe entire story you
know, because everybody used

01:59:25.610 --> 01:59:27.860
to agonize about
what's left out.

01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:30.600
Well if you did your job
properly no one would even

01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:32.790
notice that you left
anything out.

01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:37.820
They would just - our philosophy
was just go narrow and go deep,

01:59:37.820 --> 01:59:40.130
go narrow and go deep
and get characters.

01:59:40.130 --> 01:59:42.450
But I do want to comment on
something you said before

01:59:42.450 --> 01:59:45.950
about getting first hand
witnesses, because I admired

01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:49.830
that in Henry Hampton's
Shop and Eyes on the Prize

01:59:49.830 --> 01:59:51.750
and I thought it was terrific.

01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:55.670
We had a challenge
because our mandate was

01:59:55.670 --> 01:59:59.390
to tell all American History you
know prior - we had to go back

01:59:59.390 --> 02:00:01.320
into the 18th century and
even the 17th century.

02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:03.100
And we were terrified.

02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:06.260
We actually avoided anything
that was pre-archival

02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:09.200
because we didn't know how to
deal with it at the beginning.

02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:13.190
And you can't find witnesses
who are - we did a show -

02:00:13.190 --> 02:00:16.130
one of our first shows was
on the 1906 earthquake,

02:00:16.130 --> 02:00:17.450
San Francisco earthquake.

02:00:17.450 --> 02:00:22.140
We barely got a couple of people
to make an appearance and we -

02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:26.120
as soon as we found them we
shot them immediately, you know

02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:27.420
and put them in the bank.

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:28.900
Because we didn't even
know we were going

02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:31.360
to go ahead with this storoy.

02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:33.790
But it was a real
stretch for us and we had

02:00:33.790 --> 02:00:38.540
to challenge ourselves to go
back into the 19th century

02:00:38.540 --> 02:00:43.450
and even back into revolutionary
period, so we relied

02:00:43.450 --> 02:00:46.500
on since we're here talking
about the archives letters,

02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:50.260
diaries, first hand accounts
that could then be employed

02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:53.370
in many different
ways to recall maybe -

02:00:53.370 --> 02:00:56.160
maybe it was the
Donner party, you know?

02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:59.780
I mean there's no first hand
witnesses in the Donner party.

02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:04.650
One of our most successful
films and what did we rely on?

02:01:04.650 --> 02:01:08.480
We relied on diaries
and letters.

02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:09.920
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide: So
one of the things that is

02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:17.760
so I think impressive about what
both of your series ended up -

02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:19.060
and all of your work

02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:23.010
in documentaries did was
I think create a sense

02:01:23.010 --> 02:01:24.730
of trust among the stations.

02:01:24.730 --> 02:01:27.210
For something that they
had dreaded and feared ever

02:01:27.210 --> 02:01:31.860
since the days of NET which
was before there was a PBS.

02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:34.910
And you know shows
like the redliningshow

02:01:34.910 --> 02:01:38.370
that made Nixon decide he should
defund public broadcasting.

02:01:38.370 --> 02:01:42.520
So you sort of created a
sense of quality, dignity,

02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:46.740
realibility, turnkey and so on.

02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:51.990
Something else that is actually
really interesting to me is

02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:55.960
that public television and
building upon that has been able

02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:01.440
to actually foster
a kind of -and

02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:04.230
as you descrbied
it anthology show

02:02:04.230 --> 02:02:08.170
for independent voices as well.

02:02:08.170 --> 02:02:11.730
And impressively I have to
say thank you to David Fanning

02:02:11.730 --> 02:02:15.050
for being so supportive
of anthology shows as well

02:02:15.050 --> 02:02:19.160
as these executive
produced journalism series.

02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:23.300
And Stephen Gong who
is here from the Center

02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:30.130
for Asian American Media, one
of the minority consortiua

02:02:30.130 --> 02:02:34.060
of public - CPB, is also a
veteran independent filmmaker

02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:37.210
and somebody who supports
independent filmmakers

02:02:37.210 --> 02:02:40.540
and has also been involved
in creating archives

02:02:40.540 --> 02:02:42.230
that we can all draw on.

02:02:42.230 --> 02:02:47.190
So, I'd love to hear you talk a
little bit about the filmmaking

02:02:47.190 --> 02:02:50.160
that goes to fuel the
two big anthology series,

02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:53.280
POV and Independent Lens
and just like let me say,

02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:55.880
board member of ITVS, yes.

02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:58.690
&gt;&gt; Stephen Gong:
Actually ifI could,

02:02:58.690 --> 02:03:01.700
I'd like to make a reference
to the panels we heard earlier

02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:06.390
because the seeds of the
minority consortia independent

02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:09.730
and diverse filmmakers really
goes back to the same era

02:03:09.730 --> 02:03:11.680
of the great society; so many

02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:14.880
of these entities were
founded in the 70's.

02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:18.840
And it came out of both
civil rights and in many

02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:22.110
of our cases Hugo Morales
touched on this also.

02:03:22.110 --> 02:03:25.320
The changing - rapidly changing
demographics of the country

02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:28.120
which will start to be
recognized even then.

02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:31.970
The Hart-Celler Act, the
Immigration Act was rewritten

02:03:31.970 --> 02:03:36.350
in 1965 and even though it would
take the rest - a generation,

02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:37.960
it has reshaped America.

02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:40.340
So in this time period
I'm talking

02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:44.090
about from the 60's till now,
the Asia America community went

02:03:44.090 --> 02:03:47.740
from 1% of the population
and now we're 6%,

02:03:47.740 --> 02:03:50.820
we're over 20 million
and the fastest growing.

02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:53.690
And Hugo mentioned
the statistics

02:03:53.690 --> 02:03:55.530
for the Latino community.

02:03:55.530 --> 02:03:57.610
S the premise that we all had

02:03:57.610 --> 02:04:01.640
as this whole enterprise
was getting underway was

02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:05.010
where would these voices
of other communities

02:04:05.010 --> 02:04:10.470
for whom our presence in
media over all was an absence

02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:12.180
or was one of stereotypes.

02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:14.980
So for Asian Americans you know

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:18.530
in entertainment media we are
only you know the villains

02:04:18.530 --> 02:04:21.430
in war movies or we're house
boys or we're gangsters

02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:24.260
in China Town or laundry men.

02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:29.400
And yet we have this inspiration
of the Civil Rights movement

02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:32.460
to recognize how important
it was for us to be able

02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:35.180
to participate in society.

02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:38.580
So, the mechanism for us
in the minority consortium

02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:40.960
and the wisdom of
the corporatino

02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:43.580
for public broadcasting
was to help insure

02:04:43.580 --> 02:04:46.500
that there was a
pipeline of programming by

02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:50.030
and about these new
minority communities.

02:04:50.030 --> 02:04:53.720
And we've been doing this
between 35 and 40 years all

02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:57.170
of us, the five members
of the organization.

02:04:57.170 --> 02:04:59.670
One of the things that I
- one of the first points

02:04:59.670 --> 02:05:01.610
that I wanted to make
though and response now

02:05:01.610 --> 02:05:06.610
to your question was that we
have learned something deeper

02:05:06.610 --> 02:05:12.330
in this construct that it
was important ot include the

02:05:12.330 --> 02:05:16.480
perspectives of people of
color in telling diverse kinds

02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:21.550
of stories, be they about
history or social issues

02:05:21.550 --> 02:05:24.630
or even our cultural history.

02:05:24.630 --> 02:05:30.100
And I think at first we thought
we were presenting authentic

02:05:30.100 --> 02:05:33.710
images that our own
communities could recognize.

02:05:33.710 --> 02:05:36.790
So one piece that's really
important is you can't fully

02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:39.130
participate in the
society unless

02:05:39.130 --> 02:05:40.470
in some ways you see yourself

02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:43.190
and your story is
told in the society.

02:05:43.190 --> 02:05:46.900
The second poitn I think we came
to undersatnd relatively quickly

02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:49.280
after that was that these
stories needed to be

02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:53.370
for all Americans though and not
just for our own communities.

02:05:53.370 --> 02:05:55.660
The Asian American community
would be a good example

02:05:55.660 --> 02:05:59.050
because we're so diverse
and so different in language

02:05:59.050 --> 02:06:03.420
and cultural backgrounds that
in some ways you're an expert

02:06:03.420 --> 02:06:10.080
and know culture in a sense in
this construct of Asia America.

02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:13.260
But I would say in the recent
years and this is where I want

02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:17.830
to end my thoughts on
this, I think we now -

02:06:17.830 --> 02:06:21.240
where we are today in
this quesiton of really

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:25.230
who is an American and what is
it that makes America great.

02:06:25.230 --> 02:06:29.620
It's clear that I think in
some ways we tood for granted

02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:30.920
that there was an acceptance.

02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:33.480
That diversity was an
important and a key factor

02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:36.630
of the American experience.

02:06:36.630 --> 02:06:40.290
But it is vital that we
stand in for this notion

02:06:40.290 --> 02:06:44.030
of what this country can
be and that we're not just

02:06:44.030 --> 02:06:45.920
about our racial stories.

02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:49.340
You know diversity is within
each of our communities as well.

02:06:49.340 --> 02:06:51.040
And Ithink that's
th elarger piece

02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:53.340
to reshift the way we all talk

02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:56.140
about what is our
common history.

02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:58.290
The way we examine things

02:06:58.290 --> 02:07:02.060
and I think we're still
exploring what these different

02:07:02.060 --> 02:07:05.430
points of view mean and it's
a journey we'll all need to be

02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:09.770
on because we don't have the
guide stone of a you know,

02:07:09.770 --> 02:07:13.840
sort of White European
male dominated

02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:15.630
through line of history.

02:07:15.630 --> 02:07:17.110
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide:
Thank you very much.

02:07:17.110 --> 02:07:20.500
Does anybody want to
jump in before I -

02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:22.620
&gt;&gt; Clayborne Carson: I think
one of the points I'd make is

02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:26.440
that all of us in some
ways are beneficiaries

02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:33.680
of the technological changes
and that have lessoned the cost

02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:38.300
and the - some would
say even the skill level

02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:39.810
to get it to filmmaking.

02:07:39.810 --> 02:07:46.600
So, that it has become much,
much easier to do what you know

02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:48.070
like a film like Eyes

02:07:48.070 --> 02:07:51.770
on the Prize today you
could probably do it

02:07:51.770 --> 02:07:53.480
for much less money,

02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:57.230
simply because the equipment
would b eso much less,

02:07:57.230 --> 02:08:00.340
the editing euqipment,
all of that sort of thing.

02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:03.770
And I think that looking
forward into the future,

02:08:03.770 --> 02:08:10.470
what I see coming out of
African American filmmaking is

02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:15.860
that proliferation is kind
of pulling us in you know,

02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:19.030
even within the African
American community.

02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:24.440
Now you have gay
filmmakers, black filmmakers

02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:27.790
who might be trying to
describe that experience.

02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:33.010
Ou have so many - so much
diversity within each

02:08:33.010 --> 02:08:36.710
of these communities
that one thing I fear is

02:08:36.710 --> 02:08:40.900
that it's very difficult
to get a sense in a -

02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:44.380
right now for example
I've been involved in more

02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:48.620
than two dozen documentary
films about black American life

02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:52.350
and most of it 20th century.

02:08:52.350 --> 02:08:57.050
And it seems like the pace
of that keeps increasing

02:08:57.050 --> 02:09:00.840
and I think ther
eis that concern,

02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:05.270
that we're losing a sense
of even the commonality

02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:10.060
of being black, must
less being American.

02:09:10.060 --> 02:09:15.940
And maybe that's good because
otherwise you would not have a

02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:19.350
sense that these
communities exist.

02:09:19.350 --> 02:09:25.190
But in terms of trying to get
a sense of it you know for many

02:09:25.190 --> 02:09:29.230
of my students I teach - in fact
I'll be teaching next quarter a

02:09:29.230 --> 02:09:32.090
course on Black independent
film.

02:09:32.090 --> 02:09:40.980
And I find that maybe one
student might have seen some

02:09:40.980 --> 02:09:46.410
of these fairly famous
films, Charles Burnett,

02:09:46.410 --> 02:09:51.250
people who have really
made major contributions.

02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:54.460
They haven't evne
seen early Spike Lee.

02:09:54.460 --> 02:09:59.520
So it's - they might have
seen Malcolm X, but that's it.

02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:04.160
So I thikn that one of the
problems wer're going to have is

02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:08.050
that there are audiences
but it's going to be smaller

02:10:08.050 --> 02:10:09.840
and smaller rather
than larger and larger.

02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:11.140
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide:

02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:13.920
Let me actually address
the changing market place

02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:17.840
for documentaries and I'd love
to have any of yoru responses.

02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:23.920
This is a point at which Netflix
is busy giving people $450,000

02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:28.150
to make [Inaudible]
and oops sorry,

02:10:28.150 --> 02:10:31.490
and is launching entire lines.

02:10:31.490 --> 02:10:36.670
You've got Vice and Vulture
doing instant video journalism.

02:10:36.670 --> 02:10:40.660
You've got buzz feed explainers
apparently educating an entire

02:10:40.660 --> 02:10:42.600
new generation.

02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:46.100
And you've got cable channels
just stuffed with wall

02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:51.040
to wall something that looks
sort of like maybe documentary.

02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:54.280
And you have a legacy
that's been built up largely

02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:58.780
through the hard work of
public television that is -

02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:00.770
that honors the notion
of documentary

02:11:00.770 --> 02:11:03.870
as like a really
authentic true thing.

02:11:03.870 --> 02:11:08.960
At the same time you have an
enormous proliferation and in -

02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:11.630
weeping into the
marketplace of Netflix,

02:11:11.630 --> 02:11:13.720
Amazon and so many more.

02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:19.010
So what's the role now of
public television documentary.

02:11:19.010 --> 02:11:22.270
You know surely not
the only game in town.

02:11:22.270 --> 02:11:29.840
Expensive, oh my God compared
to like almost any other kind -

02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:36.000
source for documentary and
relatively slow compared to some

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.440
of the others, what's the role?

02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:40.020
No pressure?

02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:42.640
But if you could
provide us the answer -

02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:46.510
&gt;&gt; David Fanning: It's
an enormous challenge.

02:11:46.510 --> 02:11:48.550
I think one of the great
challenges is going

02:11:48.550 --> 02:11:51.440
to be you know how do you
pick your way through all

02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:54.000
of this stuff and know what's
true and what's trustworthy

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:57.620
and people maybe won't
care about that as much.

02:11:57.620 --> 02:12:00.730
There's going to be an enormous
amount of material that's

02:12:00.730 --> 02:12:02.420
out there in the
world being produced

02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:04.370
in all these different areas.

02:12:04.370 --> 02:12:07.590
And it's going to be
manipulated and used

02:12:07.590 --> 02:12:10.560
because this is the most
manipulative of media.

02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:13.310
And it's going to be - and so
we're going to have a harder

02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:17.720
and harder time trying to
figure out what we can trust.

02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:23.410
The trust brand and
the trust brand goes

02:12:23.410 --> 02:12:29.380
to very expensive you know
high octane documentaries made

02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:34.760
with big budgets for HBO, and
for Net Flix and others as well.

02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:40.420
It's very easy to put your hand
on the scale in documentaries

02:12:40.420 --> 02:12:44.780
and to be able to manipulate
this medium towards certain

02:12:44.780 --> 02:12:46.080
points of view.

02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:49.680
There is nothing easier
than to kind of you know,

02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:55.560
Michael Moore's famous film of
Fahrenheit 911 in the sort of -

02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:59.050
the use - getting
Wolfowicz and being able

02:12:59.050 --> 02:13:02.120
to sorto get those
seequences, fish in a barrrel.

02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:04.880
It's not hard to do,
it's very easy to be able

02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:08.530
to manipulate archival material
and to use it in different ways,

02:13:08.530 --> 02:13:10.620
to lay a voice over it.

02:13:10.620 --> 02:13:14.420
So we have a deep worry I think
behind all of this as to where -

02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:18.020
as to what lies behind it
and where do you have trust?

02:13:18.020 --> 02:13:22.010
Anything that we can hold onto
is to say that we really believe

02:13:22.010 --> 02:13:23.640
that you can trust us.

02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:27.130
And the way in which you
trust us is the body of work

02:13:27.130 --> 02:13:30.890
and the way in which we keep
doing it and also to make it

02:13:30.890 --> 02:13:32.480
as transparent as possible.

02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:37.180
So, we made - for me one of the
great err moments in the life

02:13:37.180 --> 02:13:39.700
of [Inaudible] was 1995,
we just done a film

02:13:39.700 --> 02:13:42.770
on Waco, the inside story.

02:13:42.770 --> 02:13:47.910
And we'd done all these
interviews with major FBI guys

02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:50.200
who were part of
negotiating with Koresh.

02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:53.990
We even had the audio tapes
of the actual negotiations

02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:57.120
and I kept saying "Can't
we put these audio tapes,

02:13:57.120 --> 02:13:59.200
make a radio show"
and somebody said

02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:00.650
"You can put it on the web".

02:14:00.650 --> 02:14:01.950
What's that?

02:14:01.950 --> 02:14:07.940
1995 we built a - we
built a website for Waco,

02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:10.970
the Inside Story with
that archival material.

02:14:10.970 --> 02:14:13.880
Plus I said, "Well can't we
put the whole film on there"

02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:16.820
and they said, "You
can't do that yet".

02:14:16.820 --> 02:14:19.470
And so thenwe put
the interviews up.

02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:21.810
And all the interviews
for these were -

02:14:21.810 --> 02:14:25.160
and that website exists today.

02:14:25.160 --> 02:14:28.520
People still actually write to
us about that website from '95.

02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:31.800
And then from then on once we
began publishing all of the -

02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:33.770
edited longer versions

02:14:33.770 --> 02:14:37.860
of the primary source
materials behind the front line,

02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:41.690
so that last week,
second film that ran

02:14:41.690 --> 02:14:46.040
of Putin's revenge there
were 65 interviews there,

02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:49.620
a body of work that's both
historical important -

02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:52.440
now that's not going ot persuade
the average person that's doing

02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:56.010
it, that there is - that
they're going to go off and hunt

02:14:56.010 --> 02:14:58.130
through the interview material -

02:14:58.130 --> 02:14:59.430
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide: You
made it transparent.

02:14:59.430 --> 02:15:00.930
&gt;&gt; David Fanning: But you
made it completely transparent

02:15:00.930 --> 02:15:03.500
but in some way that
seeps deep intothe culture

02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:07.000
that we can keep doing this if
we raise the bar really high

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:10.890
and hold to that bar, then we
begin to hold onto who we are

02:15:10.890 --> 02:15:14.370
and why we remain the
only place anywhere

02:15:14.370 --> 02:15:17.950
in the media culture
that does that.

02:15:17.950 --> 02:15:19.980
And so that's our -

02:15:19.980 --> 02:15:22.300
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide: Okay
so that's your answer.

02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:24.070
Want to go Margaret?

02:15:24.070 --> 02:15:25.830
&gt;&gt; Margaret Drain: Yeah
what I wanted to say is

02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:29.020
that you can take that
trust too and we all had

02:15:29.020 --> 02:15:31.810
to learn using new platforms.

02:15:31.810 --> 02:15:36.340
And it was challenging in
many ways because we had been

02:15:36.340 --> 02:15:39.930
so schooled in the delivery
of hour long documentaries

02:15:39.930 --> 02:15:43.080
or in the case of American
Experience six hour long

02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:45.500
documentaries or four
hour documentaries,

02:15:45.500 --> 02:15:48.530
which were big biographies
of presidents.

02:15:48.530 --> 02:15:52.340
So we had to learn how to
use the material on You Tube

02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:54.530
and we had to learn
pod casting and we had

02:15:54.530 --> 02:15:57.900
to learn all the different
platforms, mobile platforms

02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:02.330
where we could deliver the
same kind of content,s horter

02:16:02.330 --> 02:16:05.880
but the same - we hope
carries the same branding

02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:10.950
and the same scrutiny that goes
into an hour long documentary

02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:14.970
and deliver it to your
students who are not going

02:16:14.970 --> 02:16:16.960
to be watching hour
long documentaries.

02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:19.880
I mean unless somebody
leads them to it

02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:21.810
and shows them what
the benefits are

02:16:21.810 --> 02:16:24.800
and like the range
of interest is.

02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:28.030
&gt;&gt; David Fanning: And they're
doing that, we're doing that.

02:16:28.030 --> 02:16:30.540
We're getting millions of
viewers through Facebook.

02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:32.270
&gt;&gt; Clayborne Carson: We're
sitting in an archive

02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:38.080
that we I think for
anydocumentary one

02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:42.140
of the most important
tasks is whatdo you do

02:16:42.140 --> 02:16:44.190
with all the material that
you've brought together,

02:16:44.190 --> 02:16:46.270
especially the video material.

02:16:46.270 --> 02:16:48.750
And I think one of the most
important decisions for Eyes

02:16:48.750 --> 02:16:53.890
on the Prize was to put it in
an archive where now you can go

02:16:53.890 --> 02:16:58.720
and watch the entire
Coretta King interview

02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:01.460
or any other interview
done during that time.

02:17:01.460 --> 02:17:03.190
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide: So Steve
we're going to run out of time.

02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:07.670
I want to make sure that we
get your answer for the -

02:17:07.670 --> 02:17:11.670
the answer for trust has
been partly transparency,

02:17:11.670 --> 02:17:15.570
but it's also been partly brand,
you know because we are PBS,

02:17:15.570 --> 02:17:18.880
we are American Experience,
we are Frontline.

02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:22.220
And you're dealing with
a different community

02:17:22.220 --> 02:17:25.580
who are independent filmmakers,

02:17:25.580 --> 02:17:29.760
in your case specificall
Asian American filmmakers,

02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:31.060
but each consortia does.

02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:36.780
And in the series they showcase
their work, anthologize all

02:17:36.780 --> 02:17:40.380
of this work which is
very, very differnet.

02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:45.930
How do you address Clay's
point about centrifeal universe

02:17:45.930 --> 02:17:49.170
of information out there?

02:17:49.170 --> 02:17:53.740
&gt;&gt; Stephen Gong: You know
historically our stuff shows

02:17:53.740 --> 02:17:55.800
up into the system
through a variety of ways,

02:17:55.800 --> 02:17:59.620
not through one particular
strand, one brand.

02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:01.700
Although in recent
times in fact,

02:18:01.700 --> 02:18:03.070
we have a project that's going

02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:07.210
on in American Experience next
May that makes extensive use

02:18:07.210 --> 02:18:10.690
of archival materials and
we're also participating

02:18:10.690 --> 02:18:13.120
in the archives of
public braodcasting,

02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:14.420
I'm really proud of.

02:18:14.420 --> 02:18:17.680
But to speak in general of this
you know, hundred titles a year

02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:19.850
that colelctively come

02:18:19.850 --> 02:18:22.020
from independent
sources, through ITVS.

02:18:22.020 --> 02:18:27.180
We put our stuff on POV that
many of you may know about.

02:18:27.180 --> 02:18:33.600
I - you know I am optimistic
moving into the future

02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:36.100
because this is what we
all have to learn how

02:18:36.100 --> 02:18:40.560
to incorporate many more points
of view and many more voices

02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:41.860
in public broadcasting.

02:18:41.860 --> 02:18:45.750
And if you stay true to that and
it's absolutely mission driven,

02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:47.100
what we heard earlier.

02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:48.400
It is the future.

02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:51.420
And then make use of this
incredible education network.

02:18:51.420 --> 02:18:53.770
I'm going to set up
the next panel for you.

02:18:53.770 --> 02:18:58.170
PBS learning media, which we
you know put our materials on

02:18:58.170 --> 02:19:02.610
and make available to teachers
that I feel very confident

02:19:02.610 --> 02:19:04.870
about the future
of this enterprise

02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:09.600
because there are
thousands, tens of thousands

02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:14.940
of young makers who really
want to speak authentic stories

02:19:14.940 --> 02:19:17.720
that don't necessarily have
to be in commercial media

02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:22.100
and be all about selling a
product or titillating people

02:19:22.100 --> 02:19:24.490
or even in the best sense
just to entertain alone.

02:19:24.490 --> 02:19:27.110
I think ther eare so
many issues that we share

02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:29.510
and public broadcasting,
if it stays true

02:19:29.510 --> 02:19:31.480
to the mission is
that singular place.

02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:34.580
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide:
So we're going to -

02:19:34.580 --> 02:19:39.240
we've got three more minutes and
I'd like to be able to use them

02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:42.990
to talk to the issue you
addressed, which is archives.

02:19:42.990 --> 02:19:45.000
And Clay has told us about -

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:49.560
is Eyes on the Prize
in PB somewhere?

02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:52.160
&gt;&gt; Stephen Gong:
Yes, at St. Louis.

02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:53.460
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide:
Is [Inaudible],

02:19:53.460 --> 02:19:54.760
do you want to explain
[Inaudible]?

02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:57.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen Gong: There's
many wonderful things,

02:19:57.370 --> 02:20:00.870
[Inaudible] is an online digital
archive of oral histories

02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:02.780
by the Japanese American
community

02:20:02.780 --> 02:20:06.180
and we have placed a
number of our collections,

02:20:06.180 --> 02:20:09.780
the Lonnie Dane collection
when she interviewed hundreds

02:20:09.780 --> 02:20:13.690
and hundreds of 442
veterans from World War II,

02:20:13.690 --> 02:20:14.990
the Japanese Americans.

02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:17.410
We've placed all those
interviews on that source.

02:20:17.410 --> 02:20:20.210
But all of the other kinds
of works, they're going to go

02:20:20.210 --> 02:20:25.110
into the Library of Congress
as part of our collections.

02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:28.000
&gt;&gt; David Fanning: I would just
recommend seeing the Putin's

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:29.300
Revenge stuff.

02:20:29.300 --> 02:20:34.440
It was done with Duke
and it's got the -

02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:37.520
so state of the art
technology, 65 interviews,

02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:39.270
they're all video interviews.

02:20:39.270 --> 02:20:41.490
You can both read it and be able

02:20:41.490 --> 02:20:43.340
to track the video
at the same time.

02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:46.880
You can reach in and clip
a piece out and share it.

02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:52.570
And it's the most
interactive profoundly sort

02:20:52.570 --> 02:20:55.490
of impressive archive.

02:20:55.490 --> 02:20:59.290
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide:
Fantastic and in terms

02:20:59.290 --> 02:21:01.730
of APB is there frontline
material -

02:21:01.730 --> 02:21:03.030
&gt;&gt; David Fanning:
I think it's due.

02:21:03.030 --> 02:21:05.660
Karen tells me it's in
the pipeline where -

02:21:05.660 --> 02:21:09.150
we're on the way, the
body of work to come in.

02:21:09.150 --> 02:21:12.100
&gt;&gt; Margaret Drain: I just
want to go back a little bit

02:21:12.100 --> 02:21:13.480
to something Colson had said

02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:15.870
about the appetite
for documentaries.

02:21:15.870 --> 02:21:17.340
I also am on the board

02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:19.990
of POV the independent
documentary series.

02:21:19.990 --> 02:21:23.640
And I am astonished every
year we have an open call

02:21:23.640 --> 02:21:26.180
and we get more than
1,000 entries

02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:29.440
from independent producers.

02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:33.880
And of those it has to be called
to like - we've got 18 slots.

02:21:33.880 --> 02:21:36.880
So that's every single
year and even

02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:40.130
after the -during the you
know, in the middle of the year

02:21:40.130 --> 02:21:43.740
when there's no entry date
you get - they get inundated

02:21:43.740 --> 02:21:49.520
with phone calls or they
tapes or they get you know,

02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:51.390
links to films that
have been produced.

02:21:51.390 --> 02:21:55.730
So there's something going on,
it reminds me of the time I was

02:21:55.730 --> 02:21:59.040
at CBS and they announced
the death of the documentary.

02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:03.000
I don't think we can say that
the documentary is dying.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.880
I see quite the opposite.

02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:09.070
I see this hunger in
young people made possible

02:22:09.070 --> 02:22:13.420
by technology in some cases
and also just this kind

02:22:13.420 --> 02:22:16.240
of incessant fervent curiosity

02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:18.080
that they have about
their world.

02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:21.300
And they're making these films
for practically nothing and some

02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:23.430
of them are really terrific.

02:22:23.430 --> 02:22:24.730
So I'm optimistic.

02:22:24.730 --> 02:22:27.910
&gt;&gt; Clayborne Carson: Two
words that have not come up

02:22:27.910 --> 02:22:34.950
and that are really central in
this are intellectual property.

02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:39.510
And I think that in
general scholarship

02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:43.360
and documentary filmmakers
have not been aggressive enough

02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:44.660
in using fair use.

02:22:44.660 --> 02:22:53.300
I think that in part, that
comes from when particular film

02:22:53.300 --> 02:22:59.480
that I was involved in when
it came to being shown on PBS,

02:22:59.480 --> 02:23:03.940
PBS required certain
kinds of coverage

02:23:03.940 --> 02:23:06.250
for obvious reasons,
legal reasons.

02:23:06.250 --> 02:23:09.900
And that forced them to
go back and in this case,

02:23:09.900 --> 02:23:13.650
have to take out things.

02:23:13.650 --> 02:23:18.550
I think at every level
intellectual property issues

02:23:18.550 --> 02:23:20.490
have been crucial.

02:23:20.490 --> 02:23:23.420
Not so much in terms of cost.

02:23:23.420 --> 02:23:27.350
But just uncertainty about use.

02:23:27.350 --> 02:23:29.830
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide: And people
all being on the same page

02:23:29.830 --> 02:23:32.890
about what they regard
as acceptable,

02:23:32.890 --> 02:23:35.300
which is where the best
practices have been

02:23:35.300 --> 02:23:37.100
somewhat helpful.

02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:39.120
All right, last comments
because we have

02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:41.380
like 15 seconds left, go.

02:23:41.380 --> 02:23:42.680
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:46.200
&gt;&gt; Pat Aufderheide:
Okay your 15 seconds.

02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:48.000
&gt;&gt; Margaret Drain: I thank you.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:58.160
[ Applause ]

02:23:58.160 --> 02:23:59.900
&gt;&gt; Karen Cariani:
Thank you everybody.

02:23:59.900 --> 02:24:02.790
Our next panel is
going to begin.

02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:04.370
We're going to show some clips,

02:24:04.370 --> 02:24:06.430
which I hope you'll stay
seated this time to watch.

02:24:06.430 --> 02:24:10.340
It's on educational uses
of public broadcasting

02:24:10.340 --> 02:24:13.190
and it will begin - the
panel will begin at 5:10,

02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:15.190
but we're going to
start clips right now.

02:24:15.190 --> 02:24:17.730
&gt;&gt; Our next panel on
the educational uses

02:24:17.730 --> 02:24:21.950
of public broadcasting is
the person who during most

02:24:21.950 --> 02:24:25.680
of my tenure as the head of
WGBH held the purse strings,

02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:28.300
first at PBS and then at CPB

02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:33.200
because she had the most
important programming jobs

02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:34.780
in those two institutions.

02:24:34.780 --> 02:24:37.680
Not simultaneously I would say.

02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:42.030
Jennifer Lawson was the
executive vice president

02:24:42.030 --> 02:24:45.250
of programming and
promotion services at PBS.

02:24:45.250 --> 02:24:48.100
And then was senior vice
president for television

02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:52.290
and digital content at CPB and
during a little bit of time

02:24:52.290 --> 02:24:55.310
between those two she ran
the Howard University Public

02:24:55.310 --> 02:24:58.660
Station, WHUT.

02:24:58.660 --> 02:25:01.670
Jennifer has received
numerous awards and honors

02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:03.540
for her work in public media.

02:25:03.540 --> 02:25:07.240
The Hollywood Reporter
named her at one point one

02:25:07.240 --> 02:25:12.700
of the 50 most influential women
in entertainment in the world;

02:25:12.700 --> 02:25:14.760
so Jennifer take it away.

02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:16.060
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: Thank you.

02:25:16.060 --> 02:25:18.040
[ Applause ]

02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:20.990
Thank you very much.

02:25:20.990 --> 02:25:25.690
Education is a fundamental
element of public broadcasting.

02:25:25.690 --> 02:25:27.850
Public television
was established

02:25:27.850 --> 02:25:30.850
as educational television first

02:25:30.850 --> 02:25:33.240
in many places around
the country.

02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:39.250
The E in the call letters of
many stations like WETA or KCET

02:25:39.250 --> 02:25:46.540
in Los Angeles or SCETV in South
Carolina references education.

02:25:46.540 --> 02:25:52.310
And several of the 362 public
television stations are licensed

02:25:52.310 --> 02:25:56.890
to universities such as the
one Henry just mentioned WHUT

02:25:56.890 --> 02:26:03.340
at Howart University or
Arizona PBS, which originated

02:26:03.340 --> 02:26:06.590
at Arizona State Univeristy.

02:26:06.590 --> 02:26:08.590
Public television together

02:26:08.590 --> 02:26:12.670
with public non-commercial
radio combined to serve

02:26:12.670 --> 02:26:16.230
as the most consistent
and significant place

02:26:16.230 --> 02:26:18.930
for information learning,
for listenrs

02:26:18.930 --> 02:26:21.580
and viewers of all ages.

02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:24.560
WE'll discuss public
broadcastings educational

02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:28.320
underpinnings, its legacy
and how the preservation

02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:31.900
of this content creates
future opportunities.

02:26:31.900 --> 02:26:33.490
I have the privilege now

02:26:33.490 --> 02:26:37.040
of introducing our
distinguished panel

02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:42.300
and we have here Paula Apsell,
who is senior executive producer

02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:47.190
of NOVA and director of
the WGBH science unit.

02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:51.440
NOVA has won every major
broadcasting award,

02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:56.030
including the Emmy,
the Peabody, the AAAS,

02:26:56.030 --> 02:26:58.670

Gold Baton,

02:27:01.980 --> 02:27:05.500
as well as an Academy
Award nomination.

02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:08.110
Paula has also been
personally recognized

02:27:08.110 --> 02:27:12.730
with numerous individual awards
including the Carl Sagan Award

02:27:12.730 --> 02:27:17.550
given by the Council of
Scientific Society Presidents.

02:27:17.550 --> 02:27:22.070
NOVA is a favorite of
teachers who make extensive use

02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:27.090
of its high quality educational
materials and its website

02:27:27.090 --> 02:27:31.460
with popular short foreign
videos and though leader columns

02:27:31.460 --> 02:27:36.660
as one of the most
popular on PBS.org.

02:27:36.660 --> 02:27:38.780
Lloyd Morrisett.

02:27:38.780 --> 02:27:43.640

and the Carnegie Foundation for
the advancement of teaching.

02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:10.590
He was president of the John

02:28:10.590 --> 02:28:15.580
and Mary R. Markle
Foundation from 1969 to 1998.

02:28:15.580 --> 02:28:20.730
He is currently a trustee of
public agenda, a non-partisan,

02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:28.100
to inform public policy issues.

02:28:28.100 --> 02:28:33.180
Kathryn Ostrofsky teaches
in the department of history

02:28:33.180 --> 02:28:38.560
at Angelo State Universitiy
in San Angelo, Texas.

02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:40.510
Kathryn's areas of research

02:28:40.510 --> 02:28:44.980
and teaching include 20th
century US cultural history,

02:28:44.980 --> 02:28:49.110
sound studies, television
studies, the history of race

02:28:49.110 --> 02:28:54.210
and ethnicity, and the history
of media and communications.

02:28:54.210 --> 02:28:56.940
She is also working to
preserve audio visual

02:28:56.940 --> 02:29:00.110
and paper arvhical
sources related

02:29:00.110 --> 02:29:02.180
to children's television.

02:29:02.180 --> 02:29:04.630
She has a doctorate in
history from the University

02:29:04.630 --> 02:29:10.310
of Pennsylvania and her
oral history of the 1970's

02:29:10.310 --> 02:29:13.730
through the sounds of
Sesame Street has led

02:29:13.730 --> 02:29:18.110
to numerous speaking engagements
and conference presentations.

02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:22.120
She is under contract with the
University of California Pres

02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:24.690
for a book on this topic.

02:29:24.690 --> 02:29:30.840
I'd like to start with Lloyd
Morrisett and to talk a bit

02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:34.110
about the origins
of Sesame Street.

02:29:34.110 --> 02:29:37.180
And I know that you were
at the Carnegie Foundation

02:29:37.180 --> 02:29:41.050
and had a very good overview
of the state of education

02:29:41.050 --> 02:29:43.330
in America at that time.

02:29:43.330 --> 02:29:46.690
And I would just - I think
it would be really useful

02:29:46.690 --> 02:29:50.740
if you would put Sesame Street
in the context of those times

02:29:50.740 --> 02:29:54.740
and tell us a little bit about
what led to its creation.

02:29:54.740 --> 02:29:56.610
&gt;&gt; Lloyd Morrisett:
Well for those of you

02:29:56.610 --> 02:30:02.830
who are expecting
Elmo, I'm not Elmo.

02:30:02.830 --> 02:30:05.550
I think to talk about
the origins

02:30:05.550 --> 02:30:08.930
of Sesame Street
you have to recreat

02:30:08.930 --> 02:30:16.350
in your minds the
events of that decade.

02:30:16.350 --> 02:30:20.130
And I'm going to list them here
and I'm going to read the list

02:30:20.130 --> 02:30:22.920
because I don't want
to leave anything out.

02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:28.890
1960, television may have given
Senator John F. Kennedy the edge

02:30:28.890 --> 02:30:31.350
he needed to defeat
Vice President Nixon

02:30:31.350 --> 02:30:35.490
in the first televised
presidential debate.

02:30:35.490 --> 02:30:40.730
Kennedy wins the election
by a margin of 113,000 votes

02:30:40.730 --> 02:30:43.730
out of 69 million votes cast.

02:30:43.730 --> 02:30:50.320
1961, FCC chairman Newton
Minow makes his famous speech

02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:54.270
declaring that television
is a vast wasteland.

02:30:54.270 --> 02:31:00.700
1962, 90% of Americans
own a television set,

02:31:00.700 --> 02:31:04.270
ABC begins broadcasting
in color.

02:31:04.270 --> 02:31:06.350
The Federal government
funds first funds -

02:31:06.350 --> 02:31:10.590
the Federal Government
funds public broadcasting

02:31:10.590 --> 02:31:14.490
through the education
television facilities act.

02:31:14.490 --> 02:31:24.160
June of 1962, President Kennedy
federalizes Alabama's national

02:31:24.160 --> 02:31:26.920
guard and orders
Governor George Wallace

02:31:26.920 --> 02:31:31.630
to allow two black students to
be enrolled at the university.

02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:41.840
Just recounting these events
I find them very emotional.

02:31:43.250 --> 02:31:49.460
In January of 1962 Martin
Luther King delivers his

02:31:49.460 --> 02:31:52.820
"I have a Dream" speech.

02:31:52.820 --> 02:31:59.300
In August more than 200,000
Americans march on Washington

02:31:59.300 --> 02:32:01.310
in support of Civil Rights.

02:32:01.310 --> 02:32:08.040
1964 the 24th Amendment

02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:13.860
to the Constitution makes US
Poll taxes unconstitutional.

02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:19.560
March 1964 President Johnson
declares the war on poverty.

02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:22.920
He signs an Economic
Opportunity Act in August

02:32:22.920 --> 02:32:26.030
and appoints R. Sargent
Shriver to head the new Office

02:32:26.030 --> 02:32:28.530
of Economic Opportunity.

02:32:28.530 --> 02:32:32.340
Again in 1964 President
Johnson signs the bill

02:32:32.340 --> 02:32:33.900
enacting Medicare.

02:32:33.900 --> 02:32:38.440
The Great Society is underway.

02:32:38.440 --> 02:32:43.440
In August of 1964 Congress
approves the Tonkin Gulf

02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:46.480
Resolution authorizing
Presidnet Johnson

02:32:46.480 --> 02:32:50.490
to take all necessary measures
to repel any armed attack

02:32:50.490 --> 02:32:52.960
against forces of
the United States

02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:56.150
and to prevent further
aggression.

02:32:56.150 --> 02:33:01.840
December of 1964 President
Johnson announes a substantial

02:33:01.840 --> 02:33:05.430
increase in USA to South Vietnam

02:33:05.430 --> 02:33:08.090
to restrain mounting
infiltration of men

02:33:08.090 --> 02:33:10.310
and equipment by
the Hanoi Regime

02:33:10.310 --> 02:33:12.560
in support of the Vietcong.

02:33:12.560 --> 02:33:18.510
In 1965 January in the State

02:33:18.510 --> 02:33:22.500
of the Union message President
Johnson outlines program

02:33:22.500 --> 02:33:26.910
for the Great society that will
eliminate poverty in America.

02:33:26.910 --> 02:33:31.200
In February Dr. Martin
Luther King is arrested

02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:33.500
in Soma, Alabama.

02:33:40.500 --> 02:33:43.970
In February also Malcolm
X is assassinated.

02:33:48.040 --> 02:33:52.020
Coincidentally during
National Brotherhood week.

02:33:52.020 --> 02:33:56.020
June of 1965 Congress
authorizes the use

02:33:56.020 --> 02:33:58.240
of ground troops in Vietnam.

02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:00.890
A complete ground
offensive is underway

02:34:00.890 --> 02:34:03.990
and the Vietcong will collapse

02:34:03.990 --> 02:34:09.400
in a few weeks said President
Johnson's national security

02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:13.130
advisor, Walt Russell,
not months but weeks.

02:34:13.130 --> 02:34:17.080
125,000 troops are in Vietnam.

02:34:18.170 --> 02:34:22.950
In August of that year the
Voting Rights Act becomes law.

02:34:22.950 --> 02:34:26.500
And in August of that year
the Carnegie Commission

02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:30.450
on educational television begins
its landmark study of broadcast.

02:34:30.450 --> 02:34:37.740
In 1967 public broadcasting
laboratory airs

02:34:37.740 --> 02:34:40.000
over national educational
television.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:43.660
It is a Sunday night
magazine program designed

02:34:43.660 --> 02:34:48.550
to showcase the relevance and
importance of public television.

02:34:49.780 --> 02:34:52.640
We'll come back to that because
that was a much more important

02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:55.180
historically in public
broadcasting then is

02:34:55.180 --> 02:34:56.680
generally recognized.

02:34:56.680 --> 02:35:05.490
In March of 1968
President Johnson announces

02:35:05.490 --> 02:35:10.890
that he will not accept the
nomination for another term.

02:35:10.890 --> 02:35:14.650
His presidency has become
another casualty of Vietnam War.

02:35:14.650 --> 02:35:20.840
Ini 1968 in April Martin
Luther King is assassinated.

02:35:27.070 --> 02:35:31.420
In 1969 regular national public
broadcasting television program

02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:34.720
begins five nights a week.

02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:39.620
In November of that year
Sesame Street goes on the air.

02:35:42.460 --> 02:35:47.580
Now as you can tell from
my emotions this was a very

02:35:47.580 --> 02:35:49.690
turbulent time.

02:35:49.690 --> 02:35:56.000
It strongly affected all of us,
all of us who were alive then.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:02.660
And it was out of that in part,
that Sesame Street was born.

02:36:02.660 --> 02:36:09.100
We started working
on the idea in 1966.

02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:12.970
And the people that came
to us to help Dave Connell

02:36:12.970 --> 02:36:15.910
for example our executive
vice president,

02:36:15.910 --> 02:36:21.140
Joan Cooney obviously joined
me and the original idea.

02:36:21.140 --> 02:36:28.510
All of us were very affected
by the events I've discussed.

02:36:28.510 --> 02:36:32.930
And so Sesame Street was in
part, born out of a belief

02:36:32.930 --> 02:36:35.370
in Civil Rights that we all had.

02:36:35.370 --> 02:36:41.530
The fact that it appeared

02:36:41.530 --> 02:36:46.820
on public television was
somewhat of an accident.

02:36:46.820 --> 02:36:48.910
When we first started
to raise money for it

02:36:48.910 --> 02:36:55.510
in 1966 Doc Howe had become
commissioner of Education

02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:58.410
and he had been formerly
president, superintendent

02:36:58.410 --> 02:36:59.760
of schools in Scarsdale.

02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:05.910
And he was one of the first
people we talked to about it.

02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:11.130
He - after some deliberation
overruled his staff and said

02:37:11.130 --> 02:37:14.070
that he would find
4 million dollars

02:37:14.070 --> 02:37:17.960
to help us get on the air.

02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:21.830
So, with that 4 million
dollars plus the million dollars

02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:26.880
that Carnegie had already put
up we had 5 million dollars.

02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:34.320
Lou Housman was Doc Howe's
point person in liasoning

02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:37.960
between the Office of
Education and what was going

02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:40.600
to become Sesame Workshop.

02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:45.020
Lou came out of NBC television
and he strongly believed

02:37:45.020 --> 02:37:48.930
that the program should be
on commercial television.

02:37:48.930 --> 02:37:50.500
He said "Where are
the people going,

02:37:50.500 --> 02:37:51.880
they're on commercial
television.

02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:54.780
That's where you have to be".

02:37:54.780 --> 02:38:02.520
So, we took that advice
seriously and I met with NBC,

02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:09.010
CBS, Lou W Broadcasting
and got very nice -

02:38:09.010 --> 02:38:13.560
a very nice reception
but no money.

02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:15.340
No air time.

02:38:15.340 --> 02:38:18.660
The program was fully funded
but we couldn't understand,

02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:22.340
I couldn't understand
in my naivette why

02:38:22.340 --> 02:38:27.020
with a fully funded program
we couldn't have any air time.

02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:29.660
Later I realized and
I've realized it ever

02:38:29.660 --> 02:38:33.080
since that the advertising
part weren't interested

02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:35.920
in having those minutes
sold that way.

02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:37.270
They wanted to raise money

02:38:37.270 --> 02:38:39.740
around the program
and they couldn't.

02:38:39.740 --> 02:38:44.340
So the commercial broadcasters
turned us down and just

02:38:44.340 --> 02:38:48.130
at that point the public
broadcasting act had been signed

02:38:48.130 --> 02:38:51.330
and public broadcasting
needed programming.

02:38:51.330 --> 02:38:56.640
We needed air time, it was a - I
won't say it was made in Heaven,

02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:03.520
but it was certainly made
by an accident of history.

02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:09.800
So, the - the things that
made it possible in addition

02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:12.860
to the ones that
I've already cited,

02:39:12.860 --> 02:39:17.280
are that the people essentially
who created the climate

02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:19.160
to accept the idea

02:39:19.160 --> 02:39:23.110
of a children's television
program were all in their place.

02:39:23.110 --> 02:39:27.790
John Gardener had been my boss
at Carnegie, was a good friend.

02:39:27.790 --> 02:39:31.660
Doc Howe had also
become a friend.

02:39:31.660 --> 02:39:38.170
Other people who were
not directly involved

02:39:38.170 --> 02:39:42.090
in the origins, but created
the climate in Washington

02:39:42.090 --> 02:39:43.480
that made it possible.

02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:47.130
Newton Minow was one, he's
been a friend the rest

02:39:47.130 --> 02:39:49.270
of his life for me.

02:39:49.270 --> 02:39:55.220
Henry Gellar who some of you
may remember, was an ardent fan

02:39:55.220 --> 02:39:58.860
of the publics use
of broadcasting

02:39:58.860 --> 02:40:03.590
and not giving it away free
to commercial broadcasters.

02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:06.030
The other person I'd mention,

02:40:06.030 --> 02:40:08.910
whose name has already
come up is Doug Cater.

02:40:08.910 --> 02:40:13.370
Doug Cater was Lyndon Johnson's
special assistant for education.

02:40:13.370 --> 02:40:15.670
He shepherded the
Public Broadcasting Act

02:40:15.670 --> 02:40:20.170
through the process of
getting it to Congress

02:40:20.170 --> 02:40:23.930
and he was also a great
friend of the kidns of htings

02:40:23.930 --> 02:40:26.280
that we were trying to do.

02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:33.920
Joan Cooney had been at NBC and
then she had been at channel 13

02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:37.620
where she was a commercial
- not a commercial,

02:40:37.620 --> 02:40:42.310
a documentary producer and
had three good documentaries

02:40:42.310 --> 02:40:44.050
to her name.

02:40:44.050 --> 02:40:48.850
So, essentially not only
had the climate of opinion

02:40:48.850 --> 02:40:54.540
in the country been fertilized
I'll say by the events

02:40:54.540 --> 02:40:58.780
of the 1960's, but the
particular people I've mentioend

02:40:58.780 --> 02:41:02.190
were all interested
in the public's use

02:41:02.190 --> 02:41:06.070
of public facilities
and public education.

02:41:06.070 --> 02:41:10.810
They are what made the
idea become possible.

02:41:10.810 --> 02:41:12.310
I think I'll stop
there Jennifer.

02:41:12.310 --> 02:41:13.610
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: Terrific.

02:41:13.610 --> 02:41:15.410
Terrific now thank you.

02:41:15.410 --> 02:41:21.810
[ Applause ]

02:41:21.810 --> 02:41:26.410
Paula. Your work exemplifies
informal educaiton.

02:41:26.410 --> 02:41:29.540
You've helped popularize
and demystify science

02:41:29.540 --> 02:41:32.780
and science educaiton
and you've given exposure

02:41:32.780 --> 02:41:38.240
to some scientists that has made
them as popular as rock stars,

02:41:38.240 --> 02:41:40.460
Neil deGrasse Tyson,
Brian Greene,

02:41:40.460 --> 02:41:44.450
I mean you know it's easy
to go places and people go

02:41:44.450 --> 02:41:49.260
"Oh wow Brian Greene,
string theory".

02:41:49.260 --> 02:41:54.550
And so it's - and then you've
also shown us women and people

02:41:54.550 --> 02:41:58.000
of color in the sciences
routinely throughout

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.180
your series.

02:42:00.180 --> 02:42:06.230
With NOVA what's the origin, how
do we get from there to here?

02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:07.530
&gt;&gt; Paula Apsell: That's good.

02:42:07.530 --> 02:42:10.390
I first of all just want to say
I'm just awed to be setting next

02:42:10.390 --> 02:42:13.580
to Lloyd because my daughter
Natalie is here with me today

02:42:13.580 --> 02:42:18.930
and I just can see in my mind's
eye, this makes me emotional.

02:42:18.930 --> 02:42:21.450
And she and her sisters
little girls woud be sitting

02:42:21.450 --> 02:42:24.530
on that couch every
single day at 4:00,

02:42:24.530 --> 02:42:26.010
their thumbs in their mouth.

02:42:26.010 --> 02:42:28.340
A bomb could have
gone off in that room

02:42:28.340 --> 02:42:29.880
and they would not have moved.

02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:31.870
And what they learned

02:42:31.870 --> 02:42:35.740
from Sesame Street way beyond
the importance of the letters,

02:42:35.740 --> 02:42:39.300
the lessons about life,
about ethics, about morality,

02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:42.750
about how you treat other
people of all different kinds,

02:42:42.750 --> 02:42:45.210
even if they're not
familiar to you,

02:42:45.210 --> 02:42:48.970
and now as everyone
knows I have a grandson.

02:42:48.970 --> 02:42:54.700
And he watches the science
kid and also Sesame Street

02:42:54.700 --> 02:42:56.610
and the other programs on PBS.

02:42:56.610 --> 02:43:00.770
So, as well as being a content
generator, I'm a recipient

02:43:00.770 --> 02:43:07.260
of all the good things that PBS
does for kids and educationally,

02:43:07.260 --> 02:43:10.430
and it's just - really
it's just overwhelming.

02:43:10.430 --> 02:43:14.400
I feel so fortunate
to be a part of this.

02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:16.210
Now on to NOVA.

02:43:16.210 --> 02:43:19.350
So, education is in NOVA's DNA.

02:43:19.350 --> 02:43:22.860
We've been producing content
for teachers and students

02:43:22.860 --> 02:43:25.970
for as long as we've been
on PBS, and that's 44 years

02:43:25.970 --> 02:43:28.580
which is an eternity
in television.

02:43:28.580 --> 02:43:31.010
And now I have to
mention another man

02:43:31.010 --> 02:43:33.040
that I think is a
really great person

02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:36.710
and that is Michael
Lambersino who started NOVA.

02:43:36.710 --> 02:43:40.450
Michael just had -

02:43:40.450 --> 02:43:42.880
[ Applause ]

02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:47.790
Michael just had a really
good idea, very simple.

02:43:47.790 --> 02:43:50.580
His idea was sciecne is
not a collection of facts,

02:43:50.580 --> 02:43:54.640
it's a story and if you tell
the story with characters

02:43:54.640 --> 02:43:57.620
and with visuals then
people will watch

02:43:57.620 --> 02:44:00.370
and they will learn,
but they will enjoy.

02:44:00.370 --> 02:44:04.490
And it will change their
opinion about science and make -

02:44:04.490 --> 02:44:08.100
help them to undersatnd what
an important part of our lives

02:44:08.100 --> 02:44:12.280
and what an important, I
would say cultural institution

02:44:12.280 --> 02:44:14.690
that it is really a thrill

02:44:14.690 --> 02:44:19.120
to get a better understanding
of our world.

02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:24.460
And Michael always knew that
it was very important for NOVA

02:44:24.460 --> 02:44:26.210
to go to teachers as well,

02:44:26.210 --> 02:44:28.790
and they should have
supplementary materials

02:44:28.790 --> 02:44:31.290
that would help them use
NOVA in the classroom.

02:44:31.290 --> 02:44:35.910
So for years and years and
years we made teachers plans,

02:44:35.910 --> 02:44:38.350
which had all sorts of
suggestions and tips

02:44:38.350 --> 02:44:40.500
and activities for
the classroom.

02:44:40.500 --> 02:44:45.340
But teaching changes, education
changes and technology changes.

02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:50.120
And nowit began as teachers
domain at WGBH went to PBS

02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:52.690
as PBS learning media.

02:44:52.690 --> 02:44:56.900
A fabulous digital
library, the central hub

02:44:56.900 --> 02:45:00.980
for all the educational content
produced by all the PBS brands

02:45:00.980 --> 02:45:03.480
and it now reaches more

02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:07.410
than 2 million educators,
which is amazing.

02:45:07.410 --> 02:45:10.420
And WGBH is the stem
lead for PBS LM

02:45:10.420 --> 02:45:16.140
and NOVA itself has contributed
more then 900 resources,

02:45:16.140 --> 02:45:18.930
mainly video clips,
lots of animation

02:45:18.930 --> 02:45:23.970
and these are all contextualized
with teaching standards

02:45:23.970 --> 02:45:27.630
and discussion questions
and background essays

02:45:27.630 --> 02:45:31.120
and we promote these
clips really rigorously

02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:33.890
to teachers at conferences.

02:45:33.890 --> 02:45:38.720
We also create new digital
content like NOVA labs,

02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:42.530
which is a platform of
science games and interactives

02:45:42.530 --> 02:45:44.830
that uses real scientific data.

02:45:44.830 --> 02:45:48.790
And these are actually, they
were originally designed

02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:53.700
for teens to use at home and
not as an in school activity,

02:45:53.700 --> 02:45:56.920
but they turned out to be
really popular with teachers,

02:45:56.920 --> 02:46:00.970
which use them all the time
and actually assign them

02:46:00.970 --> 02:46:03.170
to their students
to do as homework.

02:46:03.170 --> 02:46:06.690
So to date, that platform
has engaged nearly more

02:46:06.690 --> 02:46:09.130
than 4 million unique viewers.

02:46:09.130 --> 02:46:12.950
And our education lab, and
I just find this amazing,

02:46:12.950 --> 02:46:18.040
is NOVA's most visited page,
so I find that amazing.

02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:22.100
We have an upcoming two
hour program on black holes,

02:46:22.100 --> 02:46:25.620
which is hosted by
astrophysicist Janna Levin

02:46:25.620 --> 02:46:30.230
and to go with that we create
an iPad app that invites players

02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:34.250
to navigate the cosmos
by hurling stars

02:46:34.250 --> 02:46:36.340
at various celestial objects.

02:46:36.340 --> 02:46:40.760
Kind of like Angry Birds
but it's for the universe.

02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:46.640
But that's - that's our what we
call our educational content,

02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:51.950
whether it's informal or formal
but science is for everyone.

02:46:51.950 --> 02:46:57.800
And so is NOVA, and so of course
I love it when people tell me

02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:00.660
"I went into science
or engineering

02:47:00.660 --> 02:47:02.980
as a result of watching NOVA".

02:47:02.980 --> 02:47:07.830
But really we want to stoke
curiosity and excitement

02:47:07.830 --> 02:47:10.520
about science in
people of all ages.

02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:14.120
So we have a very
rich historic archive

02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:17.750
that chronicles scientific
research over four decades.

02:47:17.750 --> 02:47:20.780
If you want ot know the
origins of genetic engineering

02:47:20.780 --> 02:47:24.950
or how artificial intelligence
got started you know you can

02:47:24.950 --> 02:47:28.500
really - we've been covering
that throughout the 20th century

02:47:28.500 --> 02:47:32.910
and now 21st century on NOVA
and at any given time we have

02:47:32.910 --> 02:47:37.180
about 100 full length
programs available to everyone

02:47:37.180 --> 02:47:40.090
to watch online on
PBS.org for free.

02:47:40.090 --> 02:47:43.030
And we also reach out
into the community.

02:47:43.030 --> 02:47:49.660
We've created a coalition of
science café's more than 400

02:47:49.660 --> 02:47:54.340
of them and we ourselves,
every month at WGBH studio,

02:47:54.340 --> 02:47:57.920
at the Boston Public Library,
we hold a science café

02:47:57.920 --> 02:47:59.620
for anyone who wants to come.

02:47:59.620 --> 02:48:02.040
And these science
café's are usually held

02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:04.780
at non-traditional settings.

02:48:04.780 --> 02:48:07.370
They're a chance for
people to actually interact

02:48:07.370 --> 02:48:10.400
with real scientists and
it's really kind of amazing

02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:14.620
to know how many people in their
daily life don't get a chance

02:48:14.620 --> 02:48:17.070
to really meet a
scientist and talk to them.

02:48:17.070 --> 02:48:21.380
And I think that's why
people get very wrong ideas

02:48:21.380 --> 02:48:24.750
about sicentisits
and about science.

02:48:24.750 --> 02:48:28.540
And so - and people
really enjoy these settings

02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:29.840
when they're held.

02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:32.620
And an example of this is
we also of our reaching

02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:36.680
out into the community is our
program school of the future,

02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:40.440
which actually looked at the
issue of educational equity

02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:45.840
and what kinds of new techniques
and technologies can be used

02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:47.840
to help equalize things.

02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:54.000
We organzed 293 communtiy
screenings at K12 settings,

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:58.410
at community organizations
and really all over the place.

02:48:58.410 --> 02:49:02.680
And people came and they really
engaged in the discussion

02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:06.180
of how education can be
made better for everyone.

02:49:06.180 --> 02:49:08.840
And finally and this
really touches the point

02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:13.500
that you made Jennier, we want
people from all backgrounds

02:49:13.500 --> 02:49:17.270
to appreciate the importance
of science in our lives

02:49:17.270 --> 02:49:19.150
and the crucial role

02:49:19.150 --> 02:49:22.600
that science literacy
plays in a democracy.

02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:26.210
And now CPB with their
help, we've been able

02:49:26.210 --> 02:49:30.350
to develop short form video that
explains the science behind many

02:49:30.350 --> 02:49:33.720
of the stories that are
dominating the news cycle.

02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:38.580
If you - embedded on all
of our work is the mmandate

02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:42.150
that we have on public media
to reflect the diversity

02:49:42.150 --> 02:49:45.440
of all people and
experiences in our country.

02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:50.670
We are 100% committed to
increasing diversitiy in front

02:49:50.670 --> 02:49:52.690
of and behind the camera

02:49:52.690 --> 02:49:56.090
by actively cultivating
both producers

02:49:56.090 --> 02:49:57.760
and scientists of color.

02:49:57.760 --> 02:50:01.410
And I really invite you to
take a look at any current NOVA

02:50:01.410 --> 02:50:04.150
and you'll be able ot
see what we're doing.

02:50:04.150 --> 02:50:06.160
But equally important to that,

02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:10.150
we're actually expanding the
scope of the stories we tell,

02:50:10.150 --> 02:50:16.070
focusing more on the ways that
science impacts social jsutice.

02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:19.740
Our episode last spring
Poison Water, about the Flint,

02:50:19.740 --> 02:50:22.690
Michigan water crisis
is an exmaple of that

02:50:22.690 --> 02:50:26.800
with all its associated
digital educational content.

02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:32.680
I also believe that this really
illustrated the importance

02:50:32.680 --> 02:50:38.010
of education being embedded in
a production unit like NOVA.

02:50:38.010 --> 02:50:42.350
Our education director Ralph
Bukay who taught biology

02:50:42.350 --> 02:50:46.380
in an inner city high school in
Philadephia and can really share

02:50:46.380 --> 02:50:48.410
that experience with all of us.

02:50:48.410 --> 02:50:51.490
He has a leadership
role in our unit

02:50:51.490 --> 02:50:54.820
and not only does this
integration drive many

02:50:54.820 --> 02:50:57.370
of our initiatives,
but the lessons

02:50:57.370 --> 02:51:02.580
that we learn educational and
digital and broadcast go back

02:51:02.580 --> 02:51:08.010
and forth and they are all
enriched by this integration

02:51:08.010 --> 02:51:12.130
and that helps us better to
serve the American people.

02:51:12.130 --> 02:51:13.930
Thank you.

02:51:13.930 --> 02:51:19.640
[ Applause ]

02:51:19.640 --> 02:51:22.150
&gt;&gt; Jennier Lawson: Kathryn
you've studied children's

02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:26.310
television and Sesame
Street in real depth.

02:51:26.310 --> 02:51:29.160
And you've learned a lot
about the role of the series

02:51:29.160 --> 02:51:32.470
in educating pre-schoolers
but through your work

02:51:32.470 --> 02:51:34.580
and through the particular
angles

02:51:34.580 --> 02:51:37.180
that you have approached Sesame
Street you've learned a lot

02:51:37.180 --> 02:51:39.960
about our society as well.

02:51:39.960 --> 02:51:43.050
And could you share some of
your observations with us?

02:51:43.050 --> 02:51:44.350
&gt;&gt; Kathryn Ostrofsky:
Yeah I think I'm here

02:51:44.350 --> 02:51:47.900
to represent the generation
that did grow up on PBS

02:51:47.900 --> 02:51:52.300
and my education of course
started with Sesame Street

02:51:52.300 --> 02:51:53.970
and is continuing
with Sesame Street

02:51:53.970 --> 02:51:56.260
through my graduate school
and now in my teaching.

02:51:56.260 --> 02:52:00.530
I just never stopped
watching it.

02:52:00.530 --> 02:52:05.470
So I've been asked to talk about
public broadcasting as history,

02:52:05.470 --> 02:52:09.890
and that's why I use Sesame
Street as a historical source.

02:52:09.890 --> 02:52:12.490
But so much of public
broadcasting of course,

02:52:12.490 --> 02:52:14.650
can be used as historical
sources.

02:52:14.650 --> 02:52:17.400
And the way that we
often think about that is

02:52:17.400 --> 02:52:21.460
that public broadcasting
recorded our past,

02:52:21.460 --> 02:52:24.320
the public affairs
shows, the talk shows,

02:52:24.320 --> 02:52:29.540
recordings of great
performances are now an archive

02:52:29.540 --> 02:52:30.840
of our history.

02:52:30.840 --> 02:52:33.730
And that is true,
but as a scholar

02:52:33.730 --> 02:52:36.830
and as a teacher I am
more intersted in thinking

02:52:36.830 --> 02:52:39.530
about the ways that public
broadcasting is our history

02:52:39.530 --> 02:52:42.080
because it is a forum,
it is a vehicle,

02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:44.690
a tool for which we seek
to understand our past

02:52:44.690 --> 02:52:46.650
and our present and
shape our future.

02:52:46.650 --> 02:52:49.190
I think this is a tehme that's
been running throughout all the

02:52:49.190 --> 02:52:51.740
panel this afternoon, the theme

02:52:51.740 --> 02:52:56.180
of democratization
and interactivity.

02:52:56.180 --> 02:53:00.640
So this happens from both
angles, from the producers

02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:03.160
as well from the audiences.

02:53:03.160 --> 02:53:06.530
From the producers, the way that
they approach their programs

02:53:06.530 --> 02:53:09.450
and Laird just doesn't report
the news, he analyzes it.

02:53:09.450 --> 02:53:12.320
Dick Cavett doesn't just
ask boilerplate questions

02:53:12.320 --> 02:53:14.590
of celebrities, he engages
them in a conversation

02:53:14.590 --> 02:53:18.020
that can take any turn.

02:53:19.720 --> 02:53:24.410
Even almost coming
to physical blows.

02:53:24.410 --> 02:53:27.680
Lloyd Morrisett and Jim Gance
Cooney did not just television

02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:30.510
to teach letters and numbers,
they designed a program

02:53:30.510 --> 02:53:33.050
that reflected the
cultural sensibilities

02:53:33.050 --> 02:53:37.200
of the urban minority children
that they hoped to serve.

02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:40.860
And they built the program
to be able to evolve

02:53:40.860 --> 02:53:42.910
and to be responsive

02:53:42.910 --> 02:53:45.380
to society's changing
educational needs

02:53:45.380 --> 02:53:47.040
and cultural needs.

02:53:47.040 --> 02:53:51.110
So, all of these progrms are
- they're not just series

02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:54.240
of short conversations
or presentations,

02:53:54.240 --> 02:53:58.790
rather they are decades long
conversations between producers

02:53:58.790 --> 02:54:03.300
and audiences about
issues that matter to us.

02:54:03.300 --> 02:54:08.690
So public broadcasting
creates in particualr,

02:54:08.690 --> 02:54:12.620
creates a really rich
record of these discussions

02:54:12.620 --> 02:54:16.100
of these long conversations
because it's funding comes

02:54:16.100 --> 02:54:17.400
from the government

02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:21.480
and philanthropic foundations
and viewers like you.

02:54:21.480 --> 02:54:28.650
They producers and stations
constantly have to articulate

02:54:28.650 --> 02:54:31.350
to their audiences and to their
funders what they're doing,

02:54:31.350 --> 02:54:34.560
why they're doing it like that
and what impact it's having.

02:54:34.560 --> 02:54:38.150
It creates a paper trail that
is amazing for historians.

02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:44.270
Because public broadcasting
is for the people

02:54:44.270 --> 02:54:48.060
and it's mobilizing this
technology not for advertisers

02:54:48.060 --> 02:54:51.060
but for the audiences
themselves, the audiences,

02:54:51.060 --> 02:54:55.790
educators, social activities
have through the years felt

02:54:55.790 --> 02:54:59.580
that they could and should
make their voices heard

02:54:59.580 --> 02:55:03.490
in public media as a
collaborative effort

02:55:03.490 --> 02:55:07.830
to improve programs or to use
public broadcasting as a tool

02:55:07.830 --> 02:55:09.830
for broader social change.

02:55:09.830 --> 02:55:13.510
So they do talk back
to their televisions

02:55:13.510 --> 02:55:16.020
as Nicholas Johnson suggested.

02:55:16.020 --> 02:55:20.660
So in the case of Sesame Street
for instance, the producers

02:55:20.660 --> 02:55:25.410
and the audiences agreed that
the show should provide models

02:55:25.410 --> 02:55:28.870
for ideal community
interactions.

02:55:28.870 --> 02:55:34.450
But as Lloyd was just talking
about there's a lot going

02:55:34.450 --> 02:55:36.020
on in the 60's and 70's.

02:55:36.020 --> 02:55:39.740
There's Civil Rights, cultural
pride movements proliferating

02:55:39.740 --> 02:55:42.360
and fragmenting in the 1970's.

02:55:42.360 --> 02:55:46.020
So, all of these people who
are invested in Sesame Street

02:55:46.020 --> 02:55:50.370
in some way don't agree on what
that ideal community should look

02:55:50.370 --> 02:55:54.340
like or sound like, how
those people should behave.

02:55:54.340 --> 02:55:57.710
So, cast members,
staff, parents, critics,

02:55:57.710 --> 02:56:00.690
advocacy groups like the
National Organization of Women

02:56:00.690 --> 02:56:05.800
and the UCLA Chicano Studies
Center had ongoing discussions

02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:08.240
about characters - how
characters should speak,

02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:12.330
what musical guests to
feature, how to represent

02:56:12.330 --> 02:56:16.230
and celebrate diversity without
perpetuating stereotypes.

02:56:16.230 --> 02:56:18.480
And there was no easy answers

02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:21.780
and luckily Sesame Street is a
variety show so they could sort

02:56:21.780 --> 02:56:24.970
of experiment with
all these things

02:56:24.970 --> 02:56:28.260
at the same time
and see what worked.

02:56:28.260 --> 02:56:34.140
So - but this engagement with
social issues also happens long

02:56:34.140 --> 02:56:38.100
after the programs first air.

02:56:38.100 --> 02:56:42.440
And it's - it has
become cliché to say

02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:47.250
that documetnaries bringthe past
to life, but they certainly do

02:56:47.250 --> 02:56:52.410
in my classroom, not
just metaphorically

02:56:52.410 --> 02:56:55.740
but these programs
often have the power

02:56:55.740 --> 02:56:58.470
to continue the traditions
that they discuss.

02:56:58.470 --> 02:57:00.100
The first episode
of Eyes on the Prize

02:57:00.100 --> 02:57:03.940
for example is called Awakenings
and it shows how media coverage

02:57:03.940 --> 02:57:08.400
of the lynchings, lynching of
Emmett Till and the sham trial

02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:17.120
that allowed his murderers to
go free led to a published -

02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:20.710
public consciousness about
the conditions of Jim Crowe

02:57:20.710 --> 02:57:23.640
and inspired Civil
Rights actions.

02:57:23.640 --> 02:57:26.800
Watching the documentary itself
is a consciousness raising

02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:29.080
experience for my students

02:57:29.080 --> 02:57:33.280
and there is no more
powerful demonstration for why

02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:37.130
so many people risked their
lives for Civil Rights.

02:57:37.130 --> 02:57:39.270
One episode of the
American Experience series

02:57:39.270 --> 02:57:43.110
on Latino Americans
covers the 1968 walk outs

02:57:43.110 --> 02:57:46.350
through which Chicano high
school students took control

02:57:46.350 --> 02:57:49.820
of their education and sought
to understand their place -

02:57:49.820 --> 02:57:51.680
the place of themselves
and their families

02:57:51.680 --> 02:57:54.660
in American history
and American society.

02:57:54.660 --> 02:57:56.120
And for one of my
students a couple

02:57:56.120 --> 02:57:59.860
of years ago she had heard about
the walk outs from her mother

02:57:59.860 --> 02:58:05.790
who had participated in them,
but to see those events depicted

02:58:05.790 --> 02:58:12.020
on national television, in a
US history survey class did the

02:58:12.020 --> 02:58:16.980
same thing for her, it inspired
her to take her own education

02:58:16.980 --> 02:58:21.320
into her own hands and figure
out her place in society.

02:58:21.320 --> 02:58:26.070
So, public television, we're
here talking about preservation.

02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:30.410
Public television and radio
need to be preserved not just

02:58:30.410 --> 02:58:33.550
because they have recorded
history, because they continue

02:58:33.550 --> 02:58:37.630
to be the material that
we use every day to engage

02:58:37.630 --> 02:58:43.510
with our past or our
future, shape our future.

02:58:43.510 --> 02:58:48.740
[ Applause ]

02:58:48.740 --> 02:58:50.670
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: I think your
comments underscore what has

02:58:50.670 --> 02:58:53.190
been said too at some
of the other panels

02:58:53.190 --> 02:58:56.970
about the incredible
importance of the material,

02:58:56.970 --> 02:59:00.510
not just during the time
that it is broadcast

02:59:00.510 --> 02:59:03.740
but it's archival
value into the future.

02:59:03.740 --> 02:59:06.580
Before we come back
to preservation,

02:59:06.580 --> 02:59:10.630
I'd like to go back to Lloyd for
a quick question that relates

02:59:10.630 --> 02:59:12.920
to your background
in psychology too,

02:59:12.920 --> 02:59:18.330
and that is that for example a
national study recently revealed

02:59:18.330 --> 02:59:21.810
that 50% of American
children under the age

02:59:21.810 --> 02:59:25.500
of 18 have experienced
a traumatic event

02:59:25.500 --> 02:59:27.540
such as witnessing violent acts

02:59:27.540 --> 02:59:30.610
or experiencing natural
disasters.

02:59:30.610 --> 02:59:36.110
Last month Sesame Street, Sesame
Workshop launched an initiatve

02:59:36.110 --> 02:59:40.010
to help children cope with
these traumatic experiences.

02:59:40.010 --> 02:59:44.600
And Sesame Street puppets have
often in the past been used

02:59:44.600 --> 02:59:47.950
to help children talk
about events like a death

02:59:47.950 --> 02:59:50.160
in a family or divorce.

02:59:50.160 --> 02:59:55.140
And when you and Joan
were starting Sesame,

02:59:55.140 --> 03:00:00.240
did you envision this kind of
therapeutic role for the series

03:00:00.240 --> 03:00:03.910
in its early days, or is
that something that evolved?

03:00:03.910 --> 03:00:06.320
&gt;&gt; Lloyd Morrisett: It evolved.

03:00:06.320 --> 03:00:09.560
The early days question
we were tasked

03:00:09.560 --> 03:00:13.580
with answering can
television teach anything?

03:00:13.580 --> 03:00:18.820
We had to answer
that with a positive

03:00:18.820 --> 03:00:20.570
in order to gain more funding.

03:00:20.570 --> 03:00:26.570
That was the hard work of it.

03:00:26.570 --> 03:00:31.560
So initially we concentrated
on things that were taught

03:00:31.560 --> 03:00:34.990
in school, needed to be
taught in school, letters

03:00:34.990 --> 03:00:37.510
and numbers and so on.

03:00:37.510 --> 03:00:40.470
And could be easily measured;
those were the things

03:00:40.470 --> 03:00:43.230
that we were really
trying to look out.

03:00:43.230 --> 03:00:46.360
And fortunately the study
that came out showed

03:00:46.360 --> 03:00:49.650
that people watched
more learned more.

03:00:49.650 --> 03:00:52.800
With that start and with the
confidence that we were going

03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:57.040
to be able to continue once we
got a second season funding,

03:00:57.040 --> 03:01:00.450
we then began to broaden
the curriculum to take

03:01:00.450 --> 03:01:03.810
into account some of the things
that you're talking about.

03:01:03.810 --> 03:01:13.140
Although the real change
probably came much later.

03:01:13.140 --> 03:01:19.020
The military families project
was probably the most imoprtant

03:01:19.020 --> 03:01:21.320
change in that regard.

03:01:21.320 --> 03:01:26.180
And now of course as you
mentioned traumatic events,

03:01:26.180 --> 03:01:31.240
abuse, autism would
be another example

03:01:31.240 --> 03:01:35.080
where we would not have been
able to do that initially,

03:01:35.080 --> 03:01:40.660
but as the program evolved we
have been able to do more of it.

03:01:40.660 --> 03:01:41.960
&gt;&gt; Paula Apsell:
I'd like to address

03:01:41.960 --> 03:01:45.260
that issue can public
television teach anything;

03:01:45.260 --> 03:01:48.850
I think it's really an important
question and very important

03:01:48.850 --> 03:01:51.830
for NOVA in a way
because part of our -

03:01:51.830 --> 03:01:56.410
we're always discussing was
we were you know 40 years ago

03:01:56.410 --> 03:01:59.990
and we're still discussing
it is our primary function

03:01:59.990 --> 03:02:01.950
to educate and to entertain.

03:02:01.950 --> 03:02:03.250
We're always kind of talking

03:02:03.250 --> 03:02:06.010
about how you blend
those two things.

03:02:06.010 --> 03:02:09.620
But when you think back to
your own sceicne classes

03:02:09.620 --> 03:02:13.880
and how the teacher was
always talking aobut things

03:02:13.880 --> 03:02:17.720
that you couldn't understand
what he or she was talking

03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:20.120
about because you
couldn't visualize it.

03:02:20.120 --> 03:02:23.770
You had absolutely no
frame of reference for it.

03:02:23.770 --> 03:02:31.500
And I think this one of the huge
values to PBS learning media

03:02:31.500 --> 03:02:37.150
and to their whole -
their huge stem collectin

03:02:37.150 --> 03:02:41.670
because it helps -
it provides visuals.

03:02:41.670 --> 03:02:43.930
So when you're talking about
a volcano and what's going

03:02:43.930 --> 03:02:46.070
on in the molten magma
under the earth -

03:02:46.070 --> 03:02:48.540
I mean who really knows what
that means when you're a kid

03:02:48.540 --> 03:02:51.100
and you've never
lived near a volcano

03:02:51.100 --> 03:02:52.710
and you've never seen one.

03:02:52.710 --> 03:02:54.710
But here you can
have an animation

03:02:54.710 --> 03:02:58.530
and it can be contextualized
by your teacher

03:02:58.530 --> 03:03:02.510
because there are -
the archive helps.

03:03:02.510 --> 03:03:06.650
So I really I just hink
in terms of science,

03:03:06.650 --> 03:03:10.040
visuals are just so important.

03:03:10.040 --> 03:03:14.960
They also help both kids
and everyone take the world

03:03:14.960 --> 03:03:16.550
from another perspective.

03:03:16.550 --> 03:03:20.520
The design to show you things
that you can't see for yourself

03:03:20.520 --> 03:03:24.710
and that in a way,
expands your world.

03:03:24.710 --> 03:03:28.980
And that to me, is just
really one of the benefits

03:03:28.980 --> 03:03:33.550
of the educational uses of
our material and of the fact

03:03:33.550 --> 03:03:36.910
that we are fortunate enough to
be able to produce these things

03:03:36.910 --> 03:03:38.710
and have the resources to do

03:03:38.710 --> 03:03:43.740
so even though it's always a
struggle in the first place.

03:03:43.740 --> 03:03:46.710
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: And you've
had in many cases the nature

03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:50.620
of your funding on places like
the National Science Foundation

03:03:50.620 --> 03:03:52.410
or the funding that
you've received

03:03:52.410 --> 03:03:59.500
for Sesame Workshop has received
is required rigorous evaluation,

03:03:59.500 --> 03:04:00.800
right?

03:04:00.800 --> 03:04:04.500
And testing as a
part of the proving

03:04:04.500 --> 03:04:07.100
that it has this
educational benefit.

03:04:07.100 --> 03:04:09.790
&gt;&gt; Paula Apsell: Oh
rigorous evaluation.

03:04:09.790 --> 03:04:13.220
But it's not - now one thing

03:04:13.220 --> 03:04:16.320
that the National Science
Foundation and actually a lot

03:04:16.320 --> 03:04:19.930
of other funders are going
off to is they want you

03:04:19.930 --> 03:04:22.210
to use your material
not just to evaluate it,

03:04:22.210 --> 03:04:26.240
to see if it's any good but
they want it to add to the body

03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:31.130
of learning of how people learn

03:04:31.130 --> 03:04:36.050
from the visual media
whether they get more

03:04:36.050 --> 03:04:38.940
out of an hour long documentary,
whether they get more

03:04:38.940 --> 03:04:41.340
out of short form video,
what the difference is,

03:04:41.340 --> 03:04:44.130
what the difference is in their
attitudes towards science.

03:04:44.130 --> 03:04:48.790
So we're really accumulating
with some of our projects

03:04:48.790 --> 03:04:54.110
and we're workign with academics
on this because we're not -

03:04:54.110 --> 03:04:58.880
I mean I'm a TV producers,
I couldn't begin to figure

03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:01.280
out how to do these projects.

03:05:01.280 --> 03:05:04.960
But to use them to really
understand the fundamentals

03:05:04.960 --> 03:05:06.260
of science learning.

03:05:06.260 --> 03:05:07.560
And it's very gratifying

03:05:07.560 --> 03:05:09.840
that our material
can be used for that.

03:05:09.840 --> 03:05:11.170
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: Now
Kathryn you had mentioned

03:05:11.170 --> 03:05:13.640
to me a little earlier
that in addition

03:05:13.640 --> 03:05:17.400
to the audio/visual materials
being so incredibly important

03:05:17.400 --> 03:05:20.270
that there are other
resources like the kind

03:05:20.270 --> 03:05:24.160
that Paula just mentioned or
the notes from the creation

03:05:24.160 --> 03:05:27.840
of a program that
producers might just think

03:05:27.840 --> 03:05:29.390
as real throw away.

03:05:29.390 --> 03:05:34.230
That some of that has archival
value for scholars like you?

03:05:34.230 --> 03:05:35.530
&gt;&gt; Kathryn Ostrofsky: Yes.

03:05:35.530 --> 03:05:41.930
I've been using the Sesame
Street's research notes too.

03:05:41.930 --> 03:05:46.780
I'm struck by the
parallels between the studies

03:05:46.780 --> 03:05:52.060
and the outreach that NOVA
and Sesame Street have had.

03:05:52.060 --> 03:05:54.410
They're also a paper
trail for learning

03:05:54.410 --> 03:05:56.020
about how we learn from media.

03:05:56.020 --> 03:06:02.160
Learning about what the history
of the discipline of psychology

03:06:02.160 --> 03:06:06.720
or education or whoever
is doing these studies is.

03:06:06.720 --> 03:06:11.310
And they're also
fun for me to look

03:06:11.310 --> 03:06:12.700
at from a humanities
perspective,

03:06:12.700 --> 03:06:17.770
because you do have certain
things that you're testing

03:06:17.770 --> 03:06:20.880
for your show, but that's
doesn't mean that's all we can

03:06:20.880 --> 03:06:23.500
learn from that data;
so I go in and read it

03:06:23.500 --> 03:06:25.830
from a historians point of view

03:06:25.830 --> 03:06:29.280
and find completely
differnet information

03:06:29.280 --> 03:06:35.060
about for instance
cultural differences

03:06:35.060 --> 03:06:39.030
between the Spanish speaking
and English speaking kids

03:06:39.030 --> 03:06:41.070
about how they're
responding to music,

03:06:41.070 --> 03:06:43.510
which is not what
was being tested.

03:06:43.510 --> 03:06:47.420
It was how there was
learning the Spanish language.

03:06:47.420 --> 03:06:50.750
But there's more
information there then is used

03:06:50.750 --> 03:06:56.460
in your studies, so your studies
have broader impact beyond what

03:06:56.460 --> 03:06:58.170
you're doing with them.

03:06:58.170 --> 03:07:00.190
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson:
And as we talk

03:07:00.190 --> 03:07:04.190
about these preserving content
and materials from public media

03:07:04.190 --> 03:07:07.170
and these documents, I
just also want to mention

03:07:07.170 --> 03:07:10.900
that we problably haven't
represented fully enough the

03:07:10.900 --> 03:07:13.190
broadest range of public media

03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:16.950
because there's also
culture and the arts.

03:07:16.950 --> 03:07:20.190
And that there is
so much I think,

03:07:20.190 --> 03:07:23.490
in terms of performac
program, cultural programs

03:07:23.490 --> 03:07:26.500
that are created
by producers both

03:07:26.500 --> 03:07:28.130
at the national and local level.

03:07:28.130 --> 03:07:32.800
And so I also want to bring
that into the discussion as well

03:07:32.800 --> 03:07:36.020
as public media creating
a really,

03:07:36.020 --> 03:07:39.370
really robust archive
of local content.

03:07:39.370 --> 03:07:41.820
Most public media stations

03:07:41.820 --> 03:07:45.520
and public radio really
do an incredible amount

03:07:45.520 --> 03:07:48.940
at the local level and so
there's a wealth of material

03:07:48.940 --> 03:07:52.730
and a history of commmunity
that's being created there

03:07:52.730 --> 03:07:54.030
as well.

03:07:54.030 --> 03:07:59.590
Now we have talked about
reaching the youngest viewers

03:07:59.590 --> 03:08:03.200
and we've also talked
about adults in many ways,

03:08:03.200 --> 03:08:07.040
although I must stay that
you're going far beyond adults

03:08:07.040 --> 03:08:11.350
when I look at slimy,
gross science programs

03:08:11.350 --> 03:08:14.840
that NOVA is a part of.

03:08:14.840 --> 03:08:19.430
Gross science or some
of your other programs

03:08:19.430 --> 03:08:23.800
that are what makes you
vomit is a - so I can -

03:08:23.800 --> 03:08:25.240
&gt;&gt; Paula Apsell: I
mean it's your body,

03:08:25.240 --> 03:08:27.050
you've got to undersatnd it.

03:08:27.050 --> 03:08:29.620
&gt;&gt; Jennier Lawson: So I can
imagine you attracting a much

03:08:29.620 --> 03:08:32.580
broader age range
but that has been one

03:08:32.580 --> 03:08:35.820
of the challenges I think
tha thas plagued public media

03:08:35.820 --> 03:08:37.120
for a number of years.

03:08:37.120 --> 03:08:39.900
And I want to start with you
Lloyd and just going back

03:08:39.900 --> 03:08:43.760
to the question did
Sesame Workshop

03:08:43.760 --> 03:08:48.340
as a children's television
workshop, what efforts were made

03:08:48.340 --> 03:08:53.700
in the sort of earlier years in
trying to go beyond preschoolers

03:08:53.700 --> 03:08:57.890
and to reach the
pre-teens and teenagers?

03:08:57.890 --> 03:08:59.190
&gt;&gt; Lloyd Morrisett: Well

03:08:59.190 --> 03:09:03.010
as Paula has mentione din
producing a television show you

03:09:03.010 --> 03:09:06.210
have to atract the audience as
well as teach them something.

03:09:06.210 --> 03:09:10.320
And so Sesame Street was
designed in the beginning -

03:09:10.320 --> 03:09:13.840
I need to start that again.

03:09:13.840 --> 03:09:17.230
The viewing conditions in 1969
are extremely different then

03:09:17.230 --> 03:09:18.530
they are today.

03:09:18.530 --> 03:09:22.330
In 1969 typically families
had one television set,

03:09:22.330 --> 03:09:26.480
the family watched together
and the parents could act

03:09:26.480 --> 03:09:29.490
as an intermediary between
what was on the television set

03:09:29.490 --> 03:09:31.760
and what the child learned.

03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:35.030
You say, "Johnny
did you see that A"?

03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:37.390
or "Johnny take a look
at what's coming up next,

03:09:37.390 --> 03:09:41.670
it's going to be like" and
that gets Johnny's attention

03:09:41.670 --> 03:09:45.700
to something on the set that
you want to teach about.

03:09:45.700 --> 03:09:53.320
Now I think at the - I saw
that maybe 90% of adolescents

03:09:53.320 --> 03:09:56.930
and above have smart phones.

03:09:56.930 --> 03:10:02.610
Television sets are numerous and
often the child at whatever age,

03:10:02.610 --> 03:10:07.450
two or three even controls
the set himself or herself.

03:10:07.450 --> 03:10:11.710
So the problem of
maintaining an audience

03:10:11.710 --> 03:10:13.630
and know what audience
you're really trying

03:10:13.630 --> 03:10:15.590
to reach is much harder.

03:10:15.590 --> 03:10:18.450
I don't think we've
figured it out yet.

03:10:18.450 --> 03:10:20.710
But we certianly had the
idea from the beginning

03:10:20.710 --> 03:10:23.080
that the adults had to be
atracted to the program

03:10:23.080 --> 03:10:24.380
as well as the children.

03:10:24.380 --> 03:10:28.770
&gt;&gt; Paul Apsell: I used to like
- 4:00 I was pretty tired.

03:10:28.770 --> 03:10:32.240
I'd sit there and we'd
watch Sesame Street.

03:10:32.240 --> 03:10:34.450
It appealed to adults as well.

03:10:34.450 --> 03:10:37.170
I mean I felt like
there were two levels

03:10:37.170 --> 03:10:38.770
that it was operating on.

03:10:38.770 --> 03:10:40.070
&gt;&gt; Lloyd Morrisett: Laugh in,

03:10:40.070 --> 03:10:43.940
which some of you may remember
was a very important precursor

03:10:43.940 --> 03:10:45.370
to what we did.

03:10:45.370 --> 03:10:50.690
We used a lot of the Laugh In
techniques in the early shows.

03:10:50.690 --> 03:10:52.240
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: I think
it very definitely did.

03:10:52.240 --> 03:10:56.060
The one piece that I remember
is I think it was Patti Labelle

03:10:56.060 --> 03:11:01.240
singing "I love my X, I
miss my X" and there's

03:11:01.240 --> 03:11:04.520
of course the letter
X on the screen.

03:11:04.520 --> 03:11:08.010
But the look in her eyes
suggested otherwise.

03:11:10.080 --> 03:11:13.860
So it definitely seemed as if
it was very consciously designed

03:11:13.860 --> 03:11:15.160
to -

03:11:15.160 --> 03:11:16.460
&gt;&gt; Lloyd Morrisett: It
was, no question of that.

03:11:16.460 --> 03:11:20.610
The writers particularly
enjoyed doing that.

03:11:20.610 --> 03:11:22.500
They liked to write one liners

03:11:22.500 --> 03:11:25.800
and kids didn't get
it, but the adults did.

03:11:25.800 --> 03:11:27.740
&gt;&gt; Paula Apsell: In
terms of the ages,

03:11:27.740 --> 03:11:32.610
yes but I mean we all
worry in public media

03:11:32.610 --> 03:11:34.190
about an aging audience.

03:11:34.190 --> 03:11:37.900
I mean it's like
discussed constantly

03:11:37.900 --> 03:11:40.050
and we're sweating constantly.

03:11:40.050 --> 03:11:41.370
We try to really figure it

03:11:41.370 --> 03:11:43.780
out how we can appeal
to younger people.

03:11:43.780 --> 03:11:47.860
One thing we find is that
we have a very different

03:11:47.860 --> 03:11:50.080
audience online.

03:11:50.080 --> 03:11:52.440
That the audience
online is much younger.

03:11:52.440 --> 03:11:57.030
And so the idea is that the
uadience online we do know

03:11:57.030 --> 03:11:59.460
that they love to watch our
shows on their computer.

03:11:59.460 --> 03:12:02.400
They love short form video, I
guess that's the whole thing

03:12:02.400 --> 03:12:04.290
about the attention
span, I don't know.

03:12:04.290 --> 03:12:08.720
But they also like to
watch our short form videos

03:12:08.720 --> 03:12:12.170
and if we take them off, oh
our lawyers are right there.

03:12:12.170 --> 03:12:15.170
But I have to say in two
minutes they're pirated and put

03:12:15.170 --> 03:12:18.550
on You Tube and you take them
down and they go back up.

03:12:18.550 --> 03:12:20.690
It's like a pop up,
whack a mole.

03:12:20.690 --> 03:12:23.240
It is really amazing,
so they really -

03:12:23.240 --> 03:12:26.510
I think this is a key to us.

03:12:26.510 --> 03:12:29.750
Young people we know
do not have televisions

03:12:29.750 --> 03:12:31.670
and watch television that much.

03:12:31.670 --> 03:12:35.340
They watch on their phone,
they watch on their computer.

03:12:35.340 --> 03:12:42.470
The hope is that they
will, youngsters do grow up

03:12:42.470 --> 03:12:46.870
and very often they have
families and their life changes

03:12:46.870 --> 03:12:51.540
and it starts to - and they
start to realize the value

03:12:51.540 --> 03:12:57.220
of public media and they start
to join their local station.

03:12:57.220 --> 03:13:01.650
And I think that there is,
maybe I'm just an optimist.

03:13:01.650 --> 03:13:06.010
But I think if we can
keep reaching out to them

03:13:06.010 --> 03:13:08.300
and hold them close to us

03:13:08.300 --> 03:13:12.910
by various different
forms ofwhat we do,

03:13:12.910 --> 03:13:18.240
we will migrate them in
a direction that many

03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:20.720
of them will be watching
our programs.

03:13:20.720 --> 03:13:23.080
Maybe that's just optimistic.

03:13:23.080 --> 03:13:26.870
&gt;&gt; Kathryn Ostrofsky: I think
there's an uptapped potential

03:13:26.870 --> 03:13:32.540
for that middle audience
between childrens and adults.

03:13:32.540 --> 03:13:35.950
Certainly my students,
they're adults but they -

03:13:35.950 --> 03:13:41.350
one of the things that I try
to do with the documetnaries

03:13:41.350 --> 03:13:45.560
that I show in class is to
not just show a documentary

03:13:45.560 --> 03:13:46.860
but do something with it.

03:13:46.860 --> 03:13:48.160
And there are a few
documentaries

03:13:48.160 --> 03:13:51.870
that tell us something about
the historical profession.

03:13:51.870 --> 03:13:54.310
My freshman are watching
A Midwive's Tale

03:13:54.310 --> 03:13:56.680
because I'm not in class today.

03:13:56.680 --> 03:14:00.460
And my seniors are
wathicng American

03:14:00.460 --> 03:14:05.040
Experience Documentaries.

03:14:05.040 --> 03:14:09.960
But I - I - you can use
these documentaries to teach

03:14:09.960 --> 03:14:11.570
about narrative structure,

03:14:11.570 --> 03:14:14.650
since they use narrative
structure we just ehard.

03:14:14.650 --> 03:14:17.010
You can teach them
about media literacy,

03:14:17.010 --> 03:14:19.990
which I think is
really important skill

03:14:19.990 --> 03:14:23.610
that they are not coming
to college with these days,

03:14:23.610 --> 03:14:26.820
and we need it more than ever.

03:14:26.820 --> 03:14:30.820
So there are creative ways

03:14:30.820 --> 03:14:35.830
to use these programs beyond
simply the formal education

03:14:35.830 --> 03:14:39.530
or informal education that
they were designed for.

03:14:41.780 --> 03:14:45.520
&gt;&gt; Lloyd Morrisett: Jennifer you
haven't said anything about it

03:14:45.520 --> 03:14:51.610
but the title Presrving
Public Media has two meanings.

03:14:51.610 --> 03:14:58.530
It means archivally and it
also means continuing it.

03:14:58.530 --> 03:15:03.750
And we do not now have
Newt Minow at the FCC.

03:15:03.750 --> 03:15:08.360
We don't have John Gardener
at HEW and I would think

03:15:08.360 --> 03:15:11.960
that there should be a
considerable amount of concern

03:15:11.960 --> 03:15:14.510
about the enduring health

03:15:14.510 --> 03:15:18.400
under the current
auspices of public media.

03:15:19.570 --> 03:15:20.870
&gt;&gt; Jennier Lawson: I thought

03:15:20.870 --> 03:15:23.910
that it was really quite
heartening to hear with some

03:15:23.910 --> 03:15:26.630
of the earlier panels
who addressed that.

03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:29.380
I thought it was really quite
heartening to hear their level

03:15:29.380 --> 03:15:34.180
of optimism about public
broadcasting and it's future

03:15:34.180 --> 03:15:36.150
and it's potential in that way.

03:15:36.150 --> 03:15:38.960
But I welcome your
thoughts about this.

03:15:38.960 --> 03:15:41.910
&gt;&gt; Paula Apsell: I was
going to say one thing is

03:15:41.910 --> 03:15:46.120
that I think we just talked
a minute or so about age.

03:15:46.120 --> 03:15:51.120
I mean the hope is that the
American public will demand the

03:15:51.120 --> 03:15:52.920
preservaiton of public media.

03:15:52.920 --> 03:15:55.700
You know we have to
have our fans out there.

03:15:55.700 --> 03:15:59.580
They are our biggest asset,
and I think many of you

03:15:59.580 --> 03:16:05.440
in this room remember under
few years ago, decades ago,

03:16:05.440 --> 03:16:07.660
I don't remember when
it was in the 90's

03:16:07.660 --> 03:16:10.880
when public media was
really threatened.

03:16:10.880 --> 03:16:13.790
And people wrote letters,
millions of letters

03:16:13.790 --> 03:16:17.230
and said no absolutely not, you
cannot take this away from us.

03:16:17.230 --> 03:16:20.680
That is our prservation,
that is our guarantee.

03:16:20.680 --> 03:16:24.770
So the concern I have is
yes indeed we want to expand

03:16:24.770 --> 03:16:26.830
and get younger people.

03:16:26.830 --> 03:16:30.830
Listen I love my older
viewers, keep watching.

03:16:30.830 --> 03:16:36.260
Oldies but goodies, I love
you okay, don't stop waching.

03:16:36.260 --> 03:16:38.390
People are living
longer and longer.

03:16:38.390 --> 03:16:40.050
So it's great.

03:16:40.050 --> 03:16:43.470
We do want to get younger
people but we also want to get,

03:16:43.470 --> 03:16:45.380
I know this is near
and dear to your heart.

03:16:45.380 --> 03:16:47.600
We want to get more diversity.

03:16:47.600 --> 03:16:53.500
Not just because we're ethical
people, but also becauase

03:16:53.500 --> 03:16:58.480
that is our survival, the
American demographic is changing

03:16:58.480 --> 03:17:00.360
and we have to change with it.

03:17:00.360 --> 03:17:07.430
And my job is to really find
ways to - and choose topics

03:17:07.430 --> 03:17:12.890
that show people sceince
belongs to you, not just to me.

03:17:12.890 --> 03:17:18.440
Listen sicence has been
white, we all know that.

03:17:18.440 --> 03:17:23.150
It's changing it's bringing
many more minoritis into it.

03:17:23.150 --> 03:17:25.450
We used to tear our
hair out to try

03:17:25.450 --> 03:17:28.220
and find minority scientists
to put on the screen.

03:17:28.220 --> 03:17:33.080
Now it's really - you know in
some fields it's chalelnging

03:17:33.080 --> 03:17:37.360
but in many it's really not
hard at all That's great.

03:17:37.360 --> 03:17:41.570
So one way is to really make
sure that we have scentists

03:17:41.570 --> 03:17:45.960
of all different colors and
all different backgrounds

03:17:45.960 --> 03:17:47.260
on the screen.

03:17:47.260 --> 03:17:50.560
Another way is in the choice
of topics that we have

03:17:50.560 --> 03:17:57.140
to choose topics that take
into account people's concerns.

03:17:57.140 --> 03:18:00.410
And so hopefully this is not
something that's going ot

03:18:00.410 --> 03:18:01.710
be accomplished.

03:18:01.710 --> 03:18:05.690
We're not going ot expand our
percentage of minorities from 9

03:18:05.690 --> 03:18:09.120
or 10% to 25% over night.

03:18:09.120 --> 03:18:13.350
But my hope is that if we do
it right, we tell good stories

03:18:13.350 --> 03:18:16.720
and we'r emuch more inclusive
in topic choice and people

03:18:16.720 --> 03:18:19.830
that people will
respond by watching.

03:18:19.830 --> 03:18:23.230
And you know when we took our
show poison water to Flint,

03:18:23.230 --> 03:18:25.420
and we showed it in Flint.

03:18:25.420 --> 03:18:28.960
And that ocmmunity, you
know we just - it was -

03:18:28.960 --> 03:18:33.390
the reaction was just so amazing
this group of people who were -

03:18:33.390 --> 03:18:35.650
these people were
citizen scientists.

03:18:35.650 --> 03:18:38.570
They did not wait and
rely on scientists to come

03:18:38.570 --> 03:18:40.050
in and do it for them.

03:18:40.050 --> 03:18:44.230
They figured out more than
the scientists in a lot

03:18:44.230 --> 03:18:48.710
of the agencies what was
going wrong with their pipes.

03:18:48.710 --> 03:18:50.680
And then to see themselves
reflected

03:18:50.680 --> 03:18:55.100
in a documentary how
they had taken a role

03:18:55.100 --> 03:18:59.380
in their own survival
and the survival

03:18:59.380 --> 03:19:01.470
of their children I think
they were really amazed

03:19:01.470 --> 03:19:03.870
and I think it gave
them a different feeling

03:19:03.870 --> 03:19:05.410
about public media.

03:19:05.410 --> 03:19:09.510
That it became theirs and
you know it's not easy.

03:19:09.510 --> 03:19:12.670
They're not zillions of topics
that you can do it with,

03:19:12.670 --> 03:19:14.710
but I think it's imperative.

03:19:14.710 --> 03:19:16.010
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson:
I want to come back

03:19:16.010 --> 03:19:19.380
to Lloyd's really
appropriate question

03:19:19.380 --> 03:19:23.150
about preserving public
media for the future.

03:19:23.150 --> 03:19:27.560
And but before I do that, I want
to just also get your thoughts

03:19:27.560 --> 03:19:29.490
and we have just a quick minute.

03:19:29.490 --> 03:19:34.090
I want to get your thoughts
about beyond the screen.

03:19:34.090 --> 03:19:36.620
Because we've talked
about public broadcasting

03:19:36.620 --> 03:19:39.570
and we're talking about
broadcasting and I know that all

03:19:39.570 --> 03:19:44.260
of you are aware of public
media and you do your work

03:19:44.260 --> 03:19:47.260
on so many other
platforms as well.

03:19:47.260 --> 03:19:51.570
And I just would welcome your
speaking about the importance

03:19:51.570 --> 03:19:54.600
of public media on those
additional platforms.

03:19:54.600 --> 03:19:57.890
I think that you've
spoken to that you know

03:19:57.890 --> 03:20:02.360
in a very articulate way Paula
about what NOVA has been doing.

03:20:02.360 --> 03:20:06.880
But other thoughts
about beyond broadcast?

03:20:06.880 --> 03:20:11.760
&gt;&gt; Lloyd Morrisett: We now
get an enormous number of hits

03:20:11.760 --> 03:20:15.790
on You Tube where we've
provided a lot of clips

03:20:15.790 --> 03:20:18.480
so that's the reuse of something
that's been done before

03:20:18.480 --> 03:20:21.920
but is a very useful one.

03:20:21.920 --> 03:20:24.980
&gt;&gt; Kathryn Ostrofsky: Thoughtful
curation of the things

03:20:24.980 --> 03:20:30.320
that are available really
helps the professors who are

03:20:30.320 --> 03:20:34.720
at most colleges and
univresities that have a lot

03:20:34.720 --> 03:20:37.740
of students and not a lot
of time to prepare outside

03:20:37.740 --> 03:20:39.870
of their fields in teaching;

03:20:39.870 --> 03:20:43.930
so I would say it's
extremely important.

03:20:43.930 --> 03:20:46.110
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: So the
thoughtful curation comes

03:20:46.110 --> 03:20:49.050
into places like witih
PBS learning media.

03:20:49.050 --> 03:20:52.230
I assume where then there's
already the thought given

03:20:52.230 --> 03:20:55.640
to what age group, what
level, what the topic is,

03:20:55.640 --> 03:20:59.030
all of these - nicely
tagged and everything.

03:20:59.030 --> 03:21:01.050
&gt;&gt; Kathryn Ostrofsky: Yes
tagged, properly tagged

03:21:01.050 --> 03:21:08.630
and if there are any interactive
things that can go along with -

03:21:08.630 --> 03:21:13.750
there used to be an interactive
game of pretending you were

03:21:13.750 --> 03:21:15.430
in the gold rush and
taking on a character

03:21:15.430 --> 03:21:16.740
and seeing if you survived.

03:21:16.740 --> 03:21:19.290
And it took about two minutes
to play and it went along

03:21:19.290 --> 03:21:21.410
with the documentary
for the gold rush.

03:21:21.410 --> 03:21:22.710
I can't find it anymore.

03:21:22.710 --> 03:21:24.930
I hope it's there.

03:21:24.930 --> 03:21:27.900
It may have moved or it
may have just been old,

03:21:27.900 --> 03:21:29.490
and that's of course a problem.

03:21:29.490 --> 03:21:31.720
&gt;&gt; Paula Apsell: You have to
ask the 10 year olds to find it

03:21:31.720 --> 03:21:36.060
for you, they won't
have any problem at all.

03:21:36.060 --> 03:21:38.970
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: So as a
final question just to come back

03:21:38.970 --> 03:21:43.770
to this all important point
of - of we're at the end

03:21:43.770 --> 03:21:46.010
of this wonderful day and all

03:21:46.010 --> 03:21:49.370
of these really very,
very rich panels.

03:21:49.370 --> 03:21:55.410
What about presrving
public media for the future?

03:21:56.490 --> 03:21:57.790
&gt;&gt; Lloyd Morrisett:
I would worry most

03:21:57.790 --> 03:22:04.270
about just not having
the budget go up.

03:22:04.270 --> 03:22:06.670
Costs are going up
for everything else

03:22:06.670 --> 03:22:10.180
and there are a lot of things
that budget can be used for

03:22:10.180 --> 03:22:12.850
and we just keep it the same.

03:22:12.850 --> 03:22:17.230
So in my view the strategy
is slow starvation.

03:22:17.230 --> 03:22:21.800
&gt;&gt; Paula Apsell: I
don't want to starve.

03:22:21.800 --> 03:22:23.500
As I always say, I'm

03:22:23.500 --> 03:22:26.780
on the spending side
and I like that side.

03:22:26.780 --> 03:22:28.450
But here is what I worry about,

03:22:28.450 --> 03:22:31.300
and you just mentioned something
I thinkis very important,

03:22:31.300 --> 03:22:35.700
which is the non
broadcast aspect of series

03:22:35.700 --> 03:22:37.130
like the ones that we do.

03:22:37.130 --> 03:22:39.730
And I know my documentary
friends

03:22:39.730 --> 03:22:42.400
from the previous panel
were really aprpeciate news

03:22:42.400 --> 03:22:43.710
and all of ours.

03:22:43.710 --> 03:22:48.230
When we started our website
in 1996 we just figured okay,

03:22:48.230 --> 03:22:50.840
we'll just take the same
stuff and we'll put it online

03:22:50.840 --> 03:22:53.940
and maybe we'll you
know, put a few you know,

03:22:53.940 --> 03:23:00.700
it felt like it was just going
to be a free edition to NOVA.

03:23:00.700 --> 03:23:06.020
Now it's own mouth to
feed and it's getting

03:23:06.020 --> 03:23:08.300
to be a gigantic mouth.

03:23:08.300 --> 03:23:12.660
And sothe quesiton is and it's
so important because it is a way

03:23:12.660 --> 03:23:15.310
to attract so many people
who are not going ot turn

03:23:15.310 --> 03:23:17.020
on the television set.

03:23:17.020 --> 03:23:21.810
And I think we certainly find
it's much harder to raise money

03:23:21.810 --> 03:23:24.930
for digital then it is to
raise money for broadcast.

03:23:24.930 --> 03:23:29.220
So I think that's something
we really have to figure out

03:23:29.220 --> 03:23:31.450
and figure out with
the foundations

03:23:31.450 --> 03:23:34.910
and the other funders that
have supported public media

03:23:34.910 --> 03:23:36.440
in the past.

03:23:36.440 --> 03:23:41.560
Because this is the
new world, this is it.

03:23:41.560 --> 03:23:46.020
&gt;&gt; Kathryn Ostrofsky: Oftentimes
academics and broadcasters

03:23:46.020 --> 03:23:48.610
and archivists live
in different worlds,

03:23:48.610 --> 03:23:51.200
so I think we need more
events like this to bring all

03:23:51.200 --> 03:23:55.720
of us together and that's
the first step conversations

03:23:55.720 --> 03:23:57.490
like the ones we've had today.

03:23:57.490 --> 03:23:59.510
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Lawson: Thank you.

03:23:59.510 --> 03:24:06.460
[ Applause ]

03:24:06.460 --> 03:24:08.780
&gt;&gt; We have one more
element to this panel.

03:24:08.780 --> 03:24:13.150
We're going to let Newt
Minow have the last word,

03:24:13.150 --> 03:24:17.370
but before we do, first of
all my thanks to all of you

03:24:17.370 --> 03:24:20.870
and to you Jennifer for
the work on this panel.

03:24:20.870 --> 03:24:24.450
I hope you have found this
afternoon as fascinating

03:24:24.450 --> 03:24:28.630
as I have, being with these
founders of public media

03:24:28.630 --> 03:24:31.700
and creators of some
of the most iconic

03:24:31.700 --> 03:24:35.500
and imoprtant content
in public media.

03:24:35.500 --> 03:24:38.960
And I'd be remis if I didn't
take us back at the very end

03:24:38.960 --> 03:24:42.990
to the other meaning of the
word preserve and to talk just -

03:24:42.990 --> 03:24:45.140
say a few words abou
the American archive

03:24:45.140 --> 03:24:46.530
of public broadcasting.

03:24:46.530 --> 03:24:49.150
Although I can't be quite as
articulate as Kathryn was.

03:24:49.150 --> 03:24:57.100
I think, but we - this is
really the archive of our times.

03:24:57.100 --> 03:25:00.130
Not just our national
times as you've heard

03:25:00.130 --> 03:25:03.580
as Jennifer alluded
to, but alsothe times

03:25:03.580 --> 03:25:06.600
of our communities,
geographically

03:25:06.600 --> 03:25:09.230
around the country
from coast to coast.

03:25:09.230 --> 03:25:14.330
And culturally and believe me
local commercial broadcasters

03:25:14.330 --> 03:25:18.310
have not been able to
preserve their archives.

03:25:18.310 --> 03:25:22.570
It's - it has been too expensive
for them, you know they had

03:25:22.570 --> 03:25:27.850
to reuse those tapes or couldn't
spend the staff time given news

03:25:27.850 --> 03:25:31.410
cycles and especially
now given news cycles,

03:25:31.410 --> 03:25:33.280
endless news cycles.

03:25:33.280 --> 03:25:36.670
So commercial broadcasters
really have not,

03:25:36.670 --> 03:25:39.850
with a few exceptions been able
to preserve their archives.

03:25:39.850 --> 03:25:41.530
It just wasn't their
business plan.

03:25:41.530 --> 03:25:44.520
So it's more important
than ever that commercial -

03:25:44.520 --> 03:25:48.310
that public media
preserve its archives

03:25:48.310 --> 03:25:52.070
and it's also a very critical
part of our mission that we make

03:25:52.070 --> 03:25:53.990
that archive accessible.

03:25:53.990 --> 03:25:57.500
It's been part of the core
mission of public media

03:25:57.500 --> 03:26:00.500
from the very beginning that
we make our work available

03:26:00.500 --> 03:26:03.240
to everyone, no matter
where they are,

03:26:03.240 --> 03:26:06.710
no matter what their means
are, their ability to pay

03:26:06.710 --> 03:26:09.660
and especially in
this universe now

03:26:09.660 --> 03:26:12.820
where almost everything
is behind a paywall

03:26:12.820 --> 03:26:14.720
in media elsewhere.

03:26:14.720 --> 03:26:19.060
So I'm very proud of the
progress we've been makign

03:26:19.060 --> 03:26:21.330
through the American Archive
of Public Broadcasting

03:26:21.330 --> 03:26:25.610
to put tehse works up online
and make them accessible.

03:26:25.610 --> 03:26:30.140
I want to - as we close make
a special thank oyu again

03:26:30.140 --> 03:26:33.140
to the two co-heads of
the American Archive
