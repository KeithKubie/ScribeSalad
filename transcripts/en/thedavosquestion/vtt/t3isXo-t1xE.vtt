&gt;&gt; Hello YouTube. I am Matthias Lufkens. I'm
from the World Economic Forum's media team.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.580
Here's my um badge that we all wearing hear
in Davos. I help the YouTube guys to setup

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.940
this amazing experiment-the Davos question,
that there are so many to answer. It's so,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.260
I mean we have what 300 videos that we received
and based on the publishments here answer

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.060
to your questions so I like to say a big "thank
you" to the entire YouTube community. We're

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.160
wrapping things up here. The annual meeting
is over. The Google boys are back on a plane

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.810
as we speak to California, and now I want
to answer the Davos question. There was an

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.710
amazing session here this morning, this Sunday.
With Benjamin Zander the conductor of the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.989
Boston Philharmonic. He was making the entire
audience, all the CO's sing The Ode To Joy.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.499
That video you can actually see it here on
Youtube on the World Economic Forum Channel.

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:02.899
Just type youtube.com/worldeconomic forum.
And here I go with my answer to the Davos

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.340
question. Here's a song sheet that we distributed
to all the participants. They just had to

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.410
read it off. Being German myself I don't need
this so I'll sing it, in German.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:44.030
[man singing "Ode To Joy" in German].

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.270
So that was my answer to the Davos question.
The discussion, the dialogue will continue

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.980
so stay tuned to YouTube. Thank You.
