00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.340
Alright, we've got our schema set up. We've got bands, which look up to stages.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.890
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.700
&gt;&gt; Which look up to festivals. And then we

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.050
got our attendees hanging out, also looking up to festivals.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.710
&gt;&gt; It's all looking good. Maybe we should add a couple band records?

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's make some music happen.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.780
&gt;&gt; Let's do it.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.460
&gt;&gt; Okay. So I'll go to Setup, and we don't have

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.780
any band tab up here. What am I going to do, Sam?

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so one of the trade-offs of building in Schema builder, is it

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.510
doesn't have that little check box to automatically create a new

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.060
tab. And so we're going to have to do that ourselves by

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.610
manually getting there in the Setup. But the sidebar on the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.140
left is kind of overwhelming. There's a lot of stuff you can

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.600
click into. But you can use the Quick Find, which is

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.280
that little search bar in the top over there. And if

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.240
you know what you're looking for, like for example, creating a

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.560
tab, you can just type Tab, and it filters it for you.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.840
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.660
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'll click Create Tabs?

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.200
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.660
&gt;&gt; And I'm guessing New here?

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.770
&gt;&gt; Yep. So we've been through this drill before.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is my favorite decision to make. okay, so.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.870
What do you think? What should the band tab look like?

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.370
&gt;&gt;

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.210
&gt;&gt; Music note?

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.680
&gt;&gt; That sounds good.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.000
&gt;&gt; Okay, and I'm going to hit Next a bunch of times, I'm sure.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.180
&gt;&gt; Default Visibility on. Sounds good.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.140
&gt;&gt; Okay, I

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.300
don't want it to be available to all these silly default apps.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.080
&gt;&gt; Right, just the festival app.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.710
&gt;&gt; Okay. Cool. Okay, we've got bands up here. So

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.620
now I can add a record. okay, now. Add a band,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.130
and all it has is name.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.510
&gt;&gt; So that's the other trade-off with building in

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.740
Schema Builder. it's not automatically added to the page layout.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.122
&gt;&gt; What isn't? Like, the fields, all of those

00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:39.499
[CROSSTALK]?

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.580
&gt;&gt; All of the fields that we created, yeah. So

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.890
let's just create a band. So just pick any random

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.010
name that you want, or I guess not random, pick

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.460
a band that you want to play at our festival.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.970
&gt;&gt; Okay, I don't know. Who do

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.680
you like? Changed slightly for copyright purposes.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.680
&gt;&gt;

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.542
[LAUGH]

00:01:52.542 --> 00:01:57.800
&gt;&gt; Let's do U3, my favorite band. So we've got our band, U3, and it

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.060
doesn't have the fields like genre and all that. But we can add them, I hope.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.700
&gt;&gt; So, if we ever wanted to modify the page layout, like adding fields

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.960
or even moving fields around, taking them off, whatever you want to do. You can

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.410
either do that from the Object Setup Detail page in Setup, or easily from

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.090
the page right here in the top right hand corner where it says Edit Layout.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.190
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.210
&gt;&gt; So.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.950
&gt;&gt; those

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.770
are my fields, I want them. Genre, headliner.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.160
&gt;&gt; There you go. Right now we're looking

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.190
at the Page Layout editor in Setup. And

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.520
we have all of our fields, or if we made custom buttons, or maybe had other

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.840
lists that we wanted to show, we could drag all of those into the page layout.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.690
So why don't you grab a couple of your fields, and then put them onto the page?
