Well, the world is a toilet, and
we're all completely (bleep).

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.406
But there are still
occasional bits of good news

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.176
to distract us from impending
doom, and here's one of 'em.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.913
Happy 95th birthday,
Betty White!

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.781
(cheers and applause)

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:17.284
Oh, man!
She's amazing.

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:20.487
Thankfully, the reason the
talented and enduring Ms. White

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.556
was trending on Twitter was
because it's her birthday,

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.260
not 'cause she died
or said something racist.

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:28.629
(laughter) -She's great. Here
she is with Katie Couric, and,

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:31.965
uh, what kind of (bleep) cake
is that? She's 95.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.001
-(laughter)
-Give this woman a proper slice

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.737
of devil's food cake,
not some crappy berry tart from

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.572
-the Whole Foods deli case.
-(laughter)

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:42.075
Betty was born in 1922,
so she was alive

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.244
to see the Great Depression
and the birth of television,

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:46.380
as well as the rise
of totalitarianism,

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.515
which thankfully,
was just a one-time thing

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:52.152
that definitely doesn't have
any modern parallels, you guys.

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:54.087
-(laughter)
-So, we're all good.

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.289
Comedians, how is Betty White

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:57.925
gonna celebrate
the big nine-five? Rory.

00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:02.029
-69 a 69-year-old. -HARDWICK:
All right. All right. Very good.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:05.265
-(laughter)
-Points. I feel like that'll...

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:06.567
that should trend.
That should trend.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.101
-"69 a 69-year-old."
-It will.

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:11.138
-It will. -HARDWICK: Megan.
-Let Channing Tatum come over

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:12.573
-and eat that (bleep). -Yeah.
-HARDWICK: All right, all right.

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:15.843
-Very good, points.
-(laughter)

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:17.277
Jak.

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:19.112
Continue drinking
Puerto Rican kids' blood.

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:21.014
-HARDWICK: Yeah. That's...
-(laughter)

00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:22.182
-Hey, I'm that guy.
-And, you know,

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:23.650
she'll live forever that way.

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:23.750
That's how you live forever.
