Speaker 1:          00:00          Jocko. I had had a few rough months, some setbacks at work that hurt me financially, which is stressed out. My family, I'm late on some payments, I'm falling further behind at work. I don't want to tap out, but I just don't know where to start.

Speaker 2:          00:19          Well, you know what, that's, that's just kind of the way that life works. Sometimes it's, it's Murphy's law. When things go wrong, they always seem to happen at once and they just compound on top of each other and it's, it's pretty easy sometimes to, to feel beaten when you're faced with all those issues and all those problems and they all hit you at the same time. But let me tell you that that doesn't mean give up. In fact, it means the opposite.

Speaker 3:          01:08          Okay?

Speaker 2:          01:09          It means it's time for you to fight harder to dig in means it's time for you to go on the war path. And that starts with one of the fundamental laws of combat leadership, prioritize and execute. What's the biggest problem? Well, what's causing the most stress? Family. Okay. Sit them down. Explain where you are at. Be Blunt, be up front and then give them the simple plan of how you're going to get things back on track. Don't sugarcoat it,

Speaker 3:          01:51          okay?

Speaker 2:          01:52          You give it to them straight. Next you've got some, some late payments. Call those creditors up. Explain to them what's going on. Set up some kind of a of a, of a minimum payment plan so you can start making some progress and get them off your back and then you got your job right. You're falling behind at work, okay? Talk to your boss. Face it. Tell him that you're going to step up your game. Tell him you're going to be at work early. You're going to be at work late. You're going to be at work during lunch. You're going to be wherever you need to be whenever he needs you to be there. Tell him you're going to get after it and tell them that you are 100% committed to supporting him and the company and the mission and then you get started and I'm going to tell you right now, it won't be easy. It will be hard because life is hard. That's what life is in these challenges, these challenges that you face, they're going to do their best to take you down. Do not let them stand up. Dig in, line up those problems and confront them. Face them. Fight them.

Speaker 3:          03:34          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:34          Do not let them bring you down. In fact, in fact, let loose challenges raise you up. Let them elevate you. Let their demands and their trials make you stronger. But the adversity you faced today turn you into a better person tomorrow. So, so in the future, you look back at these struggles and you say to them, thank you. You made me better.
