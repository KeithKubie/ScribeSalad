00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.650
Happy Valentine's Day. 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.110
Let's talk about making
babies, shall we?

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:04.920
I think it's about time. 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.020
♪Fun science,
fun science♪ 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.340
♪Fun science is the
science of fun, yeah♪ 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.800
So personally, I find
reproduction to be just 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.860
one of the most irresistible topics
to learn about in science. 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.250
I think this is for a
couple of reasons. 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.440
One: because I'm a human
and humans like to reproduce. 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.790
We're pretty good at it too,
but also because so much of reproduction

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.720
is just so incredibly weird. 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.960
The variation of mad and wonderful
and disgusting methods

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.650
that organisms on this planet
use to reproduce is so vast, 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.090
but every single different possible
type of reproduction 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.890
that exists on this planet fits
into just two different groups: 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.310
asexual reproduction
and sexual reproduction. 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.020
Asexual reproduction is the
method whereby the offspring 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.340
is an exact genetic copy of
its parent, a clone basically,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.980
and this can happen in a
number of different ways. 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.160
There's fission, where the
original organism grows 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.470
and splits itself into
two separate organisms. 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.530
This is what bacteria
use to reproduce. 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.910
There's budding, where a large organism
creates a little bud on its surface 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.580
with the correct genetic material
in it that then breaks off 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.740
and grows on its own. 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.100
It's how yeast reproduces. 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.900
And then there's also
vegetative reproduction, 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.680
where you take a
cutting from a plant, 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.900
plant that cutting
in the ground, 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.850
and let it grow into
its own organisms.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.550
Sexual reproduction,
on the other hand, 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.090
the one that you're
probably more familiar with 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.510
is where two cells from
two separate organism, 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.180
a male cell and
a female cell, 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.770
combing and grow to form an offspring
that has a mix of genetic material 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.140
from both of its parents. 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.690
Mad sex. Oh yeah. 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.430
For most people, though, the interesting
bit doesn't seem to be the cells 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.070
and their genetic codes,
but it's the method 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.030
by which these two cells are
allowed to meet each other. 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.340
In humans, just as it is
in many other animals, 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.040
a male makes a
bunch of male cells, 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.850
inserts them into the female
using the pair of sexual organs, 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.780
a single male cell fertilizes
a single female cell,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.890
and a baby grows inside the
female until it's ready to pop out. 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.240
However, in no way is this the
"normal" method that nature uses 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.160
when it comes to
sexual reproduction.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.800
It's just the one that we are most
familiar with, for obvious reasons. 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.240
Take the seahorse,
for example. 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.750
In this case, the female inserts
her eggs into the male 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.700
and then the male fertilizes
them and incubates them 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.840
and eventually gives birth
to them all by himself. 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.100
And then there's
the mountain slug 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.040
in which there aren't any males
or females, just hermaphrodites, 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.300
which means that every individual has
both male and female sexual organs. 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.960
In this instance, two slugs hang
off a tree branch together 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.680
by a string of
their own slime, 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.920
release their sexual organs
from behind their heads, 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.410
and then fertilize each other
for about an hour or so 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.660
before biting each
other's sexual organs off. 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.480
And actually, even though some
plants reproduce asexually, 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.200
some of them reproduce
sexually as well.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.880
In fact, the flower is actually a
plant's sexual organ 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.020
with both the male and
the female parts inside of it. 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.300
But the variation
doesn't stop there 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.800
because there are actually
some animals that have decided 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.210
to start reproducing
asexually as well. 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.730
Like there are certain
types of shark and lizard 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.770
that have just given
up on men entirely 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.620
and just have
babies anyway. 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.740
And, yes, those babies are exact
genetic clones of their mothers. 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.510
It actually raises quite an
interesting question, 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.240
which is that if there are animals in the
world that can reproduce asexually, 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.900
why do men exist?
Why am I required? 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.810
And with that, why does
sexual reproduction exist? 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.990
What is the point of it? 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.380
Well, fortunately, the answer is
relatively simple and it's this: 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.410
sexual reproduction allows
for more variation. 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.730
It means lots of different organisms
with lots of different traits, 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.640
which, in turn, mean a
higher chance of survival. 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.400
Imagine, for example,
that all of a sudden, 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.470
the whole world just
got really, really cold. 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.300
If you were an organism created
by asexual reproduction 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.630
and you couldn't handle the
new weather, you would die, 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.310
and not only that,
but every single other individual 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.980
in your entire species
would also die. 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.870
However, if you are a species
produced by sexual reproduction, 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.900
although some of
you will probably die, 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.420
others may have nice
thick skin or big furry coats 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.320
or they might be smart
enough to make a fire. 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.210
They have the extra traits
that allow them 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.020
to adapt to the environment around
them and continue to survive. 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.950
And that, I think is why we are so wired
to be so fascinated by reproduction,

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.390
to think that it's so important,
to think that it's something taboo, 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.050
something that's awkward
to talk about, 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.730
something that we have created
whole ceremonies surrounding

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.680
because it is the thing that
has allowed us to evolve 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.640
and exist in the
first place, to survive. 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.720
Nature just prefers sex,
and frankly, so do I.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.810
Should I have
done the wink? 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.700
I can always cut it out. 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.900
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike,

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.770
which makes you, like, cool.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.190
CHARLIE: I made the room pink. 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.330
Do you want to...

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.470
Yeah... 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.808
Video making.
