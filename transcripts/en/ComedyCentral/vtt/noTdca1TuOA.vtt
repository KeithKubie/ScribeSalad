00:00:00.682 --> 00:00:04.599
(uplifting instrumental music)

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:28.436
- Alan Croyd was a devoted
husband, friend to many,

00:00:28.436 --> 00:00:31.029
and of course, a loving father.

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.084
Now, to say a few words
about his rich life,

00:00:34.084 --> 00:00:36.667
his eldest son, Anderson Croyd.

00:00:38.514 --> 00:00:40.622
- Dude, you're up.

00:00:40.622 --> 00:00:42.205
- Oh, right, right.

00:00:46.623 --> 00:00:48.790
Fucking sucks, am I right?

00:00:50.193 --> 00:00:53.110
Alright, I wrote this shit out, so,

00:00:54.843 --> 00:00:56.948
alright, here we go.

00:00:56.948 --> 00:00:59.264
So, picture this, right?

00:00:59.264 --> 00:01:00.821
I'm just napping, right?

00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:04.756
Just enjoying peaceful siesta, you know?

00:01:04.756 --> 00:01:08.687
And then, my sister calls
me and fucking sucker punch,

00:01:08.687 --> 00:01:11.443
gives me the news, and, it's so crazy

00:01:11.443 --> 00:01:15.147
that he died in a car accident,
because earlier this week,

00:01:15.147 --> 00:01:17.110
my fucking girlfriend
died in a car accident,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.584
so, my first thought is like, oh, fuck!

00:01:20.584 --> 00:01:22.365
Two in one week, you know?

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:24.550
Like, bummer city.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.235
Bummer city, population,
my loved ones, you know?

00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:29.902
Like, what the fuck?

00:01:30.736 --> 00:01:32.801
Tch, tch, tch, tch, tch.

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:36.593
But then, I was like,
no, dude, gotta text mom.

00:01:36.593 --> 00:01:39.556
'Cause if I'm bummed, then
she's gonna be fucking

00:01:39.556 --> 00:01:41.168
fucked in the mind, you know?

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:44.364
'Cause like, my dad was her husband.

00:01:44.364 --> 00:01:47.697
And I can say this, because he's my dad.

00:01:49.182 --> 00:01:51.108
And I knew him.

00:01:51.108 --> 00:01:54.358
But like, he had a nice dick, you know?

00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:57.786
Like I saw that shit when I was like 10,

00:01:57.786 --> 00:02:00.344
and it was fucking rad, you know?

00:02:00.344 --> 00:02:03.150
Like, not big, you know?

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.983
Just...

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:06.712
Choice.

00:02:06.712 --> 00:02:08.457
- Nice, dude.

00:02:08.457 --> 00:02:09.837
- Thanks, dude.

00:02:09.837 --> 00:02:11.670
Oh, and like, fuck me.

00:02:13.183 --> 00:02:17.081
Huge, special thanks to my
buddy Zac for coming out.

00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:21.230
'Cause, when you're going
through a hard shit, it's just,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.939
it's just nice to have a friend.

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:28.257
Alright, so that's it
for me, I'm out, peace!

00:02:28.257 --> 00:02:29.463
(microphone squeals)

00:02:29.463 --> 00:02:31.546
(laughs)

00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:35.868
- Thank--
(microphone squeals)

00:02:35.868 --> 00:02:37.140
- Holy shit, dude!

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.701
- Fuck, fuck!

00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:39.534
- Burn!

00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:43.286
Yeah, I'm just pursuing
the acting thing right now,

00:02:43.286 --> 00:02:46.592
super inspired by the work
of Dwayne The Rock Johnson

00:02:46.592 --> 00:02:48.695
and Sarah Jessica Parker.

00:02:48.695 --> 00:02:50.726
- Wow, that's so brave.

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:53.263
I'm not confident or pretty
enough to be an actress.

00:02:53.263 --> 00:02:55.286
- Fuck you, yeah you are.

00:02:55.286 --> 00:02:57.299
- Dude, can I fucking
talk to you for a second?

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.688
- Anderson, I'm right in
the middle of something.

00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:01.372
Some pussy!

00:03:01.372 --> 00:03:03.593
- Yeah dude, that's what I
have to talk to you about.

00:03:03.593 --> 00:03:04.444
Excuse me!

00:03:04.444 --> 00:03:05.611
Come on, dude.

00:03:07.538 --> 00:03:09.289
Dude, that's my fucking sister, dude.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:10.122
- What?

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:11.833
Oh shit, are you, I had no idea!

00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:14.134
- Dude, she gave a eulogy
in front of you, dude!

00:03:14.134 --> 00:03:16.754
- I was playing Doodle Jump,
dude, I'm sorry, I'll back off!

00:03:16.754 --> 00:03:19.194
- No, no, dude, you have
my blessing or whatever,

00:03:19.194 --> 00:03:23.194
do what you want, I just
need to warn you, dude.

00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:27.136
I know she's playing all cute
and sweet with you right now,

00:03:27.136 --> 00:03:29.432
but she's a fucking predator, dude.

00:03:29.432 --> 00:03:31.754
She's been with like 10,000 guys.

00:03:31.754 --> 00:03:34.052
She's like a cute little Wilt Chamberlain.

00:03:34.052 --> 00:03:36.604
- Oh shit, dude, fuck that,
I'll throw in the towel

00:03:36.604 --> 00:03:38.293
right now!
- No, dude.

00:03:38.293 --> 00:03:40.707
It's way late in the
game for you to get out.

00:03:40.707 --> 00:03:43.475
She's not exactly cool with
people saying no to her.

00:03:43.475 --> 00:03:45.925
- Zac, come hang out with me!

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:47.184
- Caroline, I'm talking to my friend,

00:03:47.184 --> 00:03:48.732
can you just give me like a minute!

00:03:48.732 --> 00:03:50.414
- Please hurry!

00:03:50.414 --> 00:03:51.665
- 'Kay, I guess I gotta go!

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:52.498
- Yeah.

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:53.331
Hey, dude.

00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:55.229
Look.

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:58.301
I just wanna say, what
I said in the eulogy,

00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:00.346
it's fucking legit, dude.

00:04:00.346 --> 00:04:04.513
When shit goes down, you're
like my fucking parachute.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.264
- Shut up.

00:04:07.264 --> 00:04:09.681
(sad piano music)

00:04:09.681 --> 00:04:13.205
(glass shatters)

00:04:13.205 --> 00:04:14.318
- [Zac] Alright, dude, I'm off.

00:04:14.318 --> 00:04:16.266
- Have fun, dude.

00:04:16.266 --> 00:04:18.837
Have fun with my sister.

00:04:18.837 --> 00:04:22.279
- You left me standing
here by myself for so long!

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:23.687
- Oh.

00:04:23.687 --> 00:04:27.968
- It's okay, I'll let
you make it up to me.

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:31.468
(upbeat electronic music)

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.243
- Um.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.353
Like it?

- Yeah, dude, leave a comment
in the comment section,

00:04:43.006 --> 00:04:47.811
'cause, you never know
when you might not get to.

00:04:47.811 --> 00:04:51.978
- Leave a comment where you
tell a loved one that you care.

00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:58.960
Oh, and share on Facebook!

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.918
- Oh, fuck yeah.

00:04:59.918 --> 00:05:00.751
- Yeah, dude.

00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:03.362
'Cause then, all your
friends will get to see,

00:05:03.362 --> 00:05:04.832
and they'll be like,
"Oh, dude, this guy's got

00:05:04.832 --> 00:05:07.699
"fucking good taste in comedy, dude!"

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.199
(baby crying)
