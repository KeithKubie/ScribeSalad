00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You may want to introduce auxiliary variables

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
such as, for instance, this vector from the spaceship to the moon

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and this vector from the spaceship to earth.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And then the rest is simply Newton's equation.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We're dividing by the second power of the distance from the spacecraft to the earth.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You're combining all occurrences of the distance of the spacecraft

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to earth in this single place which is the third power of the length of the vector

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
from the spacecraft to the earth.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.173
The same occurs here with the moon.
