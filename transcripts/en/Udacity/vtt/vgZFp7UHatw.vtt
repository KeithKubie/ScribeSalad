00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.663
By now, you've learned about many different tools that we can use to get

00:00:02.663 --> 00:00:06.606
polynomials into their full factored forms. Sometimes, we can just pull a

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:10.858
common factor out of all the terms in an equation. Other times, we need to use

00:00:10.858 --> 00:00:14.520
the rational zero theorem in conjunction with polynomial long division. In the

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.234
event that we have a second degree polynomial, we can use the quadratic

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:22.928
formula. All of these methods tell us about exact values of roots. But in the

00:00:22.928 --> 00:00:25.918
event that we're having trouble finding these exact values, we can always use

00:00:25.918 --> 00:00:29.233
the intermediate value theorem to approximate zeroes.
