00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.770
When movies weave tales of government conspiracies,
elaborate heists, or mind-bending time travel,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.700
audiences know that not every twist or turn
will be spelled out in detail.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.690
But sometimes, a film goes too far, introducing
unclear plot points, breaking their won rules,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.960
or simply hoping viewers won�t think too
hard about what they�ve just seen.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.919
Here are ScreenRant's 10 Movie Plot Holes
and Paradoxes.

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.589
10 Movie Plot Holes &amp; Paradoxes

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:32.589
Inception

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:36.301
Inception takes a leap into fantasy with its
science of �dreams within dreams,� but

00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:37.890
sets out some clear rules.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.059
For instance, it�s explained that the sensation
of falling will cause any sleeping person

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.260
to snap wide awake.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.360
The rule is put to use in the film's climax,
as the team of heroes descends through multiple

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.969
layers of dreams, ending at an arctic fortress.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:51.790
Their only way out?

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.219
Using synchronized �kicks� to pull them
back to the real world, one dream at a time.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.309
But hold on: the final sequence of drops defies
the earlier rule, showing that a kick inside

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.840
of a dream will snap the person out of it:
the collapsing fortress first, then the elevator

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.310
stopping in the dream above.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.780
Some confused editing may be to blame for
breaking the film's simplest rule.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.050
But if that�s the case, what reason would
there have been to blow up the fortress at

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.940
all?

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.550
Back to the Future � Part 3

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.500
In Back to the Future, time travel requires
two things: a flux capacitor, and enough gas

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.270
to hit 88 miles per hour.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.140
But when Doc Brown's and his DeLorean time
machine are struck by lightning at the end

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.260
of the second movie, he winds up stranded
in the year 1885.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.490
That's ok, because he has a plan: send Marty
a letter with directions to find and repair

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.720
the stashed car, so he can rescue him from
the past.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.570
Marty does just that in the next film, but
ends up tearing a gas line, emptying the car�s

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.570
tank.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.360
With no gas stations in the Old West, the
pair�s fortunes go from bad to worse.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.420
But we have to ask: why wouldn�t Doc just
retrieve gasoline from the DeLorean he'd recently

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.640
stashed in the mine?

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.790
Even if its tank was ALSO empty, running an
engine on kerosene would surely be easier

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.500
than building a time machine.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.820
In fact, California�s oil rush meant gasoline
would have been available - and since it was

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.190
considered a worthless by-product at the time,
it would�ve been cheap, too.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.040
Ocean�s Eleven

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.120
The film is essentially one big lead-up to
a brilliant heist, stealing money out from

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.159
under a casino owner�s nose.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.760
When the vault is broken into, the thieves
demand that bags of cash be carried out by

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.170
the hotel�s own security � but when the
money is tracked by the casino�s men, an

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.719
explosion reveals the money was never there
in the first place.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:42.390
Meanwhile, the thieves - disguised as a SWAT
team - descend to the vault with bags in hand,

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.319
leaving more worthless fliers behind, and
walking millions of dollars out of the casino

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.319
personally.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.650
The only problem is that when stars Matt Damon
and George Clooney first broke into the vault,

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.780
they did so empty-handed.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.099
So where did the x-marked bags filled with
fake cash come from?

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.220
Fortunately, director Steven Soderbergh even
admitted there's no explanation, so don't

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.159
bother looking for one.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.829
The Lost World: Jurassic Park

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.159
While the first Jurassic Park proved dinosaurs
and man don�t mix, the sequel went a step

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.390
further, bringing the creatures off of their
remote island, and back to the mainland.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.049
Things go wrong immediately, as a ship carrying
an adult T-Rex violently crashes into its

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.049
port.

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.239
The crew is revealed to have fallen victim
to the island�s dinosaurs, moments before

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.709
the ship�s cargo hold is opened, and the
T-Rex escapes.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.560
But what actually killed the crew?

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.370
It turns out a scene was planned in which
a pack of raptors boards the vessel as it

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.450
leaves the island, but it was left out of
the finished film.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.470
The results of their attack remain, with nobody
ever wondering if there are more killer dinosaurs

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.040
to worry about.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.129
G.I.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.779
Joe: The Rise of Cobra

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:51.870
Blockbuster films are rarely scientifically
accurate, but G.I.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.129
Joe: The Rise of Cobra tops them all, with
one incredible oversight in its final act.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.780
When the film's hero, Duke, is taken to the
villain's underwater Arctic Base, the rest

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.730
of the Joes soon stage a rescue, kicking off
a furious underwater battle.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.680
As the villains escape, they trigger the base's
self-destruct process, "blowing the ice pack"

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.400
above them as a last resort.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.621
When audiences actually stop and wonder if
they�ve ever seen ice sink, this plot hole

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:17.919
becomes ridiculously obvious.

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.970
Some over-the-top action is one thing, but
claiming icebergs will sink like a stone is

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.260
truly unbelievable.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.000
Transformers

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.030
There aren�t many rules when it comes to
Transformers movies, but Autobot leader Optimus

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.090
Prime revealing his heroism in a climactic
battle is an absolute must.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.720
It seems to always fall on Optimus to save
the day: digging deep, summoning courage,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.350
and becoming laughably overpowered, revealing
new weapons, abilities, and combat skills

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.290
that he has inexplicably chosen NOT to use
up to that point.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.140
Suddenly becoming an invincible soldier is
silly enough, but Optimus has been upgraded

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.170
with new tech in multiple films, only to throw
it away instead of using it to help save his

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.160
comrades� lives in the next movie.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.380
Transformers Age of Extinction blew this inconsistency
wide open.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.200
After a devastating fight across the globe,
Optimus suddenly reveals he�s been able

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.730
to fly the entire time!

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.350
Maybe he just has a terrible memory� but
terrible writing seems more likely.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.290
X-Men: Days of Future Past

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.550
In the post-apocalyptic future of X-Men: Days
of Future Past, mutants are hunted to near-extinction

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.410
by an army of Sentinels.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.450
These robots are able to absorb and share
the superpowers of the mutants they encounter.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.110
In the film, the captured mutant Mystique
is offered as an explanation, with her shape-shifting

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.260
ability researched and incorporated into the
Sentinels, allowing them to mimic other mutants.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.920
The only problem is that Mystique's copycat
powers are only cosmetic - she can look like

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.450
Wolverine, but can�t reproduce his healing
factor � or his indestructible claws.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.000
The real explanation can be found only in
deleted scenes, revealing that Rogue � a

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.420
mutant able to literally steal other mutants�
powers � had also been captured, and her

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.030
ability copied as well.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.690
But the finished film never addressed the
plot hole, leaving Mystique to supply powers

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.530
to the Sentinels that she never even possessed.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.020
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the
Black Pearl

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.220
Few can forget the adventure of Will Turner
and Jack Sparrow in Disney's Pirates of the

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.220
Caribbean.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.600
In the film, the duo faces off against undead
pirates doomed to walk the Earth for scattering

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.680
a chest full of cursed gold coins.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.440
Having finally returned every gold piece,
a drop of Will�s blood was all that was

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.360
needed to return their mortality.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.810
Since they couldn�t be killed, it seemed
strange for Jack to fire a useless bullet

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.930
into the film�s villain � until Will revealed
that his blood had lifted the curse, cuing

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.740
the trickle of blood from the pirate�s fatal
wound.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.190
But the gold had clearly not been returned
when Barbosa was shot, meaning only a wound

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.460
sustained after the coin was dropped should
have had any effect.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.300
Jack had been run through with a sword minutes
earlier, so viewers are expected to believe

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.560
that the bullet was "close enough" - creating
an unnecessary plot hole instead.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.090
Star Trek

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.580
When the young Jim Kirk of J.J.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.750
Abram�s Star Trek reboot takes his uncle's
Corvette for a joyride, he chooses to play

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.330
a classic song for a classic car - "Sabotage"
by the Beastie Boys.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.780
Confirming the group and its music to also
exist in the Trek universe sent fans reeling,

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.840
since the band's other hit � �Intergalactic�
� includes an explicit reference to Star

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.620
Trek character "Mr. Spock," and his signature
�Vulcan nerve pinch�.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.640
The obvious paradox was left unexplained,
with Abrams shrugging off any deeper meaning:

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.770
"I wish I could say it was done on purpose,
but it was not.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.530
I just dig the song."

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.320
Abrams would double-down on the paradox in
the film's sequel, with Kirk�s introduction

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.360
set to the sounds of a remix of the group�s
single, "Body Movin�."

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.200
The Dark Knight Rises

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.960
When Bane and his henchmen launch their assault
on the Gotham Stock Exchange in The Dark Knight

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.360
Rises, it isn�t money they�re after.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.520
It�s revealed the next day that Bane forged
a number of transactions in Bruce Wayne�s

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.550
name, bankrupting him overnight and sending
his company�s stock into a spiral.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.870
Lucius Fox informs Bruce that fraud �may
be proven long term�, but for now, he�s

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.500
broke, and set to lose control of his company.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.960
Bankrupting Wayne to inconvenience him is
one thing, but implying that the government,

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.890
banks, newspapers and Wayne Enterprises board
members would all witness Bane�s attack,

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:13.580
then believe Bruce threw his fortune away
during that exact time frame is ridiculous.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.390
Yet nobody questions that Bruce�s �crazy
gambling� is to blame, and Bane�s entire

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.770
plan � and the rest of the film � hinges
on this impossible-to-swallow twist.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:22.770
Conclusion

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:23.770
