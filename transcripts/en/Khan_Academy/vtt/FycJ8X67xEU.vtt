00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.680
Our problem tells us that when
1.125 grams of a liquid

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.540
hydrocarbon, CxHy-- so we don't
know how many C's and

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.320
H's there are, so it's a mystery
liquid hydrocarbon.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.520
It was burned in an apparatus
like that shown in figure

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.470
4-7-- this is the apparatus,
this is our mystery

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.470
hydrocarbon getting burned, or
it's combusting with oxygen--

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.090
you need oxygen for the
combustion to occur.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.480
So when it burns in this
apparatus, and it burns with

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.890
oxygen, it tells us -- and we
have 1.125 of it to start

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.330
with-- it tells us that 3.447
grams of carbon dioxide and

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.360
1.647 grams of water
were produced.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.080
So let me write that reaction
right there.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.360
So let me just write this first
sentence right here.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.100
Write all of the information
that they're giving us in that

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.910
first sentence.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.000
They're saying that when we
start off with that liquid

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.350
hydrocarbon that has x C's and
y H's in it, and it's in its

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.670
liquid state, they say it's
a liquid hydrocarbon.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.960
And when we combust it using
oxygen in its gaseous state,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:25.340
we will produce carbon
dioxide and water.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.270
And you can't even really
realistically balance this

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.110
equation because you don't
know how many carbons and

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.060
hydrogens you have on
the left-hand side.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.450
But what they do tell us is how
many grams of everything,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.670
of at least this we start with,
and how many grams of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.270
each of these we end up with,
and we're assuming that we

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.050
have an excess of oxygen.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.290
That this hydrocarbon is
the limiting reactant.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.860
We just have an abundance
of oxygen.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.470
Just enough oxygen to turn all
of this hydrocarbon, to

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.970
combust all of it into carbon
dioxide and water.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.970
And they tell us that we have
1.125 grams of the mystery

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.510
substance, and then it produces
3.447 grams of carbon

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:20.470
dioxide, and 1.647
grams of water.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.180
Now to solve this-- well let me
finish reading the problem.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.430
It tells in a separate reaction
or in a separate

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.100
experiment, the molar mass of
the compound was found to be

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.740
86.2 grams per mole.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.970
So I'll write that down here.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:44.200
So CxHy molar mass is equal to--
let me write it this way

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.300
instead just to go with the
convention that I've been

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:58.620
doing-- we have 86.2 grams of
our mystery substance, CxHy

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.140
per mole of our mystery
substance, CxHy.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.890
And then they're asking us
in this problem, they say

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.220
determine the empirical and
molecular formulas for the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.200
unknown hydrocarbon CxHy.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.950
And just as a refresher,
empirical means just the

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.550
simplest whole number ratio of
the atoms in our molecule.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.120
So the simplest ratio of our
carbons to hydrogens, or

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.220
hydrogens to carbons, will give
us the empirical formula.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.610
The molecular formula is how
many carbons, exactly how many

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.370
carbons and hydrogens do
we have in each atom.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.100
And I suspect we're going
to be able to use this

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.420
information to come up, once
we have the empirical

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.090
formulation, the empirical
formula, we then can use this

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.070
molar mass right here to
figure out the actual

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.950
molecular formula.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.340
But let's figure out the
empirical formula first.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.300
And the way we can do it is we
could say, well gee, how many

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.590
moles of carbon dioxide
we get produced, how

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.290
many moles of hydrogen?

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.040
And then we could say, well in
the final product, how many

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.530
moles of carbon do
we have then?

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.130
And how many moles of hydrogen
do we have there?

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.950
And then we can figure
out the ratio.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.620
And the ratio of carbons to
hydrogens or hydrogens to

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.340
carbons in the product, that's
going to have to be the same

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.320
as the ratio in the reactants.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.010
And they all came from this
reactant right there.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.120
They didn't come
from the water.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.570
And then hopefully we'll be
able to figure out the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.950
simplest whole number ratio
of hydrogens to carbons or

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.180
carbons to hydrogens is.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.740
That sounds very complicated I
think, but I think if we take

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.440
it step-by-step it
won't be too bad.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.980
So a good place to start, let's
figure out how many

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.000
moles of each of these
substances we have. I'll start

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.580
off with the carbon dioxide.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.260
So if I start off with the
carbon dioxide, what is the

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.450
molar mass of carbon dioxide?

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.990
So its atomic weight, carbon is
12 plus you have 2 oxygens,

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.480
so 2 times-- the atomic weight
of oxygen is 16, you could

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.870
look that up if you like--
but that's equal to

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.440
44 atomic mass units.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.640
That's its atomic weight, which
is the weighted average

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.330
of all of the isotopes and
all of that business.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.620
But if you have a whole mole of
carbon dioxide, 6.022 times

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.780
10 to the 23rd of these
molecules, then you're going

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.000
to have 44 grams of
the substance.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:30.680
So we have 44 grams of
CO2 per mole of CO2.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.540
And if we want to figure out
how many moles we have with

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.690
us, we know that we're
starting off with

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:45.840
3.447 grams of CO2.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.810
And we want to multiply this by
something that has grams of

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.580
CO2 in the denominator.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.870
So we want to multiply it by
something that looks like

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.270
this-- and we want to turn
it into moles of CO2.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:04.420
So it should have moles of
CO2 over grams of CO2.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.740
Well that's the inverse
of this right here.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.010
This is grams per mole, we
want moles per gram.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.920
So instead of 44 grams per mole,
we have 1 over 44 moles

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.190
per gram, or for every 44 grams
we have 1 mole, for

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.550
every 1 mole we have 44 grams.
I just inverted this.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.890
So let's multiply.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.530
The grams of CO2 cancel out with
the grams of CO2, and you

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.890
are left with 3.447
divided by 44.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.040
So let's figure out
what that is.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:55.020
So you have 3.447 divided by 44,
which is equal to 0.07834.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.450
So 7-8-3-4.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.760
Let me remember that.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.020
So that is 0.07834 moles
of CO2-- that's

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.270
our only units left.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.320
Now let's figure out how many
moles of water we have. So I

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.920
could do the exact same thing
over-- let's see,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.080
where should I do that.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.900
Let me write it over here.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.830
So let's do the water in
orange right here.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:30.780
So we're starting off with
1.647 grams of H2O.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.710
And what is water's
molar mass?

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:39.160
Same argument, its atomic mass
is-- each hydrogen is 1.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.750
But you have 2 of them so it's
2 times 1 plus 16, which is

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.380
the atomic weight of oxygen.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.910
So 2 times 1 plus 16 is 18.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.470
That's also its molar mass.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:59.810
You could say 18 grams of
H2O per mole of H2O.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.330
Now to convert this, the amount
of grams we have to

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.810
moles, what we want to do is
multiply it by something that

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:11.890
has moles in the numerator and
grams in the denominator.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:18.600
We want grams of H2O in the
denominator and moles of H2O

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.930
in the numerator.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.820
And that's the exact
inverse of this.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.450
So if we have 18 grams per
mole, we have 1 over

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.310
18 moles per gram.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.400
And what is this going
to be equal to?

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.549
So this cancels out with that,
so we're left with 1.647

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:40.006
divided by 18 moles of H2O.

00:08:40.006 --> 00:08:42.549
Let me scroll over
a little bit.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:44.780
Get the calculator out.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.850
Clear it out.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:56.360
And so we have 1.647 divided
by 18, which is 0.0915.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.970
Let me do this in a new color.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:06.310
We have a 0.0915 moles of H2O.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:10.360
So so far we figured out in our
products how many moles of

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:17.770
carbon dioxide we have, and
how many moles of water.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:21.520
Now, I said we want to figure
out the ratio of hydrogens to

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.700
carbons or carbons to hydrogens
to figure out the

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.630
empirical formula right here.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.800
And to do that we can say hey
look, all of the carbons and

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.590
the hydrogens in our products,
they all had to come from our

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.420
mystery hydrocarbon.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.100
So if we can figure out the
ratio of hydrogens to carbons

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.470
in our products, we'll know
the ratio of hydrogens to

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:42.490
carbons in our reactants.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.470
Because they all had to come
from this guy right here.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.890
The oxygen, obviously, had no
hydrogens and carbons in it.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.950
So all of these hydrogens
and carbons came

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.520
from our mystery substance.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.450
So how many moles of
carbon do we have?

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.390
How many moles of carbon do we
have in the carbon dioxide, in

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.600
our products?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.470
Well the only product with
carbon is the carbon dioxide.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.660
This has no carbon in it.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:12.200
So if we have this many carbon
dioxides, we also have the

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:22.830
same number of carbon atoms,
moles of atomic carbon.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.780
And you might say hey,
that's just a number.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.870
This is saying 0.07 times 6.022
times 10 to the 23rd

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:31.760
times that huge number.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.690
A mole is just a number-- very
important to remember.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.120
So this means we have the
same number of carbons.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.060
And if we have that many
waters, how many

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.670
hydrogens do we have?

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.680
Well for every water molecule
we have 2 hydrogens.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.960
So we're going to have twice
as many hydrogen atoms.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.780
So let's multiply
that times 2.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:57.670
So times 2 is equal to 0.183.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:03.600
So we have 0.183.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.980
I could even put a trailing 0,
because we actually had-- well

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.680
I think I lost the significant
digit here.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.890
I could have put a
zero right there.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.360
But anyway, I won't worry
too much about that.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:20.300
0.183 moles of atomic hydrogen,
because for every

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.710
water molecule we have
2 hydrogens.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.610
So I just took this number
and multiplied by 2.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:29.630
And now let's figure out the
ratio of hydrogens to carbons,

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.260
and that's pretty easy.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.470
We just take a ratio
of that to that.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:42.750
So the ratio of hydrogens to
carbons is 0.183 moles of

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:52.400
hydrogen in our product for
every 0.07834 moles of the

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.330
carbon in our product.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.590
And somehow we have to make this
into some type of a whole

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:58.400
number ratio.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.780
Let's see whether we can
do anything here.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.560
Let's just divide this right
here and see what we get.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.690
So if we just take-- well we
have the 0.183 there, so let's

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:20.600
divide it by 0.07834,
and you get 2.336.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:26.410
So this is approximately equal
to-- I'll do a new color-- is

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:36.590
approximately equal to 2.336
moles of hydrogen for every 1

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.530
mole of carbon.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.520
This doesn't look like that neat
of a ratio, but this is

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.790
pretty close to 1/3.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.130
So maybe if we multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.680
by 3 what do we get?

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.060
Well 3 times 2 is 6 and 3
times 1/3 is another 1.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.670
So this will be 7.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.590
7 moles of hydrogen.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.850
I'm approximating it.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.640
I'm trying to get to some
reasonable whole number.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:11.350
7 moles of hydrogen for every
3 moles of carbon.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.510
And this was a little
bit of an art to it.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:18.890
I said OK, 2.33:1 or 2.336:1,
well gee, this looks like,

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:22.010
over here, this part of it looks
like if we multiplied

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.140
that by 3 we're going
to get pretty

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.330
close to a whole number.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.670
So let me multiply the
numerator and the

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.040
denominator by 3.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.990
That's kind of the art there to
recognize what do you have

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.590
to multiply this to turn
it into a whole number.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.460
And if you don't believe me, we
could take that number and

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.720
multiply it by 3 and you get
something very, very, very,

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.820
very close to 7.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.200
So that's enough for me.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.100
So you're multiplying both by 3,
you get 7 moles of hydrogen

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.950
for every 3 moles of carbon.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.610
And we've figured out our
empirical formula.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:55.420
We have 7 hydrogens for
every 3 carbons.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:55.640
Right?

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.710
If we have 7 moles, for every
3 moles that means we have 7

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.300
hydrogens for every 3 carbons.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:13.430
And so the empirical formula of
our mystery hydrocarbon is

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:21.590
for every 3 carbons we
have 7 hydrogens.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:22.960
Now the next thing we want
to figure is the

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.280
exact molecular formula.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.740
The exact number of-- this is
just the minimum ratio.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.400
But maybe we have 9 carbons
for every 21 hydrogens.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.310
We don't know.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.070
So let's use the other
information they gave us in

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:41.210
the problem where they told us
that the molar mass is 86.2

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:47.310
grams per mole-- this
information right here.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.510
Let me copy that.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.350
86.2-- that looks like
an 80, but we'll

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.060
remember it says 86.2.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.540
So let me paste it over here.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.250
That's what they gave
us in the problem.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:06.190
So just for kicks, what would be
the molar mass if this was

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.120
the molecular formula?

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:13.910
So as it's written right now--
well there's a couple of ways.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.440
We could do it algebraically
and all of that.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.520
But the simplest way is to say
as it's written right now what

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.780
would be the molecular
mass of this?

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.140
Or the molar mass,
I should say.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:29.580
So it would be 3 times
12, plus 7, times 1.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:36.120
3 times 12 is 36 plus
7 is equal to 43.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.710
So if this was the molecular
formula, its molecular mass

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.510
would be 43 grams per mole.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:46.060
But they tell us in the problem
that the molecular

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.900
mass is 86 grams per mole.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.110
So they're saying that the mass
is twice as much as this.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:55.810
We must have twice as many
atoms in the same ratio.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:00.660
So the molecular formula for
this-- we're in the home

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:09.560
stretch now-- the molecular
formula must have twice as

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.740
many atoms in the exact
same ratio.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:27.180
So it must be C3H7 times 2, or
we could write that as C6H14.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:32.590
So this is still a ratio
of 14:6, which is 7:3.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.030
But using this information, we
were able to figure out the

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.320
exact number of carbons and the
exact number of hydrogens

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.230
in this molecule.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.040
Anyway, hopefully you
found that fun.
