Hey, everybody, and welcome
back to the "Mobile Ads Garage"

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.790
where we get into
mobile ads code the way

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.470
I get into pie eating contests.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.050
Elbow deep.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.170
So last time out we, coded
up a simple banner ad

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.330
implementation.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.900
Today we're going to expand on
that by talking about the best

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.242
ways to use banners--
where to put them,

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:17.700
how they should
behave, and how you

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.930
can monetize while maintaining
a great user experience.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.210
With me as always Gary The
Graphics Guy who's still

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.260
a little mad I took the last
slice of pizza at lunch,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.396
but we're ready
to have some fun.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.200
We get a lot of
questions on our forum

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.500
and in person about AdMob
policy, things like can I

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.770
put my ad view in a
list view, or is it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.492
OK for this banner to be
next to this UI button?

00:00:39.492 --> 00:00:41.700
We'll talk about those kind
of specifics in a second,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.449
but first, I think
it'll help of everybody

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.090
understands why we have those
policies in the first place,

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.440
where they come from.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.520
So let's bring it in and
have a serious moment.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.870
[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.130
The main purpose
of AdMob's policies

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.050
regarding where to put
ads and when to show them

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.680
is to make sure that
every ad impression-- that

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.860
means every time an
ad is displayed--

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.480
is a good, honest impression,
and that every clickthrough is

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.580
a good, honest clickthrough.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.760
We do this because
when ads are shown,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.640
when a user taps on an ad, an
advertiser gets charged for it.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.250
Somebody, somewhere--
could be a big company,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.450
could be Aunt
Betty's Sweater Shop

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.080
For Beautiful Cats-- somebody
has to write a check.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.610
And we need to be able to
tell Aunt Betty that every ad

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.720
impression she paid for was
an honest chance for somebody

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.520
to see her ad and that every
clickthrough came from someone

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.200
who was genuinely interested
in getting a sweater for Little

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.170
Miss Whiskerson.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.680
So if you're ever in doubt about
whether a particular layout

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.850
or behavior is likely to
conflict with AdMob policy,

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.580
a great first step
is to ask yourself

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.440
would it interfere
with honest impressions

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.710
or honest clickthroughs,
and then put yourself

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.750
in Aunt Betty's shoes.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.730
[MEOW]

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.240
Exactly.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.430
So, there's our serious moment.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.110
Now let's talk specifics.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.610
Let's start with
an app like the one

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.910
from our first episode, just
a banner ad across the bottom.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.980
Perfect.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.490
This is a great layout
used buy a ton of apps.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.110
The banner's visible, it's
not near any other controls,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.110
and there's lots of
room for content.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.784
Plus the user has plenty of
opportunity to see the ad,

00:02:11.784 --> 00:02:13.450
and it's unlikely
that they'll tap on it

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.910
for any reason other
than being interested.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.875
Excellent.

00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:20.580
But watch what happens when I
add a button right down here.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.932
Those are really close.

00:02:21.932 --> 00:02:23.390
If you're going
for the button, you

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.010
might hit the ad by accident,
especially if you're like me,

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.510
and you have these big,
stupid caveman hands.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.260
Gary, the last
slice is fair game.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.750
Everyone knows this.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.232
So this layout runs the risk
of a bad clickthrough, someone

00:02:36.232 --> 00:02:38.190
accidentally tapping on
the ad when they really

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.220
want the button.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.610
It's a common problem
but it's easy to fix.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.300
You could just add a little
space or move the button.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.800
Whatever you need
to do to make sure

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.315
the user isn't going to
tap the ad accidentally.

00:02:49.315 --> 00:02:50.900
I've used buttons
in this example

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.820
but the principle applies to any
UI elements that accept input.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.320
Another issue we
get questions about

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.210
is whether it's OK to ask users
to tap on ads, and it's not.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.980
For example, if I were to
drop a UI label or a text view

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.550
in here, I'm giving
my users a reason

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.760
to click the ad even if
they're not interested,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.324
and every clickthrough
costs money.

00:03:09.324 --> 00:03:10.990
That means Aunt Betty
is going to end up

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.865
paying for clickthroughs
by people who aren't

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:14.200
interested in her cat sweaters.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.470
That's going to hurt
her small business.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.250
All right, let's get
rid of that and add

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.710
something else, a second ad.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.320
Whoa!

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.050
In addition to crowding out
content and annoying our user,

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.930
we've also got bad impressions.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.397
With two ads on
the screen at once,

00:03:28.397 --> 00:03:30.480
they have to split the
spotlight, which isn't what

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.190
our advertisers signed up for.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.840
The fix for this?

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.375
Just stick with one banner.

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:36.830
Ah, nice and simple.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.210
That's what I like.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.120
Hey!

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.709
I eat an appropriate amount
of pizza for an active person!

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.250
As I think we all learned during
off-site miniature golf team

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.520
building day, this is
an athlete, all right?

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.580
This is what sports looks like.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.061
Moving on, some types of content
can also cause bad impressions.

00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:57.310
Displaying a banner while
the user is actively playing

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.100
an action game, for example.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.150
If I'm saving the world
from the forces of evil,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.230
I'm probably too busy
to consider an ad even

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.890
when I might be
interested in it.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.580
Just move the banner to
the menu or pause screen,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.790
or consider using interstitials
between levels instead.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.790
Another good thing to
avoid is loading banners

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.360
that aren't on screen yet.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.000
This is a big reason
why we recommend

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.149
you don't place banners inside
list view or other scrolling UI

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:20.040
elements.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.769
Every time an AdMob
banner is loaded,

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.660
an impression is recorded for
it even if it's off screen

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.910
or the user was scrolling so
fast they couldn't see it.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.690
All right so that's
some stuff to avoid,

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.190
but you might be wondering what
are some things I should do?

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.070
What are the good practices?

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.490
One of the best things you can
do for your user experience

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.940
is to keep in mind
that ads should

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.710
live alongside your
content rather than being

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.910
mixed in with it.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.980
Dedicate a spot for
them in your layout

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.590
away from UI inputs and outside
of scrolling content regions.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.655
Doesn't matter if it's
the bottom or the top.

00:04:50.655 --> 00:04:52.530
That way, you can be
fair to your advertisers

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.821
and make sure you don't annoy
your users by covering up

00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:56.820
content.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.770
Yes, thank you, Gary.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.290
That's a great example of how
poor ad placement takes away

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.060
from the user experience.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.760
Very funny.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.260
Seriously?

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.110
You're going to body
shame in front of YouTube?

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.940
What's next, an ad for the
Pudgy Redhead Dating Network?

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:12.720

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.910
Sorry for blowing
my top like that.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.970
Gary and I eventually
patched things up,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.750
but it reminded me of one more
thing I wanted to mention.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.580
There are types of
content that shouldn't

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.330
be included in any app
that displays AdMob ads.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.580
Stuff like drug or
tobacco references,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.035
racist hate speech,
adult content, and so on.

00:05:34.035 --> 00:05:36.410
You can see this Help Center
article for more information

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.510
on prohibited content,
and the one below it

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.814

other things we talked about.
