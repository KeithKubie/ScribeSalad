TO YOU.

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:53.940 line:91%

CHANGE.

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:55.708 size:78% position:39% line:85%
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:56.809 align:start position:0% line:91%
NERDS ARE UPSET AT BLACK STORM
TROOPERS IN THE "STAR WARS"

MOVIE.

00:02:57.977 --> 00:02:59.178 line:91%
DO THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A
STORM TROOPER BEING BLACK?

00:02:59.211 --> 00:02:59.979 line:91%
NO, THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOU
CHANGING THEIR DEFINITION OF A

STORM TROOPER.

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:02.615 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET ME BE A LITTLE CLEARER -- IF
THE FIRST TIME YOU INTRODUCE

00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:05.151 align:start position:0% line:91%
OATMEAL TO A NERD, IT HAS MAPLE
SYRUP IN IT, IT BETTER HAVE

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:07.053 align:start position:0% line:91%
MAPLE SYRUP IN IT EVERY
(BLEEP)ING TIME OR IT'S NOT

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:08.487 align:start position:0% line:85%
OATMEAL.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.790 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S YOUR FAULT.

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:13.392 line:91%
NOW, IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT,
YOU NEED SOMEBODY WHO'S PART OF

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:15.695 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOUR ORIGIN STORY TO EXPLAIN
THAT CHANGE.

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:18.331 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE WHEN STAR TREK CHANGED
THEIR ORIGIN STORY, THEY HAD THE

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:21.467 size:88% position:44% line:91%
ORIGINAL SPOCK COME BACK TO
EXPLAIN IT TO THE NEW SPOCK.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.735 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S WHY NERDS WERE COOL WITH
IT

00:03:22.768 --> 00:03:27.440 align:start position:0% line:91%

UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING.

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:31.644 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO THE ONLY WAY TO CALM NERDS
ABOUT BLACK STORM TROOPERS ISN'T

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:33.846 size:88% position:44% line:91%
