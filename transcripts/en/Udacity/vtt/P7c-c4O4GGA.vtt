00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.720
So there's a couple of major things you need to think about.

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:10.109
There's the physical properties that you need to drive and

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.503
the materials to survive the application itself,

00:00:13.503 --> 00:00:14.977
the heat, you know,

00:00:14.977 --> 00:00:16.899
all the things that are going on in the environment.

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:20.294
There's the materials aspects of surviving,

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:23.500
the maintenance operations, cleaning being a good example.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.820
Use also the material selection that you need to do to make sure that you

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.652
don't alter the part for post-processing steps.

00:00:30.652 --> 00:00:32.865
So, let's say I'm handling

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:37.364
a metal part that subsequently is going to go through a coating or painting step,

00:00:37.363 --> 00:00:40.529
you need to make sure that the materials that you select don't

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.079
leave residues that poorly interact with downstream chemistries.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.994
So all of this goes into creating the appropriate materials selection for soft robot.

00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:55.484
So all manner of food is a fantastic application for us.

00:00:55.484 --> 00:00:57.659
So if you think about it,

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.444
there's no such thing, for example,

00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:01.649
as a regular piece of broccoli.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.025
You know when food comes down a conveyor it needs to be packaged.

00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:09.570
Every piece, even though they may look the same to a human,

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.159
to a robot small degrees of

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.719
variability can ruin an application at least for a conventional system.

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.204
So every piece of food varies a little bit in size, weight, shape.

00:01:20.204 --> 00:01:24.469
Many pieces of food are remarkably easy to damage.

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.010
I'm proud to say that our grippers actually do less damage than you might yourself just

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.465
handling a piece of food so you need to be able to offer that ability to be delicate.

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:35.790
And then on top of it,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.915
you need to be very very cleanable.

00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:40.665
So going back to the Terminator hand idea,

00:01:40.665 --> 00:01:42.375
if I have a Terminator hand,

00:01:42.375 --> 00:01:47.424
I have a gazillion little crevices all over the surface,

00:01:47.424 --> 00:01:50.789
and if you have crevices you can't clean it fundamentally.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.010
You know when you talk about bacterial harborage of E. coli, salmonella, you know,

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.270
if you have a few only a few cells left in a surface that's more than

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:05.189
enough to actually create later on a food borne illness outbreak.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.574
So our structures are fundamentally different, right?

00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:13.530
We have continuous elastomeric bladders that are mating typically into

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.180
plastic and steel hub assemblies that allow you to create

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.610
a hand structure that's incredibly dexterous like those Terminator style hands,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.150
but simultaneously have almost no crevices on

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.085
the surface so that you can clean it out and will be very very safe.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:33.900
And at the same time we are also,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.020
since you know material science is a big part of what we do here,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.265
we can select for things like all FDA approved materials or whatever it

00:02:41.264 --> 00:02:46.091
is the material safety standard that you want to hit,

00:02:46.092 --> 00:02:48.915
we can build that into our systems so that you can build

00:02:48.914 --> 00:02:51.810
incredibly clean safe robotic systems in

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.242
ways that you normally couldn't with normal technologies,

00:02:55.242 --> 00:02:56.729
and it's very exciting.

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:59.185
Something came into effect a few years back,

00:02:59.186 --> 00:03:01.349
the Food Safety Modernization Act.

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.840
It is the biggest overhaul in

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.060
the regulatory infrastructure that guides the creation of food in about 70 years.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.770
And it was in response to

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.689
some pretty horrific and dangerous outbreaks of bacteria in people's food.

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:21.875
And so the US government has really focused on how to bring us all safer food.

00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:25.659
And one of the ways you can do that is with a robotic system.

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.254
So if I have one of our grippers which is incredibly cleanable,

00:03:30.254 --> 00:03:33.990
and I do that in a process where the washing of that system is

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.875
automated as well and I surround it with other pieces of infrastructure,

00:03:37.875 --> 00:03:41.800
again very cleanable, you could start building

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.979
robotic food factories that always deliver a safe product that you can rely on.

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:51.405
So you can do gripper swaps with our systems.

00:03:51.405 --> 00:03:54.006
Many of the applications that we work and you don't,

00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:58.740
and the reason why is that because we offer adaptive gripping.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.935
You can grab many, many different grasp targets with a single structure

00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:07.569
which is technically impressive but also delivers incredible value to customers.

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:14.454
So in one particular application we're moving dough balls that are being rolled into,

00:04:14.455 --> 00:04:18.580
rolled and need to be moved onto quilling trays before they drive out to pizzerias.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.039
And the customer that we were working with,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.545
when they took a traditional mechanical approach,

00:04:23.545 --> 00:04:26.155
they were building, there was five different sized dough balls.

00:04:26.154 --> 00:04:29.169
So they were building five different size mechanical grippers.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.394
Gripper swap, gripper swap, gripper swap.

00:04:31.394 --> 00:04:34.857
And so that adds complexity that adds cost.

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:37.705
With our systems, they're able to grab

00:04:37.704 --> 00:04:42.490
all five sets of dough balls all with a single construct because,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.644
again, you just inflate until it makes contact with the surface.

00:04:46.644 --> 00:04:50.904
And the pneumatics and the ways in which the elastomers and the plastics work,

00:04:50.904 --> 00:04:54.009
it innately finds the correct grip on what is

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.879
an incredibly deformable and variable grasp target.

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:00.879
If you ever play around with dough you'll notice that, you know,

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:03.980
when it sits on a table it slowly rolls out.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.590
So its shape is changing as the water evaporates off the surface,

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:10.750
it goes from sticky to slippery.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.689
If you try to lay hands on it, you'll squish right through it.

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:19.993
So it's this incredibly complex grasp target provided a really fun challenge to solve,

00:05:19.994 --> 00:05:23.650
and because of the adaptability of our technology,

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:27.509
we were actually able to sell them one gripper that did all five.

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:33.189
You know what's better is to do one gripper that can do many different sizes and shapes,

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:37.475
and you know, ultimately that's because you don't have turnover times.

00:05:37.475 --> 00:05:39.129
So there's the cost aspect,

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:40.629
you don't have to buy so much gear.

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:43.029
But you also don't, if every time you do a gripper swap,

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:44.589
that robot's not doing the work.

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:47.875
So if you can get a gripper that's hyper adaptable,

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:50.139
then the robot's always doing work regardless

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:52.990
of what's coming down the conveyor and being presented to it.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.694
Food work is interesting because a lot of these jobs, you know,

00:05:56.694 --> 00:05:59.769
people in robotics always talk about robots doing the dull,

00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:01.909
the dirty, the dangerous jobs.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.850
So you know, think about what it's like to work in a chicken factory for example.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.770
It's a refrigerator-like temperatures at your workplace.

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:13.949
It's a very wet environment.

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.310
You typically are gowned in all sorts of smocks and

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.999
whatnot because there's chicken goop everywhere,

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:29.475
and you're working around a lot with just cutters to work the work part the meat.

00:06:29.475 --> 00:06:32.379
And so this is a dirty job.

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:34.149
It's very repetitive. It's a dull job.

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:39.096
And it can a be very, very dangerous job in a very inhospitable environment.

00:06:39.096 --> 00:06:42.610
So being able to offer solutions that can satisfy

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.634
those needs and make sure that people have good clean food on their table is,

00:06:46.634 --> 00:06:48.094
it's exciting for us.

00:06:48.095 --> 00:06:51.000
It's very, very promising application as well.
