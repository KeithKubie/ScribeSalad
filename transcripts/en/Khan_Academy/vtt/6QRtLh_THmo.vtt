00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:03.603
- [Voiceover] So let's say
that we have y is equal to

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:06.936
the secant of three pi over two minus x.

00:00:10.358 --> 00:00:12.833
And what we wanna do is,
we wanna figure out what

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:17.265
dy/dx is, the derivative
of y with respect to x is,

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:19.515
at x equal pi over four.

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:23.943
Like always, pause this
video and see if you could

00:00:23.943 --> 00:00:25.852
figure it out.

00:00:25.852 --> 00:00:28.661
Well as you can see here, we
have a composite function.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.856
We're taking the secant, not just of x,

00:00:30.856 --> 00:00:33.459
but you could view this
as of another expression

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:36.925
that x could define, or as
of a, of another function.

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:41.692
So for example, if you call
this right over here, u of x,

00:00:41.692 --> 00:00:43.040
let's do that.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.207
So if we say u of x is equal
to three pi over two minus x,

00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:51.163
we could also figure out u prime of x

00:00:51.163 --> 00:00:53.518
is going to be equal to
derivative of three pi over two,

00:00:53.518 --> 00:00:55.473
that's just going to be a zero,

00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:58.300
derivative of minus x,
well that's just gonna be

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.847
minus one, and you could just
view that as a power rule.

00:01:01.847 --> 00:01:05.712
It's one times negative one,
times x to the zero power,

00:01:05.712 --> 00:01:06.866
which is just one.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:07.961
So there you go.

00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:11.672
So we could view this as
the derivative of the secant

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:14.926
with respect to u of x, that
when we take the derivative,

00:01:14.926 --> 00:01:17.730
the derivative of secant
with respect to u of x,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.397
times the derivative
of u with respect to x.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.264
And you might say,

00:01:23.264 --> 00:01:24.969
"Well, what about the
derivative of secant?"

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.533
Well in other videos, we
actually prove it out,

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:28.973
and you could actually re-derive it.

00:01:28.973 --> 00:01:31.289
Secant is just one over cosine of x,

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.067
so it comes straight
out of the chain rule.

00:01:33.067 --> 00:01:37.002
So, in other videos, we prove that the,

00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:40.650
the derivative of the secant of x,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.817
of the secant of x, is equal
to, is equal to sin of x,

00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:51.901
over cosine of x, over
cosine of x squared.

00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:55.915
So if we're trying to
find the derivative of y

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:59.438
with respect to x, well it's
going to be the derivative

00:01:59.438 --> 00:02:02.044
of secant with respect to u of x,

00:02:02.044 --> 00:02:04.984
times the derivative
of u with respect to x.

00:02:04.984 --> 00:02:05.817
So let's do that.

00:02:05.817 --> 00:02:09.489
The derivative of secant
with respect to u of x,

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.560
well, instead of seeing an x everywhere,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.510
you're gonna see a u of x everywhere.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.293
So this is going to be,

00:02:15.293 --> 00:02:16.460
sin of u of x,

00:02:19.018 --> 00:02:20.185
sin of u of x,

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:23.324
and I could, I don't have to write u of x,

00:02:23.324 --> 00:02:25.144
I could write three pi over two minus x,

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:26.797
but I'll write u of x
right over here just to

00:02:26.797 --> 00:02:28.863
really visualize what we're doing.

00:02:28.863 --> 00:02:30.967
So sin of u of x,

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:32.487
over,

00:02:32.487 --> 00:02:33.727
over,

00:02:33.727 --> 00:02:35.810
cosine squared of u of x,

00:02:37.242 --> 00:02:38.608
cosine squared,

00:02:38.608 --> 00:02:40.098
and we do those parentheses
in the blue color

00:02:40.098 --> 00:02:41.919
just to make sure that you identify it

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.948
with the trig function.

00:02:43.948 --> 00:02:46.948
So cosine squared of u of x, u of x,

00:02:49.938 --> 00:02:53.246
so that's the derivative of
secant with respect to u of x,

00:02:53.246 --> 00:02:54.402
and then the chain rule
tells us it's gonna be

00:02:54.402 --> 00:02:57.152
that times u prime, u prime of x.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.091
So what is this going to be equal to?

00:03:02.091 --> 00:03:04.409
Well, I could just substitute back.

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.295
This is going to be equal to,
I will write it like this.

00:03:08.295 --> 00:03:12.462
Sin of u of x, which is
three pi over two minus x,

00:03:13.303 --> 00:03:14.674
and I'll fill that in in a second,

00:03:14.674 --> 00:03:17.424
over cosine of u of x squared,

00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:20.668
times u prime of x,

00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:23.918
u of x is three pi over two minus x,

00:03:25.256 --> 00:03:27.423
three pi over two minus x.

00:03:28.767 --> 00:03:31.666
And then u prime of x,
we already figured out,

00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:33.566
is negative one, so I could write,

00:03:33.566 --> 00:03:36.212
times negative one, oh, yeah.

00:03:36.212 --> 00:03:37.783
Let me just leave it out there for now.

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:39.607
I could have just put
a negative out front,

00:03:39.607 --> 00:03:41.432
but I really want you to be able to see

00:03:41.432 --> 00:03:42.898
what I'm doing here.

00:03:42.898 --> 00:03:47.161
And now we want to evaluate
at x equals pi over four.

00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:49.911
So that is equal to pi over four.

00:03:51.693 --> 00:03:52.776
Pi over four.

00:03:53.882 --> 00:03:56.037
So let's see, this is going to be,

00:03:56.037 --> 00:03:59.517
this is going to be equal to sin of,

00:03:59.517 --> 00:04:02.152
what's three pi over
two minus pi over four?

00:04:02.152 --> 00:04:03.354
I'll do that over here.

00:04:03.354 --> 00:04:04.590
So we have a common denominator,

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.673
that is six pi over four,

00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:09.837
the same thing as three pi over two,

00:04:09.837 --> 00:04:11.420
minus pi over four,

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.193
minus pi over four, is equal to five,

00:04:18.182 --> 00:04:19.682
five pi over four.

00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:24.574
So it's sin of five pi over four,

00:04:26.056 --> 00:04:27.556
five pi over four,

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:33.066
over cosine squared of five pi over four,

00:04:35.363 --> 00:04:39.697
and then times negative one,
I can just put that out here.

00:04:39.697 --> 00:04:41.805
Now what is sin of five pi over four

00:04:41.805 --> 00:04:43.953
and cosine squared of five pi over four?

00:04:43.953 --> 00:04:46.729
Well, I don't have that memorized, but,

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.138
let's actually draw a unit circle

00:04:48.138 --> 00:04:49.958
and we should be able to,

00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.482
we should be able to
figure out what that is.

00:04:52.482 --> 00:04:53.982
So, a unit circle,

00:04:55.283 --> 00:04:59.169
I try to hand draw it as best as I can.

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.650
Please forgive me that
this circle does not look

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.339
really like a circle, alright.

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:05.173
Okay.

00:05:05.173 --> 00:05:07.283
So, let me just remember my angles.

00:05:07.283 --> 00:05:11.170
So, I, I in my brain, I
sometimes convert into degrees.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.420
Pi over four is 45 degrees.

00:05:15.103 --> 00:05:19.103
This is pi over two, this
is three pi over four,

00:05:19.941 --> 00:05:22.133
this is four pi over four,

00:05:22.133 --> 00:05:24.300
this is five pi over four,

00:05:25.233 --> 00:05:27.832
lands you right over there.

00:05:27.832 --> 00:05:31.727
So if you wanted to see where
you intersect the unit circle,

00:05:31.727 --> 00:05:35.310
this is at the point,
this is at the point.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.420
Your x-coordinate is negative
square root of two over two,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.865
negative square root of two over two,

00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:42.773
and your y-coordinate
is negative square root

00:05:42.773 --> 00:05:44.265
of two over two.

00:05:44.265 --> 00:05:46.044
If you are wondering how I got that,

00:05:46.044 --> 00:05:48.427
I encourage you to review the unit circle

00:05:48.427 --> 00:05:52.307
and some of the standard
angles around the unit circle.

00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:54.620
You'll see that in the
trigonometry section

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.365
of Khan Academy.

00:05:56.365 --> 00:05:59.429
But this is enough for us, because the sin

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:02.200
is the y-coordinate, it's
the y-coordinate here.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.848
So negative square root of two over two.

00:06:04.848 --> 00:06:08.456
So this is negative square
root of two over two.

00:06:08.456 --> 00:06:12.472
And then, the cosine is the x-coordinate,

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:14.586
which is also negative
square root of two over two,

00:06:14.586 --> 00:06:15.659
it's going to be that squared.

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.290
Negative square root of two
over two, we're squaring it.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.310
So if we square this, it's gonna become,

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.167
this is going to become,
it's gonna become positive.

00:06:26.167 --> 00:06:30.356
And then square root
of two squared is two,

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:33.085
and then two squared is four.

00:06:33.085 --> 00:06:35.116
So it's one half.

00:06:35.116 --> 00:06:37.885
So this is, the denominator's
equal to one half.

00:06:37.885 --> 00:06:39.086
See the numerator, this negative

00:06:39.086 --> 00:06:41.197
cancels out with that negative.

00:06:41.197 --> 00:06:43.107
And so we are left with,

00:06:43.107 --> 00:06:45.339
we deserve a little bit of a drum roll.

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:49.318
We are left with square
root of two over two,

00:06:49.318 --> 00:06:50.479
that's the numerator,

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.916
divided by one half, well
that's the same thing

00:06:52.916 --> 00:06:55.480
as multiplying by two.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.480
So we are left with
positive square root of two,

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.345
is the slope of the tangent line,

00:07:03.345 --> 00:07:05.666
to the graph of y is equal to this

00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:08.312
when x is equal to pi over four.

00:07:08.312 --> 00:07:09.645
Pretty exciting.
