DAVE: I'm pleased to
introduce Peggy Orenstein.

00:00:02.405 --> 00:00:04.580
In addition to being
a bestselling author,

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.244
she's been named
one of the "40 women

00:00:06.244 --> 00:00:08.410
who changed the media
business in the past 40 years"

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.650
by the "Columbia
Journalism Review."

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.580
Her last few books have
focused on topics related

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.730
to her growing daughter,
or are relevant to them,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.340
and this book continues
in that tradition.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.610
As the father of
a teenage girl, I

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.915
found the topic both
interesting and concerning.

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:26.460
Even though I started the
book with my daughter in mind,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.752
along the way it
gave me insights

00:00:28.752 --> 00:00:30.900
relevant to both of
my children, and I'm

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.750
sure you'll find
it insightful, too.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.330
Please join me in giving a warm
welcome to Peggy Orenstein.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.935
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:44.290
PEGGY ORENSTEIN: So I
have-- oh, yeah look.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.030
I've got a microphone on me.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.530
This is interesting,
because I have yet

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.106
to do an event where there are
more than three men present.

00:00:56.106 --> 00:00:57.594
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:57.594 --> 00:00:58.976
So this is sort of cool.

00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:00.600
I wondered about this
coming to Google,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.683
because I kind of figured
it was a little bit more

00:01:02.683 --> 00:01:05.280
of a guy place to work, although
that might be a stereotype,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.010
and I apologize if that's true.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.800
But I was excited about that.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.970
So I wanted to talk a
little bit about this book,

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.850
and how I came to do it,
and some of what I found.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.146
And then I thought
we could just chat

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.270
if that works for you guys.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.610
So I came to this book
really-- my previous book

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.205
had been called "Cinderella
Ate My Daughter."

00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:35.150
And that was looking at the ways
that the culture was telling

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.690
girls, from the very youngest
ages, that how they looked

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.254
was more important
than who they were.

00:01:42.254 --> 00:01:43.920
And I was looking at
that through a kind

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.840
of pop cultural lens.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.090
And I was looking at it partly
because I'm a mother myself,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.110
and I have a 12-- now
12-and-1/2-year-old daughter.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.350
And after I finished that
book, I was going around,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.850
and I was starting to hear
some stories that were really

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.100
concerning me about
the hookup culture

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.220
and about sexting and
about binge drinking.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.973
And my first response
was to kind of go, ooh,

00:02:09.973 --> 00:02:10.930
my child's little.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.013
I don't have to hear this.

00:02:12.013 --> 00:02:15.036
I don't want to hear this yet.

00:02:15.036 --> 00:02:18.080
Parenting from ignorance
and fear, generally not

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.830
the best idea.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.845
So I started sort
of digging into it.

00:02:22.845 --> 00:02:26.835
And what I wanted
to look at was,

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:29.129
we're having this
umbrella conversation

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.670
in this culture
right now that's been

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.910
going on for several years
about assault on campus.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.906
And it's a really, really,
really important topic.

00:02:39.906 --> 00:02:47.470
But consent, it's a really low
bar for a sexual experience.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.040
You know, like, I was not
assaulted is a really low bar

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.030
for a sexual experience.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.700
And so I became
really interested

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.620
in looking at what was going
on in young women's lives

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.860
after yes, and what had
changed, what hadn't, how

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.330
they-- whether they felt more
in control of their experience,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.940
whether they were more able
to create something that

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.070
was satisfying them,
whether they were more

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.490
able to articulate
their wants, needs,

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.745
and desires than
previous generations,

00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:16.760
and whether some of
the dynamics that

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.600
were happening in
those relationships

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.150
were feeding into
the culture that

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.910
was surfacing around
coercive sex and assault.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.670
So I decided to talk
to young women who

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.670
were between the
ages of 15 and 20,

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.760
because that's
sort of when girls

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.730
are becoming sexually active.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.088
And I talked to girls
who were-- they spanned

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:45.424
a pretty broad
ethnic demographic,

00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:50.120
but they were all middle class,
they were all in high school,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.270
either going to college
or already in college.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.280
And I particularly chose that
demographic because I wanted

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.040
to talk to girls
that we think of

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.880
has having opportunity,
and the kind of girls

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.730
that we think of as
being the beneficiaries

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.265
of the feminist movement.

00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:07.436
Because if those
girls who were-- I

00:04:07.436 --> 00:04:08.810
mean, the girls
I talked to, they

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.400
were-- if I had been
interviewing them

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.410
about their education,
their aspirations,

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.960
their professional
dreams, I would

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.540
have walked away so impressed.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.600
And if these girls who were
leaning in all over the place,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.890
you know, were toppling
in their personal lives,

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.860
I felt that we couldn't really
deny that there were issues

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.640
that we needed to address.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.950
And what I found with them was
that while today's young women

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.370
felt entitled to engage
in sexual activity,

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.810
they didn't necessarily
feel entitled to enjoy it.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.070
So as one young
woman I talked to,

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.940
who is a sophomore at an Ivy
League school said to me,

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.670
you know, I come from
generations of strong women.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.095
And my grandmother was a
firecracker, and my mother's

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:58.670
super strong, and my sister
and I are really loud,

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.030
and that's our feminine power.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.840
And then she proceeded
to articulate

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:10.640
a kind of series of
hookups that were

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.770
kind of demeaning,
depersonalized, not

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.040
very pleasurable.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.220
And she said, you know,
I think we girls are just

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.320
socialized to be deferential
and not express our wants.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.500
And I said, wait.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.660
Five minutes ago,
you told me that you

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.630
were a really strong woman.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.566
And she kind of hemmed and hawed
and she said, yeah, you know,

00:05:34.566 --> 00:05:36.940
I don't think anybody ever
told me that that strong woman

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.410
image applied to sex.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.650
And I began to think about
this disconnect between how

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.440
we talk about sex in the
culture and how we see sex

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.830
all around us, and how
the landscape is littered

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.060
with female body parts
used to sell everything

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.640
that we can possibly think
of, and the complete dearth

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.160
of honest conversation,
frank conversation,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.350
real, authentic
conversation that we

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.230
have with young
women-- and young men,

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.090
but particularly young
women-- about sex.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.010
And the whole idea of where
my previous book led me

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.160
to this book-- or
I was saying, girls

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.804
used to talk about
pretty, and how

00:06:19.804 --> 00:06:21.220
it was more important
to be pretty

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.660
than to be anything else,
that had morphed into hot.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.924
And girls were
sold hot, which is

00:06:28.924 --> 00:06:35.420
a really narrow, superficial,
commercialized idea of what's

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.130
sexy and what's
attractive that tells them

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.930
over and over that how their
bodies look to someone else

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.555
is more important than how
those bodies feel to themselves.

00:06:45.555 --> 00:06:49.450
And they're sold that in a way
that whereas I think parents

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.590
who are Gen-X parents or who
are Baby Boom parents, women

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.490
that age would have
pushed back against that

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.480
as self-objectification
or sexualization.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.105
For today's young
women, that's sold

00:07:01.105 --> 00:07:05.340
as a source of empowerment
and self-confidence,

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.150
and often is the
most important source

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.190
of self-confidence and power.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.950
So it becomes much more
complicated for those girls.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.245
For instance, as one young woman
that I was talking to said,

00:07:17.245 --> 00:07:20.115
she showed me a
picture of herself,

00:07:20.115 --> 00:07:22.610
and she was going
to a party, and she

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.580
had the requisite crop top and
little skirt and high heels.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.255
And she said, you know,
I'm proud of my body,

00:07:30.255 --> 00:07:33.160
and I never feel more
liberated than when

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.070
I'm wearing skimpy clothing.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.260
And I said, OK.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.580
And we talked about
it a little more.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.520
And a few minutes later, she
said that a year previous,

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.050
she wouldn't have worn that
same outfit because she

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.790
was 25 pounds heavier.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.384
And as she put it,
some jerky boys

00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:49.800
would have called
me the fat girl,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.040
and that would be bad
for my mental health.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.010
So then I felt we needed
to have a discussion,

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.240
and have a discussion
with young girls about who

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.910
gets to be proud of
which bodies under what

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.750
circumstances, and how
liberating that idea of hot

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.360
really is if humiliation
and judgment lurk just

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.420
around the corner.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.370
And what we know in
the culture of hot

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.260
is that
self-sexualization affects

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.860
girls cognitively,
psychologically,

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.210
and in a real bait-and-switch,
it affects them sexually.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.370
Girls who
self-sexualize actually

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.730
report less power
in the bedroom,

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.510
less satisfaction, less
control over their experiences.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.446
So there's this way
that I felt like, OK.

00:08:37.456 --> 00:08:41.530
If the opposite were
true, if this was truly

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.110
creating a more powerful
situation for girls

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.510
in the workplace, in
education, in their sex lives,

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.520
I'd have to say, all right.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.130
I'm just fusty and old, and
it's time for me to shuffle off,

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.016
you know?

00:08:54.016 --> 00:08:57.310
But it seemed quite
apparent to me

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.450
that the confidence was
coming out with the clothes,

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.240
coming off with the clothes.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.240
And whether we were
talking about porn,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.740
whether we were
talking about pop,

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.100
whether we were talking about
fashion, what girls were

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.340
learning was that pleasing
others was more important

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.880
than their own pleasure,
that being desirable

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.120
was more important than
understanding their desire,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.350
that appearing sexy was more
important than understanding

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.090
their own sexuality.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.500
And one of the things that
I talk about in the book

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:31.810
is the way that we
need to, as adults,

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.840
change the way that we
talk about sex with kids

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.300
and broaden our
definition of sex

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.530
beyond virginity and
beyond intercourse.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.560
Because when we talk about
sex as being intercourse,

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.900
we are-- and in fact, the
rates of intercourse among kids

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.325
have not changed.

00:09:48.325 --> 00:09:49.950
They're sexually
active at the same age

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.980
as they were 20 years
ago, and they're sexually

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.390
active at the same rates.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.980
However, that denies and
diminishes and marginalizes

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.520
the other forms
of sexual activity

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.510
that are taking place,
particularly oral sex.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.410
And it makes it so
that those are not

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:10.000
subject to the same
rules about consent,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.380
coercion, responsibility,
and respect.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.035
It makes it into not sex.

00:10:16.035 --> 00:10:19.170
So particularly where
oral sex was concerned,

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:24.470
I heard so many stories
about girls having, you know,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:25.000
oral sex.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.200
And when I say that,
I mean female on male,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.410
because male on female was
a whole different situation

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:31.150
for girls.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.500
But female and male, they
would describe as not sex.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.030
That would describe
as no big deal.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.130
And they engaged in it
for a lot of reasons.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:42.810
It was to please a partner,
to gain popularity,

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:48.620
to feel a sense of
power, to feel desirable,

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.375
because they wanted
an evening to end,

00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:51.750
and they wanted
a guy to go away,

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.290
and they didn't know how
else to make him go away.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.040
But it was rarely something
that was in their own bodies.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.040
And after a while, I
started saying to girls,

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.870
because I got sort of
frustrated by hearing

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.670
all these stories of this
one-way situation, what

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.550
if every time you
were alone with a guy,

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.340
he asked you to
go to the kitchen

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:19.640
and get him a glass of
water, and he never offered

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.560
to get you a glass of water?

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.240
Or if he did, it
was kind of like--

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.740
[SIGH]

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.695
You want me to, you know,
get you a glass of water?

00:11:32.695 --> 00:11:34.400
You know, really begrudging.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.105
You would never stand for it.

00:11:36.105 --> 00:11:38.150
And they would say--
they would laugh

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.570
and they'd say, well, when
you put it that way, yeah.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.110
And I said, well, maybe you
need to put it that way.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.940
Maybe you need to think
about why for you it's

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.990
more insulting to think
about getting somebody

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:52.520
a glass of water than performing
a nonreciprocal sex act.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.380
And it wasn't just about
girls getting theirs.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.431
But I became very
intrigued with this idea

00:11:59.431 --> 00:12:01.750
of what Sara McClelland,
who's a researcher

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.926
of the University of Michigan,
calls intimate justice.

00:12:04.926 --> 00:12:11.950
And just like when
we talk about who

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.050
does the dishes in your home is
partly a political act as well

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:20.000
as a personal accommodation,
sex has those dynamics too,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.970
and it can bring
up similar ideas

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.550
about equality, economic
disparity, mental health,

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:26.270
violence.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:30.452
And we need to ask, when we
talk about girls and sex,

00:12:30.452 --> 00:12:33.090
who gets to engage
in an experience?

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.690
Who's entitled to enjoy it?

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.350
Who's the primary beneficiary
of that experience?

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.680
And how each partner
defines good enough.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.590
And those are
really thorny ideas

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.650
to explore for adult
women, I think.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.970
But when we're talking
about girls' early formative

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.440
experience that's going
to be following them

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.160
through their lives,
you know, I just-- I

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.180
don't want girls' early
experiences to be something

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.402
that they have to get over.

00:13:02.402 --> 00:13:05.940
And that was something that I
was just hearing way too much.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.390
So as part of that
intimate justice,

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.650
we set girls up to
expect inequality

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.470
in their sexual relationships.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:18.830
And I call that the
psychological clitoridectomy,

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.670
that we engage in.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:24.210
So when baby girls and
baby boys are born,

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.467
we tend to name all of
our baby boy's body parts.

00:13:27.467 --> 00:13:29.550
So at least we'll say,
like, there's your pee-pee.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.800
Something like that, you know?

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.395
But with girls, we tend
to go from navel to knees.

00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:36.620
And we just don't
name that great void.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.640
And there's no better way to
make something unspeakable

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.820
than not to name it.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.730
Then girls go into their
puberty education classes,

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:51.635
and they learn that boys have
erections and ejaculations

00:13:51.635 --> 00:13:57.532
and girls have periods
and unwanted pregnancy,

00:13:57.532 --> 00:13:59.270
which are not the same thing.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:04.940
And we only see that sort of
internal diagram, you know,

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.810
that looks like a
steer head, of girls.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.480
And it grays out
between the legs.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.250
So we never hear the
word vulva, we never

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.830
hear the word clitoris.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:20.605
And not surprisingly, fewer
than half of girls ages 14 to 17

00:14:20.605 --> 00:14:22.980
have ever masturbated.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.435
And then they go into their
partnered interactions,

00:14:26.435 --> 00:14:29.310
and we somehow expect
that magically they're

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.530
going to be able to
articulate their wants,

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.530
their needs, their
desires, their limits,

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:34.572
and have those respected.

00:14:34.572 --> 00:14:36.529
We think that they're
going to be able to think

00:14:36.529 --> 00:14:37.450
they have a voice.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.260
We think that they're going
to be able to advocate

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
for an equal relationship.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.040
And it's really just
not that realistic.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.082
And so again, you
know, I wanted to talk

00:14:48.082 --> 00:14:49.540
about that idea of
virginity, and I

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.080
wanted to talk about the
idea of satisfaction.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.310
Because one thing
that we know is

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.180
that we think of
satisfaction as being

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:01.490
one kind of monolithic idea in
that we know how to define it.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.380
But in fact, young
women and young men

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.700
define satisfaction
very differently.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.140
So young women are more
likely than young men

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.710
to measure their satisfaction
by their partner's pleasure.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.890
So they'll say, if he had a
good time, I had a good time.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.050
Whereas young men are
more likely to measure

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.190
their satisfaction by
their own pleasure.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:26.820
So if I had a good
time, I had a good time.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.910
What's interesting
is that that dynamic

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.260
remains the same for
girls when they're

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.320
in same-sex relationships.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.110
So that's when we sort of see
an interesting transformation,

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.780
that in same-sex
liaisons, girls tend

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:43.636
to be orgasmic at the same
rate as heterosexual men.

00:15:43.636 --> 00:15:45.280
Also really
interesting, and back

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.230
to the point of
virginity-- or actually,

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.820
let me skip back a second
before I get to that.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.730
One of the things that gay
and lesbian girls would say--

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.520
gay and bisexual
girls would say to me

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.910
is that when they were with
other women, other girls,

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.965
that they felt that they
could get off the script.

00:16:02.965 --> 00:16:06.502
And they used-- several of
them used that word, script,

00:16:06.502 --> 00:16:09.980
which is the cultural script,
the media script, the porn

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.180
script, every script.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.360
The sex education script.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.450
And that when they
got off that script,

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:20.260
they were free to create
an experience that

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.262
worked for them, and
that wasn't dictated

00:16:23.262 --> 00:16:24.720
by something outside
of themselves,

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.290
and it was a more creative act.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.040
And that really stuck
with me as something

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.800
that I think that we
can learn from even

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.940
if we're in other sex liaisons.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.890
The other piece of that was
when I was talking earlier about

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:42.350
virginity, when we
continually talk

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.330
about sex and virginity
as intercourse--

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:45.955
not because intercourse
is no big deal.

00:16:45.955 --> 00:16:49.010
Of course it's a big deal, but
it's not the only big deal.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.910
And it also marginalizes
and it completely

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:56.050
ignores the experience of
lesbian and bisexual girls.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.600
And so I asked a
young woman, how

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.050
did you know that you
weren't a virgin anymore

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.950
when you've never had
heterosexual intercourse?

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.849
Oh, I get to make
this joke here.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:07.900
This is so great.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.355
She said, I had to Google it.

00:17:10.355 --> 00:17:13.829
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:15.329
Guess what?

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.260
Google didn't know.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.450
Guys, get on it.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:23.119
So she said, there
was no answer.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:27.029
And I said, well,
what did you decide?

00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:29.070
And she sort of hemmed
and she hawed for a while,

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:34.210
and she said, you know, I
think I stopped being a virgin

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:37.556
when I had my first
orgasm with a partner.

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:41.070
And I thought,
just for a second,

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.745
what if that was the definition?

00:17:43.745 --> 00:17:47.300
How that would shift our
whole conception of sexuality.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.540
And it's this idea that
sexuality, especially

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.190
for young people, should be
this pool of experiences that

00:17:55.190 --> 00:18:00.590
is about warmth and closeness
and affection and sensation

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:06.850
and communication and pleasure.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.494
Not this race to a goal.

00:18:09.494 --> 00:18:13.030
And you know, I
like to say, when

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:17.230
I talk to young people, who's
really more experienced?

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:21.445
The person who spends three
hours kissing their partner

00:18:21.445 --> 00:18:24.590
and experimenting with these
ideas of erotic tension

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.230
and communication and sensation?

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:30.810
Or the person who gets wasted,
hooks up with a random,

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.830
and tries to dump their
virginity before they

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.960
get to college?

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.160
So it's just a way
to sort of think

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.740
about how to reframe this.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.860
I'm just trying to decide
how much I want to talk,

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.670
and how much I want
to let you guys ask.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.720
I mean, I talk a lot
about the hookup culture,

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:57.630
and what has changed
in recent years.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.237
Young people did not
invent casual sex, right?

00:19:00.237 --> 00:19:00.870
[LAUGH]

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.300
I heard that.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:02.800
[LAUGH]

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.970
You know, please.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:09.210
But what has changed is the
idea that sex arises out

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:14.780
of-- proceeds rather than
arises out of intimacy,

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.090
and that that's the norm.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.800
And that was true in
colleges, and it was becoming

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.010
more true in high school.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:24.250
So that whether
young women wanted

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.290
to be part of hookup
culture or wanted

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.089
to opt out of hookup culture,
or wanted to go in and out,

00:19:29.089 --> 00:19:30.630
or however they
wanted to do it, they

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.520
had to define themselves
and their relationships

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.260
and their sexuality in
relationship to that culture.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.600
And some young women
were really into it.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.500
Some girls would come
in, sit down, and say,

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.940
I am so sick of women
being portrayed as victims

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.130
of the hookup culture.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:49.972
I am a participant, I want
to be here, this serves me.

00:19:49.972 --> 00:19:51.430
I don't want a
boyfriend right now.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.300
I don't have time for
a boyfriend right now.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.674
I want to focus on school, I
want to focus on my friends,

00:19:55.674 --> 00:19:59.312
and I still want to have a sex
life, and this is how I do it.

00:19:59.312 --> 00:20:03.515
Other women found it, you
know, unhygienic and just not

00:20:03.515 --> 00:20:05.390
something that they
wanted to participate in.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.740
But they all had to do that.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.120
And what became
interesting to me

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.630
was not thinking about
hookups good or hookups bad,

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.630
relationships good
or relationships bad.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:15.930
I'm not prescriptive that way.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.420
That's not my job.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.091
But what I did want to
talk about with girls

00:20:20.091 --> 00:20:21.590
and what I did want
them to know was

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.660
what they were
likely and probably

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.800
were not likely to get
out of a situation.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.130
So to know that if you're
going to go out and hook up--

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.170
and hookups, of course, are
not just lubricated by alcohol.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.700
They are dependent
on it in order

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.750
to create what a
sociologist at Occidental

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.110
told me was called
compulsory carelessness.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.990
So trying to anesthetize
yourself against feelings

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:49.910
so that you can go into these
sexual liaisons-- she said,

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:53.070
actually, her interview
subjects talk about sober sex

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:56.110
like it was an amazing unicorn.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:00.190
So going into a
hookup, you'll probably

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.050
get an adrenaline rush.

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:09.420
You'll probably get a sense
of conquest, a war story.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.090
You'll probably feel desirable
for a short period of time.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.520
You'll get a warm body.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.990
You might have some fun.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.930
What you probably won't
get out of hookups

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:22.000
is good sex, or
the tools that you

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.970
need in order to practice
good sex or create intimacy.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.250
So my hope was by surfacing
that and surfacing

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:33.240
how girls talked
about hookups was

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.410
to allow them to look at
what the realities were

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.420
of their choices, and then make
the choice from an informed

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.200
place.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.700
I'm not telling
them how to make it,

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.810
but this is what
they need to know.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:55.400
So at the end of the book,
I end in a co-ed classroom.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.610
And I do that on
purpose, because I really

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:01.400
wanted to stop in a place where
boys and girls were working out

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.820
these issues together.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.560
Because I do have great belief
that teenagers are thoughtful,

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.940
they are eager,
they're interested,

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.830
and they're capable of working
out their ethics, their values,

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:16.875
and learning to treat people
with ethics and respect.

00:22:16.875 --> 00:22:19.700
And in part of that, in looking
at that section of the book,

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.110
I also looked at
other countries.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:24.765
And one of the things that
was most interesting to me

00:22:24.765 --> 00:22:27.990
was comparing the experience
of Dutch teenagers

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:29.870
to American teenagers.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:35.410
And I looked at research
that showed how Dutch college

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.110
girls and American
college girls spoke

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.270
about their early
sexual experiences.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:44.070
So these were demographically
very similar groups.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:48.360
On every measure,
the Dutch girls,

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:53.150
whether it was fewer negative
consequences like pregnancy,

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:57.990
disease, regret, or enhanced
positive consequences

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:04.550
like knowing your partner,
preparing responsibly, enjoying

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:08.686
the experience, having
a positive body image,

00:23:08.686 --> 00:23:14.650
every single measure, the
Dutch girls came out way ahead.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:19.140
They embodied everything that
we hope for for our girls.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.140
So what was different?

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:26.250
Well, in Dutch culture,
teachers, doctors, and parents

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:30.610
talk explicitly about sex
from the time kids are young.

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:33.760
In an age-appropriate
way, obviously.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.710
And what was particularly
different was parents,

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:39.370
that while parents, American
parents and Dutch parents

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.550
were no less-- were no different
in their comfort levels

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.060
in talking about
sex, American parents

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:50.140
spoke exclusively
about risk and disease,

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:53.530
and Dutch parents talked
about balancing responsibility

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.790
and joy.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:59.136
And I'll tell you that
thinking about that as a parent

00:23:59.136 --> 00:24:01.070
really made a big
difference to me.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.880
Because I think that before,
I would have reflexively said,

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.374
you know, I've talked to my
daughter about contraception,

00:24:08.374 --> 00:24:10.540
I've talked to my daughter
about disease protection,

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.831
I've talked to my daughter--
because I'm really modern,

00:24:12.831 --> 00:24:15.910
I've talked to
her about consent.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:17.910
And then I would have
thought, good job, Peggy.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.377
Job is done.

00:24:20.377 --> 00:24:22.960
Now I know that that's not true,
and there's a whole other job

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.310
that I have to
figure out how to do.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.240
And that's important
for boys as well.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.864
And one of the-- I'll
tell you that one

00:24:28.864 --> 00:24:33.900
of the most meaningful moments
in the classroom that I was in

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:37.430
was when a young boy, a high
school boy, raised his hand.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:40.146
And they were talking about
something, and he said,

00:24:40.146 --> 00:24:43.845
you know that baseball
metaphor for sex?

00:24:43.845 --> 00:24:47.480
In baseball, there's
winners and there's losers.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.170
So who's supposed to
be the loser in sex?

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.250
And I thought, you know, bingo.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.780
Like, that was just
a small revelation,

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.050
but that boy, in
making that switch,

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:02.330
will go more into his
partnerships as a partner

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.770
rather than as an
adversary trying to score.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:08.000
And actually, I don't even think
that girls in that metaphor

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.290
are the opposite team.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:13.140
I think that girls might
be the field, right?

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.560
Saying It's not even that good.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.474
So thinking about how to
replace that, I have--

00:25:18.474 --> 00:25:19.890
and I'll end on
this, because it's

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.112
my favorite thing in the world.

00:25:22.112 --> 00:25:23.689
Do you guys know Al Vernacchio?

00:25:23.689 --> 00:25:24.605
Do you know who he is?

00:25:24.605 --> 00:25:26.200
He did a TED Talk.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.340
He's a sex educator
in Pennsylvania.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.214
And he advocates
replacing the base--

00:25:32.214 --> 00:25:34.005
and if you can do one
thing with your kids,

00:25:34.005 --> 00:25:37.370
this is it-- replacing the
baseball metaphor with a pizza

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.620
metaphor, and here's why.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:46.050
When we go out to pizza, we
have a shared experience.

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:48.480
First, we decide together,
you want to have pizza?

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.410
Yeah, let's have pizza.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.500
Then we go to the pizza
place, and we order a pie,

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.530
and we negotiate.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:56.100
We talk about, like,
maybe I like mushrooms

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.200
and you like pepperoni.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.560
And so maybe we'll go halfsies.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.030
Or maybe we'll have
mushrooms this time

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.110
and pepperoni next time.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.270
Or maybe if you keep insisting
on pepperoni and I keep kosher,

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.740
I'm not going to go out
to pizza with you anymore.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:09.871
You know?

00:26:09.871 --> 00:26:13.686
It's a kind of endless
metaphor, but it is all about

00:26:13.686 --> 00:26:16.720
having an experience
that's shared,

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.805
everybody's invested in
one another's pleasure.

00:26:18.805 --> 00:26:20.430
You would never want
to go out to pizza

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.230
and have your partner not
care if your partner didn't

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:24.907
like the pizza you were having.

00:26:24.907 --> 00:26:26.240
You want them to like the pizza.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.948
You want to have an
enjoyable experience.

00:26:27.948 --> 00:26:29.590
You want to be communicating.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:33.100
And you can see, you
can take that metaphor

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.310
in all different directions.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.840
But it's so far
superior in thinking

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.720
about how we can
talk to our kids

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.170
and raise them so
that they can think

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.680
about their sexuality in
terms of intimate justice,

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.480
and so that they can think
about engaging ethically,

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.460
responsibly, respectfully,
and joyfully,

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.940
whether their liaisons
last for 10 minutes

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.750
or whether they
last for 10 years.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.550
So I will stop there, and I'd
be happy to take any questions.

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:00.690
Probably not the
discussion you think

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.157
you're going to have in the
middle of a work day, right?

00:27:02.157 --> 00:27:02.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:04.580
I appreciate that you came.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.360
Anybody have any thoughts?

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.592
Yeah?

00:27:08.592 --> 00:27:11.050
AUDIENCE: So the question I
have is about the research that

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.740
compares the Netherlands
and the United States.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.990
Is there research that
compares the Netherlands

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:18.250
to the best state in the US?

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:20.250
Because it seems like
it's such a small country,

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:23.270
and all the people
are very similar,

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.050
whereas the US is
huge and very diverse.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:28.640
So I feel like it's maybe
not a very fair comparison.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.098
PEGGY ORENSTEIN: Well, here's
why it was a fair comparison,

00:27:31.098 --> 00:27:33.816
because it wasn't comparing the
demographic to a broad swath

00:27:33.816 --> 00:27:34.690
of the United States.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.620
It was comparing
two sets of girls

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.950
who were in college, who
were the same age, who

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:43.510
were the same ethnic
background, and who were largely

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:46.420
the same religious background
and the same economic

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.140
background.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.320
So it wasn't
comparing Dutch girls

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.740
to the broad swath
of American society.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.180
It was comparing the demographic
that I was particularly

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.000
interested in to
the demographic I

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.730
was particularly interested in.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:03.520
But in terms of
states, you know, yeah.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.930
There's huge diverse--
I mean, the truth

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:11.800
is that only 23 states in our
country mandate sex education,

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.372
and only 13 mandate that
it be medically accurate.

00:28:16.372 --> 00:28:19.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:19.675
I know.

00:28:19.675 --> 00:28:21.200
I mean, it's very sad.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.170
And one of them-- I live in
California, and one of them

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:25.370
is supposed to be mine.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:30.595
But it wasn't until last
summer that the city of Clovis

00:28:30.595 --> 00:28:34.960
was found in violation of that,
because they were running films

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.430
in their sex ed class
that compared a sexually

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:41.800
active, unmarried woman
to a dirty old shoe,

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.507
and had the kids chanting--
I can't remember exactly

00:28:45.507 --> 00:28:47.590
what they were saying now--
but they were teaching

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:51.420
them anti-gay slogans to chant
in school, in public school.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.611
Yeah.

00:28:52.611 --> 00:28:53.466
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:53.466 --> 00:28:53.922
PEGGY ORENSTEIN: Mm-hm.

00:28:53.922 --> 00:28:56.340
You know, I'll say one other
thing about the Netherlands too

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.048
that's a sort of
broader idea about them.

00:28:58.048 --> 00:29:00.280
But the one thing that
also really struck me

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.330
as a parent was Amy
Schalet, who wrote a book

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:04.830
called "Not Under
my Roof" and also

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.710
compared the Netherlands
to Americans,

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:09.430
she found some really
interesting things.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.640
And one of them
was that we expect

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.710
American teenagers to
grow up by creating

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:18.415
a rift with their parents.

00:29:18.415 --> 00:29:20.920
That we expect,
particularly girls,

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.860
we expect them to present
as the good girl at home,

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.550
and to lie either overtly or
by omission about what they're

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:28.755
doing outside of the home.

00:29:28.755 --> 00:29:30.380
And I certainly saw
that with the girls

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.338
I talked to who were
always saying things like,

00:29:32.338 --> 00:29:34.360
ugh, my father
thinks I'm a virgin,

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.770
or my mother has no
idea what I'm doing.

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:42.250
And in Holland, they're expected
to discuss these matters

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.380
in the family, they're
expected to grow up

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.380
in an interdependent
way with the family,

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.440
and parents use that
as a way to continue

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.150
to exert a kind of soft
control over the kids

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:54.870
so that they can reiterate
ideas about safety,

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.720
ideas about values,
ideas about respect.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.890
And when I thought about
that, I thought, oh, my gosh.

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:05.780
I don't want my daughter to
have to grow up by lying to me.

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.610
I want to be on her team.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:09.770
Well, at the same
time, I also realized

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:15.480
that that can be hard to do when
you're the parent, especially

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.710
in our culture.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:20.030
And so I really advocate
also building the team.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:22.330
Here's a good-- this
baseball metaphor works.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.095
Build the team.

00:30:24.095 --> 00:30:26.250
And I've been that
person where--

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.500
I have a friend
whose daughter was

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:33.295
becoming-- thinking about having
intercourse when she was 16.

00:30:33.295 --> 00:30:36.020
And she asked me,
the mother asked

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.239
me to go out and have a
conversation with the girl.

00:30:38.239 --> 00:30:40.530
And like everybody, I wanted
to fall through the floor.

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:41.970
I'm no different.

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:43.626
But I said, look.

00:30:43.626 --> 00:30:44.784
Let's talk about this.

00:30:44.784 --> 00:30:46.200
I know you're
thinking about this.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.550
Let's talk about contraception.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.050
Let's talk about
disease protection.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.840
Let's talk consent.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.650
And I'm going to ask
you some questions.

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:55.160
You don't have to
answer them, but I

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.030
want you to think about them.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:58.460
Have you ever masturbated?

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.280
Have you had an
orgasm on your own?

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.210
Have you had an orgasm
with your partner?

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:06.150
Can you tell this partner
what you like and don't like?

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:08.580
Can you tell him no when
you're ready to stop,

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.260
and have him respect that?

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.280
Are you able to communicate
with him around these issues?

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:17.740
And if you answer no to those
questions, what is it that you

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.020
want out of this experience?

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.240
What is it that
you want for you?

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.902
Why are you doing this?

00:31:22.902 --> 00:31:24.110
And she didn't really answer.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:27.725
She just-- her eyes got,
you know, as big as my head.

00:31:27.725 --> 00:31:30.870
And I don't know what
she ultimately decided.

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:34.106
But she's 24 now.

00:31:34.106 --> 00:31:35.980
And we talk-- I just
talked to her yesterday.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.010
We talk all the time.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:40.480
We talk about her sex life,
we talk about her job,

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.310
we talk about her ideas
about graduate school.

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:44.720
We talk about everything.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.590
And I feel like that
conversation opened

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:51.490
this door where she knew that
there was never going to-- I

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.390
was never going to
flinch, you know?

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:54.750
I was never going to flinch.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.590
No matter what she told me, no
matter what we talked about,

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:58.420
I was there.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.770
And I just think
to be able to have

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.960
that relationship
with your niece,

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.570
with your friends' kids, with
your own daughter, ideally,

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:07.925
is just a huge gift
in this culture.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.242
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:32:12.242 --> 00:32:15.005
So you mentioned kind
of offhand talking

00:32:15.005 --> 00:32:18.997
to children in age-appropriate
ways about sex.

00:32:18.997 --> 00:32:20.455
One of the things
that I've learned

00:32:20.455 --> 00:32:22.560
in talking with many
different parents

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.380
is that the definition
of age-appropriate

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.520
varies very widely.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:30.950
Do you have any
guidance on-- that?

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:32.525
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:32.525 --> 00:32:34.275
PEGGY ORENSTEIN: You
know what I would do?

00:32:34.275 --> 00:32:36.316
I think what I'd like to
do is recommend a couple

00:32:36.316 --> 00:32:40.570
books to you, because that's
a really long conversation.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:42.710
And there are really
interesting books

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:47.190
that look at it from a
developmental psychology

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:49.240
point of view.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.270
Deborah Roffman's book
"Talk to Me First"

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:56.167
talks about kids from
infancy to teenage years.

00:32:56.167 --> 00:32:57.750
I mean, you know,
upper teenage years.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:59.680
And Al Vernacchio,
the pizza guy,

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.800
has a book called
"For Goodness Sex."

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.292
And both of those books are
wonderful about guiding you.

00:33:05.292 --> 00:33:07.000
Like, what do you tell
your two-year-old?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.833
You know, what do you
tell your 10-year-old?

00:33:08.833 --> 00:33:10.281
What do you tell
your 12-year-old?

00:33:10.281 --> 00:33:11.530
It's really helpful from that.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.650
But I do think that
there is a way that we

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:16.320
start from the get-go by
naming the body parts.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.180
And I mean, I don't know if
any of you have a preschooler,

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.830
but preschoolers
masturbate all the time.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:31.140
And one way to talk about
that with them is to say, gee,

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.522
you know, it's great.

00:33:32.522 --> 00:33:34.980
It feels really good when you
touch your vulva, doesn't it?

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.160
And-- not but-- and we don't do
that at the Thanksgiving table.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.230
We do that in
private in our rooms.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:46.000
And, you know, it's OK to talk
about privacy, which is not

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.290
the same as secrecy,
and start building

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:51.560
that idea of bodily
integrity and pleasure,

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.750
and having control and
understanding of your body.

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:57.050
It's OK to say, you don't
have to hug Great Aunt

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.180
Nancy if you don't want to.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.949
I'm not going to make you do
that, because that's pushing

00:34:01.949 --> 00:34:03.490
you beyond a boundary,
and you should

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:04.781
be able to set your boundaries.

00:34:04.781 --> 00:34:06.790
Nor am I going to make
her hug you, and I'm just

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.290
going to live with
the embarrassment

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:12.260
that Great Aunt Nancy thinks I'm
a really bad parent, you know?

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.690
So even things like that that
aren't necessarily-- I mean,

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:17.350
a lot of this is not about sex.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:19.389
It's about creating an
atmosphere of trust,

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:22.560
and it's about creating an
atmosphere of ethics and values

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.960
in the same way that we do in
any area of our kids' lives,

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.600
and the way that we want them
to treat others, and in the way

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.939
that we want them to expect
others to treat them.

00:34:30.939 --> 00:34:32.480
But I would recommend
those two books

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.540
about the actual,
direct specifics.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.040
AUDIENCE: Can you
repeat the titles?

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.219
PEGGY ORENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:44.650
"Talk to Me First" by Deborah
Roffman and "For Goodness Sex"

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:51.900
by Al Vernacchio, which is
V-E-R-N-A-C-C-H-I-O, I think.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.536
But if you look up pizza guy
and sex, you'll find him.

00:34:55.536 --> 00:34:56.456
AUDIENCE: Nice, nice.

00:34:56.456 --> 00:34:59.432
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:59.432 --> 00:35:00.560
AUDIENCE: So I have a--

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.560
PEGGY ORENSTEIN: I didn't
see you come up there.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.101
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:04.292
PEGGY ORENSTEIN: Ninja.

00:35:04.292 --> 00:35:05.160
AUDIENCE: Stealthy.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.900
I have a really good
friend who wants

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:12.430
to raise her children with
a culturally appropriate

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:13.450
for her sexual ethic.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:15.640
They are very strong Christians.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.240
I'm personally not, but she's
a really good friend of mine.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.940
And one of her
challenges is she wants

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:24.500
to be able to have these
sorts of conversations

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:29.270
that respect the child,
the girls as women who

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:33.600
have these bodies, but has even
less resources for doing so

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:38.730
in a way within that subculture
where I think a lot of-- just

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.610
the idea of saying,
you know, oh, think

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.110
about the relationship you're
in and what you're getting out

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:48.540
of it, is not really the
conversation she wants to have.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.790
I mean, if it's the reality,
that's a different thing,

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:52.570
but it's not the example
she wants to set.

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:54.660
So do you have any
advice for people

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.075
coming from that perspective?

00:35:58.396 --> 00:36:00.270
PEGGY ORENSTEIN: That's
a very good question.

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:01.769
I mean, I think
that you can, again,

00:36:01.769 --> 00:36:08.170
talk about ideas about
bodily integrity,

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:13.860
about respect, about
pleasure, about limit setting

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:19.340
that don't necessarily mean that
you have to go from zero to 60.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.662
What's comfortable for you,
what's valuable to you.

00:36:21.662 --> 00:36:23.870
I mean, I think you can have
those same conversations

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:27.292
regardless of when you expect
a young person-- I mean,

00:36:27.292 --> 00:36:29.250
I don't know if what
you're talking about-- one

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:36.630
of the things that was true with
people who advocated abstinence

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:39.430
until marriage was that,
again, they were very focused

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.150
on intercourse.

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:44.710
And what we know about
that is that first of all,

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:46.530
it doesn't work.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:49.890
Those kids have sex-- have
intercourse at the same rates

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:51.030
as other people.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:53.480
They do tend to start
maybe a little later,

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.840
but it's a matter of months.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.980
They have maybe fewer partners,
but they have much higher rates

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.150
of pregnancy and disease.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:01.205
Way higher rates of disease.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:10.680
We also know that they engage in
other forms of sexual activity,

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.470
particularly oral and
anal sex, at higher

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:15.240
rates than other teenagers.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.950
So one thing to
understand for your friend

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:21.250
would be that that's
the likely outcome

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:24.610
if you take that point of view.

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:26.920
If you still want to
take that point of view,

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:30.020
you better be having a whole
other set of discussions

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:38.750
about what that means and how
kids can engage in ways that

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:42.270
would still-- where they
can express affection,

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:44.380
where they can
express sensuality,

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:49.350
that you feel jibes
with your values.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:52.630
But it's a tough one, because
I mean, essentially, you're

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:54.420
educating your
children for ignorance,

00:37:54.420 --> 00:38:00.390
you're educating your
children for risk.

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:02.015
You're putting your
children at risk

00:38:02.015 --> 00:38:04.370
when you take that perspective.

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:06.500
So it's hard for
me to give advice

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.055
on how to do it
in a healthy way.

00:38:13.595 --> 00:38:14.365
That it?

00:38:14.365 --> 00:38:16.440
Oh, you have a question?

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.240
Dave.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.021
[LAUGH]

00:38:18.521 --> 00:38:19.340
DAVE: AUDIENCE:
In your book, you

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.650
mentioned something
called philophobia,

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:21.805
which is a new word for me.

00:38:21.805 --> 00:38:22.700
So what is that?

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.170
How does it relate
to the subject?

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:25.570
PEGGY ORENSTEIN: That
was so interesting.

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:27.800
I was talking to this girl--
you're the first person who's

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.633
asked me about that.

00:38:28.633 --> 00:38:30.850
That was such a
profound experience.

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:35.480
I was talking to this young
woman who told me, you know,

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.240
was like really swaggery
and really, like,

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.700
I have sex like a
guy, by which she

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.920
meant she didn't have to
have any feelings, which I'd

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.790
like to question in a minute.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:47.030
You know, and she
could just object--

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:50.539
she objectified men the
way men objectify women.

00:38:50.539 --> 00:38:52.580
She would tell-- you know,
I don't want that guy.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.540
He's too fat.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.540
And you know, I'm not
going to go out with that.

00:38:55.540 --> 00:39:01.380
And she was like
really like the way

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:04.530
I would hope a male would
never treat my daughter.

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:07.858
That was how she
was treating boys.

00:39:07.858 --> 00:39:09.689
And she felt really
good about that.

00:39:09.689 --> 00:39:11.480
And then at the very
end of the interview--

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.200
we talked for about
two hours-- I said,

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.600
do you have anything else
you want to talk about?

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.510
And she said, philophobia.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.040
And I said, excuse me?

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.670
She said, philophobia.

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:23.692
And I said, I'm sorry.

00:39:23.692 --> 00:39:24.900
I don't know what that means.

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.240
And she said, fear of love.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.285
I think that I have
a fear of love.

00:39:30.285 --> 00:39:32.660
I do all of this,
but I am really

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.760
afraid of ever really
liking somebody and getting

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.650
into a relationship with them.

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:40.720
And it was really-- it was like
this really deep moment-- she

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.520
almost cried-- of, you know,
what was she getting out

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.840
of what she was doing?

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.302
And what wasn't she getting?

00:39:47.302 --> 00:39:52.230
And thinking about her,
I felt like that idea

00:39:52.230 --> 00:40:00.720
that how we should
learn to-- that progress

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:06.185
is somehow becoming as
disconnected as we can be.

00:40:06.185 --> 00:40:09.090
Getting our sexual
hookups on Tinder,

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:12.650
or whatever people
are doing now,

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:15.700
that is a really low
road to equality.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.860
That's a very low
road to equality.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.650
And treating other
people like objects

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.030
is a very low road to equality.

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:25.510
And it's also clear
in research that one

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:28.320
of the things that teenagers
talk about, American teenagers

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.750
talk about, is that they
do want to hear more

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:33.515
from their parents, and
that they especially

00:40:33.515 --> 00:40:36.950
want to hear more from their
parents about relationships

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:38.432
and the emotional side of sex.

00:40:38.432 --> 00:40:40.890
And that that's a part that
they-- because what's happening

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:45.030
right now is that kids
are without sex education

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:49.210
in schools and in the face of
silence from their parents.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:52.700
They go to porn, because
there it is on the internet.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.107
And I don't want to, especially
in front of you guys,

00:40:55.107 --> 00:40:56.690
I don't want to
demonize the internet,

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:59.870
but one of the
things it's done is

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:03.370
allowed porn into
your house 24/7,

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:06.970
really easily accessible,
increasingly explicit

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:09.800
because it's got to be
increasingly competitive.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:14.160
And kids are able to access
it at ever earlier ages.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.430
And when you look
at research on this,

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:19.180
there was a survey of
college students in England

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:24.120
that showed that 60% of them
said that they consult porn

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:28.510
in part as sex education,
even though 75% of them

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:32.785
know that it's about as
realistic as pro wrestling.

00:41:32.785 --> 00:41:34.860
And I think it's
not really where

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.880
we want our kids to be
getting their sex education

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.410
because it's really not perhaps
the best image and vision

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:44.150
of female sexuality.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:45.910
You know, it's another
performative space

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.880
that presents it as
for male gratification.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.230
And I would hear
about this from girls.

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:56.520
They would say things to
me like-- oh, often they

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.390
would say, my
boyfriend wants to know

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:02.380
why I don't make the noises
like the women in porn.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.180
And again, I got
kind of frustrated,

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.766
and my journalistic remove
faltered, and I said, look.

00:42:07.766 --> 00:42:12.880
It's a movie, and a movie
has to have a soundtrack.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.935
And if it doesn't,
it's a silent movie.

00:42:14.935 --> 00:42:16.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:19.180
So people have to make the
noises so that there will

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:21.197
be a soundtrack on the movie.

00:42:21.197 --> 00:42:22.280
That doesn't make it real.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.400
They're actors, you know?

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.440
They're actors.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.670
And that was kind of
a revelation to them.

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:31.331
On the more extreme
end of that spectrum,

00:42:31.331 --> 00:42:35.850
we've seen a significant uptick
among teenagers in anal sex.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:38.710
And again, I don't want to
demonize a particular behavior.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:43.414
But we're talking, like I said,
about girls who have never

00:42:43.414 --> 00:42:45.330
masturbated, never had
an orgasm on their own,

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:46.790
never had an orgasm
with a partner,

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:49.580
can't communicate effectively
with their partners.

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.680
And when you look into the
research, what comes up

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.730
is that it is driven--
it's a trend that

00:42:54.730 --> 00:43:00.000
is driven by porn, pushed more
by boys because they want,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
not as an act of intimacy with
a partner, but as, like, part

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.680
of that continuing to go in a
straight line in experience,

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.270
and kind of checking it
off your bucket list.

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:14.080
That the girls report,
unsurprisingly, that it hurts,

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.670
but that both-- this is
what was interesting to me--

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:19.920
both girls and boys blamed
that on the girls, because they

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.370
say the girls are-- they used
language like naive, flawed,

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:25.260
and unable to relax.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:27.500
So again, you know, I
think it's really important

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.705
to get out front and
talk to kids about,

00:43:29.705 --> 00:43:35.960
porn's vision of women is about
as real as "Real Housewives"

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.040
vision of marriage, you know?

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.810
But I also started feeling--
I had this conversation

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:41.780
with my own daughter.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.180
And then like a
week or two later,

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:47.550
we were watching the
movie "Brooklyn,"

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:48.800
which is a great movie, right?

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:49.446
Fine movie.

00:43:49.446 --> 00:43:50.570
Or maybe you don't like it.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:51.111
I don't care.

00:43:51.111 --> 00:43:52.570
But you know, it's a fine movie.

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:57.140
And there's a sex scene in that
movie that is very nondescript.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.310
You know, it's just an
absolutely garden variety,

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:01.300
ordinary Hollywood
sex scene, which

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:06.200
is that the two characters
kiss for a couple seconds,

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.130
they rip off half their
clothes, they apparently

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:11.780
are having intercourse
for approximately seven

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:15.200
and a half seconds, and
then everybody's happy,

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.034
and it's done.

00:44:16.034 --> 00:44:17.700
And it suddenly
occurred to me that that

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:21.250
wasn't very realistic either,
and that she's probably

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:26.420
going to see many more
thousands of times that image,

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:29.390
that sequence than actual porn.

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:33.734
And what impact does that have
on her idea about what sex

00:44:33.734 --> 00:44:35.400
is supposed to be,
and who it's supposed

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.608
to be for, and who gets to
enjoy it, and all of that?

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:41.548
So I said, you know,
honey, you know

00:44:41.548 --> 00:44:46.696
how in a movie when
somebody takes a cab ride,

00:44:46.696 --> 00:44:48.855
they open the door
and get into the cab,

00:44:48.855 --> 00:44:50.330
and then you see
them open the door

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:52.163
and get out of the cab
at their destination.

00:44:52.163 --> 00:44:54.795
But you don't see
the whole cab ride,

00:44:54.795 --> 00:44:57.200
because that would be,
like, the whole movie,

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.720
and it would be boring.

00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.770
Similarly--

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:01.261
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:01.261 --> 00:45:04.540
--when we see sex in movies
and on TV and in ads and in all

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.560
these places, or in
videos or whatever

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:11.710
you're doing, watching, we
don't see what really happens.

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:13.850
Hollywood has a
series of symbols,

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:19.086
which are kind of
outdated on what sex is.

00:45:19.086 --> 00:45:20.460
And they throw
those up, and that

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.665
is supposed to signal to
us that sex has happened.

00:45:23.665 --> 00:45:26.970
But it doesn't actually tell us
anything about what real sex is

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:28.610
or the experience of sex.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:31.110
And I felt like that was at
least as important for kids

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:35.760
to understand as talking
to them about porn.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:41.140
So a little ways from
philophobia, but there you go.

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:42.350
DAVE: Thank you very much.

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:42.400
PEGGY ORENSTEIN: My pleasure.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.740
DAVE: We'll have
signing right up here.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:44.080
PEGGY ORENSTEIN: OK.
