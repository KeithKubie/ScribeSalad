00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.360
In the last video we talked
about the idea that if I start

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.570
with some type of a string
there, and if I were to take

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.870
the left end of the string-- I
could just have equally have

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.370
done the right, but if I take
the left end of the string and

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.280
jerk it up, then all the way
down, and then back to its

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.890
resting position, it'll generate
this disturbance in

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.460
the string.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.190
And the disturbance might
initially look like this after

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.270
I've done that jerking
up and down once.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.960
And that disturbance is going to
propagate down the string.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.330
It's going to move down
the string like that.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.090
Let me color this in black.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.950
So this is right after I do that
first cycle-- that first

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.870
jerking up and down.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.300
The string might look
something like that.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.710
And if we wait a little while,
the string might look

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.420
something like this, assuming
that I only did that once.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.980
The string might look something
like this, where

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.630
that pulse has actually
propagated down the string.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.570
That pulse has propagated
down the string.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.675
And in the last video, we said,
hey, this disturbance

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:57.520
that's propagating down the
string, or propagating down

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.580
this medium-- although it
doesn't necessarily have to

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.180
have a medium- we called this
a wave. And in particular,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.690
this wave right here,
this is a pulse.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.260
This is a pulse wave because we
only have, essentially, one

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.140
perturbation of the string.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.010
Now if I kept doing that-- if I
kept going up and down, and

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.290
up and down, essentially, if I
periodically did it at regular

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.430
intervals, then my
string would look

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.680
something like this.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.070
Doing my best to
draw it neatly.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.550
It might look something like
this, where once again, the

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.280
perturbations are going
towards-- the disturbances are

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.830
going to move to-- the right.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.870
They're going to move to the
right with some velocity.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.510
And what I want to do in this
video is really focus on this

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.390
type of wave. This type of wave
right here, which you can

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.310
imagine, since I'm periodically
moving this left

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.200
side up and down, up and down,
and creating these periodic

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.370
movements in the wave, we call
this a periodic wave. This is

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:08.979
a periodic wave. The motion is
repeated over and over again.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.980
So what I want to talk about is
some of the properties of a

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.190
periodic wave. Now, the first
thing you might say is, hey,

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.990
how far are you jerking
it up and down?

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.630
How far are these movements
from rest?

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.130
So if this is the resting
position right there, how far

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.590
are these movements above the
resting position and below the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.640
resting position?

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.430
And we call that the amplitude
of the wave. So that distance

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.170
right there- I'll do it in
magenta-- that distance right

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.420
there is the amplitude.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.660
Sometimes mariners will have
an idea of wave height.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.660
Wave height, they normally refer
to from the bottom--

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.560
from the trough-- of
a wave to its peak.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.730
Amplitude, we're talking
about from the resting

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.480
position to it's peak.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.950
So let me label peak.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.160
I think you know what
peak means.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.300
Peak is the highest point on
the wave. That's the peak.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.580
And that's the trough.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.510
If you're in a fishing boat and
you wanted to see how big

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.280
a wave is, you'd probably care
about the wave height-- not so

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.920
much if your boat's sitting down
here, you have to care

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.760
about this whole distance.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.780
But anyway, we won't talk
too much about that.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.600
So that's the first interesting
idea behind a

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.170
wave. And not all waves are
being generated by Sal

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.980
jiggling a string on
the left-hand side.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.430
But I think you get the idea
that these waves can represent

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.680
many different-- this graph can
represent many different

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.290
types of wave forms. And this,
essentially, displacement,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.290
from the resting position, or
from the zero position, that

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.330
is your amplitude.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.210
Now the next question you might
ask is, OK, I know how

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.890
far you're jiggling this string
up and down, but how

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.850
quickly are you doing it?

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.730
So how long does it take for you
to go all the way up, all

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.050
the way down, and back again?

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.630
So how long for each cycle?

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.070
Cycle is me going up,
down, back again.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.190
How long for each cycle?

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.640
Or you might say how long
for each period?

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.760
We're saying this is periodic.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.350
Each period is each repetition
of the wave. So this idea of

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.205
how long for each cycle, we
call that the period.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.560
And this is going to
be a unit of time.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.420
Maybe I'm doing it every
two seconds.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.570
It takes me two seconds to
go up, down, back again.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.610
Up, down, back again.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.080
That's going to be
two seconds.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.570
A very related term is,
how many cycles

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.820
am I doing per second?

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.500
So in other words, you
could say, how many

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.840
seconds for each cycle?

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.090
We could even write that.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.200
So for example, a period might
look like something like 5

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.260
seconds per cycle.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.240
Or maybe it's 2 seconds
per cycle.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.870
But what if we're asked how
many cycles per second?

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.600
So we're asking the
opposite question.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.480
It's not how long, how many
seconds does it take for me to

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.270
go up, down, and back again.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.200
We're saying in each second, how
many times am I going up,

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.440
down, back again?

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.080
So how many cycles per second?

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.510
That's the inverse of period.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.600
So period, the notation
is normally a big

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.160
capital T for period.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.410
This is frequency.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.430
It's normally denoted by an F.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.770
And this, you're going to
say cycles per second.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.240
So if you're going 5 seconds per
cycle, that means you're

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:08.550
doing 1/5 of a cycle or, 1/5
of a cycle per second.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.510
All I did is invert
this right there.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.560
And that make sense.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.490
Because the period and the
frequency are inversions of

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.860
each other.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.160
This is how many seconds
per cycle.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.550
How long does one up, down,
back again take?

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.710
And this is how many up,
down, back agains

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.670
are there in a second?

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.040
So they are inverses
of each other.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.090
So we could say that frequency
is equal to 1 over the period.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.180
Or you could say that
period is equal

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.580
to 1 over the frequency.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.860
So if I told you that I'm
vibrating the left end of this

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:49.060
rope at 10 cycles per second--
and, by the way, the unit of

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.300
cycles per second, this is a
hertz, so I could have also

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.120
written this down as 10
hertz, which you've

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.000
probably heard before.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.360
10 hertz just means 10
cycles per second.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.770
If my frequency is 10 cycles per
second, my period is going

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.540
to be 1 over that.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:13.580
So 1 over 10 seconds per cycle,
which makes sense.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.680
If in 10 times, I can go up and
down, a whole up, down,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.560
back again, if I can do that
10 times in a second, it's

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.690
going to take me 1/10 of a
second to do it each time.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.460
Now another question we might
ask ourselves is, how quickly

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.170
is this wave moving, in this
case, to the right?

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.010
Since I'm jiggling the left
end of the string.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:37.700
How quickly is it moving
to the right?

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.170
So the velocity.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.770
So to do that, we need to figure
out how far did the

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.200
wave go after one cycle?

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.270
Or after one period?

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.750
So after I jiggled this once,
how far did the wave go?

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.520
What is this distance from this
resting point to this

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.010
resting point there?

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.370
And we call that a wavelength.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.480
And there's a lot of different
ways you can define a

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.060
wavelength.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:10.160
You could view a wavelength as
how far the initial pulse went

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.070
after completing exactly
one cycle.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.390
Or you could view it as the
distance from one peak to

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.360
another peak.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.360
That is also going to
be the wavelength.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.070
Or you could view it as a
distance from one trough to

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.100
the other trough.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.390
That's also the wavelength.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:30.240
Or in general, you could view
the wavelength as one exactly

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.880
equal point on the
wave. From that

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.700
distance to that distance.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.970
That is also one wavelength.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.940
Where you're completing, between
that point and that

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.150
point, you're completing one
entire cycle to get exactly

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.090
back to that same point.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.500
And when I say exactly back to
that same point, this point

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.450
doesn't count.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.220
Because this point, although
we're in the same position,

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.670
we're now going down.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.940
We want to go to
the point where

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.330
we're in the same position.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.390
And notice over here,
we're going up.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.890
We want to be going up again.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.590
So distance is not
one wavelength.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.530
To go one wavelength,
we have to go

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:03.780
back to the same position.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.340
And we're moving in the
same direction.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.920
So this is also one
wavelength.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.630
So if we know how far we've
travelled after one period--

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:22.220
let me write it this way;
wavelength is equal to how far

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:31.625
the wave has traveled
after one period.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.170
Or you could say after
one cycle.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.020
Because remember, a period is
how long does it take to

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.540
complete one cycle.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.340
One to complete up, down,
and back again notion.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.600
So if we know how far we've
traveled, and we know how long

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.750
it took us, it took us one
period, how can we figure out

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.350
the velocity?

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:02.175
Well, the velocity is equal to
distance divided by time.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.340
For a wave, your velocity--
and I could write it as a

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.260
vector, but I think you
get the general idea.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.800
Your velocity-- what's
the distance

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.650
you travel in a period?

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:23.390
Well, the distance you travel in
a period is your wavelength

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.640
after one up, down,
back again.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.210
The wave pulse would have
traveled exactly that far.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.910
That would be my wavelength.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.830
So I've traveled the distance of
a wavelength, and how long

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.850
did it take me to travel
that distance?

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.180
Well, it took me a period
to travel that distance.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.170
So it's wavelength divided
by period.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.790
Now I just said that 1 over the
period is the same thing

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:51.410
as the frequency.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.910
So I could rewrite this
as wavelength.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.570
And actually, I should
be clear here.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.540
The notation for wavelength
tends to be the

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.810
Greek letter lambda.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:06.550
So we could say velocity
is equal to

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.510
wavelength over period.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.170
Which is the same thing
as wavelength

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.110
times 1 over my period.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.050
And we just said that 1 over the
period, this is the same

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.570
thing is your frequency.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.650
So velocity is equal to

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:25.600
wavelength times your frequency.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.090
And if you know this, you can
pretty much solve all of the

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.470
basic problems that you might
encounter in waves.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.400
So for example, if someone
tells you that I have a

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:42.520
velocity of-- I don't know-- 100
meters per second to the

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.940
right, so in that direction--
velocity you have to give a

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:54.410
direction-- and they were to
tell you that my frequency is

00:11:54.410 --> 00:12:00.770
equal to-- let's say my
frequency is 20 cycles per

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.370
second, which is the same
thing as 20 hertz.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:08.790
So literally, if you had a
little window where you're

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:13.410
only able to observe this part
of your wave, you'd only

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.160
observe that part
of my string.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.020
If we're talking about 20 hertz,
then in 1 second, you

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.960
would see this go up and
down twenty times.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.020
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.410
18, 19, 20.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.280
In exactly one second,
you would see this go

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.510
up and down 20 times.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.960
That's what we mean by the
frequency being 20 hertz, or

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.590
20 cycles per second.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:33.495
So, they gave you
the velocity.

00:12:33.495 --> 00:12:34.470
They gave you the frequency.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.380
What's the wavelength here?

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.380
So the wavelength, in this
situation-- you would say the

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:45.130
velocity-- your velocity is
equal to your wavelength times

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.780
your frequency.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.380
Divide both sides by 20.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.470
And actually, let me make sure
I get the units right.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:58.110
So this is meters per second,
is equal to lambda times 20

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.450
cycles per second.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:05.610
So if you divide both sides by
20 cycles per second, you get

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:14.010
100 meters per second times
1/20 seconds per cycle.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.490
And then this becomes a 5.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:17.370
This becomes a 1.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.760
So you get 5, and then the
seconds cancel out.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.680
So you get 5 meters per cycle.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:30.830
So this is equal to 5 meters per
cycle, which would be your

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.150
wavelength in this situation.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.350
So it's 5 meters.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.130
You could say 5 meters per
cycle, but wavelength implies

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.810
that you're talking about
the distance per cycle.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:44.760
So in this situation, if this is
moving to the right at 100

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.440
meters per second and this
frequency-- I see this moving

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.830
up and down 20 times in a
second-- then this distance,

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.700
right here, must be 5 meters.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.050
Likewise, we can figure out
the period very easily.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.710
The period here is just going
to be 1 over the frequency.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:06.470
It's going to be 1/20
seconds per cycle.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:10.190
So using these formulas-- and I
don't want you to memorize a

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:13.350
formula, it should be
intuitive for you.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.470
And hopefully, this video made
it a little bit intuitive.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.380
But using this, you can really
answer almost any question if

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.770
you're given two of these
variables and you need to

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:23.990
solve for the third.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.190
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.
