00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.913
Building a business is hard.

00:00:01.913 --> 00:00:05.148
As an entrepreneur, not only
do you need a solid product,

00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:08.999
but you need to secure investment,
find co-founders, hire employees

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:12.439
and complete countless of other tasks
in pursuit of your goals.

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.290
But being an entrepreneur comes
with a ton of responsibilities,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.287
like the freedom to be your own boss

00:00:17.287 --> 00:00:20.270
and the chance to make a
lasting impact on the world.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.043
Throughout this course, you're going
to get expert advice from Googlers,

00:00:24.043 --> 00:00:27.622
from co-founders of companies,
like CrunchBase and UpWest Labs,

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:30.313
from investors of accelerators,
like NFX Guild

00:00:30.313 --> 00:00:33.103
and from other Silicon Valley
business experts.

00:00:33.103 --> 00:00:36.124
All this expertise comes together
in this course to help you to find

00:00:36.124 --> 00:00:39.155
your business goals, 
build your team around your product

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:41.465
and get financing to help
grow your startup.

00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:44.447
By the end of this course, you can
have the confidence in your product

00:00:44.447 --> 00:00:45.617
and your business.

00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:48.480
&gt;From there, you'll be in great shape
for the build-up product out,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.741
go see around, fly to an accelerator,
or just bootstrap your way to success.
