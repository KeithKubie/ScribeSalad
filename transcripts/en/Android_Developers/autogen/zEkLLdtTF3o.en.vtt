Nexus tens very soon so that's really
great and I'm sure there's a lot of

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759
great and I'm sure there's a lot of
 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.849
great and I'm sure there's a lot of
people looking forward to that one thing

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859
people looking forward to that one thing
 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.770
people looking forward to that one thing
I wanted to point out however is that we

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780
I wanted to point out however is that we
 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.429
I wanted to point out however is that we
have this site where you can download

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
have this site where you can download
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.179
have this site where you can download
nexus factory images so a lot of people

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189
nexus factory images so a lot of people
 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.830
nexus factory images so a lot of people
actually use this as a way to shortcut

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840
actually use this as a way to shortcut
 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.230
actually use this as a way to shortcut
the process and update sooner but the

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240
the process and update sooner but the
 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.609
the process and update sooner but the
reason I wanted to point it out is

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619
reason I wanted to point it out is
 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.109
reason I wanted to point it out is
really for our developer community

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119
really for our developer community
 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.970
really for our developer community
because one thing that I found very

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980
because one thing that I found very
 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.490
because one thing that I found very
useful to do is occasionally if I want

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500
useful to do is occasionally if I want
 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.240
useful to do is occasionally if I want
to go in

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250
to go in
 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.720
to go in
sure or test my apps on all the releases

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730
sure or test my apps on all the releases
 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.090
sure or test my apps on all the releases
of Android like let's say gingerbread or

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100
of Android like let's say gingerbread or
 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.900
of Android like let's say gingerbread or
even ice cream sandwich and you can go

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910
even ice cream sandwich and you can go
 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.400
even ice cream sandwich and you can go
to this site and download those factory

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410
to this site and download those factory
 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.290
to this site and download those factory
images and roll back your developer

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300
images and roll back your developer
 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.050
images and roll back your developer
devices so that's a good way to have you

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060
devices so that's a good way to have you
 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.840
devices so that's a good way to have you
know a single physical device but test

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850
know a single physical device but test
 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.140
know a single physical device but test
across multiple versions of the android

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150
across multiple versions of the android
 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.260
across multiple versions of the android
platform so yeah keep it in mind as part

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270
platform so yeah keep it in mind as part
 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.830
platform so yeah keep it in mind as part
of your developers toolbox alright so

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840
of your developers toolbox alright so
 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.080
of your developers toolbox alright so
enter a four point into it is called

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090
enter a four point into it is called
 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.720
enter a four point into it is called
jelly bean internally we've the version

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730
jelly bean internally we've the version
 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.550
jelly bean internally we've the version
code that we have is actually called

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560
code that we have is actually called
 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.300
code that we have is actually called
jelly bean mr one and it is API level 17

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310
jelly bean mr one and it is API level 17
 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.490
jelly bean mr one and it is API level 17
now the reason i mentioning that that

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500
now the reason i mentioning that that
 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.590
now the reason i mentioning that that
that we have a static defined for for

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600
that we have a static defined for for
 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.660
that we have a static defined for for
jelly bean mr one is because you may

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670
jelly bean mr one is because you may
 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.340
jelly bean mr one is because you may
have some code in your apps that you

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350
have some code in your apps that you
 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.590
have some code in your apps that you
want to version gate now typically we

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600
want to version gate now typically we
 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.900
want to version gate now typically we
don't you know it's not necessarily good

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910
don't you know it's not necessarily good
 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.880
don't you know it's not necessarily good
practice to version get your code but

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890
practice to version get your code but
 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.500
practice to version get your code but
there are times when you need to write

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510
there are times when you need to write
 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.920
there are times when you need to write
so if it's if your version gating

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930
so if it's if your version gating
 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.400
so if it's if your version gating
against this version its android OS stop

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410
against this version its android OS stop
 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.680
against this version its android OS stop
build version codes jelly bean mr one so

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690
build version codes jelly bean mr one so
 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.080
build version codes jelly bean mr one so
one of the things that many developers

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090
one of the things that many developers
 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.360
one of the things that many developers
we've encouraged in the past on a do

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370
we've encouraged in the past on a do
 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.449
we've encouraged in the past on a do
plus to do is to update your app so that

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459
plus to do is to update your app so that
 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.100
plus to do is to update your app so that
you're targeting the latest version of

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110
you're targeting the latest version of
 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.060
you're targeting the latest version of
the sdk and if you go back to our first

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070
the sdk and if you go back to our first
 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.670
the sdk and if you go back to our first
ad 0 plus we talked about the

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680
ad 0 plus we talked about the
 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.310
ad 0 plus we talked about the
androidmanifest.xml file and really we

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320
androidmanifest.xml file and really we
 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.400
androidmanifest.xml file and really we
we dived quite deep into that but one of

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410
we dived quite deep into that but one of
 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.380
we dived quite deep into that but one of
the things we covered was how you update

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390
the things we covered was how you update
 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.910
the things we covered was how you update
your app so that you're targeting the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920
your app so that you're targeting the
 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.930
your app so that you're targeting the
latest SDK and that is sdk version 17 so

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940
latest SDK and that is sdk version 17 so
 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.960
latest SDK and that is sdk version 17 so
in your users sdk flag in your Android

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970
in your users sdk flag in your Android
 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.500
in your users sdk flag in your Android
manifest file you would just change that

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510
manifest file you would just change that
 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.140
manifest file you would just change that
to 17 now there are obviously good

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150
to 17 now there are obviously good
 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.780
to 17 now there are obviously good
reasons to do this often we enable

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790
reasons to do this often we enable
 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.850
reasons to do this often we enable
things and newer versions of the sdk

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860
things and newer versions of the sdk
 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.039
things and newer versions of the sdk
that are unavailable in older versions

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049
that are unavailable in older versions
 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.250
that are unavailable in older versions
so for example if you're running an old

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260
so for example if you're running an old
 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.020
so for example if you're running an old

it's always a good idea and in general

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110
it's always a good idea and in general
 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.210
it's always a good idea and in general
is good practice

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220
is good practice
 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.580
is good practice
to always target your SDK to the latest

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590
to always target your SDK to the latest
 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.840
to always target your SDK to the latest
version you should use the minimum SDK

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850
version you should use the minimum SDK
 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.470
version you should use the minimum SDK
version or min SDK version attribute to

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480
version or min SDK version attribute to
 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.220
version or min SDK version attribute to
specify how far back you want to support

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230
specify how far back you want to support
 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.720
specify how far back you want to support
and of course there's a whole bunch of

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730
and of course there's a whole bunch of
 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.370
and of course there's a whole bunch of
development tools like lint that will

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380
development tools like lint that will
 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.940
development tools like lint that will
help protect you from invoking code that

isn't supported on this those minimum
SDK versions so you should go ahead and

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530
SDK versions so you should go ahead and
 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.890

occasionally make changes like this and
 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.840
occasionally make changes like this and
this is actually quite well-documented

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850
this is actually quite well-documented
 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.020

on developer.android.com but here's a
 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.120
on developer.android.com but here's a
summary anyway the other thing we've

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130
summary anyway the other thing we've
 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.610
summary anyway the other thing we've
done now is when you request the

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620
done now is when you request the
 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.920
done now is when you request the
permission access course location and

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930
permission access course location and
 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.310
permission access course location and
you don't specify access fine location

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320
you don't specify access fine location

you don't specify access fine location
the accuracy that you get back off that

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470
the accuracy that you get back off that
 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.920
the accuracy that you get back off that
location will always be around the city

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930

when your accuracy could have been

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970
when your accuracy could have been
 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.360
when your accuracy could have been
higher you're the accuracy now will

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370
higher you're the accuracy now will
 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.520
higher you're the accuracy now will
always be course if you haven't asked

you should look out for other some

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750
you should look out for other some

android 4.2 now has multi user

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169
android 4.2 now has multi user
 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.409
android 4.2 now has multi user
capabilities so you can have multiple

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419
capabilities so you can have multiple
 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.710

and so if you share the your tablet with

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050
and so if you share the your tablet with
 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.270
and so if you share the your tablet with
your

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280
your
 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.790
your
with a family member or a friend you

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800
with a family member or a friend you
 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.170
with a family member or a friend you
know that they basically have their own

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180
know that they basically have their own
 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.940
know that they basically have their own
set of applications and they're in their

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950
set of applications and they're in their
 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.040
set of applications and they're in their
own and those apps have their own sort

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050
own and those apps have their own sort
 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.040
own and those apps have their own sort
of data so you know some of these

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050
of data so you know some of these
 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.830
of data so you know some of these
settings are now going to affect users

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840
settings are now going to affect users
 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.100
settings are now going to affect users
across the the system itself so they

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110
across the the system itself so they
 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.830
across the the system itself so they
have moved now with those settings

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840
have moved now with those settings
 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.000
have moved now with those settings
whether you target API 17 or not on

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010
whether you target API 17 or not on
 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.150
whether you target API 17 or not on

devices that are API 17 and higher those
 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.820
devices that are API 17 and higher those
settings will have moved so we kind of

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830
settings will have moved so we kind of
 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.520
settings will have moved so we kind of
know are basically if you are accessing

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530
know are basically if you are accessing
 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.470
know are basically if you are accessing
those settings and trying to change them

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:12.480
those settings and trying to change them
 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.930
those settings and trying to change them
we you want your app won't just start

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940
we you want your app won't just start
 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.360
we you want your app won't just start
crashing but it'll basically have no

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.370
crashing but it'll basically have no
 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.950
crashing but it'll basically have no
effect if you've tried to write to one

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960
effect if you've tried to write to one
 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.440
effect if you've tried to write to one
of these older settings and so keep that

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.450
of these older settings and so keep that
 

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.470
of these older settings and so keep that
in mind as Drive Android 4.2 some of

in mind as Drive Android 4.2 some of
 

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.659
in mind as Drive Android 4.2 some of
these settings have changed and you

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:26.669
these settings have changed and you
 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:28.190
these settings have changed and you
really should follow up in the

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:28.200
really should follow up in the
 

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.150
really should follow up in the
documentation as to which ones so we've

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160
documentation as to which ones so we've
 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.680
documentation as to which ones so we've
introduced something new that we called

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.690
introduced something new that we called
 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.159
introduced something new that we called
a dream and daydream is is really need

a dream and daydream is is really need
 

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:39.320
a dream and daydream is is really need

then there's a there's a set of
 

00:09:05.439 --> 00:09:07.379
then there's a there's a set of
overrides that tell you basically the

so you'd have a service and you make

00:09:58.980 --> 00:09:58.990
so you'd have a service and you make
 

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.309
so you'd have a service and you make
sure that you'd added the intent filter

00:10:02.309 --> 00:10:02.319
sure that you'd added the intent filter
 

00:10:02.319 --> 00:10:06.350
sure that you'd added the intent filter
for it as well so those are daydreams

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360
for it as well so those are daydreams
 

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.699
for it as well so those are daydreams
this one I'm really excited about

00:10:08.699 --> 00:10:08.709
this one I'm really excited about

it's basically that we've added a set of
 

00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:17.240
it's basically that we've added a set of
second screen AP is so the nexus 4

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:17.250
second screen AP is so the nexus 4
 

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.549
second screen AP is so the nexus 4
utilizes miracast wireless technology so

00:10:20.549 --> 00:10:20.559
utilizes miracast wireless technology so
 

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:22.530
utilizes miracast wireless technology so
that you can actually have an app

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:22.540
that you can actually have an app
 

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.720
that you can actually have an app
running on your device but displaying on

devices that support the the miracast
 

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.079
devices that support the the miracast
standard now the interesting thing about

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:34.089
standard now the interesting thing about
 

00:10:34.089 --> 00:10:36.259
standard now the interesting thing about
this is you're not just limited to

00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:36.269
this is you're not just limited to
 

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:39.049
this is you're not just limited to
mirroring what is on your device as a

00:10:39.049 --> 00:10:39.059
mirroring what is on your device as a

aren't the same as what you have on your
 

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.900
aren't the same as what you have on your
your mobile device so you can have this

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:54.910
your mobile device so you can have this
 

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.210
your mobile device so you can have this
this distinction between the passive

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:57.220
this distinction between the passive
 

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.540
this distinction between the passive
experience and an interactive one so if

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:00.550
experience and an interactive one so if
 

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.160
experience and an interactive one so if
you're thinking in terms of games you

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:02.170
you're thinking in terms of games you
 

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.540
you're thinking in terms of games you
might have on

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:03.550
might have on
 

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.940

you might have the heads up display or

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:09.580
you might have the heads up display or
 

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.210
you might have the heads up display or
the controls visible on the screen but

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:12.220
the controls visible on the screen but
 

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.220
the controls visible on the screen but
on the second screen you may want to

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:14.230
on the second screen you may want to
 

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:15.750
on the second screen you may want to
ditch those because then you can just

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760
ditch those because then you can just
 

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.030
ditch those because then you can just
watch how the race is going and you may

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.040
watch how the race is going and you may
 

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.740
watch how the race is going and you may
not even show the same perspective where

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:19.750
not even show the same perspective where
 

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:20.850
not even show the same perspective where
you might have the driver mode

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:20.860
you might have the driver mode
 

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.370

to a secondary display whether there's
 

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.170
to a secondary display whether there's
one available and then you would extend

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:46.180
one available and then you would extend
 

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.120
one available and then you would extend
the presentation class and then you

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.130
the presentation class and then you
 

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.329
the presentation class and then you
construct your your class your extended

the secondary screen will actually be a

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800
the secondary screen will actually be a
 

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.380
the secondary screen will actually be a
different resolution and a different

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:04.390
different resolution and a different
 

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:08.460
different resolution and a different
size to what your mobile devices so you

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:08.470
size to what your mobile devices so you
 

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.470
size to what your mobile devices so you
shouldn't make any assumptions that your

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480
shouldn't make any assumptions that your
 

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.540
shouldn't make any assumptions that your
layouts need to be the same even though

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:12.550
layouts need to be the same even though

they will you know if you're doing the

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.170
they will you know if you're doing the
 

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.160
they will you know if you're doing the
mirroring type mode then yeah sure but

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:17.170
mirroring type mode then yeah sure but
 

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.620

if you're building custom displays for

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:19.630
if you're building custom displays for
 

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.430
if you're building custom displays for
the second screen you need to use the

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440
the second screen you need to use the
 

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.650
the second screen you need to use the
resources that are attributed to that

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:25.660
resources that are attributed to that
 

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.110

presentation class so within your
 

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.300
presentation class so within your
presentation class you call get context

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:30.310
presentation class you call get context
 

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.060
presentation class you call get context
and call get resources so that when you

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:33.070
and call get resources so that when you
 

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:37.019
and call get resources so that when you
load resources to display so let's say

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:37.029
load resources to display so let's say
 

00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:39.090
load resources to display so let's say
drawables for example that it's getting

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:39.100
drawables for example that it's getting
 

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.550
drawables for example that it's getting
them from the right right folders

using you know the DP smallest width
qualifiers so you need to keep that in

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760
qualifiers so you need to keep that in
 

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.130
qualifiers so you need to keep that in
mind when you're working with this that

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:53.140
mind when you're working with this that
 

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.290

out of this I'm sure this is just the
 

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.210
out of this I'm sure this is just the
start of something really big for a

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:09.220
start of something really big for a
 

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.449

actually one of my favorite new features
 

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.360
actually one of my favorite new features
which are lock screen widgets

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:16.370
which are lock screen widgets
 

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.650
which are lock screen widgets
and basically what it means is that

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:17.660
and basically what it means is that
 

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.200

typically what we've had so far on the

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:20.210
typically what we've had so far on the
 

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:21.790
typically what we've had so far on the
default launcher I know they've been

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800
default launcher I know they've been
 

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.740

some third-party lock screen apps that

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:23.750
some third-party lock screen apps that
 

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.660
some third-party lock screen apps that
could do this but on the default

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:25.670
could do this but on the default
 

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.690
could do this but on the default
launcher you could you'd have the time

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:28.700
launcher you could you'd have the time
 

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.810
launcher you could you'd have the time
and then you have your you either you

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:31.820
and then you have your you either you

the entry for your your password or
 

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.420
the entry for your your password or
pattern and so on well now you can

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:46.430
pattern and so on well now you can
 

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.040
pattern and so on well now you can
actually have other widgets than just

but that's on the assumption that you've
been doing the right thing so it's worth

been doing the right thing so it's worth
 

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.790
been doing the right thing so it's worth
auditing your code if you if you're

also now added something that developers

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:03.890
also now added something that developers
 

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.440
also now added something that developers
have been asking for for a while which

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:05.450
have been asking for for a while which
 

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.750
have been asking for for a while which
is called nested fragments so you can

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760
is called nested fragments so you can
 

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.049
is called nested fragments so you can
now have a fragment within a fragment to

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:11.059
now have a fragment within a fragment to
 

00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:12.850
now have a fragment within a fragment to
nest them what you need to do is call

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:12.860
nest them what you need to do is call
 

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.340
nest them what you need to do is call
this get child fragment manager when you

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:17.350
this get child fragment manager when you
 

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.710
this get child fragment manager when you
fall for when you're doing your your

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720
fall for when you're doing your your
 

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.419
fall for when you're doing your your
fragment transaction then you can see

00:18:22.419 --> 00:18:22.429
fragment transaction then you can see
 

00:18:22.429 --> 00:18:24.399
fragment transaction then you can see
there's some sample code there that that

00:18:24.399 --> 00:18:24.409
there's some sample code there that that
 

00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:26.440
there's some sample code there that that
shows you that when we go to do the

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:26.450
shows you that when we go to do the
 

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.960
shows you that when we go to do the
transaction the begin transaction is

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:28.970
transaction the begin transaction is
 

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:30.880
transaction the begin transaction is
actually called on get child fragment

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:30.890
actually called on get child fragment
 

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:34.419

code in renderscript we we basically

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:54.350
code in renderscript we we basically
 

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:55.659
code in renderscript we we basically
have continued to improve the

00:18:55.659 --> 00:18:55.669

script so you get some tremendous
 

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.810
script so you get some tremendous
performance out of it and we've added

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:01.820
performance out of it and we've added
 

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.340
performance out of it and we've added
some new capabilities there that will

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:03.350
some new capabilities there that will
 

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:07.539

make it easier for you of course now
that we have a new platform release we

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:09.110
that we have a new platform release we
 

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.909
that we have a new platform release we
also have some great updates to the

00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919
also have some great updates to the
 

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:14.769
also have some great updates to the

awesome improvement to the layout editor

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:16.850
awesome improvement to the layout editor
 

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.539
awesome improvement to the layout editor
that layout editor that we previewed at

from the screenshots we have we have

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:24.890
from the screenshots we have we have
 

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.880
from the screenshots we have we have
this main view open which which looks

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:27.890
this main view open which which looks
 

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:30.279
this main view open which which looks
like a tablet layout and then we've got

00:19:30.279 --> 00:19:30.289
like a tablet layout and then we've got
 

00:19:30.289 --> 00:19:32.169
like a tablet layout and then we've got
a bunch of small thumbnails on the right

00:19:32.169 --> 00:19:32.179
a bunch of small thumbnails on the right
 

00:19:32.179 --> 00:19:34.630
a bunch of small thumbnails on the right
those thumbnails are actually showing

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640
those thumbnails are actually showing
 

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.930
those thumbnails are actually showing
previews of that same layout on how it'd

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:37.940
previews of that same layout on how it'd
 

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.909
previews of that same layout on how it'd
be rendered on different sized screens

00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919
be rendered on different sized screens
 

00:19:39.919 --> 00:19:42.070
be rendered on different sized screens

bandages there but we we probably need a
 

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.220
bandages there but we we probably need a
different approach so on that night

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:25.230
different approach so on that night
 

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.050

yeah so I mean there's lots of ways you

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:22.220
yeah so I mean there's lots of ways you
 

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.340
yeah so I mean there's lots of ways you
can do this if you're just using a

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:24.350
can do this if you're just using a
 

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:27.760
can do this if you're just using a
single text view you can you know just

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:27.770
single text view you can you know just
 

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:30.940
single text view you can you know just
listen to the button click for for

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:30.950

whatever next or if you've got a swipe

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:33.160
whatever next or if you've got a swipe
 

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.520
whatever next or if you've got a swipe
gesture and just update the the text in

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:36.530
gesture and just update the the text in
 

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:39.610
gesture and just update the the text in
your text views alternatively you can

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:39.620
your text views alternatively you can
 

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:43.090
your text views alternatively you can
change the views that you show so you

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:43.100
change the views that you show so you
 

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.610
change the views that you show so you
may have you may not want to reuse the

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:45.620
may have you may not want to reuse the
 

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.680
may have you may not want to reuse the
text view for whatever reason and you

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:47.690
text view for whatever reason and you
 

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:49.150
text view for whatever reason and you
may have a different set of text view so

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:49.160
may have a different set of text view so
 

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.760
may have a different set of text view so
you can just hide the existing ones show

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:51.770
you can just hide the existing ones show
 

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:55.330
you can just hide the existing ones show
these ones you could probably go from

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:55.340
these ones you could probably go from
 

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.340
these ones you could probably go from
activity to activity and say that you

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:57.350
activity to activity and say that you
 

00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:00.210
activity to activity and say that you
explicitly don't want an activity

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:00.220
explicitly don't want an activity
 

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.610
explicitly don't want an activity
animation so look there's lots of ways

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:03.620
animation so look there's lots of ways
 

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:06.070
animation so look there's lots of ways
to do this the animations are kind of

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080
to do this the animations are kind of
 

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.250
to do this the animations are kind of
there to give a more pleasant user

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:09.260
there to give a more pleasant user
 

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.100

that's quite no frills and you just want
 

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:19.150
that's quite no frills and you just want
to change values and lots of different

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:36.150
that's now consuming those swipes you've
kind of broken the swipe navigation yeah

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160
kind of broken the swipe navigation yeah
 

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.029
kind of broken the swipe navigation yeah
I'm aware of that and I trialed it the

I'm aware of that and I trialed it the
 

00:38:39.039 --> 00:38:42.150
I'm aware of that and I trialed it the

preference would be that you wouldn't

00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359
preference would be that you wouldn't
 

00:39:19.359 --> 00:39:21.450
preference would be that you wouldn't
want to override the horizontal stripes

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:21.460
want to override the horizontal stripes
 

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.190
want to override the horizontal stripes

of markers have it's a conflict of
 

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.170
of markers have it's a conflict of
swipes and I agree with that that you

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:25.180
swipes and I agree with that that you
 

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.420
swipes and I agree with that that you
probably wouldn't want to override that

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:27.430
probably wouldn't want to override that
 

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:29.220

you could consider is for that inner

00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079
you could consider is for that inner

view pager that you have now could that

00:39:37.289 --> 00:39:37.299
view pager that you have now could that
 

00:39:37.299 --> 00:39:39.299
view pager that you have now could that
could that instead of swiping

00:39:39.299 --> 00:39:39.309
could that instead of swiping
 

00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:41.849
could that instead of swiping
horizontally be a vertical swipe so

00:39:41.849 --> 00:39:41.859
horizontally be a vertical swipe so
 

00:39:41.859 --> 00:39:43.349
horizontally be a vertical swipe so
horizontally is taking you across

00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359
horizontally is taking you across
 

00:39:43.359 --> 00:39:46.170
horizontally is taking you across
categories and vertically is the one

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:46.180
categories and vertically is the one
 

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.069

credit cards right so if you've got a
 

00:39:48.309 --> 00:39:50.999

vertically sorted would that be

00:39:54.749 --> 00:39:54.759
vertically sorted would that be
 

00:39:54.759 --> 00:39:57.469
vertically sorted would that be
something that that might be useful

00:39:57.469 --> 00:39:57.479
something that that might be useful
 

00:39:57.479 --> 00:40:00.690

that'd sort of work until I go and chuck

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:00.700
that'd sort of work until I go and chuck

a lot quick it again into the app a lot
 

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.680
a lot quick it again into the app a lot
more straightforward and just sort of

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:25.690
more straightforward and just sort of
 

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:28.289
more straightforward and just sort of

it's it seems to be working i don't

00:40:35.009 --> 00:40:35.019
it's it seems to be working i don't
 

00:40:35.019 --> 00:40:37.170
it's it seems to be working i don't
think the problem that i'm seeing is

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:37.180
think the problem that i'm seeing is
 

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:42.029
think the problem that i'm seeing is
really to do with with a a mix-up of the

really to do with with a a mix-up of the
 

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:45.749
really to do with with a a mix-up of the
motion itself it's it's more i think

00:40:45.749 --> 00:40:45.759
motion itself it's it's more i think

take up the full width of the page and
because of that you know that the stuff

00:40:57.359 --> 00:40:57.369
because of that you know that the stuff
 

00:40:57.369 --> 00:40:59.549
because of that you know that the stuff
that you could do with gallery in terms

00:40:59.549 --> 00:40:59.559
that you could do with gallery in terms
 

00:40:59.559 --> 00:41:02.009
that you could do with gallery in terms
of having you know multiple light and

00:41:02.009 --> 00:41:02.019
of having you know multiple light and
 

00:41:02.019 --> 00:41:05.130

replacement with view pager for that

00:41:15.059 --> 00:41:15.069
replacement with view pager for that
 

00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:21.539
replacement with view pager for that
kind of functionality yeah um I haven't

00:41:21.539 --> 00:41:21.549
kind of functionality yeah um I haven't
 

00:41:21.549 --> 00:41:24.449
kind of functionality yeah um I haven't
had to resort to that clip clipping a

00:41:24.449 --> 00:41:24.459
had to resort to that clip clipping a
 

00:41:24.459 --> 00:41:26.939
had to resort to that clip clipping a
trick that you've mentioned the one

00:41:26.939 --> 00:41:26.949
trick that you've mentioned the one
 

00:41:26.949 --> 00:41:28.529
trick that you've mentioned the one
thing I to ask is could you just try

00:41:28.529 --> 00:41:28.539
thing I to ask is could you just try
 

00:41:28.539 --> 00:41:31.589
thing I to ask is could you just try
this for me and I just don't know if

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599
this for me and I just don't know if
 

00:41:31.599 --> 00:41:33.569
this for me and I just don't know if
there's a conflict there could you try

00:41:33.569 --> 00:41:33.579
there's a conflict there could you try
 

00:41:33.579 --> 00:41:36.930
there's a conflict there could you try

nested inside another view pager and
 

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:40.829
nested inside another view pager and
just see if that those same artifacts

00:41:40.829 --> 00:41:40.839
just see if that those same artifacts
 

00:41:40.839 --> 00:41:43.469
just see if that those same artifacts
whether you're still seeing them and I

00:41:43.469 --> 00:41:43.479
whether you're still seeing them and I
 

00:41:43.479 --> 00:41:47.189
whether you're still seeing them and I
just don't know whether because because

00:41:47.189 --> 00:41:47.199
just don't know whether because because
 

00:41:47.199 --> 00:41:48.660
just don't know whether because because
you've got a view pager within a view

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:48.670
you've got a view pager within a view
 

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:50.309
you've got a view pager within a view

the fact that you're using this clipping
 

00:41:54.789 --> 00:41:56.939
the fact that you're using this clipping
feature yeah yeah I'll give it a shot

00:41:56.939 --> 00:41:56.949
feature yeah yeah I'll give it a shot
 

00:41:56.949 --> 00:41:58.660
feature yeah yeah I'll give it a shot
breaking it down

00:41:58.660 --> 00:41:58.670
breaking it down
 

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:01.570
breaking it down
and yeah might might even cut some code

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:01.580
and yeah might might even cut some code
 

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.120
and yeah might might even cut some code
up someone so if you get a chance of the

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:04.130

world trunk just seems sad like from
 

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.830
world trunk just seems sad like from
like a android usability point of view

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:11.840
like a android usability point of view
 

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.440
like a android usability point of view
like your users might not be expecting

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:14.450
like your users might not be expecting
 

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.620
like your users might not be expecting
that you know the the way that you're

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:16.630
that you know the the way that you're
 

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:20.260
that you know the the way that you're
using a viewpager within a view pager I

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:20.270
using a viewpager within a view pager I
 

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:23.200
using a viewpager within a view pager I
just I don't think I've seen it in other

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:23.210
just I don't think I've seen it in other
 

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:27.640
just I don't think I've seen it in other
apps on me yeah I was very cautious and

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:27.650
apps on me yeah I was very cautious and
 

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:29.710
apps on me yeah I was very cautious and
aware of that and so I trialed it and

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720
aware of that and so I trialed it and
 

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.900
aware of that and so I trialed it and
and to be honest my finding is that

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:31.910
and to be honest my finding is that
 

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:35.410
and to be honest my finding is that
actually it hints more that that that

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:35.420
actually it hints more that that that
 

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:40.420
actually it hints more that that that

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:40.430
interview pager takes motion because
 

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.850
