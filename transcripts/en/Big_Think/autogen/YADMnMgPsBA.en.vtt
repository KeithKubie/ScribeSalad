monetary policy and fiscal policy and I

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960
monetary policy and fiscal policy and I
 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.840
monetary policy and fiscal policy and I
think we've written with real

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850
think we've written with real
 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.650

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660
sophistication about the monetary debate
 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.410
sophistication about the monetary debate
and then also about the fiscal debate so

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:11.420
and then also about the fiscal debate so
 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.050
and then also about the fiscal debate so
actually I think both that we've had

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.060
actually I think both that we've had
 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.300
actually I think both that we've had
more creative monetary policies than as

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.310
more creative monetary policies than as
 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.990

Scott would imply in his question but
 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.290
Scott would imply in his question but
also that at the moments of decision I

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:25.300
also that at the moments of decision I
 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.920
also that at the moments of decision I
think that we were quite thoughtful and

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:29.930
think that we were quite thoughtful and
 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.990
think that we were quite thoughtful and
explicit in talking about what those

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000
explicit in talking about what those
 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.040
explicit in talking about what those
options were

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.050
 
 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:43.070
 
I think to assess the links between the

Obama administration and business is a

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:46.349
Obama administration and business is a
 

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:49.640
Obama administration and business is a
really big really complicated question

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:49.650
really big really complicated question
 

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.820
really big really complicated question
and in some ways it's still too early to

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:52.830
and in some ways it's still too early to
 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.320
and in some ways it's still too early to
answer it they haven't been in office

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:54.330
answer it they haven't been in office
 

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.890
answer it they haven't been in office
for a full year and I think that there

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900
for a full year and I think that there
 

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.430
for a full year and I think that there
are different questions that need to be

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440
are different questions that need to be
 

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.309
are different questions that need to be
asked about the Obama administration in

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319
asked about the Obama administration in
 

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:07.100
asked about the Obama administration in
different areas so there's one set of

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:07.110
different areas so there's one set of
 

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.800
different areas so there's one set of
issues in health care there's one set of

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:09.810
issues in health care there's one set of
 

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.129
issues in health care there's one set of

00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:13.139
issues in the environment and climate
 

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:16.029
issues in the environment and climate
change and there's one set of issues in

the response of the Obama administration
 

00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:31.279
the response of the Obama administration
into two parts the first is the

into two parts the first is the

immediate crisis firefighting and there
 

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.899
immediate crisis firefighting and there
I think we really have to be careful not

00:08:38.899 --> 00:08:38.909
I think we really have to be careful not
 

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:44.840
I think we really have to be careful not

we have to be careful not to apply that

00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:55.589
we have to be careful not to apply that

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.300
mindset to the decisions that were taken
 

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.030
mindset to the decisions that were taken
in the crisis and we also have to be

00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040
in the crisis and we also have to be
 

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.160
in the crisis and we also have to be
mindful of the fact that the really big

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:01.170
mindful of the fact that the really big
 

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.380

decisions of both the financial crisis

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:03.390
decisions of both the financial crisis
 

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.750
decisions of both the financial crisis
were all taken when George Bush was

Barack Obama made the explicit choice
effectively to carry on with those

place where I think the Obama
 

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.040
place where I think the Obama
administration has a much clearer much

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:31.050
administration has a much clearer much
 

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.160
administration has a much clearer much
freer choice to make in its relationship

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:34.170
freer choice to make in its relationship
 

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:38.150
freer choice to make in its relationship
with the banking industry is the

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160
with the banking industry is the
 

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.030
with the banking industry is the
post-crisis is what the regulatory and

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040
post-crisis is what the regulatory and
 

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.310
post-crisis is what the regulatory and
legislative response is to this crisis

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320
legislative response is to this crisis
 

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.699
legislative response is to this crisis
and there we haven't yet seen I think a

00:09:46.699 --> 00:09:46.709
and there we haven't yet seen I think a
 

00:09:46.709 --> 00:09:49.460
and there we haven't yet seen I think a
very robust response yet we had a choice

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:49.470
very robust response yet we had a choice
 

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.630
very robust response yet we had a choice
by the White House to

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640
by the White House to
 

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.700
by the White House to
move on health care before moving on

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:52.710
move on health care before moving on
 

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.540
move on health care before moving on
financial reform and in financial reform

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:56.550
financial reform and in financial reform
 

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:02.570
financial reform and in financial reform
we have not yet seen a sufficiently in

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.580
we have not yet seen a sufficiently in
 

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.020
we have not yet seen a sufficiently in
my view aggressive response I do think

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:06.030
my view aggressive response I do think
 

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.230
my view aggressive response I do think
that the right thing for this

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240
that the right thing for this
 

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.000
that the right thing for this
administration for any administration to

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.010
administration for any administration to
 

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.300
administration for any administration to
do is to say actually the rules of the

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:14.310
do is to say actually the rules of the
 

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.580
do is to say actually the rules of the
game were a real problem ahead the

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:16.590
game were a real problem ahead the
 

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.910
game were a real problem ahead the
financial crisis and while before this

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920
financial crisis and while before this
 

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.140
financial crisis and while before this
crisis maybe people reasonable people

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:24.150
crisis maybe people reasonable people
 

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.660
crisis maybe people reasonable people
could legitimately disagree about the

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:26.670
could legitimately disagree about the
 

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.910
could legitimately disagree about the
extent to which markets self-regulate

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:28.920
extent to which markets self-regulate
 

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.880
extent to which markets self-regulate
this crisis really is proof that they

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:31.890
this crisis really is proof that they
 

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.850
this crisis really is proof that they
can't self-regulate and that booms and

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:34.860
can't self-regulate and that booms and
 

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.300
can't self-regulate and that booms and
busts still do happen and most

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:38.310
busts still do happen and most
 

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.030
busts still do happen and most
importantly that the collective cost of

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040
importantly that the collective cost of
 

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.010
importantly that the collective cost of
those booms and busts is really great

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:43.020
those booms and busts is really great
 

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.670
those booms and busts is really great
and that is what gives government a

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680
and that is what gives government a
 

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.420
and that is what gives government a
right and indeed a responsibility to

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:50.430
right and indeed a responsibility to
 

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.540
right and indeed a responsibility to
regulate in such a way that minimizes

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:53.550
regulate in such a way that minimizes
 

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.160
regulate in such a way that minimizes
both the likelihood of those booms and

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:55.170
both the likelihood of those booms and
 

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.630
both the likelihood of those booms and
busts and more importantly the

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640
busts and more importantly the
 

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.160
busts and more importantly the
collective costs of those booms and

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:01.170
collective costs of those booms and
 

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.650
collective costs of those booms and
busts and I think the responsibility of

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:03.660
busts and I think the responsibility of
 

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.380
busts and I think the responsibility of
government to do that absolutely

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:06.390
government to do that absolutely
 

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.720
government to do that absolutely
outweighs both the growth penalty

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:11.730
outweighs both the growth penalty
 

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.340
outweighs both the growth penalty
because if you do have regulation that

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:13.350
because if you do have regulation that
 

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.950
because if you do have regulation that
does inevitably cut down on innovation

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:15.960
does inevitably cut down on innovation
 

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.080
does inevitably cut down on innovation
and it means that in your boom period

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.090
and it means that in your boom period
 

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.200
and it means that in your boom period
your boom is a little bit less vigorous

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:20.210
your boom is a little bit less vigorous
 

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.240
your boom is a little bit less vigorous
and it also really means that government

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:23.250
and it also really means that government
 

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:28.040
and it also really means that government
has a right to restrict the ability to

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:28.050
has a right to restrict the ability to
 

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.590
has a right to restrict the ability to
grow of specific players and of specific

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600
grow of specific players and of specific
 

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.810
grow of specific players and of specific
firms
