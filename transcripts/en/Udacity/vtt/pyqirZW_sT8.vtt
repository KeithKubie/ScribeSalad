00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.530
To access Udacity,

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.200
we first need to log into Udacity
using our Georgia Tech credentials.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.830
So first go to udacity.com and
then click to sign in at the top.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.450
Since we're Georgia Tech students,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.530
we'll click Sign in with
Georgia Tech at the bottom.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.210
Here you'll enter your
Georgia Tech ID and your password.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.660
Once you log in,
you'll see a My Courses tab at the top.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.230
If you click the drop-down,

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.858
you'll see a list of classes that
you currently have access to.

00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:30.560
&gt;&gt; Note that udacity.com changes with
some regularity, so make sure to check

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.600
out the instructor notes below this
video for any information on whether or

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.160
not anything you've seen
in this video has changed.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.140
But now we'll move onto talking
about the main pages of

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.960
the classes you'll take.
