00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.750
- [Instructor] A public opinion survey

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:03.480
investigated whether a majority,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.240
more than 50 % of adults,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.860
supported a tax increase to help fund

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.550
the local school system.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.920
A random sample of 200 adults

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.940
showed that 113 of those sampled

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.350
supported the tax increase.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.496
Researchers used these results to test

00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:23.207
the null hypothesis is
that the proportion is 0.5.

00:00:23.207 --> 00:00:25.100
The alternative hypothesis is that

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.700
it's greater than 0.5 where
P is the true proportion

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.650
of adults that support the tax increase.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.520
They calculated a test statistic of Z

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.810
is approximately equal to
1.84 and a corresponding

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.950
P value of approximately 0.033.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.340
Assuming the conditions
for inference were met,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.690
which of these is an
appropriate conclusion?

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.350
And we have our four conclusions here.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.950
At any point in encourage
you to pause this video

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.920
and see if you can answer it for yourself,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.990
but now we will do it together.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.130
And just to make sure we
understand what's going on,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.200
before we even cut to the
chase and get to the answer.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.440
So what we do is we have this population

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.690
and we are going to sample it.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.630
So N is equal to 200.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.410
From that sample we can calculate

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.740
a sample proportion of adults

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.490
that support the tax increase.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.600
We see 113 out of 200 support it,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.370
which is going to be equal to,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.370
let's see that is the same thing as 56.5%.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.840
So 56.5% and so the key is
to figure out the P value.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.640
What is the probability of getting

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.320
a result this much above the assumed

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.720
proportion or greater,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.640
at least this much above
the assumed proportion?

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.900
If we assume that the
null hypothesis is true.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.230
And if that probability,

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.790
if that P value is below
a preset threshold,

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.480
if it's below our significance level,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.690
they haven't told it to us yet,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.370
it looks like they're gonna
give some in the choices,

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.580
well then we would reject
the null hypothesis

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.211
which would suggest the alternative.

00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:06.468
If the P value is not lower than this,

00:02:06.468 --> 00:02:09.860
then we will fail to
reject the null hypothesis.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.460
Now to calculate that P value,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.981
to calculate that probability,

00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:14.968
what we figure out is how many

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.287
in our sampling distribution,

00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:19.960
how many standard deviations above

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.580
the mean of the sampling distribution

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.130
and the mean of the sampling distribution

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.260
would be our assumed
population proportion,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.451
how many standard deviations above

00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:31.280
that mean is this right over here?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.180
And that is what this test statistic is.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.390
And then we can use this
to look at a Z table

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.250
and say all right,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.708
well in a normal
distribution what percentage

00:02:40.708 --> 00:02:43.350
or what is the area under the normal curve

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.550
that is further than
1.84 standard deviations

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.335
or at least 1.84 or
more standard deviations

00:02:50.335 --> 00:02:52.120
above the mean?

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.910
And they did for us as well.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.230
So really what we just need to do

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.230
is compare this P value right over here

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.900
to the significance level.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.570
If the P value is less than
our significance level,

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.303
then we reject,

00:03:07.303 --> 00:03:09.470
reject our null hypothesis.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.030
And that would suggest the alternative.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.110
If this is not true,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.090
then we would fail to
reject the null hypothesis.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.220
So let's look at these choices

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.700
and if you didn't answer
it the first time,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.390
I encourage you to pause the video again.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.220
So at the alpha is equal
to 0.01 significance level,

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.290
they should conclude that more than 50%

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.720
of adults support the tax increase.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.770
So if the alpha is 100th,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.310
the P value right over here is over 300th.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.250
It's roughly 3.3%.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.038
So this is a situation where our P value,

00:03:44.038 --> 00:03:48.160
our P value is greater
than or equal to alpha.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.390
In fact it's definitely
greater than alpha here

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.277
and so here we would fail to reject,

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:58.840
we would fail to reject
our null hypothesis.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.090
And so we wouldn't
conclude that more than 50%

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.420
of adults supported the tax increase.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.520
'cause remember our null
hypothesis is that 50% do

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.910
and we're failing to reject this.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.490
So that's not gonna be true.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.970
At that same significance level,

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.210
they should conclude that less than 50%

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.179
of adults support the tax increase.

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:14.910
No, we can't say that either.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.840
We just failed to reject
this null hypothesis

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.650
that the true proportion is 50%.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.870
So at the alpha equals to
500th significance level,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.010
they should conclude that more than 50%

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.223
of adults support the tax increase.

00:04:31.223 --> 00:04:32.160
Well yeah,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.970
in this situation we have our P value

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.900
which is 0.033.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.540
It is indeed less than
our significance level.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.020
In which case we reject,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.180
reject the null hypothesis.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.350
And if we reject the null hypothesis,

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.620
that would suggest the alternative.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.230
That the true proportion
is greater than 50%.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.450
And so I would pick this
choice right over here.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.510
And then choice D at that
same significance level,

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.370
they should conclude that less than 50%

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.700
of adults support the tax increase.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.558
No, not the situation at all.

00:05:04.558 --> 00:05:07.875
If we're rejecting our null
hypothesis right over here,

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:12.470
then it should suggest this alternative.
