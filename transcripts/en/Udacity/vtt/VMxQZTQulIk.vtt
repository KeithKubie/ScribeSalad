00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.241
In the last quiz, we talked about the performance characteristics of the serial program.

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:07.609
Now we're going to look at the performance characteristics of the parallel program.

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:09.190
The same two questions.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.249
How many multiplications will this code perform?

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:16.027
And assuming that each multiplication operation takes 10 nanoseconds

00:00:16.027 --> 00:00:20.290
and we have enough GPU hardware resources to run all the multiplications in parallel

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.925
and everything else is free,

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:24.728
how long will it take to compute the entire computation?
