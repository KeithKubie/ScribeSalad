00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.107
Thinking about what we talked about in the last quiz, what values can x have for

00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:07.882
Grant's story, then? Write this as an inequality. Remember, that this

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:11.851
restriction, that we're going to place here, does not in any way, change the

00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:16.072
fact that, mathematically speaking, this is the correct answer, as a solution,

00:00:16.072 --> 00:00:20.012
for this inequality. We're just trying to take real life into account now.
