00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:16.268
Like many of you, I'm often frustrated
by the democratic process.

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:19.317
It's messy, it's complicated,

00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:20.773
it's often inefficient.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:23.765
Our political leaders feel disconnected

00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:26.148
from the concerns of ordinary people.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.599
Many feel that voting every few years

00:00:29.623 --> 00:00:32.123
for leaders disconnected
from their daily challenges

00:00:32.147 --> 00:00:33.329
is pointless.

00:00:35.427 --> 00:00:37.399
But before we reject democracy,

00:00:38.626 --> 00:00:40.188
let's imagine what it could be.

00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:45.035
And I believe that African activists
are redefining democracy

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.089
by putting protest at its center,

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.437
what I refer to as "protest democracy."

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.632
International organizations
and academic experts

00:00:56.656 --> 00:01:00.819
define democracy as regular,
multiparty electoral competition.

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.782
But democracy should not only be
about elites competing at the ballot box.

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:08.951
For it to have meaning,

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:11.985
it's something we must
engage in every day.

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:15.864
When I say "protest democracy,"

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.377
I'm challenging how we think
about democratic action.

00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:25.195
Viewing democracy as only elections
is no longer adequate

00:01:25.826 --> 00:01:27.714
and threatens democracy itself.

00:01:29.912 --> 00:01:32.957
So we must protest democracy
to give it a renewed meaning.

00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:37.867
What would this look like?

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.952
We need to turn to African societies,

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:45.383
where ordinary people
are increasingly taking to the streets

00:01:45.407 --> 00:01:47.078
to transform their lives.

00:01:47.102 --> 00:01:50.650
African social movements
have often been at the forefront

00:01:50.674 --> 00:01:53.244
of conceptualizing democracy in this way.

00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:55.693
This may come as a surprise
to those of who think

00:01:55.717 --> 00:01:58.243
that the only way
Africans engage in politics

00:01:58.267 --> 00:01:59.865
is through the barrel of the gun.

00:02:01.984 --> 00:02:04.617
But increasingly, young people
are taking to the streets

00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:07.115
and abandoning organized violence

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:10.259
in favor of more effective
nonviolent action.

00:02:12.575 --> 00:02:15.888
I've spent much of the past two decades
talking to African activists,

00:02:15.912 --> 00:02:17.490
both violent and nonviolent.

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.891
Across Africa, young people are rising up

00:02:21.915 --> 00:02:24.781
to challenge almost every
type of regime known to humanity.

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:26.675
This is my friend Thiat.

00:02:27.787 --> 00:02:29.536
He's a rapper from Senegal.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.224
He led a large movement in Senegal

00:02:31.248 --> 00:02:35.136
that was successful in preventing
the president from stealing a third term.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.356
From Morocco to Lesotho,

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.204
young people are rising up
against entrenched monarchies:

00:02:41.177 --> 00:02:42.792
in Egypt and Sudan,

00:02:43.577 --> 00:02:45.404
against brutal dictatorships;

00:02:46.303 --> 00:02:48.221
in Uganda and Ethiopia,

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.909
against powerful militarized states

00:02:51.687 --> 00:02:53.590
with quasi-democratic veneers;

00:02:56.053 --> 00:02:58.668
in South Africa,
where this image was taken,

00:02:58.692 --> 00:03:00.148
and Burundi,

00:03:00.172 --> 00:03:02.254
against democratically elected leaders

00:03:02.278 --> 00:03:05.559
who have done little to improve
the conditions for ordinary people.

00:03:06.548 --> 00:03:09.425
Across the continent,
protest is not exceptional,

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:11.026
but a normal part of life.

00:03:12.293 --> 00:03:15.095
Africans use protests
to challenge both dictators

00:03:15.964 --> 00:03:17.462
as well as power cuts.

00:03:19.257 --> 00:03:22.424
In a way, Africans are protesting
democracy itself,

00:03:23.048 --> 00:03:25.322
enriching its possibilities for us all.

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:28.852
There have been two
major waves of African protest,

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:31.064
and we are currently living
through the third,

00:03:31.088 --> 00:03:32.719
which began around 2005.

00:03:32.743 --> 00:03:34.757
It includes the so-called Arab Spring,

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:37.808
which took place mostly on the continent.

00:03:39.032 --> 00:03:42.186
The first wave took place
in the 1940s and 1950s

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.034
and led to Africa's decolonization.

00:03:45.023 --> 00:03:49.234
Kwame Nkrumah led
a broad coalition in Ghana

00:03:49.258 --> 00:03:51.123
that overthrew British rule,

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:53.926
providing a template
for nonviolent movements globally.

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.992
The second wave took place
in the 1980s and 1990s

00:03:59.016 --> 00:04:01.695
against austerity measures
that imposed harsh conditions

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:02.871
on African economies.

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.467
These protests led to the overthrow
of autocratic regimes

00:04:07.491 --> 00:04:08.952
and led to the introduction

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:11.269
of multiparty elections
across the continent.

00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:17.529
The ongoing third wave is correcting
the shortcomings of the earlier two.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.364
If the first wave brought
liberation but not democracy,

00:04:24.198 --> 00:04:27.585
and the second, elections
but only for the elites,

00:04:28.398 --> 00:04:29.825
then it is the third wave

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.515
that is most concerned
with transforming democracy

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.098
into the rule of the people.

00:04:35.678 --> 00:04:38.491
It includes movements
like Y'en a Marre in Senegal,

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.582
Le Balai Citoyen in Burkina Faso,

00:04:41.606 --> 00:04:43.369
Tajamuka in Zimbabwe,

00:04:43.937 --> 00:04:47.051
LUCHA and Filimbi
in the Democratic Republic of Congo,

00:04:47.725 --> 00:04:52.620
movements that work outside of more
conventional nongovernmental organizations

00:04:52.644 --> 00:04:53.969
and political parties

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:56.551
to challenge the economic
and political system itself,

00:04:57.323 --> 00:04:58.602
often at great risk.

00:04:59.402 --> 00:05:02.762
Brilliant young activists
like LUCHA's Fred Bauma

00:05:02.786 --> 00:05:04.820
have been detained and tortured,

00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:08.410
often with little to no outcry
from the international community.

00:05:09.018 --> 00:05:12.371
The list goes on, as you can see
from some of the data we collected.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.737
There have been large popular protests

00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:17.786
in over 40 African countries since 2005,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.355
and if you look,
you'll recognize that in 2011,

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:23.287
the year of the so-called Arab Spring,

00:05:23.311 --> 00:05:25.507
was actually the spike
of this broader wave.

00:05:26.237 --> 00:05:27.880
Contrary to popular belief,

00:05:27.904 --> 00:05:30.099
many of these protests
have been successful.

00:05:30.874 --> 00:05:34.085
We know of the dictators falling
in Tunisia and in Egypt,

00:05:34.702 --> 00:05:38.343
but popular movements have prevented
presidents from stealing third terms

00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:41.726
in Senegal, in Malawi
and Burkina Faso as well.

00:05:43.782 --> 00:05:45.895
What's driving this upsurge of protest?

00:05:46.865 --> 00:05:49.316
Demographically,
Africa is both the youngest

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.212
and the fastest-growing continent,

00:05:51.236 --> 00:05:54.435
with the largest age gap
between the people and their rulers.

00:05:55.334 --> 00:05:57.365
It is urbanizing at a tremendous pace.

00:05:58.578 --> 00:06:02.097
Economically, African countries
have been growing for over a decade now,

00:06:02.585 --> 00:06:04.851
largely driven by investments from Asia.

00:06:05.864 --> 00:06:08.024
But little of this wealth
is trickling down.

00:06:09.305 --> 00:06:12.390
Formal jobs in the industrial sector
are actually decreasing,

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.998
with informal labor the only option left
for people to eke out a living.

00:06:18.942 --> 00:06:21.123
As a result, inequality is skyrocketing,

00:06:21.717 --> 00:06:24.154
and political leaders
are increasingly disconnected

00:06:24.178 --> 00:06:26.305
from their much younger populations.

00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:28.425
For those of us from outside of Africa,

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.399
we're familiar with parts of this story:

00:06:30.888 --> 00:06:32.658
a massive spike in inequality,

00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:35.981
the product of a decline
in good jobs for good wages

00:06:36.005 --> 00:06:39.030
that were once considered
the hallmark of an advanced society;

00:06:39.586 --> 00:06:42.003
the capture of our
political parties by elites

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:45.053
accompanied by the hollowing
out of civil society

00:06:45.077 --> 00:06:47.543
that once provided a voice
to ordinary people;

00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:50.930
that sinking feeling
that no matter what you do,

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:54.336
external factors related
to the global economy

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.802
can disrupt our lives for the worse.

00:06:58.706 --> 00:07:00.655
Our political leaders seem helpless,

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:01.971
insisting on austerity,

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.863
even as public goods diminish
to levels unseen in decades.

00:07:06.398 --> 00:07:10.185
And this is when they're not succumbing
to exclusionary nationalism,

00:07:10.748 --> 00:07:13.686
blaming our woes on the weak
rather than the powerful.

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:18.818
What those of us from North America
and Western Europe consider to be new

00:07:18.842 --> 00:07:21.813
has been the normal condition
of African life since the 1970s.

00:07:22.202 --> 00:07:23.826
So who better to learn from

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.024
than those who have been engaged
in resistance to these conditions

00:07:27.048 --> 00:07:28.542
for the longest period of time?

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:31.825
What can we learn
from African protest democracy?

00:07:32.795 --> 00:07:35.733
First, democracy must begin
with ordinary people.

00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:40.264
Viewing democracy as only elections
has led to widespread disillusionment.

00:07:41.724 --> 00:07:44.934
We must instead work to center
ordinary people in democratic life.

00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:47.579
Protest provides us one way to do that.

00:07:48.445 --> 00:07:51.315
Regardless of your age,
sexuality, your gender,

00:07:52.177 --> 00:07:55.736
whether you're a citizen or a non-citizen,
able-bodied or disabled,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.076
anyone can participate.

00:07:58.524 --> 00:07:59.888
In contrast to elections,

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:02.654
protests are not confined
by rigid electoral cycles.

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:05.381
They offer a much more
immediate form of action

00:08:05.405 --> 00:08:06.963
in our era of instant feedback.

00:08:08.261 --> 00:08:11.063
Second, while protests may be messy,

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.477
this is what makes them powerful.

00:08:14.532 --> 00:08:17.528
Protests are contentious
and contested processes,

00:08:18.528 --> 00:08:20.639
defined by contingent actions,

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.420
often devoid of clear messaging,

00:08:24.073 --> 00:08:26.779
characterized by incomplete organization.

00:08:27.756 --> 00:08:31.644
These dynamics are what makes it easy
to dismiss protests as riots

00:08:31.668 --> 00:08:34.719
or to assume they are
of limited political utility.

00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:37.948
But it also makes them easier to suppress.

00:08:38.612 --> 00:08:43.567
Too often, governments do not view
protests as elementary to democracy.

00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:47.082
Instead, they violently crush
social movements

00:08:48.371 --> 00:08:50.881
or work to discredit their message.

00:08:53.642 --> 00:08:55.659
Third, as I already hinted,

00:08:56.147 --> 00:09:00.014
protest is the space from which
new political imaginations may emerge.

00:09:01.957 --> 00:09:04.373
Protests are about coloring
outside the lines,

00:09:04.797 --> 00:09:07.977
a way for ordinary people
to rewrite the rules of the game

00:09:08.001 --> 00:09:10.212
that too many feel
are stacked against them.

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:14.392
Many young people in Africa
have grown up in societies

00:09:14.416 --> 00:09:16.910
where a single ruler
has ruled their entire lives.

00:09:17.787 --> 00:09:20.525
Protest is the space
for new possibilities to emerge,

00:09:20.549 --> 00:09:23.013
as young people begin
to discover their own power.

00:09:24.954 --> 00:09:27.479
Consider the situation
of my friend Linda Masarira,

00:09:28.206 --> 00:09:29.944
a single mother of five,

00:09:29.968 --> 00:09:33.300
who is leading protests
against the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe.

00:09:34.103 --> 00:09:36.748
She has been beaten, arrested, harassed.

00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:40.740
But Linda perseveres, because
as she told me a few months ago,

00:09:40.764 --> 00:09:43.471
protest has given her a sense
of meaning and direction.

00:09:43.495 --> 00:09:45.839
And though she knows the odds against her,

00:09:45.863 --> 00:09:47.066
Linda perseveres.

00:09:47.789 --> 00:09:51.368
Like Linda and other
young African activists,

00:09:51.392 --> 00:09:53.885
we all must work to redefine democracy

00:09:53.909 --> 00:09:56.992
as something more than just
elections and political parties.

00:09:58.522 --> 00:10:00.736
Democracy is a creative process,

00:10:01.363 --> 00:10:03.926
and protest has always been the vehicle

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:08.100
for expanding our political imaginations
beyond what we are told is possible.

00:10:08.124 --> 00:10:09.842
(In Swahili) Thank you very much.

00:10:09.866 --> 00:10:13.198
(Applause)
