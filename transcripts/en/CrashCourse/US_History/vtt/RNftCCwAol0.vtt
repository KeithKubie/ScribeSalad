00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course US
History and today we return to one of my favorite
subjects: economics.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.099
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, I don't wanna brag,
but economics is actually my best subject.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.919
Like, I got the bronze medal at the state
academic decathlon tournament...among C students.

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.339
Yeah, I remember, Me from the Past.

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.430
By the way, thanks for getting that picture
into our show.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.940
It just goes to show you: aptitude is not
destiny.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.220
Anyway, economics is about much more than,
like, supply and demand curves.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.720
Ultimately, it's about the decisions people make and
how those decisions shape their lives and the world.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.460
So today we're going to turn to one of the
least-studied but most interesting periods in
American history: the Market Revolution.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:45.360
There weren't any fancy wars or politically charged debates, but this discussion shaped the way that most Americans actually live their lives and think about work on a daily basis.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.140
Like, if you or someone you know goes to work,
well, then you have the Market Revolution
to thank, or possibly to curse.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.960
[Theme Music]

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.080
The Market Revolution, like the Industrial
Revolution, was more of a process than an event.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.660
It happened in the first half of the 19th century,
basically, the period before the Civil War.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:17.240
This was the so-called "Era of Good Feelings,"
because between 1812 and 1836, there was really
only one political party, making American politics,
you know, much less contentious.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.240
Also, more boring.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.960
The Market Revolution saw many Americans move
away from producing stuff largely for themselves on
independent farms – that Jeffersonian
ideal –

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.700
and toward producing goods for sale to others,
often others who were very far away, with prices
set by competition with other producers.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.100
This was closer to Hamilton's American dream.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.710
In the end, buddy, you didn't get to be president,
but you did win.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.880
In many ways, this was the beginning of the
modern commercial industrial economy, not
just in the United States, but in the world.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.360
The first thing that enabled this massive
economic shift was new technology, specifically
in transportation and communication.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.580
Like, in the 18th century, it was very difficult
to bring goods to markets, and that meant
that markets were local and small.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:01.340
Most trade was over land, and transporting
goods 30 miles over land in the United States literally
cost as much as shipping them to England.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.660
So, to get something from Cincinnati to New
York, for instance,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.920
the most efficient way was to go down the
Mississippi River, through the Gulf of Mexico,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.020
around Florida, and then up the Atlantic coast,
which took three months,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.320
but that was still less time and less money
than more direct overland routes.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.080
But new transportation changed this.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.680
First came better roads, which were largely
financed by tolls.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.280
Even the federal government got in on the
act, building the so-called National Road,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:32.520
which reached all the way from the massive city
of Cumberland, Maryland, across our great nation to
the equally metropolitan Wheeling, West Virginia.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.320
Mr. Green! Mr – Mr. Green, Mr. Green!

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.280
I know, Me from the Past, West Virginia did
not yet exist, argh, shut up!

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.420
More important than roads were canals, which
made transport much cheaper and more efficient,

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.740
and which wouldn't have been possible without
the steam boat.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.660
Robert Fulton's steam boat Clermont first
sailed from New York to Albany in 1807, demonstrating
the potential of steam-powered commerce.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.140
And by 1811, there were steam boats on the
Mississippi.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.210
The introduction of steam boats set off a
mania for canal building.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.910
Between 1800 and the depression of 1837,
which put a halt to most construction,
more than 3,000 miles of canals were built.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.760
And no state was more instrumental in the
canal boom than New York,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:16.920
which in 1825 completed the 363-mile-long Eerie
Canal, linking the Great Lakes with the Hudson River,
which made New York the nation's premier port.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.320
Other cities like Buffalo, Rochester, and
Syracuse grew up along the canals.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.580
So much so that Nathaniel Hawthorne once said,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.840
"The canal is like fertilizer, causing cities
to spring up alongside it."

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.760
That's such a good simile, Nathaniel Hawthorne.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.840
It's almost like the United States didn't
have any good writers until Mark Twain,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.670
but we need to read somebody from the early
19th century, so I guess it's you.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.810
But from a long-term perspective, the most
important new transportation? Railroads.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:47.520
The first commercial railroad, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio,
was begun in 1828 and by 1860, there were more than
30,000 miles of rails in the United States.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.980
And on the communication side, we got the
telegraph, so no longer would Andrew Jackson
fight battles two weeks after the end of a war.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.520
Telegraphs allowed merchants to know when
to expect their shipments and how much they
could expect to sell them for.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.980
And then, as now, more information meant more
robust markets.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.400
But perhaps the most important innovation
of the time was the factory.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.920
Now, when you think of factories, you might think of,
like, Chinese political prisoners making smartphones,
but early factories looked like this.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.220
More than just a technological development,
the factory was an organizational innovation.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:23.520
Like, factories gathered workers together in one
place and split up tasks among them, making
production much faster and also more efficient.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.920
The first factories relied on water power, which is the reason they were all east of the fall line – the geographic reason why there are so many waterfalls and rapids on the east coast.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.020
But after 1840, steam power was introduced,
so factories could be located in other places,

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.750
especially near the large cities that were
sprouting up in what we now know as the Midwest.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.370
So the American system of manufacturing, which
centered on mass-production of interchangeable parts,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:51.840
grew up primarily in New England, but then it moved to the Midwest, where it spent its adolescence and its adulthood, and now its tottering decline into senility.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:59.480
So, all these new economic features – roads, canals, railroads, telegraphs, factories – they all required massive up-front capital investment.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.200
Like, you just can't build a canal in stages
as it pays for itself.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.640
So, without more modern banking systems
and people willing to take risks, none of this
would have happened.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.860
Some of these investments were facilitated
by new business organizations, especially
the Limited Liability Corporation,

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.840
which enabled investors to finance business
ventures without being personally  responsible
for losses other than their own.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.350
In other words, corporations can fail without,
like, ruining their stockholders and directors.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.240
People don't always like that, by the way,
but it's been very good for economic growth
in the last 180 years or so.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.420
So having angered a bunch of people by talking about the important role that big businesses played in growing the American Economy in the 19th century,

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.280
I will now anger the rest of you by talking
about the important role that the state played.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.080
In the 1830s, states began passing general incorporation laws, which made it easier to create corporations,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:51.180
and the Supreme Court upheld them and protected them from further interference in cases like Gibbons vs. Ogden, which struck down a monopoly that New York had granted to one steamboat company.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:58.520
And the Charles River Bridge case, which said that building a second bridge over the Charles River did not infringe upon the charter of the first bridge.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.020
In both those cases, the court was using its
power to encourage competition.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.760
And this brings up something really important about
the growth of American capitalism: government helped.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.350
The federal government built roads and canals
and its highest court protected businesses.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.260
And states issued bonds to build canals and
offered sweetheart deals to companies that
built railroads.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.960
And despite what we may believe about the
heroic risk-taking entrepreneurs building the
American economy through solitary efforts,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.480
without the government protecting their interests,
they wouldn't have been able to do much.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.960
All right, let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.700
The Market Revolution changed the landscape
of work, which, for most of the prior 200 years,
happened at home.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:44.000
Small-scale production of clothes and other goods had been done in the home, largely by women, and initially, this is how industrial production worked as well.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.259
Factory owners would produce some of the products,
like patterns for shoes, and then farm the finishing 
out to people working in their houses.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:07:00.720
Eventually, they realized that it would be more efficient to gather the workers together in one place, although the older, "putting-out system" continued in some industries, especially in big cities.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.100
After the Market Revolution, more and more Americans
went to work instead of working from home.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.940
The Market Revolution also changed the way
we imagined work and leisure time.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:17.520
Like, on farms, the seasons and hours of daylight
regulated the time for work, but in factories,
work is regulated by the clock.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.840
Which, by the way, was one of the first products
to be manufactured using the American system
of manufacturing.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.920
Railroads and shipping timetables further
required the standardization of time.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.200
Factories also made it possible for more people
to do industrial work.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.630
At first, this meant women.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:40.900
The workers in the early textile mills at Lowell, Massachusetts, for instance, were primarily young, New England farm girls who worked for a few years in the mills before returning home to get married.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.260
Women were cheaper to employ, because it was
assumed that they would not be a family's sole
breadwinner.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.070
At least, this was the excuse for not paying
them more at the time.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.990
I can't remember what excuse we have now,
but I'm sure it's a great one.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.630
Anyway, all of this meant that the nature
of work had changed.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:59.520
In colonial America, artisans worked for what they
called their "price," which was linked to what they
produced.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:06.460
In a factory, however, workers were paid a
wage according to the number of hours they worked,
regardless of how much they produced.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:14.040
This may not sound like a big deal, but working for wages with one's livelihood defined by a clock and the whims of an employer was a huge change,

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.560
and it undermined the idea of freedom that
was supposedly the basis of America.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:28.420
Thomas Jefferson had worried that men working in factories, dependent upon their employers, were inherently un-free, and that this would make them unfit to be proper American citizens.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.340
And as it happens, many factory workers agreed
with him.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.539
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:38.740
So, one reaction to the restrictions of the
wage worker was to engage in the great American
pastime of lighting out for the territories.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.940
With less and less farmland available in New England,
young men had been migrating west for decades.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.980
And, after the War of 1812, this flood of
migration continued and even grew.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:56.260
Between 1790 and 1840, 4.5 million people crossed
over the Appalachian Mountains, and six new states
were created between 1815 and 1821.

00:08:56.269 --> 00:09:02.209
Ohio's population grew from 231,000 in 1810
to over 2 million by 1850.

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:09.220
People even took up the motto 'Malaria isn't
going to catch itself!' and moved to Florida
after we purchased it from Spain in 1819.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:15.420
Moving out West was a key aspect of American
freedom, and the first half of the 19th century
became the age of "manifest destiny":

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.600
the idea that it was a God-given right of Americans
to spread out over the North American continent.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:27.700
The term was coined by a New York journalist, John L. O'Sullivan, who wrote that the people living out West – i.e, the Native Americans – must succumb to quote,

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:37.360
"our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the
whole of the continent which providence has given us
for the development of the great experiment in liberty."

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.360
Stan, he actually wrote "overspread"!

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:47.640
One thing I love about providence is that
it has like a 100% rate of giveth-ing unto
us and taketh-ing away from them.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:53.240
One of the results of this migration was that
it was really difficult for factory owners to find
men who could work in their factories.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:58.140
First, they looked to Yankee women to fill
the factories, but increasingly, those jobs
were filled by immigrants.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:05.820
Fortunately, the US had lots of immigrants, like the more than one million Irish people that came here fleeing poverty, especially after the potato famine of 1845 to 1851.

00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:09.360
Lastly, let's turn to the intellectual responses
to the Market Revolution.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.500
Oh, it's time for the Mystery Document?

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.300
The rules here are simple.

00:10:15.309 --> 00:10:18.289
If I fail to guess the author of the Mystery
Document, I get shocked with the shock pen.

00:10:18.289 --> 00:10:19.720
And yes, this is a real shock pen!

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.620
Lots of people are commenting, saying I am
faking the shocks.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.720
I am not faking the shocks!

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.850
I am in the business of teaching you history,
not in the business of faking pain!

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.730
All right, let's do this thing.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:35.410
"They do not yet see, and thousands of young
men as hopeful now crowding to the barriers
of the career, do not yet see,

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:43.770
that if the single man plant himself indomitably
on his instincts, and there abide, the huge
world will come round to him.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:48.910
Patience - patience; - with the shades of
all the good and great for company;

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.429
and for solace the perspectives of your own
infinite life;

00:10:52.429 --> 00:11:01.200
and for work, the study and the communication
of principles, the making those instincts
prevalent, the conversion of the world.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.560
Is it not the chief disgrace in the world,
not to be a unit; - not to be reckoned one character;

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.779
- not to yield that peculiar fruit which each
man was created to bear, but to be – "

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:14.529
Oh, god, Stan, I can't bear it anymore.

00:11:14.529 --> 00:11:19.190
It's Emerson. [dinging noise] It's definitely
Emerson. It is unreadably Emerson.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.200
Indeed, the most linguistically convoluted of the
Transcendentalists, which is really saying something.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.700
Anyway, I don't get punished, but I did kind
of get half punished, because I had to read that.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:34.740
The Transcendentalists – like Margaret Fuller, Henry
David Thoreau, Walt Whitman – were trying to
redefine freedom in a changing world.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.560
Work was increasingly regimented.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.800
Factory workers were as interchangeable as
the parts that they made.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:46.420
But the Transcendentalists argued that freedom
resided in an individual's power to remake
oneself, and maybe even the world.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:53.199
But there would be a reaction to this in American
literature as it became clear that escaping drudgery to
reinvent yourself was no easy task for wage workers.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.680
So, the early 19th century saw a series of booms
and busts, sometimes called business cycles.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.980
And with those business cycles came a growing
disparity in wealth.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:10.399
To protect their interests, workers began forming political organizations called Working Man's Parties, that eventually morphed into unions, calling for higher wages and better working conditions.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:16.240
And we'll have more to say about that in coming weeks, but for now, it's important to remember that as America grew more prosperous, many people

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.620
– women and especially slaves, but also
free, wage-working men –

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:26.980
recognized that the Market Revolution left them with much less freedom than they might have enjoyed 50 or 100 years earlier.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:33.120
My favorite commentary on the Market Revolution
actually comes from the author Herman Melville
in his short story "Bartleby the Scrivener."

00:12:33.129 --> 00:12:37.850
Melville worked at the customs house in New
York, so he knew all about world markets first-hand.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.809
In "Bartleby," he tells the story of a young
clerk who works for a lawyer in New York City.

00:12:41.809 --> 00:12:44.420
Now, when you're a farmer, your work has an
intrinsic meaning.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.879
When you work, you have food, and when you
don't work, you don't.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.880
But when you're a copyist like Bartleby, it's difficult
to find meaning in what you do every day.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:59.040
You know that anyone else could do it, and
you suspect that if your work doesn't get done,
it won't actually matter very much.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.840
And in light of this, Bartleby just stops
working, saying, "I prefer not" when asked,
well, pretty much anything.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:11.920
Seeing his boss and society's reaction to
someone who simply doesn't buy into the market
economy is comic, and then ultimately tragic.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:18.080
And it tells us a lot about the Market Revolution
beyond the famous people and inventions and
heroic individualism.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:27.380
Now, most people read "Bartleby" as an existentialist
narrative, and it definitely is that, but, for me, the story's subtitle proves that it's also about the market economy.

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:32.889
The full title of the story is, "Bartleby
the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street."

00:13:32.889 --> 00:13:34.110
I'll see you next week.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.440
