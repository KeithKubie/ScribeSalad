00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:03.734
California is the third
largest oil-producing

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:04.700
state in the country.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.166
A lot of people
don't realize that.

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.433
When they think of
California, they think

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:10.433
of vineyards and Hollywood.

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:12.867
But we've been living with
oil and gas production

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:15.500
since the late 19th century.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.233
Kern County is
really the epicenter

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:20.166
of oil production in
California, where about 80%

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.667
of our state's oil is produced.

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:25.400
NARRATOR: The Central Valley,
where half of Kern County lies,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.000
produces 25% of America's food.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.166
Oil and agriculture
have always had

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.200
a tenuous relationship here.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.300
I make my living
on the surface.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.967
They make their living below.

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:39.667
NARRATOR: Keith Gardiner and his
business partner, Holly King,

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:42.900
have farmed in Kern
County for 22 years,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.667
right alongside big oil.

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:47.734
HOLLY KING: You have two owners
on the same piece of property,

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:51.367
one who owns the
minerals and the farmer

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:53.133
who owns the surface.

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.000
KEITH GARDINER: A land
man from an oil company

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.066
will call or come
out to your office

00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:00.367
and say, hey, the
trucks are lined up.

00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:01.467
We're gonna be in
there tomorrow.

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:03.333
We want to drill here and here.

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.233
Well, immediately,
you get into a fight.

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:06.767
You say, no, you're not.
Yes, we are.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:07.734
No, you're not.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:08.734
Well, we're gonna sue you.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.533
And I'm just a
little guy, you know.

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.600
I can't stand to be
sued by an oil company.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.834
So a lot of times, you
just acquiesce, say,

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:16.800
go ahead, you know.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.000
I can't fight you.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.967
We do have an
obligation to allow

00:01:19.967 --> 00:01:23.500
them to access their minerals,
and we're OK with that.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.333
We're not OK with
we can do anything

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:30.734
we want on your surface,
because we're the big guys.

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:32.800
NARRATOR: Like Earl
Tennant in West Virginia,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.834
they have seen substantial
damage on their farm.

00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:38.700
KEITH GARDINER: We noticed the
overall health of the trees

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.000
was not good.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.133
We started testing the water,
and we found out that we

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:45.166
had a lot of high salts.

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.600
A lot of high chlorides.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.900
And those are just the
death of almond trees.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.934
We took out about 8,000 trees.

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:57.633
We suspected that billions
of barrels of saltwater

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:01.767
was getting injected
into our freshwater zone.

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:05.400
When you start taking our
trees out, it's a problem.
