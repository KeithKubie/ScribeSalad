00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.220
There are a few really common pitfalls
that developers should avoid.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.240
First and foremost,
it's using your analytics improperly.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.080
A good example of this is
relying on vanity metrics.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.940
Vanity metrics are things
such as daily active users.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.870
These might be extremely large,
attractive numbers, 100,000, a million

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.070
people but they don't actually tell you
how the app or the game is performing.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.160
You might have a huge number of people
but nobody's actually monetizing,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.400
or the percentage of the people
that are monetizing,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.410
even though the average revenue
per user is really high,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.220
the percentage of total people who
are making a purchase is absurdly low.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.410
You're leaving money on the table.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.960
Make sure that you're not
relying on those vanity metrics.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.530
Make sure you're tracking
exactly the right things.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.850
Only things that actually determine
whether or not you're making money or

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.200
retaining users.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.180
It might be interesting to see how many
people are engaging with the multiplayer

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.500
feature within your game but if it's
not actually contributing to your

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.000
monetization, the percentage of
people that are making a purchase or

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.360
sticking around or
sharing the game with their friends,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.430
then it makes the most sense to
leave that out of your analysis.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.080
Finally, when looking at your analytics,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.250
make sure you're not getting
consumed with the minutia.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.230
In a lot of cases, there will
be a great degree of noise but

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.060
not a whole lot of signal, particularly
statistically significant signal.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.470
Make sure that in the end,
if you see a small day to day, or

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.330
week to week fluctuations that
you're only acting on it if it's

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.430
actually something that is significant.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.760
One mistake that we see a lot,
is that developers rely on one

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.030
particular ad network, or a monetization
method for all of their monetization.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.270
You don't want to put all
of your eggs in one basket.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.000
Even if you have a great relationship
with whoever the person is that sold you

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.530
that particular method,
make sure that there are fallbacks,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.190
just in case there's a problem.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.098
Finally, don't use emotion or

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:03.370
don't rely on an emotion in
order to make your decisions.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.650
Do everything based on the numbers.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.030
There's great data somewhere out there
that's going to determine exactly what's

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.570
right for you,
all you have to do is find it.
