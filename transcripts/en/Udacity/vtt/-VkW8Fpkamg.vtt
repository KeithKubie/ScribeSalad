I always going to forget this, but let me figure it out. To

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.100
add a field, I was there was, where's that little click access guy?

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.900
&gt;&gt; So you can only see that when

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.560
you're actually in the app. from the end user

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.910
view. But right now we're in the setup. So,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.240
we don't need a quick link to the setup.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.010
&gt;&gt; Hm. Oh, custom fields, new field. I found it. Okay so I

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.430
want to add, I don't know, what should we track about our attendees?

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.870
&gt;&gt; Maybe their emails, so we can

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.460
send them the ticket?

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.590
&gt;&gt; Makes sense, Okay. so I bet there's an email field.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.350
There is, nice work. That was nice work to Sales Force, just

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.350
&gt;&gt;

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.555
[LAUGH]

00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:37.980
&gt;&gt; In general, thank you for giving me

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.630
the email field. Field Label, Email, I guess.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.990
Okay, and again, not going to worry about this stuff.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.830
Save. All

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.340
right, cool. We've got our field here just like we wanted.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.150
&gt;&gt; Great.
