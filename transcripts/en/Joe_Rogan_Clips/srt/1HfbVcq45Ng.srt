1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Like a murderer from the past, like
Gingiss con or something like that. Well,

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,770
you actually get in trouble
now for cultural appropriation.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,340
You know where you
wouldn't get in trouble.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,380
Is that the renaissance fair when they
have like heroes and villains day goes on.

5
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:18,070
What you're doing there,
you got some squinty eyes.

6
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:22,990
I'm going out with tape too far. Right.
And then you're taking it too far,

7
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:23,290
isn't it?

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,210
But why is it weird that
a physical characteristic
like eyes like cl small eyes

9
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:31,930
is like offensive to discuss?
Is that fast? It is fascinating,

10
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,820
but I recreate I think.

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,830
Is it offensive or is it people
enjoy the feeling of being offended.

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,960
I think there's this, there's a
sweet spot in the middle of there.

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,250
I would beg to differ that some of the
people in society who are offended by

14
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:46,200
words,
terms,

15
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:51,201
sentences aren't necessarily
truly offended as much as
they want to say they're

16
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,630
offended. I am 100% on
board with you. So Lucy,

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,020
doctor Peluso. Sorry. All
right, thank you doctor Peluso.

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,340
I have an HPV HD Phi Abd.

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,070
I can't, I mean people get offended.
It's exhausted. They love it.

20
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,160
They love getting offended and you
know what? They also love doing,

21
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,250
not doing shit about it,
but in their defense,

22
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:22,270
if you see like a movie where
a dude is playing an Asian man,

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,990
but he's a white dude and they
do some malarkey with his eyes,

24
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,600
you're like mother fucker
working with his eyes.

25
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,860
What did he turn him into?
A leprechaun,

26
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:36,060
something Irish with
someone at Charlie Chan.

27
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,020
The fucking fucking all from use that
special effects Malarkey can change and

28
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:46,580
went to a Chinaman. Oh God
damn Leprechaun, that fucker.

29
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,140
You could be an Englishman.

30
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,940
No one has a problem with
calling someone an Englishman.

31
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,950
You call someone a Chinaman and no wall.
You're getting weird. They're weird.

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,430
It's exhausting when people are offended
and then it's like girls being offended

33
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:02,940
and writing articles about guys
that are doing me too moments,

34
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:04,830
but they're not going to the VA,
the rallies,

35
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:06,960
they're not involved in the community.

36
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,170
They're not really like moving
the needle there, just screaming.

37
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,640
Is it good to go to rallies?

38
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,420
I think it's good to be also actively
and physically involved in whatever

39
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:16,560
movement you believe in.

40
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,370
I think just saying it and
posting it on Twitter is a facade,

41
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,240
but it's good for likes. You can
get a lot of likes. Boom. I mean,

42
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:27,660
I guess there's some eyeballs on it.
You're, you're creating a conversation.

43
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:31,800
But I dunno, I just believe
in like living, walking
the talk a little bit more.

44
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,230
What the fuck are we just talking about?
The gang has con oh,

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,000
Chinese, um, actors that get fucked
out of roles by white people.

46
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,340
They don't do that anymore, but they
used to, but one of the big ones was, um,

47
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,460
Charlie Chan. Charlie Chan was
like a famous detective show.

48
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,030
Remember that show was,
it was it cast it as a white man?

49
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,000
It was a white dude playing,
uh,

50
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,290
a Chinese detective that was like
super wise detective that's busted,

51
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,950
but he looks like, you know, like a
white guy who eats good like math block.

52
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,550
More like a commish. No, like
that's, that's all right.

53
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,470
My Holy Hell. Yeah, that was Charles Chan.

54
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,190
I'm offended. Yeah, he should
be. He looks more like,

55
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,450
he looks like a shitty magician who
looks like chewy from the comedy store.

56
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:22,750
You don't,

57
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,340
you guys don't remember chewy that is
offensive at the same thing happened with,

58
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:30,730
um, let me see that picture. Look
at that. That shit is ridiculous.

59
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,830
[inaudible] happening there.
These,

60
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,190
he looks like he runs a casino and
upstate New York. You ever hear him talk?

61
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,740
Can we play? Some of them need
to hear it from Charlie Chan.

62
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:44,020
It was very offensive.
Oh my God. Don. Don,

63
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,910
let's listen to this. Charlie. I'm,
I'm shocked right now. So Jamie. Okay.

64
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:54,220
What do you think? What you hear? What
year do you think this was? 1945 it says,

65
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,880
say fifties scarlet
Johannson had that holy,

66
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:00,520
she remembers she was cast in that movie
and it was supposed to be an Asian role.

67
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,620
Yeah. And Holly and people went
crazy over it. Balle spelled,

68
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,870
let's hear some of this.
Here we go guys. I can't,

69
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,880
Alrighty. You have telephone. Wait
a minute. I got your telegram.

70
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:16,881
I started watching all train you contact
mysterious Mr Raj or pick him up and he

71
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:21,450
got off the train and Hodge. That's
one of my man over that. He and I have,

72
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:25,980
I owe him plus seven now rounds.
You know, you follow him.

73
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,820
He couldn't help it. I figured you heard
about partner on the ground. Right.

74
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,720
So we've kept totally,

75
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,330
what's his face?
He doesn't even look remotely.

76
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,050
They taped his eyes for sure.
They did some weirdness,

77
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,360
but not much because he looks like every
housewife in Bev hills minus the facial

78
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:46,620
hair. The pullback phase. Okay. Yeah.
Where you're like take off 10 years,

79
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,390
but back then you know this guy could
get away with that. You know? Uh,

80
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,720
what's his face? John Lady in the
Saran wrap. She's a ghost or some shit.

81
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,140
Dude. What's happening
to her? That is bizarre.

82
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,170
I mean not their hands around ran back
then. That could be just shit. Oh Shit.

83
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,990
Oh bubble wrap up.

84
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:10,500
Food is just get out to Tj's on things
budget and take it home after the party

85
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,140
balloon.
Put your food inside of it.

86
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,410
It's like your face.
What is that Shit Dude?

87
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,720
She's wearing like a glass veil
or something. Shiela booth.

88
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,030
Is that Louis Gomez and
Shiela booth. They're time
travelers. And this is, I mean,

89
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,860
isn't it great to live in this time where
our movies are so much better but are

90
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:34,260
going to laugh in the future? Looking
back at how stupid things are today,

91
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,080
you just can't see a comment. Number one.
You still have to re look at that guy.

92
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,310
That's a cool chair. What is that dude?
So another Chinese guy, that dude,

93
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:43,300
it's not really a Chinese guy.
Thank you God.

94
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,650
That's some terrible face
makeup I think added to them.

95
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,930
I think that looks like a,
like Joey Diaz on acid.

96
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,960
Look at that with a head wrap.
That's fancy tape.

97
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:57,290
It does look like Tate a regal
Tate older Tate on acid acid.

98
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,420
Real angering. Ruling a kingdom
after a couple of divorces. Yeah,

99
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,160
he's like an 80 year old Tate. Yeah,
that's, well that's what they used to do.

100
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,240
But look up John Wayne as Gangas con.
That's even dumber cause I didn't even,

101
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,880
I didn't even change anything,
including the way he talked.

102
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,340
He talked like John Wayne,

103
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,690
I'll go out there or you're
gonna fuck up these Russians.

104
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,430
He talked literally like John Wayne,

105
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,350
but he was dressed like
a for fucking hat on and

106
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,120
so dumb. Oh my God, you
got to see it. I'll see it.

107
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,170
When they made that movie where
they're like, this is it. This is it.

108
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,790
They didn't know everything sucked.
Everything did kind of suck for sure.

109
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,300
It's only a few like gone with the
wind, like, Whoa, what did they do?

110
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:49,250
There are a few movies, citizen
Kane like, whoa. You're like,

111
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:53,000
wow, this one doesn't
suck. I got lost there.

112
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,120
I up gang guess God.
I mean,

113
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,880
the likeness is a little lasing
a two weeks. Wow. Imagine,

114
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,150
look at that beard.

115
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:05,690
Who went from playing like a
fucking sheriff and some wild west,

116
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,160
wild west town to Gingiss Khan.
Hollywood was so whitewashed.

117
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,990
It really, really was. Well, they knew
back then, if they did a John Wayne movie,

118
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:18,850
they would sell a million tickets. You
know? That's really what the, what the,

119
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,710
the thing is. I mean, an
aspect of that still going on.
