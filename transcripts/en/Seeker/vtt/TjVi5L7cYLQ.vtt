00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.100
You guys, this is crazy, but scientists have
created a whole new kind of matter- Yeah,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.910
time crystals are here!

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.599
Hey there time bandits, it’s Trace for DNews.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.340
Physicists have created a new form of matter
called TIME CRYSTALS!

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.440
No, it’s not the time crystals you may have
seen on Rick and Morty.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.570
These time crystals have properties we haven’t
seen in other matter.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.939
Usually, matter is motionless at its resting
state and only has potential energy until

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.920
kinetic energy is introduced to it.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.989
For example, a ball at rest is chock-full
of ‘potential energy’, and when it’s

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.600
kicked, that energy is converted to ‘kinetic
energy’, the energy of motion.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.790
But time crystals actually move at their ‘resting
state’ or their ‘ground state’ — that’s

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.500
when atoms have the lowest amount of energy.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.290
They’re like a ball that is forever in motion.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.719
In other words, they are always unstable,
down to the atomic level.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.680
They are the first non-equilibrium matter
ever created!

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.989
Regular crystals are an arrangement of atoms
in repeated three dimensional patterns, called

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:59.989
a lattice.

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.390
The patterns are duplicated through space,
whereas time crystals duplicate their patterns

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.250
through space AND time.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.610
They are essentially 4 dimensional crystals!

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.890
The concept of time crystals was first theorized
by Nobel Prize winner Frank Wilczek in 2012.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.780
He surmised that there could be hypothetical
matter that could move periodically even while

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.180
in a ‘ground state’.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.350
In theory, the time crystals could move without
the application of energy because they would

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.020
be designed to be inherently unstable, breaking
the symmetry of time, resulting in atoms that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.590
are in perpetual motion.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.659
Once the theory of time crystals was out in
the ether, researchers focused on coming up

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.110
with methods to create this new matter that
could break time symmetry.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.670
A blueprint was created and posted online
in August 2016.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.210
The author called his paper, quote, "the bridge
between the theoretical idea and the experimental

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.210
implementation".

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.400
Two teams, one from University of Maryland
and one from Harvard, took the basic ‘blueprint’

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.549
of how to make time crystals and got to work.

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.829
Both teams were successful but used different
methods to achieve the same results.

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.879
The University of Maryland created their time
crystals with a line of 10 ytterbium (it-er-be-um)

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.879
ions.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.840
Within these ions, the spins of their electrons
were entangled.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.879
The researchers’ goal was to interrupt the
ions’ normal equilibrium.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:21.710
To do this, they used two lasers, one to flip
the ions and a second laser to create a magnetic

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.710
field.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.360
The first laser flipped ions over, causing
them to interact with other ions, making them

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.330
flip over, all within the magnetic field created
by the second laser.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.290
This process continued until all the ions
were oscillating, or spinning.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.040
This was considered normal behavior for a
regular crystal, but researchers noticed something

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.040
strange.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.620
As the lasers continued to nudge the ions,
they realized that the ions were now reacting

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.880
more frequently than they were being nudged.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.100
According to researcher Norman Yao, this is
like jiggling jello and having it move when

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.730
you weren’t poking it.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.660
Researchers had essentially broke the time
symmetry and created a new form of non-equilibrium

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.280
matter that continued moving at its ‘ground
state’!

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.280
Voila!

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.349
A time crystal!

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.909
Researchers at Harvard went about creating
their time crystal differently.

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.190
Instead of ytterbium ions, they used nitrogen
vacancy centers, which are certain impurities

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.220
found in diamonds.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.069
And instead of using lasers, Harvard researchers
used microwaves to cause the ions in the diamonds

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.740
to flip and oscillate.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.160
Different method, same result: time crystals.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.400
This new form of matter could lead to future
breakthroughs in quantum computing and understanding

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.599
the various forms matter can ultimately take.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.050
Researchers have also remarked that their
creation of time crystals is evidence that

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.159
time symmetry can be broken and that non-equilibrium
matter CAN exist.
