00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.820
In the last few videos, I showed
you amines, and, in

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.076
particular, it was ethylamine,
involved in Sn2 reactions.

00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:10.110
But what I want to show you in
this video, it doesn't always

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.080
have to be an Sn2 reaction.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.390
In fact, in this video, we'll
look at an Sn1 reaction.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.090
So let's say I had
some methylamine.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.220
So let's say it looks
like this.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.790
So this is our methyl group
bonded to a nitrogen, which is

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.542
bonded to two hydrogens,
just like that, and it

00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:29.710
has its lone pair.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.150
So this is methylamine
right there.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.970
And let's say it's in solution
with something

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.850
that looks like this.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.380
Let's say we have something
that looks like this.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.080
So then we have a bromo group.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.900
Now, there's a couple of
different ways that you can

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.040
name this, but maybe the
simplest way, you find the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.410
longest chain here.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.493
It has one, two, three carbons,
so that is a propane.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.670
And then on the two carbon,
regardless of whether you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.180
start counting from here or
there, so this is one, two,

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.720
three, on the two carbon, you
have a bromo group and you

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.910
have a methyl group
right there.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.520
So this would be 2-bromo.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.850
You want to write it in
alphabetical order.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.100
2-bromo-2-methylpropane.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.120
What we care about is what
would happen over here?

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.090
Now, over here, you have a
situation where you have a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.050
carbon right here attached
to the bromine.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.450
And if your brain is really in
Sn2 mode, you might say, hey,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.460
maybe these electrons attack
this carbon and then this

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.360
electron that's with the carbon
right now gets taken by

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.190
the bromine.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.310
But if you really think about
what are the conditions for an

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.550
Sn2, you'll probably remember
that this won't happen because

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.590
it's sterically hindered.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.460
You have these three
other carbons here.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.830
And actually, these are not just
carbons, these are CH3's.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.100
The hydrogens aren't
even drawn.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.040
But this is a CH3 here.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.930
This is a CH3 over here.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.750
This is a CH3.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.110
These things are going to block
the nucleophile's access

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.770
to this carbon, so you're
not going to see an

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.690
Sn2 reaction here.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.550
But what you can see is, because
this guy is a tertiary

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.960
carbon, he is bonded to three
other carbons, it would

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.180
actually be a fairly
stable carbocation.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.120
So what you could see in step
one of this reaction is just

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.890
the bromine leaves.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.730
So if you have just the bromine
leaves, then our

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.580
situation looks like this.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.800
You have a tertiary
carbocation.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.880
This electron leaves, so it
now has a positive charge

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.450
right over there.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.190
That's why it's a
carbocation now.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.210
And now the bromine has
taken an electron.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.550
It already had one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.530
valence electrons.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.070
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.580
And it just took one more
electron from that carbon.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.275
It now has a negative charge.

00:03:17.275 --> 00:03:19.570
It's now a bromide anion.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.670
But now that the bromine has
left, now the methylamine can

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.970
get involved.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.220
This would be methylamine
right over here.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.740
So now this, as we learned in
the previous video, has a

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.680
partial negative charge, has
these extra electrons, it will

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.165
be attracted to this
carbocation.

00:03:38.165 --> 00:03:41.640
So let me draw the
methylamine.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.610
So you have the nitrogen,
hydrogen, hydrogen bonded to a

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.960
methyl group right like that.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.410
And in an Sn1 reaction,
that's what this is.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.310
Remember, the rate-determining
step right here only involves

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.280
one of the reactants.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.190
That's where the number
one comes from.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.010
In an Sn1 reaction like this,
the nucleophile could attack

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.320
from either side.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.450
This no longer is a
tetrahedral shape.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.980
It's now a triangular planar
shape, so it could go in from

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.340
this direction or from
that direction.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.520
So, in this case, well,
I'm just going to

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.050
draw it in this direction.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:22.180
So this nucleophile can give
this electron right here to

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.640
the carbocation, in which case,
we will end up with

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.930
something that looks
like this.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.190
We have our nitrogen.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.580
It has bonded to two hydrogens
over there.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.460
It has a methyl group,
just like that.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.760
It has this electron
over here.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.630
Now, this magenta electron has
been given to this carbon over

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.270
there, and then that carbon is
bonded to three other carbons:

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.860
one, two, three.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.280
And so, just like that,
we have created--

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.040
oh, we have to remember.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.600
We've given away an electron
to this carbocation.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.930
The carbocation is
now neutral.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.025
It gained an electron.

00:04:59.025 --> 00:05:02.460
Let me write the the
carbon right there.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.240
But since the nitrogen gave away
an electron, it now has a

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.150
positive charge.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.200
So what will we call this
molecule right over here?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.950
Now, this is a little
bit tricky.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.720
So you have a methyl
group over here.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.830
Well, this is no longer amine.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.400
It's an ammonium because it
has this positive charge.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.320
We have four bonds
on the nitrogen.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.260
So we could call this
right here N-methyl.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.020
That tells us that the methyl
is bonded to the nitrogen.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.340
It's not bonded to the
other carbon chain.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.570
N-methyl.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.620
And then this right here, these
four carbons, one, two,

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.625
three, four, this you could view
as a tert-butyl group.

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:50.100
There's other ways to
name it, but that's

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.840
the most common one.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:06:01.220
So it's N-methyl-tert-butyl
ammonium.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.960
Remember, we have that positive
charge there.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.900
And as we saw in the previous
video, this isn't ammonium

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.660
right now, but you had some of
your original methylamine

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.910
floating around.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.730
If you have some of your
original methylamine floating

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.360
around, and this could in
theory, or it can in practice

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.910
even, nab away one of these
hydrogens, or at least the

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.680
proton part.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.430
So it gives its electron to that
hydrogen, and then the

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.620
hydrogen's electron gets taken
back by what was an ammonium.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.710
And then if you have
that-- and this is

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:39.770
a reversible reaction.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.060
It can go in either direction.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.370
This methylamine is now
methyl ammonium.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.850
So it now looks like this.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.430
It now has three hydrogens on
it because this guy bonded

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.400
with that hydrogen.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.220
It now has three hydrogens, so
this is methyl ammonium.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.460
And then this thing over here
will now look like this.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.720
It lost a hydrogen.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.330
So you have a methyl group
bonded to an N, bonded to an

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.530
H, which is then bonded
to a tert-butyl group.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.400
So now this has become,
as I just said,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.430
this is methyl ammonium.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.395
But this over here
is N-methyl.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.010
Once again, the N tells us
that this methyl group is

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.815
bonded to the nitrogen.

00:07:27.815 --> 00:07:33.700
N-methyl-tert-, and now instead
of calling it butyl

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.120
ammonium, and actually we didn't
have to have this dash

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.940
over here; this is
butyl ammonium.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:44.650
It's now butylamine, tert-butyl,
and then obviously

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.410
because we have that nitrogen
there, butylamine.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.950
Anyway, I just wanted to show
you that, that the mechanisms

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.420
or the reactions I showed in
the last video, they're not

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.350
the only type of things
that can occur.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.790
You can also have Sn1.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:08:02.090
And, in general, it can
act as a weak base.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.030
It's definitely not
a strong base.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.750
But it's the most basic of all
of the neutral functional

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.350
groups, which I've said
over and over again.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.010
So there's many different
types of reactions.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.350
I've just tried to give
you a sample of a few.
