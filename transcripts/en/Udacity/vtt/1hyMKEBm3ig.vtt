00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.050
Enough talk,
let's see this app in action.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.431
I'll open up the Pirate Fleet xCode
project, and then I'll launch the app.

00:00:07.431 --> 00:00:10.913
And as soon as the game launches, we
begin in the guessing phase as opposed

00:00:10.913 --> 00:00:13.663
to when we actually get to place
our ships in our minds, and

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:15.540
that's something you'll do in code.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.620
Now we've kept the UI pretty simple.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.974
Here at the top,
we have the opponents grid.

00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:24.312
And at the bottom we have our grid with
our ships in our minds that have already

00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:25.890
been placed.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.202
Now as I start guessing, I want you
to think about what objects and

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:31.562
relationships may exist
between the scenes.

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:34.765
So I'm going to start guessing, and
I have a little strategy in mind.

00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:36.646
I'm going to try to
guess every two spaces,

00:00:36.646 --> 00:00:40.300
because I feel like that will give me
a pretty good shot at hitting a ship.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.528
Being that smallest ship's sized two.

00:00:43.528 --> 00:00:45.090
So I hit a mine.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.970
Hopefully I won't fall
too far behind here.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.160
Got one ship.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.922
And it looks like they're doing some
work on my big ships right now.

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:58.772
This, there we go.

00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:01.896
All right I got the two
big ships out of the way.

00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:05.171
Ooh, there we go.

00:01:05.171 --> 00:01:08.503
Uh-oh, I think they might
all be lined up here.

00:01:08.503 --> 00:01:12.007
If I have enough time,
I may be able to get all of them.

00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:13.219
There we go!
