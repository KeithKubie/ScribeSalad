00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.130
Electric eels have fascinated scientists and
the public for hundreds of years.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.720
Even Charles Darwin was puzzled by them.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.660
What is the shocking secret behind an electric
eel’s weapon?

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.279
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.779
Electric eels are some of the most shocking….

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.830
okay sorry had to do that once… organisms
on this planet.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.339
They can harness the power of electricity
to hunt.

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.601
But electric eels aren’t eels at all, they’re
actually a type of knife fish found in the

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:30.609
Amazon River Basin in South America.

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.480
They’re just one type of dozens of fish
that use electrical fields as sort of extrasensory

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.480
perception.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.760
But they’re the only ones with a charge
strong enough to kill.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.590
Basically electric eels and other fish have
modified muscle cells that stack on top of

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.590
each other.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.199
They work kind of like batteries.

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.420
Okay when I say kind of, I mean Alessandro
Volta actually modeled batteries after electric

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.420
eels!

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.960
Typically an eel can have as many as 6,000
of these cells called electrocytes.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.910
These stacks of cells are negatively charged
inside and their outsides are positively charged,

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.640
each cells has the potential of .08 volts.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.450
Not a lot, and considering the charges alternate,
no current flows.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.140
But as soon as the eel is triggered by spotting
a potential prey, these cells open up and

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.530
an influx of sodium ions changes the polarity,
so now the stacks have a positive and negative

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.610
end which creates an electric current.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.630
With all the cells stacked together, in some
species of fish, the charge can reach as many

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.160
as 600 volts of electricity.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.020
While that might sound like a lot, it’s
not enough to kill a man, because the shocks

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.920
are delivered very quickly in a matter of
milliseconds.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.650
but it's certainly enough electricity to shock
a small fish.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.979
But the coolest thing about electric eels
special shocking power, it’s not just for

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.220
killing prey.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.930
Their shocks have a stealth mode, they have
a low voltage version that helps them hunt.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.659
These electric shocks act an awful lot like
sonar bats use.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.280
They can send them out as feelers, sensing
if any fish are lurking near by.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.140
But even their big shocks have a dual function.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.360
One study published in the journal Nature
Communications found it’s for hunting too.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.700
The lead author of the study told National
Geographic that “The eel can use its electric

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.340
attack simultaneously as a weapon and a sensory
system, it’s sort of a science-fiction-like

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.340
ability.”

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.080
Once they hone in on a prey they have a “remote
control” mode.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.140
They send out two closely spaced high-voltage
discharges, called doublets which makes the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.860
prey’s body contract involuntarily.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.810
This movement sends ripples through the water.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.410
It lets the eel know it’s an alive thing
and possibly prey.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.450
It can even make the fish “freeze”.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.530
It shocks their neurological system so the
fish can’t move.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.190
While ideal for catching smaller prey, sometimes
the shock isn’t enough for catching larger

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.190
fish.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.190
So an eel has to amp up their power.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.810
A recent study published in the journal Current
Biology found that eels boost their electric

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.960
zap by curling into a circle.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.210
This brings the positively charged end of
their body, their head, with the negatively

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.510
charged tail area.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.130
By bringing the two points closer together,
the fish can double their shock.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.570
While their shock isn’t enough to kill a
person, it’s still pretty painful.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.550
Those who’ve experienced it say it’s a
lot like running into an electric fence.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.620
So I wouldn’t exactly try fishing for one
anytime soon.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.030
As close as I’d like to get is Twitter.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.080
Miguel Wattson is an electric eel at the Tennessee
Aquarium sends a tweet whenever he sends out

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.770
zap! check him out @EelectricMiguel

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.240
But there are a ton of other animals I wouldn’t
touch with a ten foot pole.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.580
Electric eels and sharks often get a bad reputation
for being dangerous and deadly, but there

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.220
are some freshwater animals you should be
way more terrified of.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.480
Julian and Natalia Reagan have the scoop on
four Freshwater Animals More Terrifying Than

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:48.530
Sharks in this episode right here.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.730
Like the shockingly great shirt I have on?

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.930
Get one of your very own!
