00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:09.706
&gt;&gt;Aukeem Ballard: Today we'll be having
some conversations that are going

00:00:09.706 --> 00:00:11.566
to take some courage for
us to participate in.

00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:15.916
&gt;&gt;Student: Some kids get out of school,
go home, just to strictly do work.

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.556
I don't have the same privileges,
because I need to go help my parents.

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:21.636
Having this responsibility is kind
of harder on me just because I have

00:00:21.636 --> 00:00:24.606
to worry about grades and getting
into college and going to work just

00:00:24.606 --> 00:00:25.816
to actually help my parents out.

00:00:25.816 --> 00:00:27.966
&gt;&gt;Aukeem Ballard: We have
put a stake in the ground

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.176
around building the whole student.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:33.486
Once a week students go through
a curriculum meant to build

00:00:33.486 --> 00:00:37.416
out their capacity for emotional
intelligence, habits of success,

00:00:37.416 --> 00:00:39.116
community, and building culture.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:43.706
Once we have those tools we are better
equipped to navigate the next part

00:00:43.706 --> 00:00:44.976
of our journey as well as right now.

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:54.116
&gt;&gt;Penelope Pak McMillen:
Our school's mission is

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:58.726
to prepare a diverse student population
for success in a four-year university,

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:03.246
but it isn't just about making sure
that our kids have content knowledge,

00:01:03.326 --> 00:01:05.286
that they can critically think.

00:01:05.896 --> 00:01:10.746
To truly be a thoughtful, contributing
member of society you need to be able

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:15.696
to have emotional intelligence, to
understand people who are different

00:01:15.696 --> 00:01:17.666
from you, to have a wide perspective.

00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:19.586
&gt;&gt;Aukeem Ballard: What is your story?

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:24.356
What are stories that
others have told about you?

00:01:25.386 --> 00:01:27.526
&gt;&gt;I teach "Habits, Community, Culture".

00:01:27.526 --> 00:01:27.736
&gt;&gt;All right.

00:01:27.736 --> 00:01:28.396
What did we discuss?

00:01:29.406 --> 00:01:35.816
&gt;&gt;This is essentially a course that
seeks to grow students' capacity to own,

00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:39.906
understand, articulate, and practice
emotional intelligence skills,

00:01:40.176 --> 00:01:44.336
critical habits of success, as
well as build a thriving community.

00:01:44.806 --> 00:01:46.946
&gt;&gt;Aukeem Ballard: We're going
to do mindfulness practice.

00:01:46.946 --> 00:01:49.036
You're going to want your
feet shoulder-width apart.

00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:50.946
It's going to start with breathing
exercise, but then it's going to go

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:53.566
into a little bit of, like,
mindful movement practice.

00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:54.126
Eyes closed.

00:01:54.126 --> 00:01:56.826
&gt;&gt;Kiran: We usually open
up the class with a five

00:01:56.826 --> 00:01:58.626
to ten-minute exercise in mindfulness.

00:01:59.016 --> 00:02:00.316
&gt;&gt;Aukeem Ballard: The
mindfulness practice is more

00:02:00.316 --> 00:02:03.126
of the concrete practicing of some
of the emotional intelligence skills.

00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:04.116
&gt;&gt;Take a deep breath in.

00:02:04.116 --> 00:02:05.736
&gt;&gt;Especially self-awareness
and self-management.

00:02:06.486 --> 00:02:06.826
&gt;&gt;And out.

00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:10.776
You're just going to focus on your
breath and trying to hold the focus.

00:02:11.046 --> 00:02:15.176
&gt;&gt;It's more about giving the students
space and opportunity to kind of quiet

00:02:15.246 --> 00:02:19.076
down for themselves and reflect
on where they're at with things.

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:23.256
&gt;&gt;Whatever you're feeling simply
acknowledge it without judgement.

00:02:23.706 --> 00:02:26.106
&gt;&gt;Kiran: The ability to step back
from our day-to-day rush and, like,

00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:29.286
really reflect into ourselves
about how were we feeling,

00:02:29.286 --> 00:02:30.726
are we okay with how we're doing?

00:02:31.196 --> 00:02:34.376
&gt;&gt;Because we've given time to this,
students come in and say, "Mr. B,

00:02:34.436 --> 00:02:35.446
tell me we're doing mindfulness,

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:38.516
because I got some stuff
I need to think through."

00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:41.416
&gt;&gt;That's the goal: You can
recognize and manage your emotions!

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:44.996
&gt;&gt;We're going to do some group in small
works and really hear people's stories

00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:46.966
and give space for their stories.

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:51.846
Make sure your chairs are
actually in a circle as long

00:02:51.846 --> 00:02:53.246
as everyone is facing everyone.

00:02:53.496 --> 00:02:55.626
&gt;&gt;Aukeem Ballard: Those small
group conversations that we have,

00:02:55.726 --> 00:02:58.596
part of the background intent is
strengthening the empathy ability

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:00.656
because one of the emotional
intelligence skills is being able

00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:02.726
to recognize the emotions
of others in the room.

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:06.056
&gt;&gt;Geoffrey: When I go into a store a
person told me to empty out my backpack,

00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:07.656
because he thought I stole something.

00:03:07.656 --> 00:03:09.696
But I didn't have anything at all.

00:03:10.326 --> 00:03:15.166
And then I had a police stop
just asking me what am I doing.

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:17.296
I would just be like, "I'm
just coming back from school."

00:03:17.986 --> 00:03:19.826
And it's kind of hard to see how, like,

00:03:19.826 --> 00:03:24.616
even when someone's dressed differently
how, like, you can get judged on that,

00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:26.636
even though you try to do your best.

00:03:26.716 --> 00:03:27.856
You know?

00:03:28.426 --> 00:03:31.596
&gt;&gt;Geoffrey: It's important to talk
about, you know, the struggles in life,

00:03:31.796 --> 00:03:35.676
because it clears the mind and then you
feel like you're ready to start again.

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:38.686
&gt;&gt;Kiran: You really do need a lot of
emotional intelligence for that class,

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:41.186
because these are all, like, a
lot of personal stories coming

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:42.506
out about people's identities.

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:47.566
Because of the social and emotional
awareness that we are taught in HCC,

00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:51.146
I'm able to develop stronger
relationships with my peers at Summit.

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:54.166
&gt;&gt;Aukeem Ballard: Now stand in a
circle while we do our brief shout-out.

00:03:54.446 --> 00:03:56.446
It's appreciation, apology, or aha.

00:03:56.556 --> 00:04:01.166
My aha is that a lot of folks in
here have pieces to their story

00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:04.976
that they may think aren't important
parts, but actually important parts.

00:04:05.136 --> 00:04:07.156
&gt;&gt;We usually have some
sort of closing activity

00:04:07.156 --> 00:04:11.076
and it really plays a special role
when you've gone through something

00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:14.386
that is emotionally difficult
for some people in the room.

00:04:15.206 --> 00:04:16.286
&gt;&gt;So, can we get a few people

00:04:16.286 --> 00:04:18.746
to shout-out an appreciation,
apology, or aha?

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:20.346
&gt;&gt;Student: I'd like to appreciate Brenda

00:04:20.346 --> 00:04:23.616
for facilitating the
conversation in our small group.

00:04:25.446 --> 00:04:26.656
&gt;&gt;Student: I'd like to thank everyone

00:04:26.736 --> 00:04:29.526
for taking this class
seriously for all the stories.

00:04:30.406 --> 00:04:33.346
&gt;&gt;Carlos: I apologize
for having my headphones

00:04:33.346 --> 00:04:35.136
in half of the time to everyone.

00:04:35.506 --> 00:04:36.326
&gt;&gt;Aukeem Ballard: Thanks
a lot of that, Carlos.

00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:36.866
That means a lot.

00:04:38.616 --> 00:04:39.896
&gt;&gt;Those types of appreciations

00:04:39.896 --> 00:04:42.846
or community recognitions can go
a long way to build the bonds.

00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:47.266
&gt;&gt;Janet: We all are striving to,
like, become good students and, like,

00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:49.806
just do well in our community.

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:51.746
If you're able to understand
people at a younger age,

00:04:51.746 --> 00:04:53.726
you could probably work
better with them as adults.

00:04:53.866 --> 00:04:56.616
That kind of just changes how
the future generations will be.

00:04:56.616 --> 00:05:00.056
Like, people can be more accepting,
more helpful towards each other.

00:05:00.146 --> 00:05:02.196
&gt;&gt;Aukeem Ballard: They are
going to the outside world,

00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:06.746
which I have no control over, and I
want to give them every chance possible

00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:10.976
to soar and swim and play around
in the pool if they want to.
