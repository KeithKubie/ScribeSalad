00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.250
Welcome back.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.130
We're now starting section
eight on page 547.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.430
OK.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.540
And I think we're in the third
test. So problem number one,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.200
if e is a set of even numbers--
even integers,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.970
sorry-- e is a set of even
integers, p is a set of

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.150
positive integers, and f is a
set of integers less than 5,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.630
which of the following
integers will be

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.960
in all three sets?

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.710
So we're looking for something
that meets all the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.190
constraints.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:37.960
So it has to be even, it has to
be positive, and it has to

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.140
be less than 5.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.660
OK, so choice A is 6.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.900
6 is not less than 5.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.070
Choice B is 4.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.840
4 is even, 4 is positive,
4 is less than 5.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.520
So the answer is B.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.420
And the other choices don't
work because, C, 1 is odd.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.490
D, 0 is not positive.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.700
And the last choice,
E, negative 2.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.820
Well, that's not positive
either.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.720
Problem number two.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.940
So our answer was B.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.290
Choice B was 4.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.760
Problem number two.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.710
If 8 plus the square root
of k is equal to 15,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.490
then what does k equal?

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.110
Well, subtract 8 from both
sides, and you get square root

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.500
of k is equal to 7.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.310
Square both sides,
k is equal to 49.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.860
Next problem.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.775
Problem number three.

00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:42.150
Let's see If I can
clear image.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.020
Problem number three.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.190
In a poll, 35 people
were in favor of

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.680
building a new library.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.290
So 35, yes, they want it.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.850
14, against it.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.750
14 said no.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.590
And 1 person doesn't know.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.550
1 person just has no opinion.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:10.220
What fraction of those polled
were in favor of building a

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.480
new library.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.240
So the people that were
in favor were 35.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.970
And the fraction of the total
people polled-- so the total

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.600
people polled was 35 plus
14 plus 1, right?

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.170
And what is this?

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.910
That's 50.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.170
So that's equal to 35 over 50.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.670
And 35 over 50, if we divide
the top and bottom

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.830
by 7, you get 7/10.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.970
So the answer is A.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.710
7/10 were in favor
of the library.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.880
Problem number four.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.550
We've got a kind of crazy
looking figure here.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.200
You have a line that goes
something like this, and it

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.610
goes like that and then it
goes like this and looks

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.530
something like that.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.080
Close enough.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.100
And what's going on here?

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.770
So they tell us that
this angle is 70.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.850
That's 70.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.330
This is 30.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.440
They say that this is
t and this is u.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.810
You probably can't read
that but you see

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.890
it in your own book.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.360
In the figure above, what is
the value of t plus u?

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.620
This is the angle game again.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.350
Let's see what angles
we can figure out.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.650
So, this is 70, this is 30.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.220
So this angle right here
plus 70, plus 30 has

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.000
to equal 180, right?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.510
This angle plus 70, plus 30.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.430
70 plus 30 is 100.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.350
So this is 80 degrees
right here.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.920
If this is 80 degrees,
this is the

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.320
opposite angle to 80 degrees.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.915
So that's going to also
be 80 degrees.

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:44.410
We learned that in
geometry class.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.770
And so if this is 80 degrees--
first of all, what do all of

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.420
these angles combined equal? t
plus u, plus 80 are all on the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.260
same triangle.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.980
So they have to add up to 180.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.790
So we know that t plus u has
to be 100 degrees, and

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.520
that's choice C.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.360
Next problem.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.550
[? Invert. ?]

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.110
OK, problem number five.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.370
Oh, there's a big graph.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.020
According to the graph above,
between which two consecutive

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.540
years was the greatest change
in the price of coffee?

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.490
Oh, I think I'm going to
have to draw this.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.390
Just so that you see what
I see, hopefully.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.930
OK, and then let me just
write the years.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.880
So this is, it goes
'81 through '86.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:38.035
So '81, '82, '83,
'84, '85, '86.

00:04:38.035 --> 00:04:47.725
Let's see, in 1981-- so let's
see, we have $3.00, $3.75, we

00:04:47.725 --> 00:05:01.470
have $4.00, $4.25,
$4.50, $4.75.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.670
In 1981 it cost $3.75.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.520
It's going to take me a little
time to draw this whole thing.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.240
In 1982 it was at $3.50.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.040
Oops, that's $3.50 down
here, not $3.00.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.130
Let me write that,
that's $3.50.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.280
Back to what I was doing.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:28.612
In 1983 it went to $4.25.

00:05:28.612 --> 00:05:35.960
In 1984 it went all
the way to $4.75.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.070
In 1985 it was at $3.75 again.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.130
That looks something
like that.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.130
And then 1986 goes to $4.50.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.640
1986, $4.50.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.030
OK, and what are
they asking us?

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.690
According to the graph above,
between which two consecutive

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.710
years was the greatest change
in the price of coffee?

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.970
Well, let's figure that out.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.950
So here, the change is $0.25.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.810
Here, the change, going from
this year to this year, is--

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.960
let's see, $0.25,
$0.50, $0.75.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.280
That's a good contender
right there.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.410
$0.75.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:22.540
Going from here to here we
only had a $0.50 change.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.850
Then we went from
$4.75 to $3.50.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.960
So this is a pretty big
change, actually.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.270
This looks like our winner.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.010
That's from $4.75 to
actually $3.75, so

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.780
this is a $1.00 change.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.060
And then we went from $3.75 to
$4.50, so we had a $0.75

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.820
change again.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:44.840
So the biggest change happened
from 1984 to 1985, choice D.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.630
All that work for a fairly
straightforward problem.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:49.880
Next problem.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.000
Problem number six.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.630
More drawing for me.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.050
OK.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.300
let's see, more drawing.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.140
Got to be focused,
Sal, focused.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.730
This is negative 1, this
is negative 2, this

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.520
is 1, this is 2.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.810
1 and 2.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.850
And what does this
graph look like?

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:29.690
Let's see, we go from here to
here, it looks like, and then

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:37.020
we stay flat here, and then we
go like this, and then we go

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.570
flat again.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:39.510
And what are they asking?

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.510
The graph of y equals g of x.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.080
So this is y is equal
to g of x.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.230
Shown above.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:53.310
If g of k is equal to 1, which
of the following is a possible

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:53.990
value of k?

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.490
So g of k is equal to 1.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.710
So when does this
graph equal 1?

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.435
Well, this graph equals 1--
add a different color-- it

00:08:01.435 --> 00:08:04.040
equals 1 here-- oh,
it equals 1 here.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.960
It equals 1 this entire
period, right?

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.430
All of these values are where
g of x is equal to 1.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.960
So what could be the
values of k?

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.550
Well, the values of k could
be anywhere between

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.840
negative 1 and 0.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.030
All of those could be values
of k, anywhere from here.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:26.290
Because at all of these values,
g of k is equal to 1.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:26.750
So let's see.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:27.810
They have choices.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.560
Minus 1.5 is here.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.880
No, that's over there.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.080
Minus 0.5 is right here.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.630
And g of minus 0.5 is right
here, so that's 1. g of minus

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.700
0.5 is equal to 1.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.690
So that looks pretty good.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.610
So that is our answer.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.950
Choice B.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.910
Let's see if I can squeeze
in problem number seven.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.420
I think that would be the most
videos I've ever done-- most

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.350
problems in 10 minutes.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:02.580
If a, b and c are different
positive integers, and 2 to

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:09.430
the a, times 2 to the b, times
2 to the c, is equal to 64,

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:14.230
then they want to know, what is
2 to the a, plus 2 to the

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.620
b, plus 2 to the c?

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.410
Fascinating.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.360
Well, what do we know about
exponent rules?

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:26.000
2 to the a, times 2 to the b,
times 2 to the c, that's 2 to

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.575
the a, plus b, plus c, right?

00:09:32.575 --> 00:09:35.100
2 to the what power is 64?

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.220
2 to the sixth power, right?

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.540
2 to the sixth power is 64.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.990
Actually, I'm going to
run out of time.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.180
So I'm going to do this
in the next video.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.580
I only have 15 seconds left.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.830
See you soon.
