00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 
my dad was an engineer and so there was

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170
my dad was an engineer and so there was
 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.970
my dad was an engineer and so there was
some interest in science my own interest

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980
some interest in science my own interest
 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.919
some interest in science my own interest
developed when I was very young I had a

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929
developed when I was very young I had a
 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.400
developed when I was very young I had a
toy microscope and I was fascinated with

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410
toy microscope and I was fascinated with
 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.799
toy microscope and I was fascinated with
life forms that I could see in pond scum

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809
life forms that I could see in pond scum
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.310
life forms that I could see in pond scum
and I saved up my money and i bought a

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320
and I saved up my money and i bought a
 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.240
and I saved up my money and i bought a
professional microscope when I was a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250
professional microscope when I was a
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.340
professional microscope when I was a
young teenager and I've actually just

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350
young teenager and I've actually just
 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.259
young teenager and I've actually just
today donated that microscope to the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269
today donated that microscope to the
 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.050
today donated that microscope to the
nobel museum so it's really very

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060
nobel museum so it's really very
 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.960
nobel museum so it's really very
important in my early development of an

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970
important in my early development of an
 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.240
important in my early development of an
interest in microbiology and that just

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250
interest in microbiology and that just
 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.910
interest in microbiology and that just
sort of naturally evolved and when i got

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
sort of naturally evolved and when i got
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.510
sort of naturally evolved and when i got
to university I continued to study

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520
to university I continued to study
 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.280
to university I continued to study
viruses and microorganisms and that

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
viruses and microorganisms and that
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.670
viruses and microorganisms and that
interest has continued to this day
