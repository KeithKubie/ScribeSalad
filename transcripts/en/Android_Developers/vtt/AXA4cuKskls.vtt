Hello.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.980
My name is Reto Meier, and
welcome to This Week in

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.750
Android Development, on Monday,
September 16, 2013.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.230
Last week, the Android Design
in Action team focused their

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.340
laser-like attention
on the UX issues we

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.910
encounter most often.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.710
And I was back for the next
chapter of my DevBytes series

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.280
on efficient data transfers.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.190
This time, looking at ways
to batch and bundle your

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.210
transfers using sync adapters.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.640
Our favorite intern was back
to teach us about ListView

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.250
Cell Insertion Animations.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.190
And for mobile developers of a
slightly different stripe,

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.480
Todd Kerpelman offered an
introduction to using Google

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.310
Play game services on iOS.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.570
This week, join Wolff and
Joanna as they talk you

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.870
through the development of NFC
Hunt, as featured this year at

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.780
Google I/O. And I'll be back
again for another efficient

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.970
data transfers DevByte, this
time looking at how to

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.140
eliminate polling and refresh
problems with

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.800
Google Cloud messaging.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.950
We've also got another animation
DevByte, looking at

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.930
how to implement a
folding layout.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.800
And a few designers based in
New York City join Nick and

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.250
Roman at the New York Android
Developers MeetUp on the 20th.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.230
In other in-person action, this
year's season of DevFests

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.830
has officially kicked off.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.500
So check the site for details of
Google Developer Group led

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.330
DevFests near you.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.120
That's all for This Week
in Android Development.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.920
Be sure to check out
this week's bytes.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.690
I'm Reto Meier, and I thought
I found the connector, it's

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.940
just a reflector.
