Hello everyone.

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.780
Welcome to another
Authors at Google talk.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.050
Today we have Nick Offerman
to talk about his book

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.632
"Paddle Your Own Canoe."

00:00:06.632 --> 00:00:08.340
He's going to start
off with a few songs,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.640
and then we're going
to discuss the book

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.896
and open it up to questions.

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:19.390
NICK OFFERMAN: Thank you.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.623
Good afternoon, Google.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.890
NICK OFFERMAN: I'll go ahead
and just whip out a couple songs

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.772
to get us in a mirthful
mood, and then we'll

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:41.105
get into the religious material.

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:44.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.110
NICK OFFERMAN: My wife
turned 50 a few years ago,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.260
and she asked me for a
rainbow for her birthday.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.410
And I said, thank you honey.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.410
That should be easy.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.740
And I made a few calls.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.287
NBC was no help whatsoever.

00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:04.580
And then I realized I could
make a rainbow out of art.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.650
So this is the
first song I wrote.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.650
And my friend CornMo.com
helped me set it to chords.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.525
And he's much more
entertaining than I am.

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:19.420
Please avail yourself
of his talents.

[MUSIC - NICK OFFERMAN,
"THE RAINBOW SONG"]

00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:17.480
NICK OFFERMAN: I posed
for that font in 1996.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.924
And I've been in
the ocean since.

00:04:20.924 --> 00:04:24.031
I have two big-screen
TVs, both with shots

00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:30.818
of all of you in case I need
some perspective, apparently.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:43.610
Looking at you this way is
too daunting, so-- what else

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.740
do I do?

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.000
My friend Corn Mo,
actually, suggested to me

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.570
that I write an album of songs,
all with woodworking themes.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:00.840
And we laughed, quaffed our
seventh beer at McSorley's Pub.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.690
And then I said, wait a second.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.860
I like the sound of that.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.190
And so this is the first song
from that forthcoming album.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.780
It's very much in progress,
but this is just a taste.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.056
Thank you to Kristie for
loaning me her guitar.

00:05:34.056 --> 00:05:37.437
Mine arrived broken.

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:38.886

[MUSIC_-_NICK_OFFERMAN]

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.810
NICK OFFERMAN: My final
offering for today's lunchtime

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.290
is the final song and tip
from my touring humorist

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.890
show, "American Ham."

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:28.360
It's also the title of my
book, "Paddle Your Own Canoe."

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.850
If you can't find a piece
of philosophy in this,

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.330
then I suggest you think again.

00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:42.750
There's more.

[MUSIC_-_NICK_OFFERMAN]

00:10:27.658 --> 00:10:29.770
INTERVIEWER: So
welcome to Google.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:33.080
Thanks for indulging us with
song and a little bit of dance

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.580
as well.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.538
NICK OFFERMAN: Thank you
for having me, Google.

00:10:35.538 --> 00:10:38.930
And I would like to also say
thank you to the local chef

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:44.870
Bill Billenstein for filling
my gullet with delicious meats

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.810
and starches.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.380
INTERVIEWER: Glad
you enjoyed it.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.950
So I have actually a question.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.330
The name of the book is
"Paddle Your Own Canoe,"

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.925
but this is actually a canoe
that's you've built yourself.

00:10:55.925 --> 00:10:57.175
NICK OFFERMAN: It is, in fact.

00:11:00.236 --> 00:11:01.042
Was that--

00:11:01.042 --> 00:11:03.000
INTERVIEWER: That was a
leading question, yeah.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.790
NICK OFFERMAN:
Grammatically speaking.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.730
Would you like to hear
a little bit about it?

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.585
INTERVIEWER: Please.

00:11:10.585 --> 00:11:12.330
NICK OFFERMAN: Her
name is Huckleberry.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.560
My wife was doing a Broadway
show some years ago,

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.730
and we don't live apart
for more than two weeks.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.390
That's a rule.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.810
Actors that work a lot,
which we're lucky enough

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:30.330
to be sometimes, often
have their relationships

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.600
suffer because they
go to play Frodo

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.530
Baggins in New
Zealand for 18 months.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.550
Not naming any names.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.870
What I'm saying is I turned
down the role of Frodo Baggins

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.897
to preserve my marriage.

00:11:46.897 --> 00:11:47.980
I made the right decision.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.750
I went with Megan to
live in New York, which

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.070
I was very excited to do.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.860
And I had been looking
for an opportunity

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.475
to build my first canoe.

00:12:02.475 --> 00:12:04.240
So I took a bag
of tools with me,

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.420
and I built it in
Red Hook, Brooklyn.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.200
And it was one of the greatest
things I've ever gotten to do.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.509
I highly recommend it.

00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:16.800
Although if you're going to
do it in this neighborhood,

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.260
I'd go with an ocean kayak.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.490
LA is not a great
canoeing community.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:24.530
I learned the hard way.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.607
INTERVIEWER: Oh, I see.

00:12:25.607 --> 00:12:27.940
Well, they're opening up the
LA river, supposedly, for--

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.250
NICK OFFERMAN: They
are, and it's neat.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.770
There's a cool
section to kayak on.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:39.210
Some of it looks very much like
where Danny Zuko raced Greased

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:44.476
Lightnin' down the sides of
the LA river, which is badass.

00:12:44.476 --> 00:12:46.119
INTERVIEWER: Awesome.

00:12:46.119 --> 00:12:47.660
NICK OFFERMAN: Great
seeing you guys.

00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:53.520
INTERVIEWER: So you were
going to read a couple

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.520
sections from your book.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.590
We don't have a lot of time,
so I figure, you can do that.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.400
And then we can basically
open up the questions

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.205
from the audience

00:13:01.205 --> 00:13:03.250
NICK OFFERMAN: OK.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.300
The paddle, as well, is
my best paddle so far.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.100
It's Alaskan yellow cedar,
to answer your question,

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:17.990
with accents of cherry inlaid
into the handle and blade tip.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.010
And there's some
pretty bitchin' carving

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.270
going on in that paddle.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.200
Paddles are really
fun to make, actually.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.866
And if you want to
get into woodworking,

00:13:26.866 --> 00:13:31.170
I recommend a paddle
because it only

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:36.260
takes one piece of wood
and some hand tools.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.260
It's a great introduction
to hand tools.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:48.970
Moving onto my prepared
remarks, the first little piece

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:54.040
is a quick anecdote about a
waiting room not far from here.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.410
It's in Santa Monica.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.990
And, gosh, I guess it
was about 15 years ago.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:06.710
I was just out of high school,
and I was auditioning--

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:11.210
I was new in town-- when you're
trying to get arrested here,

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:16.020
you try and get kick-ass
jobs and auditions,

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.750
but you also go to
commercial auditions.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.850
You go to any bullshit
that will pay you

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:24.410
$1, because you're broke.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.315
So I was going to all
these commercial auditions.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.690
If you guys know anybody that
are good with the internet

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.730
and stuff-- I've
never seen this again,

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.140
but there's a commercial
that I did for a steakhouse.

00:14:43.092 --> 00:14:44.050
The fuck was it called?

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.175
It was in the southeast.

00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:49.210
I don't remember the name of
the steakhouse, and I won't.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.620
So I did a couple
commercial spots.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.290
If you can find that, it would
probably be funny to look at.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:59.530
I escaped from jail.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.910
And I was conflicted
going to these auditions.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.990
I'm a classically
trained theater actor.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.630
At the time, I was incredibly
snotty about myself.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:12.000
I performed works
of theater, like, I

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.270
memorized two
hours of literature

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.780
and then presented
dramatically on stage.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.910
And then you're
sitting in a room

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.140
with a bunch of guys
that are like, all right.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.340
You chew a piece of
gum and it tastes bad,

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.774
so you make a funny face.

00:15:25.774 --> 00:15:26.565
And that's the job.

00:15:26.565 --> 00:15:31.350
And you're just like-- Jesus
Christ, this is demoralizing.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.900
So I had been in
town for about a

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.030
year when I found myself
auditioning for a Budweiser

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:38.320
spot.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.360
I hauled my ass out
to Santa Monica.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.600
Same old waiting room,
full of maybe 60 guys.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.660
It's a big square room, and
each wall has a bench along it,

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.680
so it's a big square of guys.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:54.540
Mostly beer-loving, baseball
fan-looking guys, so fat guys.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.180
The schtick was, you're
in the bleachers,

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.840
holding at a baseball game.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.230
And you hear the sound of a
home run crack off the bat.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:08.967
The crowd noise builds, and
you're holding two huge beers.

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:10.550
You probably remember
this commercial.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.720
And you don't want to
set either one down

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.680
because Budweiser
is so delicious,

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.480
or because ballpark
beers are so expensive.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.600
So you want to track this whole
thing until the home run hits

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.250
you on the forehead, of course.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:26.190
And you make a hilarious
face, and then you fall over.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.260
So the salient question was,
who makes the funny face

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.120
of getting hit on the head
with a home run ball the best?

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.340
The Bud spot also
contained the role

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.760
of a little old peanut
vendor, so there

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.020
was a motley throng of
hedonist looking guys,

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.180
the beer drinkers,
together with a bunch

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.130
of assorted little old men.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:49.740
I was looking around, silently
calculating the carpenter wages

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.460
I was not earning,
and I realized

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.330
that sitting next to me was
Donald Gibb, the guy who

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.390
played Ogre in
"Revenge of the Nerds."

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.930
I was the appropriate age
for "Revenge of the Nerds"

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.950
to have been a hugely
beloved movie for me.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.054
My wife passed on that
movie, by the way,

00:17:07.054 --> 00:17:08.720
which, something we've
had to work past.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.609
But it was a seminal film.

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:18.810
I was the right audience
for "Revenge of the Nerds."

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:19.480
A classic.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.849
He was also in the movie "Blood
Sport," for mercy's sake.

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:26.500
This guy-- I remember
this guy, "Nerds!"

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.450
He was a hero to me and every
other teenager in the '80s,

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.430
and now he's sitting next to
me at this commercial audition?

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.410
I thought, good God.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:37.510
You can be this minor movie
star and do a ton of TV roles,

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.760
and then 10 years later
you're sitting next to me

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.270
at a fucking Budweiser spot.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.650
I was truly reeling.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.960
So I got up and walked around
the room to clear my head.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.960
Across the room, I
passed another guy

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.300
whose face rang a bell.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.920
And I looked back,
and I'll be goddamned

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.940
if it wasn't fucking Carmine
from "Laverne and Shirley."

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.680
I surreptitiously looked at
the head shot in his hand.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:05.140
And at the bottom, sure enough,
it read, Eddie "Carmine" Mecca.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.302
I was dumbstruck, thinking,
you've got to be kidding me.

00:18:08.302 --> 00:18:10.010
It might as well have
been John Schneider

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.200
from "The Dukes of
Hazzard," or Burt Reynolds.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.630
You can be fucking
Carmine and now you're

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.530
at this Budweiser spot?

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.030
Just then, Carmine
started up a conversation

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.010
with the little old
man next to him.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.480
"Hey, you're Joey such and such.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.270
You were in "Guys and Dolls"
and "Singing in the Rain."

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.470
Joey was apparently
an old song and dance

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:30.230
man, with whom Carmine
was very impressed.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.775
In a grinning reply, the man
said, "Ah, come on, Eddie.

00:18:32.775 --> 00:18:33.710
You saw that shit?

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:35.666
Fuhgettaboutit."

00:18:35.666 --> 00:18:40.000
Fate, that fickle
bitch, was grabbing

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.670
me oh so firmly
by the shorthairs

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.010
and sending me a
very clear message.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.700
I ran out to the payphone,
called my commercial agent,

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.400
and said, thank you kindly but
I'm not doing this anymore.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.880
This is not the life for me.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.300
There was no shame in
these commercial auditions.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.340
I just knew that I would rather
be making a solid $20 an hour

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.970
than making zero money to
sit and wait for a lottery

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.480
ticket that could pay off big.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:09.100
I understood in that
moment what Robert Mitchum

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.660
had meant when he said,
"Acting is no job for a man."

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.440
Years later, I got to
work with Eddie "Carmine"

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.390
Mecca on an episode of
Children's Hospital.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.680
And he was a dreamboat.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.430
Between takes, he would sing
standards and Sinatra tunes.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.180
He was a total peach.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.680
Now if I could only shake
hands with the Ogre,

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.412
I could bring my Budweiser
trauma to a neat resolution.

00:19:34.412 --> 00:19:39.172
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:39.172 --> 00:19:42.030
You're very generous.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.690
Thank you.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:48.730
I'll give you one more little
piece, subtly entitled,

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:54.770
"Don't Be an Asshole," I find
it consistently difficult

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:59.030
to get around the notion that
we are all, in our very natures,

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.230
assholes.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:01.670
I'm an asshole.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.870
I'm afraid you are also.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.270
That's why the conversation
about good manners

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.510
even exists in the first place.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:13.530
We're cognizant, curious
beings, capable of philosophical

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.170
thought-- nuclear physics,
repeating Nerf weaponry,

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:20.250
global consciousness,
Glade air fresheners,

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.730
and sentient automobiles.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.990
But we're assholes first.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.600
But this is because
before we can

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.970
begin to argue mortgage
rates and tuition hikes,

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.540
before we can roll
up our sleeves

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.360
and thread a profusion catheter
into the cholesterol-choked

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.640
artery of today's society,
we-- every one of us--

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.830
must first replenish our
mammalian bodies with food

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.440
and water, while
establishing and maintaining

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.930
a comfortable climate
around our bodies

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.260
through the employment of
garments and heating/cooling

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.070
cooling systems.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.820
Before we can
arrive at the office

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.250
to resume our efforts
to improve, say,

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.750
worldwide Muslim-Christian
relations,

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.860
or the infrastructure of the
Haitian public utility system,

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.950
we must commune-- and more
to the point, commute--

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.510
with thousands of other animals
upon ever-increasingly crowded

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.580
roadways and public
transit vehicle systems.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.380
It's during these more basic
elemental steps in our day

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:19.560
that we reveal our true
colors as assholes.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.660
Our bodies tell us frequently,
in no uncertain terms,

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.290
to do things that society has
deemed inappropriate, or quite

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:27.480
often illegal.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.150
Talking about the animal
voice deep inside us

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.970
that we've learned to repress
through socialization--

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:34.950
hey, Dave.

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:38.424
Look at that ripe young female
cheering for the sports team.

00:21:38.424 --> 00:21:39.840
You should make
some babies occur.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.130
Or, excuse me, Jorge.

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:46.840
That other family
is in front of you

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.000
in line at the Reuben truck.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.250
Your own family could claim
all of the delicious sandwiches

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.520
and grow stronger if you
simply kill that first family.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.080
We humans contain within
us instinctual signals,

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.860
influencing us toward the
perpetuation of our species--

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.930
specifically, our own
tribes or family units,

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.330
often to the
detriment of others.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.090
That's just how nature works.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.910
What's amazing is
that we've largely

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.440
contained these urges to the
point of successfully checking

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.730
out of a crowded Whole
Foods without decapitating

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.840
that crunchy, granola-haired
hustler dude to trying

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.130
to squeak 14 items
through the express lane

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.192
when the sign clearly
states, 12 items or less.

00:22:32.192 --> 00:22:33.650
You think we aren't
all going to be

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.410
counting your
fucking items, bro?

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.790
But we don't strike.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.120
We take a deep breath,
and feel better

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:49.010
for another day of carnage-free
foraging at the grocery store.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.950
As civilization
developed, we learned

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.820
to establish some rules
and guidelines-- laws,

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.180
if you will-- to
convince ourselves

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.130
that it's not right to
heed these animal urges.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.830
OK, everybody, I know
we used to just rip out

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.800
one another's throats if
we wanted to claim, say,

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.330
a certain hunting
territory for our own.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.560
But we're all deciding
in this new committee,

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.511
or let's say congress we formed,
that that's not cool anymore.

00:23:13.511 --> 00:23:15.010
We're going to lay
down some notions

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.140
about personal property,
and the ways in which we

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.210
can violate these notions.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:22.220
And we're going to establish
some punishments to hopefully

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.670
deter us from raping
and killing one another,

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.900
mostly the weak people.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.420
Over the centuries,
we've continued

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.020
to evolve these notions so
that every citizen receives

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.190
a fair shake.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:36.860
And by God, we're
still working on it.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:41.710
For you see, gentle reader-- or
listeners-- it's complicated.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:44.490
In a society where to the
victors go the spoils,

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.660
it can be difficult
for said victors

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.430
to wrap their heads
around fair treatment

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:52.420
or rights for all the
people, especially

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.770
those who have been
defeated or dominated

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.200
in one sense or another.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.870
For example, slavery.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.267
Although versions of
slavery have been prevalent

00:24:00.267 --> 00:24:01.850
all over the world
throughout history,

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:05.890
I'll focus on American slavery
during the last few centuries.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:08.760
We Europeans were caught
up in a system that

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.850
entailed the brutal,
inhuman capture

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:14.580
and transport of brown-skinned
Africans to the United States,

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.750
where they would be
sold like work animals

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.660
to perform labor in the
fields and houses of farms

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:20.850
and plantations.

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:23.310
Full on, flagrant,
fucked-up assholery.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:25.030
It's unthinkable.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.850
This horribly criminal system
existed for hundreds of years

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.380
before the white folks
finally copped to its not

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.740
being super cool.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.710
It took a long
time for the whites

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:38.540
to wrap their heads
around the idea of sharing

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.740
this nation, which
incidentally was brutally

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.640
stolen by them from
the indigenous tribes.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.420
Inequality with the
dark-skinned people

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.720
whom they had once
owned like mules--

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.140
how did this ever occur?

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.760
Assholes.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.780
The rules were being
made by assholes.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.860
These decisions were handed
down from assholes on high,

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.380
and carried out by-- you
guessed it-- assholes.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.880
So thankfully, we got that
bullshit straightened out,

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.530
on paper at least,
but we're still

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.930
trying to heal
the wounds of that

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:13.010
and countless other genocides
and discriminations and ass

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.380
fuckings that we
humans have handed one

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.250
another over the years.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:21.080
The early transgressions that
our laws sought to prohibit

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.800
involved a violating poleaxe or
spear of one brand or another.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.190
Many crimes of action
required a sharp-bladed weapon

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:32.010
with which to pierce the skin
or property of the victim,

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:37.160
or an actual penis with
which to violate another

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.450
in the most intimate
of breaches.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.700
By now civilization
has done, it must

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.670
be said, a pretty stand-up job
of reducing these more overt

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:49.620
asshole moves with the promise
of strict repercussions--

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.120
prison, death, what have you.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.100
Terrific.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.560
But folks, we have got
us a very long way to go.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.940
I here proffer my opinion
that we the people

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.090
are still being raped
on a daily basis,

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:04.100
but it's a much longer,
much slower fucking.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.030
The aggressors
are-- I don't know,

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.980
the lobbyists for big
tobacco, and for guns

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.250
and pharmaceuticals
and agribusiness.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:14.160
And their filthy, turgid
cocks are enormous,

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.760
probing ramshafts made of money.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.330
But wait!

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.121
I thought this book
was a lighthearted look

00:26:20.121 --> 00:26:22.010
at living one's
life deliciously.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:23.870
That's all well
and good, fat boy,

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.840
but you cannot just
blithely drift through life

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.350
in your canoe whilst turning a
blind eye of the bullshit going

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.970
on all around you.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.930
Really, all religious
teachings can

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.770
be boiled down to just be cool.

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.540
Don't be an asshole.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.380
The teachings of Jesus,
Mohammad, Buddha, Yahweh,

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.980
Dionysus, Oprah, Yoda,
and all the rest.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.510
Confucius.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.540
All we need to be told
is that we are all

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.040
presented with a similar
challenge in life, which

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.570
is you will encounter
tests every day.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.710
You can serve yourself,
or you can serve others.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:00.570
Now, before I dive headfirst
off a self-righteous cliff

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.870
like a motherfucking
juggernaut, let

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.480
me point out that I count
myself as not only a human,

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.500
but a fucking American white
guy with a decent brain

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.100
and set of life skills,
which means I am,

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.870
by birthright, a major asshole.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.010
I come by it honest.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:19.050
It's the first
rule of fight club,

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.010
admitting you're an asshole.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.560
And once I saw this
truth and swallowed it,

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.290
an excellent
technique developed,

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:28.950
one that I believe makes my life
much more calm and much less

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:32.820
desperate, therefore
much more delicious.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.920
The technique is, let
the others go first.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.490
At the airport, at the grocery
store, at the pleasure chest,

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.520
hey ho.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.860
The calmer I've become,
the more I enjoy my day.

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.780
The more I enjoy my day,
the more people enjoy me,

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.950
and the more they want to
see me in my enjoyment.

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.020
Eventually, they want
to see me enjoying

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.350
my day on the set of their film.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:00.390
Turns out all I had to
do was keep my cool.

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:02.230
I could hardly dive
into this topic

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:05.320
without immediately citing
the storied heavy traffic

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:10.310
of my hometown of 16 years,
Los Angeles, California.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:14.680
Crosstown trips continue to take
longer and interminably longer

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.860
with each passing year.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.060
And in the arena of
the streets of LA,

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.580
a great many motorists
reveal themselves

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.650
to be lacking in moral fiber.

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:26.410
Their integrity is questionable
at best to begin with,

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:29.230
perhaps because Hollywood,
more than any other American

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:31.520
community, is the
city of dreams.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.450
Los Angeles County is choking
with these supplicants

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:38.010
to glittering visions, like that
of impressing one's handprints

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:40.820
in the cement sidewalk
outside of Mann's Chinese,

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.550
or delivering a sexual
pleasuring to a studio head.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:46.640
Of course, most of
us will never realize

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.360
even the first flirtation
of such a lofty climax.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.030
And the frustration
with that status quo

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:57.260
can foment quite a bitter,
impatient, aggressive driver.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.270
I can speak to the sensation
as for my first years in LA,

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:04.230
I felt like I was in some
sort of invisible queue,

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:08.040
bombarded daily by reports of
all the goddamn guys in front

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.120
of me succeeding by
inches, wedging me out

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.480
of TV pilots and film roles.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.450
When I learned to
ignore the business,

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:19.940
and instead focus on
woodworking and my love life,

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.720
I merely calculated
my drive time,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.030
adding a 15-minute
cushion for chilling out.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.645
And Christ almighty,
did my mood improve.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.282
I usually don't read that
section, but-- thank you.

00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:40.516
That's generous, thank you.

00:29:40.516 --> 00:29:41.950
I usually don't
read that section,

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:44.480
but there's been some
things in the news lately

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:48.030
of silly people
shooting one another,

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:52.490
and different weird sort of
end of days kind of violence

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.530
happening.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.780
And there's a lot of talk
from all the political pundits

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.690
and very smart people
about what's to be done.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:04.300
And I am not as
smart as them, and I

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.340
don't have a solid opinion
in terms of the statistics

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:12.180
or the science behind
it, but I do feel like--

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:16.770
and something that my
book goes to some lengths

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:19.370
to try and address
is, I think the answer

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:21.000
to a lot of these
questions comes

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.260
down to how we
treat one another.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.760
I feel like making
us take our shoes off

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:30.300
at the airport-- I
get the math of it.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.730
I understand your logic.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:34.800
But we're incredibly
crafty monkeys,

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.540
and so if we want to do
something stupid with a weapon

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.250
someplace, there's
probably no regulation

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.960
that's going to keep
us from doing it.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.880
You know, so many
men and women that

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:48.710
are incredibly handy
with a piece of bamboo,

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:50.930
if they want to fuck
you up, they will.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:52.121
INTERVIEWER: Canoe paddle.

00:30:52.121 --> 00:30:56.620
NICK OFFERMAN: And so my
plan is to try and treat

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.810
everyone decently,
so they don't feel

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:01.980
like they have to stick a
sharp end shiv of bamboo

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.570
into any part of my person.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.880
So besides trying
to engender mirth,

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.570
I'm also trying to promote
treating each other decently,

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:14.450
and just promoting good
manners and remembering

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.970
that we're all in this together.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:18.002
Thank you for having me.

00:31:18.002 --> 00:31:19.710
And I guess now we'll
ask some questions.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:21.010
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, we only
have about 10 minutes.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:22.760
So if you guys want
to step up to the mic,

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.167
and anybody has any questions
that they'd like to ask?

00:31:25.167 --> 00:31:27.035
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you had

00:31:27.035 --> 00:31:29.058
any tips for cutting
a concrete floor that

00:31:29.058 --> 00:31:31.710
might be a little easier?

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:34.520
Because it wasn't really
like three hours [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.590
NICK OFFERMAN: That's
not my number one--

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:48.000
I try to avoid any
masonry-based sheet goods,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.700
which I think goes
for most of us.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.940
In general, I can say
you get what you pay for.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.460
So there's probably a diamond
or carbide-tipped blade

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.680
that's more expensive, but
will get you through your job

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.210
a lot faster than eight of the
shitty blades that you thought

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:06.660
were a good bargain.

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.790
That's a gross generalization.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:12.690
And I don't mean to make
such sweeping statements.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:16.330
But as a philosophy,
I've found that if you

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.800
spend the money on the
more expensive tool,

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.760
it ends up being
cheaper in the long run.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:21.521
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:21.521 --> 00:32:22.270
Thank you so much.

00:32:24.497 --> 00:32:27.080
INTERVIEWER: So maybe not a lot
of people know this about you,

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.810
but you have your
own woodworking shop.

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:29.643
NICK OFFERMAN: I do.

00:32:29.643 --> 00:32:30.870
That's why I built a canoe.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:35.500
It wasn't just, what should I
do, should I go to the park?

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.720
Eh, build a fucking canoe.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.500
I build furniture.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.290
I have a shop in town.

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:44.200
Offermanwoodshop.com
is our website.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.983
We have some great
Christmas items.

00:32:45.983 --> 00:32:49.342
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:49.342 --> 00:32:50.990
NICK OFFERMAN: Hello there.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.790
Congratulations on
those mutton chops.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:55.592
AUDIENCE: Why,
thank you very much.

00:32:55.592 --> 00:32:57.180
Your mustache is an inspiration.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.590
NICK OFFERMAN: I doffed my cap.

00:33:01.672 --> 00:33:06.440
AUDIENCE: I am also a
Midwesterner transported to LA.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.940
NICK OFFERMAN:
You're very handsome.

00:33:11.307 --> 00:33:13.140
AUDIENCE: Now I'm getting
all uncomfortable.

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.040
Yeah, so what I want is life
advice from Nick Offerman,

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.710
like I think many Americans do.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:28.090
I've come to a similar
philosophy about assholes

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:32.680
as you have, in that
it's important to relax

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.240
and chill and treat
people decently.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.740
But it's also true
that sometimes when

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.240
I go back home to
the Midwest, I come

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.287
across people who are proudly
racist or proudly homophobic.

00:33:44.287 --> 00:33:45.120
NICK OFFERMAN: Sure.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.550
AUDIENCE: And it's
difficult to continue

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:49.610
treating them with respect.

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:54.020
And I was wondering if you
had thoughts on that aspect,

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:56.245
like when you give up on people?

00:33:56.245 --> 00:34:00.860
NICK OFFERMAN: Well,
that's a good question.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:04.520
I generally give
them seven strikes.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:09.040
No, I mean I grew up in a very
conservative, white, small town

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:13.739
where I met one
black person once.

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:17.280
And I had heard of Jews,
but like I got to college

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.860
and a kid was getting hazed and
he had lox in his underwear.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.290
And I said, what is lox?

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:25.060
And he looked at me funny.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.710
And I said sorry, what is lox?

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.449
And he said, salmon.

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:29.105
Lox and bagels.

00:34:29.105 --> 00:34:30.230
And I said, what's a bagel?

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.244
And I said, oh are you serious?

00:34:35.244 --> 00:34:36.295
Like there's still Jews?

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:44.449
I had heard about
them in Sunday school.

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:50.600
My town was that white and
sort of Catholic and Methodist.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:58.250
And so I mean, my solution was
to move to an urban area, where

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.625
I could find people
that were cool.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.690
But I've had lots of
conversations with people

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.310
in my family, or old
friends from home

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:11.410
where you do what you can.

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:16.280
I mean, either you
eschew their company

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:21.200
or in the case of family
members, I try to gently say,

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.890
I know that, like, you feel that
way because of this or that.

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:27.930
Or, you I know that racism
was very prevalent in,

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:30.510
like, your generation or in
your parents' generation.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:36.440
But some stuff went down
in, like, the '50s and '60s

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.080
that you might
want to check out.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.480
There was this dude, Martin
Luther King, Jr. Like,

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.050
there's some
exposition you might

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:45.320
want to avail yourself of.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.990
But I remember having a talk
with a member of my family.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.910
I took them to see the
movie "American Beauty."

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:54.429
And it was a very pointed
trip to the movies.

00:35:54.429 --> 00:35:55.970
I didn't tell them
anything about it.

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:56.845
And we saw the movie.

00:35:56.845 --> 00:35:58.690
And then we got out
and I said, so what

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.540
do you think about that?

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.680
And he said, well, no,
I'm OK with those guys,

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.680
as long as they don't
try to hold my hand.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:10.270
And I said, that's why I
wanted to take you to this.

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:12.330
Like, that's like
a fear-- that's

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:16.570
an old-school fear that you
have been instilled with.

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:20.190
And can you understand
that that's bad,

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.370
that if some people felt that
way about you because you're

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:27.250
white or you're brunette,
or because you're straight?

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.540
Can you understand that
that's discriminatory?

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:37.500
And in my world of
theater and artists,

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.760
it's an incredible melting pot.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:46.000
It's a veritable Benetton
ad of races and sexualities,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.500
and they're all
people that I love.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.458
And we're all the same.

00:36:48.458 --> 00:36:51.930
We're all working together
to make something.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.180
And many of my friends
that you've met

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:59.470
are wonderful people
that you like.

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.490
And can you understand
how you need

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:05.370
to see them as human beings,
rather than some sort of group?

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:08.150
So I try to have gentle
conversations about it.

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:12.240
And sometimes I think
it's a game that's

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.990
won by inches, certainly
not by slam-dunks.

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:17.542
Remain patient.

00:37:17.542 --> 00:37:18.250
That's the thing.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:21.940
That's what that chapter is
about is like, I can never

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:26.640
lose sight of the fact that we
all have it in us to be like,

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.320
goddammit.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.330
That Honda cut me
off in traffic.

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:30.830
Fuck Hondas!

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:31.809
No, no.

00:37:31.809 --> 00:37:32.309
No.

00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:32.809
No.

00:37:32.809 --> 00:37:33.790
No.

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:34.480
It's not Hondas.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:39.320
And we have to remind
ourselves to mind our manners,

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.456
and open the door
for one another.

00:37:42.456 --> 00:37:43.350
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:44.308
NICK OFFERMAN: You bet.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:53.620
AUDIENCE: So I think you and
Tom Selleck probably have, like,

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.480
the greatest moustaches
in Hollywood.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.995
NICK OFFERMAN:
That's very generous.

00:37:56.995 --> 00:37:58.710
AUDIENCE: So I mean,
how old were you

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:00.960
when you first grew it out,
and at what point were you

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.616
like, I got something here?

00:38:03.616 --> 00:38:08.560
NICK OFFERMAN: Well, when I
was at theater school at age

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:13.280
like 18 or 19, and
it was interesting.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.880
I was very much a
greenhorn, like fresh kid

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.960
from the corn fields.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.010
And I sort of saw
the lay of the land.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:27.320
And I saw, even in the microcosm
of my theater conservatory

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.510
in Champaign-Urbana,
I saw the sort

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.110
of different genres of actor.

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:36.340
There were cute people,
there were funny people,

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.750
there were some that had both,
that I was very envious of.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:44.740
But I quickly determined that,
of the options available to me,

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.500
I wanted to be a
character actor.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:52.560
I didn't want to go try and
achieve the route of someone

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.120
looking the same all
the time, and playing

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:59.350
the same version of some sort
of heroic guy, or something.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:02.980
And so I immediately
began to capitalize

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.970
on my hair and my facial hair.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:10.420
And sort of used every tool
in the follicular toolbox.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:16.690
And so I was so excited to
get out of my little town,

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:20.020
and finally be able to do
things that I saw in the movie

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:22.220
"Hair," like grow
kick-ass mutton

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.840
chops like our last questioner.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:29.510
And I'd say it was
probably in my early 20s

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:34.830
when my man's mustache
fully was achieved.

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:37.230
And it was clearly--
I was like, oh that's

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:42.170
going to be a great-- of my
12 different looks, that's

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:43.490
going to be a good one.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:47.090
I hope I can play
a sheriff someday.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:48.422
But I come by it honest.

00:39:48.422 --> 00:39:50.630
Like, people often ask me
for tips on how to grow it.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:51.910
And I say, don't shave.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.045
If you don't do anything,
it just-- it appears.

00:39:57.045 --> 00:39:58.110
AUDIENCE: Usually
how it happens.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:58.410
Cool.

00:39:58.410 --> 00:39:59.470
NICK OFFERMAN: Thank you.

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:00.960
INTERVIEWER: It's one o'clock.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.585
Is it time for one
quick last question?

00:40:02.585 --> 00:40:06.060
NICK OFFERMAN: Yeah,
I got 15 more minutes.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.060
INTERVIEWER: I was going
to say, so your current

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:09.643
mustache that you
have right now, this

00:40:09.643 --> 00:40:11.675
is the shooting mustache, right?

00:40:11.675 --> 00:40:12.550
NICK OFFERMAN: It is.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:14.990
This is the A game.

00:40:18.455 --> 00:40:19.240
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.200
NICK OFFERMAN: Hello.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.969
AUDIENCE: I have a really
big crush on Ron Swanson.

00:40:23.969 --> 00:40:25.010
NICK OFFERMAN: I'm sorry.

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:26.820
Oh, so you have a really
big crush on Ron Swanson?

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:27.403
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:27.403 --> 00:40:31.020
How much of you is
in the Ron character?

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:37.612
NICK OFFERMAN: Not
very much, apparently.

00:40:40.324 --> 00:40:42.690
AUDIENCE: No, like
the breakfast eating,

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:45.369
the scotch, the steak
the libertarian--

00:40:45.369 --> 00:40:46.910
NICK OFFERMAN: To
be fair, many of us

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:54.360
eat breakfast and consume
meat entrees and whiskey.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:58.524
AUDIENCE: There are lots of
vegans and vegetarians here.

00:40:58.524 --> 00:41:01.060
NICK OFFERMAN: I'm
actually down with that.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.710
I applaud healthy
eating choices.

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:10.070
So as you can see, I'm nothing
like Ron Swanson, ma'am.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:14.030
AUDIENCE: I have a
little crush on you, too.

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:15.309
A two-parter.

00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:17.100
What's the character
you most want to play?

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.141
NICK OFFERMAN: The character
I most want to play.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.360
It's a good question.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.955
I'm too old to play Hamlet.

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.970
Please, don't argue with me.

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.740
I passed it, like,
three months ago.

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:38.050
I don't know.

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:41.830
I don't have a dream
character as much

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:47.210
as I just love to
perform great writing.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:49.170
And so, if I was to
sit here and say,

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:53.040
I wanted to play-- there's
a great comic book called

00:41:53.040 --> 00:42:00.107
"The Boys," and the head of
this gang is a part I love.

00:42:00.107 --> 00:42:01.440
There's lots of parts like that.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.414
But until somebody
turns in a script where

00:42:04.414 --> 00:42:06.330
I'm like, oh, this is
great-- I want to do it,

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:10.340
it's good writing that moves me
much more than the notion of,

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.700
I would love to play
James K. Polk someday.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:17.420
Wait a second.

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.640
The Napoleon of the South.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.560
That's not a bad idea.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:26.430
I mean also, being handed this
crazy dream role of a lifetime,

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:31.400
it's hard at the moment
to care about-- nothing.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:37.470
I don't want to play any parts,
because this is such a feast

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:41.560
that I feel like I don't
need to eat for a while.

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.290
But we'll see.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:53.280
I'd love to play a fop,
some sort of mincing fop.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.510
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:55.635
NICK OFFERMAN: My pleasure.

00:42:55.635 --> 00:42:57.180
INTERVIEWER: So it's
kind of interesting

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.388
that you've become so
identified with this character.

00:42:59.388 --> 00:43:02.890
But I learned from the book that
you actually went into audition

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:04.940
for a different
role on the show.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:06.930
Why do you think this
ended up being the one

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:07.902
that you were cast in?

00:43:07.902 --> 00:43:09.360
NICK OFFERMAN:
Well, in a nutshell,

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.870
you can get all
the juicy details

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:15.412
Chapter [INTENTIONALLY
MUMBLES] in the book.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.150
Mike Schur and Greg
Daniels were creating

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:25.780
the show very organically.

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:29.890
They knew some sort of
archetypes they wanted.

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:33.550
They knew they had Amy and
Aziz and Aubrey, I think.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:39.135
And they thought, I
think we want Rashida.

00:43:39.135 --> 00:43:41.760
And so they were coming up with,
they were filling in like, OK,

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:45.220
we need a guy who maybe
gets involved with Rashida--

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.590
were filling out the cast.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:53.990
And so they had me in to
read for that guy, and also

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:56.350
Adam Scott, the day I went in.

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:58.280
And I've known Adam
for a long time,

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:02.170
and he's such a
funny, great guy.

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:04.550
He's also just
such a great actor,

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:07.000
that there's no one I
could think of that I would

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.480
rather not fucking
see at an audition

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.070
where I'm like, oh great.

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:16.240
Which one of us-- I want
to see you kiss Rashida,

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.860
or I see myself.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:23.240
But so we both went in
that day, and neither of us

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:23.990
ended up doing it.

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:29.930
I think it's experimental,
where they say OK,

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:32.975
maybe that guy is too husky.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.669
Maybe he's too goddamn charming.

00:44:37.669 --> 00:44:39.335
Nobody would believe
that he was single.

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:47.060
Or whatever, and they then
further shaped the characters.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:50.820
And NBC had a say,
where they said--

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:54.020
and this is a funny quote that I
heard from somebody, where they

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.940
came back and said, we
asked you for Aaron Eckhart.

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.760
And you brought
us Nick Offerman,

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.425
with indignant,
righteous indignation.

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:09.420
I thought I was in
the Eckhart file,

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:13.050
but I guess it's not the case.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:16.560
So thankfully, they really
wanted me on the show.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.730
And they had conceived
of this boss character.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:23.282
I think they had initially
pictured him as being older,

00:45:23.282 --> 00:45:24.990
you know, being more
of an administrator,

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:28.110
like a high school principal.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:31.330
And so that's why it took a
long time to convince NBC.

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:32.795
So they said OK,
you don't want him

00:45:32.795 --> 00:45:35.160
as somebody who kisses anybody.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.420
We think he's funny.

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:37.980
Can we put him in
this other part?

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:38.938
And they were like, no.

00:45:38.938 --> 00:45:41.240
That needs to be a
guy with white hair.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:44.650
And so eventually,
they came around.

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:47.720
And I'm so eternally
grateful to those guys,

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:53.350
because it's really hard,
as you all are well aware.

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:56.830
When you're dealing
on a corporate level

00:45:56.830 --> 00:46:01.170
with an artistic project, it's
really hard for the corporation

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:03.300
to keep their fingers
out of your pudding.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.920
And if they've hired
you to paint a picture,

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.230
there's somebody that wants to
stand there and suggest a brush

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:11.483
to say, what if
you do red there?

00:46:11.483 --> 00:46:15.190
OK, sorry-- and try to tell
you how to paint your picture.

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:18.370
And so I'm so grateful to
Mike Scher and Greg Daniels

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:22.080
for sticking to their
guns over a long process

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.000
to give me this part,
because-- and of course,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.760
you know, then once it
works, then the corporation

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.780
is like, we found this guy.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.900
He's terrific.

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.327
It took some doing, but
we got him in the part.

00:46:36.327 --> 00:46:38.410
INTERVIEWER: All right,
I'll take another question

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:39.656
from the audience?

00:46:39.656 --> 00:46:41.620
AUDIENCE: Coming from
conservatory training,

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.620
it sounds like maybe
you're more classical,

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.530
or were not always
considering comedy.

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:47.380
Who were your comedy
influences growing up?

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.412
Was it, like, Newhart,
Don Rickles, or--

00:46:50.412 --> 00:46:53.260
NICK OFFERMAN: No.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.300
I'm a fan.

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:56.610
I'm a fan.

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:59.800
Newhart-- it would be
more of an influence.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.450
I'm not super
familiar with Rickles,

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:05.370
although I think he's super
funny, what I've seen.

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:08.370
But it's a weird thing
in show business.

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:10.320
It took me a long time
to learn that they

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.510
want you to be a specialist.

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:17.880
In theater, you do-- in any
given season at a theater,

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:21.210
you might do a Sam Sheppard
play, a Shakespeare, a Martin

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:24.950
McDonagh play, some
weird experimental thing.

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:27.850
You might do the
broadest "Phaedo" farce--

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:30.430
hilarious, like,
door slamming comedy.

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:34.550
And then you may do the most
serious Chekhovian drama.

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:37.130
And you're equipped,
hopefully, with the tools

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:38.680
to do all of those things.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.990
And they're all enjoyable
in their own way.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:44.310
I always loved comedy.

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:49.260
As a kid out in the country,
the movies of Mel Brooks

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.500
were incredibly
influential for me.

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.730
Steve Martin, early SNL.

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:58.520
I sat in school, I
remember in grade school

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:01.990
sitting there doing
pushups with my eyebrows,

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:05.270
because I wanted to be John
Belushi when I grew up.

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:07.280
He was a very big hero to me.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.660
And now I can do the
wave with my eyebrows.

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:12.620
Thank you, thanks.

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:18.350
But I was literally
in my mid 30s

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:20.690
when I realized--
I had been in town,

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:22.960
I had been working
here and there,

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:26.400
and slowly getting
better and better work.

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.700
But then something was weird.

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:30.220
There was a certain
genre of like,

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:32.390
a Will Ferrell or
a Jim Carrey movie,

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:34.410
or these big comedies
where maybe there

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:36.050
would be 10 firemen.

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:38.270
And I'd see the
movie and say, there

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:41.360
wasn't a-- I couldn't
read for Fireman Number 7?

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:43.300
Like, what's the deal?

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.500
And I had learned that the
people casting these movies

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:50.280
have these lists of, these
are the people that do comedy.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.160
These are the people
that play tennis.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.270
These are the people
that speak French.

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:58.810
And I literally had to make
a concerted effort to go--

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:03.040
and the people that do comedy
come from the Upright Citizens

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.740
Brigade, Second
City, Groundlings--

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:11.380
all of these venerated comedy
schools, where people learn

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.046
improv and sketch, or stand-up.

00:49:14.046 --> 00:49:15.670
Those are the people
that are allowed--

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:18.800
that are licensed
to perform comedy.

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.890
And when I started
getting work in comedy,

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:23.810
some of the more
substantial stuff

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:26.740
was I did a bunch of
the George Lopez show.

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:29.840
And a couple casting directors
after that would say to me,

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.640
oh, I didn't know you do comedy!

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:34.480
As though I was
knitting, or something.

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.370
Oh, I didn't know
that you crochet!

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:42.350
And so I made a
concerted effort.

00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:43.980
I called Amy, who I had known.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.230
Amy Poehler.

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:47.820
I'd known her in Chicago
just from palling around

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:48.700
in the early 90s.

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:52.150
We never saw each other's--
it's two separate worlds,

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:54.390
The world of comedy, and
then the world of, like,

00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:57.020
legit theater--
Steppenwolf Theater.

00:49:57.020 --> 00:50:01.190
In town, it would be like the
Taper and the Geffen, South

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:07.550
Coast Rep versus Groundlings and
Second City and Improv Olympic.

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:11.370
So we were buddies,
but we never went

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:12.680
to where each other worked.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.180
It was like, how's
your thing going?

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.980
You make up shit in
front of people in bars?

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.720
Have fun.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.410
I'm doing Ibsen.

00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:21.690
I'm doing a little Brecht piece.

00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:24.270
No big deal.

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:26.224
Good luck.

00:50:26.224 --> 00:50:27.265
Good luck with your path.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.490
So I was in my mid 30s and
I called Amy and I said,

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:38.740
I need to be considered
someone who does comedy.

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:40.330
Can I take a class?

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:41.730
Where do I start?

00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:44.230
And she said, we've
got some shows

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:49.240
that are designed for actors
to play with our improvisers.

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:52.030
So I started doing those shows.

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:54.830
And it was like a
switch had been flipped,

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:56.220
where they're like oh, you guys!

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.850
Nick Offerman does comedy.

00:50:57.850 --> 00:51:01.930
And suddenly I was allowed
to make people laugh.

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:07.585
I've still got five.

00:51:07.585 --> 00:51:09.120
AUDIENCE: OK, I'll
make this quick.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.530
Hi.

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:13.470
So my husband is from
Stillman Valley, Illinois.

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.192
Loves to build things,
grows hair well.

00:51:15.192 --> 00:51:16.650
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
Sounds badass.

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:18.420
AUDIENCE: Really polite guy.

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:20.380
And we've been out
here for seven years.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:22.400
We moved here from Chicago,
both theater people.

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.700
Columbia College.

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:27.015
And how do I keep him from
turning into an LA asshole?

00:51:27.015 --> 00:51:29.140
Like, how do you surround
yourself with like-minded

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:32.604
people living in this town and--

00:51:32.604 --> 00:51:36.630
NICK OFFERMAN: It's a very
good question, America.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.800
I'm a great salesman.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.654
Did you say you went to
theater school at Columbia?

00:51:44.654 --> 00:51:45.570
When did you graduate?

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:47.700
AUDIENCE: I graduated in '96.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.941
Sheldon Patinkin was
my director there.

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:52.144
NICK OFFERMAN: OK.

00:51:52.144 --> 00:51:52.643
'96.

00:51:55.410 --> 00:52:01.690
I taught lighting there
in the department in '95.

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:04.290
I was in "A Clockwork
Orange" at Steppenwolf.

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:07.780
I had my whole head shaved, but
just had the front inch of hair

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.414
with a huge red beard.

00:52:09.414 --> 00:52:10.955
AUDIENCE: I would
have remembered you

00:52:10.955 --> 00:52:11.972
if I had your class.

00:52:11.972 --> 00:52:13.638
NICK OFFERMAN: They
called me Faceplate.

00:52:16.002 --> 00:52:18.210
And at the end of one semester
of teaching lighting--

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:19.880
I used to build
scenery in their shop,

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.350
and they needed somebody to
teach this lighting class.

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:26.120
I was 25, my students
were like, 22.

00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.950
Two of them were
lovely young ladies,

00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:32.900
who I maybe paid a little
too much attention to

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.210
in the classroom.

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:37.300
And they were just,
like, have you

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:42.300
done anything, like even
a music video, or like

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:45.820
do you have nothing
but these plays?

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:47.170
And I was like, no.

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:50.510
But they're really good plays.

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:53.680
Are you familiar
with "The Crucible"?

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.070
It was really weird.

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:56.600
I was super uncomfortable.

00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.300
And people-- my peers
would say, dude.

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.180
I can't believe you,
like, blew that meeting.

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:03.250
You have to go in
there and be a shark,

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:09.566
and like, blow your x factor
all over the people interviewing

00:53:09.566 --> 00:53:10.550
you.

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:17.020
And I was like, I don't
do that to people.

00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:18.046
I don't sell myself.

00:53:18.046 --> 00:53:20.170
I don't want people to hire
me because they thought

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:23.970
it was cool sitting in their
office to do a job on stage.

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:27.860
That doesn't make sense to me.

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:31.630
And all the people that I
saw chasing that, chasing

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:33.710
the sort of fashion
of the business,

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:36.950
reading magazines to see, like,
how to get their hair cut,

00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:40.270
and like, try to go
to the right parties,

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:43.580
trying to find all the ways
by which you might get ahead

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:50.059
in the business without actually
doing so for the right reasons.

00:53:50.059 --> 00:53:51.600
And I said, I don't
like any of this.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.690
It's gross.

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:56.370
So I'm going to step out of it.

00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:59.080
And that's why I gave up
the commercial auditions.

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:03.720
I gave up trying to act like
people trying to get work here,

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:07.230
and instead do what
made my life happy up

00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:10.660
until that point, which was
build things with my tools,

00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:14.060
work in theater, even
though nobody comes in LA.

00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:16.790
I found a great theater company
called the Evidence Room,

00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:18.560
and started working with them.

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:21.470
And that didn't make
me rich or famous,

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:23.020
but it made me super happy.

00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:27.370
It found me the love of my life.

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:30.760
And so that's my answer
to your question,

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:34.380
is to try to avoid
all-- don't look

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:37.420
for the answer in
any popular culture

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:40.640
magazines or channels,
because they're usually

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.730
trying to make money--
trying to either sell

00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:46.280
magazines or shoes or
Rogaine or something.

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:51.415
But instead, it's that
great John Lennon quote of,

00:54:51.415 --> 00:54:53.040
"Your life is what
happens while you're

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.800
busy making other plans."

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.530
I really try to focus on that.

00:54:56.530 --> 00:54:58.930
I come from this wonderful
salt of the earth

00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:02.720
family in Illinois, and
it's a really happy family.

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.290
And so I try to just
maintain my life

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:07.170
like my family does
in Illinois, which

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:11.200
is get together with people,
enjoy food and drink,

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:13.490
make things.

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:20.410
And the things that
I avoid are like,

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:25.350
isolationist, like basically
multimedia masturbation,

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:28.820
where it's so easy
to spend a whole day,

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:32.500
like, doing all kinds of
things online, or like,

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:36.239
chasing down somebody from
junior high on Facebook.

00:55:36.239 --> 00:55:36.780
I don't know.

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:39.420
I found I'm much happier
trying to continue

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:41.590
to interact with people.

00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:46.630
And I've often said that
it's so much more fun

00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:48.990
to have eight people
with one beer each,

00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:52.620
than to have one person
with eight beers.

00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:54.660
That sounds
wrongheaded, but I've

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:58.364
crunched the numbers many times.

00:55:58.364 --> 00:56:00.480
And I stand by it.

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.684
I hope that's of
some sort of service.

00:56:02.684 --> 00:56:04.850
INTERVIEWER: All right,
that's all the time we have.

00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:08.720
Thank you again, Nick Offerman
for coming to talk to us.

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.870
NICK OFFERMAN: Thank
you for having me.
