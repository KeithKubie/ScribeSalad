00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:01.920
When I go to share
something, it's

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.390
probably because I had a
fleeting thought about how

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.440
cool it was, which
means that if it takes

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.180
too long to actually share, I'm
going to hit the Back button

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.510
and give up.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.930
I'm Joanna Smith, and I am
your least favorite user.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.907
To help you create magic
moments when sharing,

00:00:16.907 --> 00:00:18.740
Android Marshmallow
introduced a new feature

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.310
called Direct Share.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.460
With Direct Share, you can
define direct share targets

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.450
that launch a specific
activity in your app

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.210
when the user initiates a share.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.652
To be clear here,
consider the current flow.

00:00:31.652 --> 00:00:33.610
If I found a fun new
article to show my sister,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.790
and I select your app
from the Share dialog,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.150
your app launches.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.830
That's great.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.030
But a direct share means that
I can select my conversation

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.380
with my sister,
and your app opens

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.240
to that conversation with
the article already waiting

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.990
in the message text
view for me to hit Send.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.700
Now that is a good
user experience.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.410
To enable direct
share targets, you

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.200
must define a class that extends
from ChooserTargetService,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.700
and in this new
service of yours,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.630
you need to implement
onGetChooserTargets.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.790
This method is the one that
will offer up those share

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.940
targets to the system so that it
may populate the Share dialog.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.770
OnGetChooserTargets is where
your app can get as fancy

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.532
as its little heart desires.

00:01:19.532 --> 00:01:21.740
Maybe it makes the most
sense to offer up the 10 most

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.510
recent conversations, or
perhaps your app offers a way

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.980
for users to track who
they care the most about,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.250
and you can provide a list
of those BFFs instead.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.490
Or maybe you know
which conversations,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.890
like group messages,
for example,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.110
are most prone to
using attachments,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.560
and those are your
likely share targets.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.150
This magic is up to you.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.660
We just made the
framework so that you

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.390
could build a better app.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.410
Now we need to
update our manifest.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.530
As with any new service,
we need to declare it,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.620
but what is special
about our declaration is

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.640
the BIND_CHOOSER_TARGET_SERVICE
permission.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.090
This will let us
interact with the system

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.015
to exchange those
implicit intents and share

00:02:01.015 --> 00:02:02.430
targets properly.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.900
Oh, and of course, the
intent filter that associates

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.560
this service as a
chooser target service.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.060
That covers everything you need
to populate the system share

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.480
dialog, but what about
when the user selects

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.915
one of your options?

00:02:14.915 --> 00:02:17.290
You'll want to start the proper
activity when your app is

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.760
launched, and to
do that, you need

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.260
to tie those specific activities
to the correct implicit intent.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.340
So you'll need some
metadata to do this,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.270
but it really is
as simple as that.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.440
So to play with Direct
Share in your own app,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.400
take a look at our
super fun sample, which

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.110
is linked in the
description below,

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.290
or check out our documentation.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.130
But most importantly, just
continue to build better apps.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.480
