00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:09.309
Narrator: ALASKA'S INTERIOR
IS ITS HEARTLAND.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.577
THE LARGE REGION,

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:15.314
WHICH IS BIGGER THAN TEXAS,
IS WILD AND UNDEVELOPED.

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.483
WINTERS HERE ARE BRUTAL.

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:18.784
Craig:
WINTERS ARE EXTREME.

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:21.587
WE NORMALLY GET 60 INCHES
OF SNOWFALL A YEAR.

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:23.756
50 BELOW IS NOT UNCOMMON.

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:25.591
Narrator: DURING THE DARK DAYS
OF WINTER,

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:28.761
THE 100,000 RESIDENTS
OF INTERIOR ALASKA

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.030
ARE FORCED TO LIGHT
AND HEAT THEIR HOMES

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.900
FAR MORE THAN PEOPLE
IN THE LOWER 48.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.037
ENERGY REALLY IS A REQUIREMENT.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.438
YOUR PIPES
CAN FREEZE IN RAPID ORDER

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:40.740
IF THERE'S NO HEAT SOURCE.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.077
WITHOUT ENERGY,
LIVES CAN BE AT RISK.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.879
Narrator: THIS REMOTE PART
OF THE STATE

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.947
IS ALSO HOME TO LARGE OPERATIONS

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:50.749
THAT REQUIRE LOTS
OF ENERGY YEAR ROUND.

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.485 line:0%
SEVERAL INDUSTRIAL SITES,

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:55.388 line:0%
SEVERAL GOLD MINES
AND MILITARY BASES.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:59.158
Narrator: FEEDING THE BEAST
IN THE INTERIOR ISN'T EASY.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:01.160
ALASKA RANKS THIRD
IN THE COUNTRY

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.130
IN THE MOST ENERGY
CONSUMED PER PERSON.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:10.002
ALASKANS GO THROUGH
826 MILLION BTUs PER CAPITA.

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:13.105
THAT'S 2.5 TIMES
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:15.441
Narrator: MOST OF ALASKA
DEPENDS ON FOSSIL FUELS

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.810
TO ENDURE THE HARSH ENVIRONMENT.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.048
MANY REMOTE TOWNS
SURVIVE OFF DIESEL GENERATORS.

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:24.450
BUT THE POWER GRID
IN INTERIOR ALASKA

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.719
BOASTS THE BIGGEST
CLEAN ENERGY MACHINE

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.554
IN THE WHOLE STATE.

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:31.824
IT STRETCHES
ACROSS 170 ACRES,

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:34.026
BOASTS 12 GIANT TURBINES

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:37.330
THAT STAND NEARLY
AS TALL AS BIG BEN,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.233
AND SPORT 36 WHIRLING BLADES.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.435
TIP TO TIP
IS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:43.736
AS A FOOTBALL FIELD.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:45.738
Narrator: THIS IS EVA CREEK,

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:50.710
ALASKA'S LARGEST
COMMERCIAL WIND FARM.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.978
TO SEE THOSE WIND TURBINES
STANDING THERE,

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:55.281
THEY'RE MAGNIFICENT.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.350
THE EVA CREEK WIND TURBINES
ARE BIG.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.751
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A REDWOOD?

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:02.622
THESE ARE THE SAME SIZE
OF AN AVERAGE SIZE REDWOOD.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:05.090 line:0%
JUST THE SOUND OF IT
WHEN IT'S IN FULL PRODUCTION

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.660 line:0%
IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.062
THEY'RE HUGE.

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:11.331
THEY SEEM LIKE A SKYSCRAPER.

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.632
Narrator: THIS IS HOW IT WORKS.

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:15.134
THE TURBINES CREATE POWER

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:17.236
WHEN STRONG WINDS
TURN THE BLADES,

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:19.239
WHICH ARE CONNECTED
TO GENERATORS.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.540
FROM THERE, IT TRAVELS DOWN

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.374
INTO WHAT WE CALL
A COLLECTION SYSTEM

00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:23.509
AND THEN ONTO THE GRID.

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:24.844
Narrator: ALL 12 WIND TURBINES

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:28.547
CAN GENERATE UP TO 24.6
MEGAWATTS OF ELECTRICITY

00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:31.150
TO HELP POWER
THE INTERIOR OF ALASKA.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.919
THAT ADDS UP OVER THE COURSE
OF A YEAR.

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.855
THE WHOLE SITE
HAS PRODUCED ENOUGH

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:38.725
FOR 11,000 HOUSES
FOR A WHOLE YEAR.
