00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.458
So we just identified which
graph actually met our criteria,

00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:06.358
of going through a point and
having a certain slope.

00:00:06.358 --> 00:00:08.778
But how do I generate that graph myself?

00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:13.399
Well let's say that a line goes through
the point negative two, five and

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:16.090
has a slope of negative three-fourths.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.940
Well, my first step is to find
the point negative two, five.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.450
Negative one, negative two and
then up one, two, three, four, five.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.830
Now my next step is to obey
the commands given by the slope.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.820
To find the next point,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.370
by finding which point would have a rise
of negative three and a run of four.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.100
So can you tell me what's the next
point that I should plot?

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.320
And you can just click
the appropriate place on the graph.
