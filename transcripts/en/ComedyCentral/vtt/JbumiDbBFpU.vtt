- Good morning.

00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:05.438
- We're alive?
- Yes!

00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:08.641 align:end position:100%
The storm veered off course
at the last moment.

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:11.444 size:88% position:44%
- But the captain said that
the ship was breaking apart.

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:13.446 align:end position:100%
- Yes, I'm told
he always says that,

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.281 align:end position:100%
but...
[smacks lips]

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.083 align:start size:69% position:31%
We are safe and sound.

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:19.318 align:end position:100%
Speaking of which,
you made a sound

00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:22.355 align:end position:100%
that was positively
jaguar-ian last night.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.293 align:end position:100%
Well, now I thought
we could start the day

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:29.295 size:84% position:58%
with a bit of shuffleboard,

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:33.766 align:end position:100%
and then begin our lives
as we've always dreamt:

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:34.834 align:start size:28% position:72%
together.

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.269 align:start position:0%
- Together?

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:37.336 align:start size:19% position:81%
- Yes!

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.205 align:start size:75% position:25%
Just as we said we would

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:42.208 align:end position:100%
whilst in the throes
of lovemaking

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:45.078 align:end position:100%
and believing
we were about to die.
