00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.100
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good afternoon
and thank you all for coming.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.500
I mean we have a very
special program today

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.650
and our speaker has come all
the way from Paris to be with us

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.030
and to share her research.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.170
I want to welcome her and of course

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.280
to welcome Her Imperial
Highness the Shahbanou

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.250
who has been a great
supporter of this library,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.810
who has been a great
supporter of our programs

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.180
and four years ago we had a
big exhibit on A Thousand Years

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.480
of the Persian Book and it
not been for Her Highness,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.100
we would hot have been
able to make it.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.700
She was-- she was there behind us.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.260
She met with Dr. Billington
and said A Thousand Years

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.090
of the Persian Book, we
have to support this effort

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.230
and the whole Iranian-American
community rallied behind her

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.710
and were able to put
together the first

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.740
and the spectacular
exhibit of the Persian book.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.180
So, I am Mary-Jane Deeb, Chief of
the African Middle East Division

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.570
and I'm here to welcome you
all and also as a reminder

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.480
that this division, with the
support of its members and--

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:53.330 position:56%
who are scholars, writers, thinkers,
and people who have a deep interest

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.420
in the region, stand out and make a
program such as this one possible.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:11.250
Dr. Layla Diba is a major scholar
in the arts and history of Iran

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.990
and she has an incredible career
which will be shared with you

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:26.510
in a moment, but I just wanted
to be here to express a--

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.390
my gratitude to those who have
supported us like Your Highness.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.600
So, I am passing now the baton to
the head of the near east section

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.750
who is going to say a few
words of welcome as well.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.510
Thank you.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.740
[ Applause ]

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Thank you, Mary-Jane.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.300
Good afternoon ladies and
gentlemen and particular Highness.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.860 position:56%
I'm thrilled to have you here today.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.170
On behalf of all my colleagues, I'd
like to welcome you to the African

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.260
and Middle East Division and a
very warm welcome to everyone,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.250
particularly about this program
Kamal al Mulk and the Invention

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.360
of the Modern Iranian Landscape.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.320
But, before we start
today's program,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.330
we always like to give our
newcomers a little overview.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.030
I'm afraid some of
us have heard this

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.040
for every single program
they've been to, but we'd still

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.610 position:56%
like to give everybody a little
welcome orientation to our division.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.600
This is a custodial division,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.030
which means that we actually
have the books in our purview,

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.070
in our custody, and this means
that we build and serve collections

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.430 position:56%
to researchers from around the
world and we cover over 78 countries

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.760
and over two dozen languages.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.140
The African section includes all of
the countries of Sub-Sahara Africa

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.070
and the Judaic or Hebraic
section covers Judaica worldwide

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.370
and the Near East section covers
all of the Arab countries,

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.740
including North Africa, Turkey,
Turkic Central Asia, Iran,

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.580
of course, and Afghanistan, and
the Muslims of Western China

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.350
and the peoples of the caucuses.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.200
So, it's a very extensive region
and we hope you'll come back

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.140
and use our collections
for your research.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.560
And just a couple notes
of housekeeping.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.170
After the program, we invite
you to fill in our survey.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.660
This helps us plan for
future programs and also we'd

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.310
like to invite you to try out
our Facebook and our blog.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.110
We've left little papers so
you can easily find them.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.780
Our curators are writing
very interesting blog posts

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.020
about special parts of the
collection and if you like us

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.520
on Facebook you'll find out about
all sorts of other programs.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.070
So, please do that.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.470
And also, just one last
thing, we'd like to remind you

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.720
that this program's being
videocast, so if you would

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.020
like to answer a quest--

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.770
ask a question, then you're
implicitly giving your permission

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.230
to be videotaped.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.900
So, without further ado, I'd
like to call upon my colleague,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.280
Hirad Dinavari, to
introduce the speaker.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.080
Thank you.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.220
[ Applause ]

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.520
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Thank you, Joan.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.820
Thank you, Mary-Jane.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.480
Thank you everyone for coming
on a busy weekday and on

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.550 position:56%
such a beautiful day where you could
probably be outside enjoying the

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.850
fresh weather.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.990
We are very honored to have Her
Royal Highness Farah Diba here

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.290
with us.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.070
Total surprise and shock and we are
very delighted that you're here,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.790
thank you, and thank you
again personally for all

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.150
of your help with that exhibition.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.880
It was not going to happen
without the help that you gave us.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.170
We are also very happy
that every year for Nowruz,

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:56.480
the festival of spring that brings
together vast regions all the way

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.910
from Western China to the
Balkans, many, many nationalities

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.010 position:56%
and many groups, Turkic and Iranian,

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.850
we do a cultural Nowruz
event every year.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:12.930 position:56%
It is a huge honor to have a curator
at the caliber of Dr. Layla Diba,

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.560
who has accepted to come here
and give this wonderful talk.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.070
So, I am going to not take too
much time and Dr. Diba has a CV

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.700
that is very long and I will try
to give you a few highlights here

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.710
and then give the rest of
the time for her to speak.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.610
Our Nowruz lecturer
figure, Dr. Layla Diba,

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.930
is an independent scholar,
arts advisor, and curator.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.440
She has been the director
and chief curator

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.230
of the Negarestan Museum in Tehran.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:49.560
Negarestan-- I'm sorry-- Negarestan
Museum in Tehran from 75 to 79.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.160
Arts advisor for the
private secretariat

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.520
of Her Majesty Queen Farah Diba,
and the Hagop Kevorkian curator

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.490
of Islamic art at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:06.820
In 2006, Dr. Diba was invited to
develop programming and strategy

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.440
for the future of the Guggenheim's
Abu Dhabi Museum and to serve

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:18.080
on the museum's Asian Art Council
and the Middle East focus group.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.760
She has curated the landmark--
the landmark The Qajar Epoch.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.990
This is a book that
is really a textbook.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.290
I have to tell you, as a librarian,

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.020
I have referred many
researchers including myself

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.250
to this book on Qajar painting.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.980
So, The Qajar Epoch Royal
Persian Paintings exhibition

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.370
and the Brooklyn-- at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.850
This was an exhibit and
the book came with it.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.360
The book itself is a treasure
trove of paintings that go back,

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.180
if I'm correct, to the
Afsharid period and it comes

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.970
down to the end of the Qajars.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.270
It's wonderful book.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:59.470
The list of accomplishments
go on and on and on.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.460
I would just like to
come to the end and say

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.350
from the many articles she has
written that are scholarly,

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.540
that are published in
scholarly publications,

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.330
she also sits on the board
of Encyclopedia Iranica

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.710
and the Soudavar Memorial
Foundations.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:20.920 position:56%
She is also the collector of Persian
Islamic art and the benefactor

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.230
and the advocate of numerous
Persian cultural causes.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:29.630
Current projects include a study
of Kamal al Mulk and the emergence

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.120
of Iranian landscape painting,
which we have the honor

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.660
of hearing her first
talk about this,

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.120
as this has been something
she's been working on,

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.630 position:56%
and the emergence of-- I said that--

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:46.410
and articles and contemporary
Iranian artists like Shirin Neshat

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.510
and Nikzad Nojoomi as well.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:54.420 position:56%
So, without taking any further time,
thank you again for making time

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.130
to come down here and
see us and give a talk.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.930
Please.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:03.500
[ Applause ]

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.020
&gt;&gt; Layla Diba: Your
Majesty, honored guests.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.740
Thank you to my colleagues from the
Library of Congress and to Hirad

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.910
for your kind words and
for inviting me to lecture

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.500
on this auspicious occasion
of the Persian new year.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.070
I am delighted-- is there
light, by any chance?

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.910
Can I have more light?

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:37.740
OK. I'm delighted to speak about
Qajar art again in the presence

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:43.020
of Her Majesty Shahbanou Farah
who is the founder and patron

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.760
of the Negarestan Museum of 18th
and 19th century Iranian art,

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.630
which I had the honor to
direct from 1975 to 1978

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.890
and which really was the impetus

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:02.720
for a lifelong interest
and career in the arts.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.390
Just for your information, since
this lecture really is a preview

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:13.290
of unpublished work, the text
and the images are copyrighted.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:19.860
The recent discovery of a group of
six late 19th century Iranian oil

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.890
on canvas landscape
paintings and a large corpus

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:30.350 position:56%
of 19th century Iranian photographs
held in a private collection outside

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:35.490
of Iran has provided the
impetus for today's lecture.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.430
I wish to express my thanks
to the owners for permission

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.440
to present these works for
the first time to the public

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.060 position:56%
and we hope they will be the subject

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.750
of a comprehensive
future publication.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:53.610 position:56%
The corpus of landscapes was
painted by the leading court painter

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:59.570
of the Nasiri era Mohammad Ghaffari
Kamal al Mulk, 1859 to 1922,

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:05.580
who was also the principal exponent
of European-style academic painting

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.580
in the late Qajar and
early Pahlavi eras.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.580
Kamal al Mulk is perhaps best
known for his portraiture

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:20.060
and architectural views, but
my current research has led me

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:26.500
to conclude that he had an abiding
interest in the genre of landscape.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:34.120
I will argue that these landscape
paintings present critical new

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.400
evidence for the development
of Kamal al Mulk's [inaudible]

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.170
and that they play a
significant role in the emergence

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:47.800
of the Iranian landscape of the
late Qajar and early Pahlavi eras.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.940
A subject which has hitherto
been largely unexplored.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.910
The works fall into two
chronological groups,

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.210
as you will see.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:03.020 position:56%
The first group features four views
of Iranian mountain landscapes dated

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:08.370
to the 1880's, which are among
his earliest known works.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:13.170
The second group is comprised
of two European landscapes,

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:19.040
which may be assigned to
sometime between 1898 and 1901,

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.330
executed either in
Florence or in Paris,

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.870
both of which he lived
in at that time.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:31.340
As a group, the paintings
are remarkably fresh

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.010
and largely unrecorded.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.220
The landscapes and their
lengthy inscriptions

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:41.980
by Kamal al Mulk himself--
you can see on the lower left

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:46.230
or right there are like two,
three lines of inscriptions.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:50.730
Giving details of date and
location provide the framework--

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.710
thank you so much--
for our discussion.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.160
First, I will discuss
Nasiri court culture

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.700
in Kamal al Mulk's
career-- thank you so much.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:05.580
Second, I will present an analysis
of Kamal al Mulk's landscapes

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:13.040
of the 1880's and his post-1900
landscapes and those of his school,

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.210
the [inaudible] Kamal al Mulk.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.580
And, finally, consider
their significance

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:23.810
for the Iranian landscape tradition
and the birth of Iranian modernism.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:28.350
So, first, Nasiri court
culture, the setting.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:34.020
Court culture of the era of
Nassereddin Shah, 1848 to 1896,

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:39.420 position:56%
was dominated by the will and whims
of the autocratic ruler and centered

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:44.210
in the Golestan Palace, the
site of a precarious balance

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.450
between Persian tradition
and European modernity.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.460
Certain features pertain
directly to the production

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.800
of the landscape corpus
under discussion.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.770
The era was marked
by the introductions

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:02.000
and enthusiastic acceptance
of photography.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.720
Students were sent abroad to
study, particularly to Paris,

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.920
and a European academy-style
art curriculum was taught

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:18.370
at the Dar ul-Funun, the royal
military college, as of 1862.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:23.160
The role-- the ruler created a
museum for his collection as well

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.110
as designated galleries within
the premises of the palace.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:32.230
He founded also an office
of publication and printing

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:36.310
for a vast program of
historical and scientific texts,

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:40.440
European translations, and
the Royal Court Gazette.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.760
These innovations served to
enforce the power of the Shah

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.590
by presenting an image of a
modern and effective ruler

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.870
and by mapping his territories

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:54.600
and recording information
on his subjects.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.400
In these endeavors, he was assisted
by a vast array of courtiers

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.340
and ministries, many
of whom were invested

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:10.160
in introducing European culture,
technology, and eventually reforms.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.200
These institutions were
accompanied by court activities

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.680 position:56%
such as yearly European-style
exhibitions of artists' work modeled

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.920
on the Salon d'Automne in Paris

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.660
and more traditional
Persian kingly pursuits

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:30.930
such as court entertainment,
visits to the harem, hunting trips,

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.530
and more rarely military
expeditions.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:40.560
The Dar ul-Funun housed both
photographic and painting studios,

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.840
both of which would have been known

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.300
to Kamal al Mulk during his
formative years as a court artist.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:53.240
Thousands of photographs produced
for the court have survived.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.280
Although the portraits and images

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:04.030
of archeological sites are the
most well-know of the photographs,

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:09.310
three previously unknown
court stereophotographs,

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:14.100
of which you see one on the
screen, of the Iranian landscape

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.230
and royal encampments which
were commissioned by the rule

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.280
from the court photographer
[inaudible]

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.400
in the 1860's have
recently been published

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.140
and these you see on the screen.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.870
The photographs are
inscribed by the ruler

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.350
and by Ali Reza [assumed
spelling] and give the locations

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:40.180
of [inaudible] and
Aliabad as the sites.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.770
Unfortunately, further evidence

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:46.410
from Golestan collections
remains unpublished.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:53.010
However, now another very
large corpus of photographs

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.580
and landscape photographs outside

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.980
of Iran has been brought
to my attention.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:03.860
The three photographs serve
as intriguing precedents

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.030
for the landscapes
painted by Kamal al Mulk

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:11.990
with almost photographic
realism in the 1880's.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:16.770
More interestingly,
the new photographs,

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:21.670
which I will discuss again
shortly, are even closer in date

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:23.890
to Kamal al Mulk's landscapes.

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.800
As you can see, it's dated 1870's.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.780
Information on landscape painting
at the Dar ul-Funun is sparse

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.090
and we need to open a parenthesis
on the development of this genre

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:41.110
in Persian painting
before Kamal al Mulk.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.630
Until the mid-17th century

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:48.840
when European painting influenced
Persian painting traditions,

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:54.120
the Persian landscape was
depicted in manuscripts in flat,

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.800
decorative, and semiabstract style.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:03.300
Then European-style landscapes
with modeling and recession,

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.390
chiefly associated with the court
painter Mohamad Aman became the

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:13.180
vogue for manuscript painting and
lacquer work of the 17th century.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:18.760
The next development does not
occur until the mid-19th century.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:23.160
Landscape backgrounds of Sani'
al-Mulk's watercolor illustrations

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:28.260
for the Thousand and One
Nights manuscript, about 1853.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:33.280
When we see a new infusion of
European painting techniques,

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.740
there may also have been an
awareness of European landscapes

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.860
through the interaction
of Iranian artists

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:46.980
with European artist diplomats and
officers such as Colonel Colombari

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.220
who flocked to Iran during
the mid- to late-19th century.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:56.380
However, the interest
in pure landscape seems

00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:03.000 position:56%
to have been only limited since only
a single painting with a landscape

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.290
by Kamal al Mulk's
teacher has survived.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:12.270
Kamal al Mulk's Iranian landscapes
would never have been produced

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:18.040 position:56%
without the ruler's patronage, which
encouraged competition and rivalry

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:23.060
between bazaar craftsman, court
painters, and photographer.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.460
Another factor was probably
the publication program

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:31.050
of Mohammad-Hasan Khan E'temad
al-Saltaneh, the court chronicler

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.690
and chief minister for publication.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.250
In addition to histories
of the reign,

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:41.840
the ruler commissioned
historical geographies of Khorasan,

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:47.080 position:56%
such as the [inaudible] and the most
likely candidate for the context

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.050
of Kamal al Mulk's
Iranian landscape,

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:55.770
the historical geographic
dictionary, Mirat-ul-Buldan.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:01.090
This work was based on
E'temad's data and observation

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:06.820
of the provinces collected in the
1880's on the order of the Shah.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:11.440
As recently noted by Abbas
Amanat, this project was informed

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.250
by a new awareness of
topography and the boundaries

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:20.950
of Persia as a national entity.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:25.790 position:56%
These developments occurred after
the Shah's first two trips to Europe

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:34.410
in 1873 and 1878 and reflect the
ruler's awareness of the importance

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:40.010 position:56%
of documenting and controlling his
domains vis a vis those he had seen.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:43.820
Kamal al Mulk's ascendency as
a court artist and confidant

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.890
of the ruler would coincide
with these programs.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:53.270
So, we will look at his career
from the 1870's to 1901,

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:56.470
which is the framework
of our paintings.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:59.720
Kamal al Mulk was born
in 1859 to a family

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.680
of prominent courtier statesman
and artists from Kashan.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.830
His early training as an artist
began with apprenticeship

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:13.060
with his uncle, Abolhassan Ghaffari
Sani' al-Mulk, chief court painter

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:18.040
of Muhammad and Nassereddin Shahs,
who had received training in Italy

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.550
in classical painting and in the
use of the lithographic press.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:26.460
Sani' al-Mulk became a
teacher at the Dar ul-Funun,

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.280 position:56%
where prints of old master paintings

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.610
and plaster casts he
had brought back

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:34.440
from Europe were part
of the curriculum.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:39.630
Sani' al-Mulk was also editor
of the illustrated Court Gazette

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.140
and recipient of major
commissions such as the Thousand

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.170
and One Nights manuscript

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:49.030
and the [inaudible] wall
paintings of the Nasiri court.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:52.120
After the death of
his uncle in 1866,

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:57.260 position:56%
Kamal al Mulk continued his studies
at the Dar ul-Funun for eight years.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.550
During the 1870's,
he studied painting

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.950
with Mirza Ali Akbar
Mozayyen-od-Doleh,

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:08.290
also born in Kashan, who was
Sani' al-Mulk's successor

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.540
at the Dar ul-Funun.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:14.950
Mozayyen-od-Doleh was a
graduate or the only graduate

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:18.190
of the Academie des
Beaux-Arts in Paris,

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:21.300
which he frequented in the 1850's.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:25.200
He faithfully applied the
methods of the French academy

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.800
and probably retained aspects

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.760
of the curriculum already
introduced by Sani' al-Mulk.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.280
Kamal al Mulk maintained

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:40.730 position:56%
that Mozayyen-od-Doleh quote unquote
was a trained artist in academic art

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:47.410
and that quote I learned the art
of painting from no one by myself.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:59.060
A still life you see on this
screen dated 1907-8 and a copy

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:03.370
of the mid-19th century French
artist Rosa Bonheur's iconic

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:07.630
painting attests to
this artist's skills.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:11.600
As evidenced by the landscape
which you see in the background

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.980
of the painting Ploughing Time,

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.500
Mozayyen-od-Doleh's
landscapes were composed after

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:24.880 position:56%
and closely followed European models
painted in the artist's studio.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:30.350
OK? This is very important that
they are copied from other versions

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.160
that were actually
painted in the studio.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:39.460
And these confirm Kamal al Mulk's
statement and the originality

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.540
of Kamal al Mulk's
open-air practice,

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.940 position:56%
which you will see in a few minutes.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:50.200
Now, Kamal al Mulk's skill soon
caught the attention of the Shah

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:56.710
who appointed him one of his
personal attendants and, in 1881,

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:58.090
court painter [inaudible].

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:03.600
During the following years until
the ruler's assassination in 1896,

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.430
Kamal al Mulk executed portraits
of the ruler, such as you saw

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:14.370 position:56%
at the beginning, the famous hall of
mirrors, and of the court, palace,

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:19.050
and of the court notables and
landscape views that surpassed all

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:24.160
of his contemporary in their
almost photographic naturalism,

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.080
attention to detail,
and color sense.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.770
His renderings of the hall of
mirrors, the Takiya-ye Dawlat

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.930
and the [inaudible] are
considered among his masterpieces,

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:38.990
yet he also showed an
interest in genre scenes set

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.270
in contemporary urban settings

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:45.980
such as his paintings
of geomancers and women.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.960
Kamal al Mulk appears to
have accompanied the ruler

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:55.370 position:56%
on his trips throughout the
provinces and this is a major theory

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.940
that we have been developing--

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.940
I've been developing thanks
to this close scrutiny

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.240
of this group of paintings.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.500 position:56%
So, the idea that Kamal al Mulk
accompanied the ruler throughout the

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:11.860 position:56%
providence and his landscape and
encampment scenes, which you'll see,

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.270
were executed en plein air.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:18.090
The only artist of his
era to have done so.

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:21.160
Photography did play a
role in his practice,

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.890
particularly in portraiture
and memorial portraits,

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.830
but it was his extraordinary skill
as a painter which is revealed

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.580
in the works he produced in
the decades when he was working

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:38.260
for the court, including the
landscapes under consideration.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:43.230
His great painterly skills were
thus evident even before his trip

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:46.820
to Europe where he would
study the old masters

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.800
and modern painters directly.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.810
A year and a half after
the ruler's death,

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:56.780
Kamal al Mulk requested permission
to go to Europe to study.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.960
He remained there for a very
long time, for about three years.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.330
According to his memoirs,
he studied first in Florence

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:10.790
with the royal portrait
painter Michele Gordigiani,

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:14.100
who was active until 1909.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.800
Now, Gordigiani is a
documented painter.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.880
He was academic in training,
but with a [inaudible]

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:27.240
for naturalism known in Italy
as the Macchiaioli movement.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:32.350
Kamal al Mulk expresses his
admiration for the style

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:36.640
of naturalism in addition to
his better-known appreciation

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.700
of the old masters in his memoirs.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.000
Now, as a parenthesis,
what was naturalism?

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.440
It was a mid- to late-19th
century European cultural

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.230
and literary movement which
originated in France with the works

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:56.360
of Emile Zola and included painters
such as Courbet at the beginning.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:01.990 position:56%
It was contemporary with
impressionism and it espoused a form

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:08.920 position:56%
of heightened realism with social
political awareness that was lacking

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.260
in the light-hearted
scenes of picnics

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:16.550
and open-air entertainments
favored by the impressionists.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:21.810
So, given Kamal al Mulk's
support of the constitutionalists,

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:27.440
the [foreign phrase] or
intellectuals and of freemasonry,

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.660
it seemed logical he would be drawn

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.250
to this movement, which
he encountered.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.490
Now, back to Gordigiani.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:39.730
He was the official Italian court
painter and although he seems

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:44.540
to have appreciated Kamal al
Mulk's talents, he also abused it,

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:48.480
according to the painter
who claimed in his memoirs

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:56.300
that Gordigiani passed off as his
own work this portrait of the ruler

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.180
of Siam, which was actually
painted by Kamal al Mulk.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.660 position:56%
And, believe it or not, my assistant
actually located this painting

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.960
on the internet.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.380
We have no idea where it is,

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:11.930
but the idea that there is a
Kamal al Mulk original out there

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:16.490
that I don't know who signed it,
I assume it has the signature

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:19.280
of Gordigiani in it,
but in his memoirs,

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.410
Kamal al Mulk says
that he painted this.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:27.390
So, those are the vagaries of
being a student of a great master.

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:31.120
After a year and a half,
Kamal al Mulk went on to Paris

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.610
where he rented a studio in the
artist's quarter and copied works

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:40.180
of the old masters such as
Rembrandt and Titian in the Louvre.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:45.020
He also copied Italian
landscapes and executed portraits

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:48.230
of his fellow artists such
as Henri Fantin-Latour,

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:52.980 position:56%
the French realist painter, and a
series of remarkable self-portraits.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:59.710 position:56%
His main achievement, in my view, in
Europe was to perfect his knowledge

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:03.530
of the techniques of illusionistic
painting, which he had learned

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:07.700
through his own practice
in Iran previously,

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.570
and to familiarize himself
with the theories on naturalism

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:17.160
and literature and art, which were
in vogue in that time in Europe.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.700
Although Kamal al Mulk worked
as a court painter for a year,

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:25.210
on his return to Iran, he did
not like Mozaffar ad-Din Shah

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:29.850
or his questionable taste in art,
so Kamal al Mulk retired himself

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:33.250
to Baghdad and Karbala
for over two years.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.390
It is from this period that a
shift in subject matter occurs

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:41.950
with greater attention paid
to urban scenes and images

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.170
of the everyday life
of ordinary people.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:48.770
This represented a major
evolution in the visual language

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:52.410
of Persian painting and
would have a lasting effect

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.750
on its subsequent development.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:59.470
The following analysis will discuss
the role of landscape painting

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:03.940
in the chronological
evolution of his practice

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:08.510
and highlight the significance
of this new genre, landscape,

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:11.500
for modern Iranian painting.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:17.540
The first group of mountainous
landscape was painted circa 1882

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:26.130
and 1883, but I've not made a
finalized reading of all the dates.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:29.590
These years coincide with
Kamal al Mulk's early years

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.500
as a court artist.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:36.320
Analysis of the iconography,
topography, and inscriptions

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:41.060
of these works confirm they
were most likely executed

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.950 position:56%
when he accompanied the ruler on
his frequent trips to the provinces.

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:51.310
The inscriptions provide many
locations from the area of Tehran

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:57.530
and Mazandaran and I want to thank
my research assistant Layah Bigdeli

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:02.370
for creating this map of all
the locations of his paintings.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:05.790
The inscriptions, which
conform in style with those

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.220
of his other published
inscribed works,

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.740
do not specifically
mention a royal commission.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.790
Meaning there is never the
phrase [foreign language].

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:17.790
OK? To the order of.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:22.960
However, numerous trips by the
ruler to this area are recorded

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:28.310
by E'temad al-Saltaneh in his daily
journal by year, day, and month.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:31.190
So, the entries coincide
approximately

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:36.040
with the locations given in the
works themselves, which is--

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:41.260 position:56%
yes, it's like a goldmine for an
art historian to be able to do that.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:46.520
So, all the works are
painted in rectangular format

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:51.440
from a high viewpoint which
would provide a panoramic view

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.680
of the valley and of the mountains.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:58.460
In order to analyze the
relationship between photography

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:03.700
and Kamal al Mulk's practice,
comparison with the larger corpus

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:08.630
of landscape photographs from
the previously mentioned private

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:12.170
collection and from the
Golestan is needed, but--

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:15.420
which is beyond the
parameters of today's talk.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:22.890
So, what I've done is with a single
comparison between this image

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:29.080
and this early photograph, these
are both views of the same site

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.030
and this we know from
reading the inscriptions.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:36.360
A location called Kayvan Shokoh
[assumed spelling], an encampment.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.300 position:56%
So, you see Kamal al Mulk's painting

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:43.490
and the photograph
of the same location.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:48.770
We see how his choice
differentiates his work

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.030
from the published images taken
by the court photographers.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:58.320
You can see the photographs
are square format close ups

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:03.340
of anecdotal scenes with
the landscape barely visible

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.640
in the background.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.570
So, a completely different
approach and concern

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:08.870
from that of the painter.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:16.150 position:56%
The compositions are dominated by
rolling hills and mountain foothills

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:21.060 position:56%
in the background and feature
verdant valleys in the middle ground

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:25.500
and dark, rocky outcrops
in the foreground.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.980
Three of the paintings
show large tent encampments

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.700
in the middle ground.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.520
The scale of the encampments
and the presence

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:39.860 position:56%
of red textile partitions separating
off the main tent indicate these are

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.860
royal encampments.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.540
The View of the Bend on the
River, which you see here,

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:50.490
features a wandering river and
groups of trees on the hillsides

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:56.570
as well as small retainers in black
in the foreground and a mule train

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:59.300
which gives scale to
the whole scene.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:05.260
A View of [inaudible] depicts
a small village clinging

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:09.570
to the mountainside with an
[inaudible] in the foreground

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:13.430
and gardens and houses
in the very front.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:20.890
As a rule, the foreground acts
as a repertoire and the rules

00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:25.700
of landscape recession, modeling,
perspective, aerial recession,

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:29.450
and the direction of light
are faithfully observed

00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:32.140
in the artist's treatment
of the hills.

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:34.550
Careful attention is paid

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:38.100
to detailed rendering
also of vegetation.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.420
Sometimes green and
dotted with trees.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.060
Sometimes arid and craggy.

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:47.090
And to do the texture
of the rough earth.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:52.450
The contrast between green
and arid areas is typical

00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:56.710
of the Iranian landscape
between Tehran and the Caspian,

00:34:56.710 --> 00:35:02.610
a favorite area for picnicking
and more prolonged country stays.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:05.080
The palette is also earthy.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:10.460
Terracotta and olive green
shot through with white.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:15.340
Crystal clear blue is used
for the water and the sky.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:20.460
The minute white tents with
their pointed tops are scattered

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:24.590
across the landscape as so many
exclamation points is our small

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.680
black figures and animals.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:32.290 position:56%
The paintings have a roughly
sketchy surface, not highly polished

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:37.320
and finished, as if the artist
wanted to capture the immediacy

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.260
and specificity of his experience.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.770
This is confirmed by
the inscriptions

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:46.450
which give the exact direction
of the artist's viewpoint.

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:48.880
This is so remarkable.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:52.580
He says it's taken from the north,
it shows the east and the west,

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:53.980
it's the view through this valley.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.850 position:56%
So, these inscriptions-- the reading

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:58.730
of these inscriptions
is very critical.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:03.370 position:56%
The careful realism and photographic
details suggest these paintings may

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:07.050
have had a scientific or
illustrative purpose linked

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:10.680
to the ruler's previously
discussed policy of recording

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.660
and surveying his domains

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:15.700
and to E'temad al-Saltaneh's
numerous publications.

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.280
This is entirely theoretical,
but we need--

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:22.590
we need to have some theory here.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:26.430
Now, let us review the
evidence of this group in light

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:29.540
of the artist's known
landscape [inaudible].

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:33.430
With this discovery, four new
works are added to the corpus

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:38.190
of 37 landscapes currently
known and these are all listed--

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:42.790
I wrote a joint article with
Ahmad Ashraf on Kamal al Mulk

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:44.620
in the Encyclopedia Iranica.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.930
Dr. Ashraf really did
the very hard work

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:51.380
of listing almost every
known work of Kamal al Mulk.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.880
For those of you who
would like to go further.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.110
So, at that point, there
were 37 landscapes.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:04.200
So, now we added four more
to these, plus another six.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:08.450
The four works we just discussed
in conjunction with a few others

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:11.100
from the decades before
Kamal al Mulk went

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.840
to Europe illustrate the
painter's increasing skill

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.600
in composition in painting
technique.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:23.210
So, you can see the artist learning
and teaching himself and get--

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:26.950
this is 1888, about four years
later than the early ones,

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:31.330
and you can really see the
amazing progress he's made.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:36.630
By the late 1880's, Kamal al Mulk's
landscape become more monumental

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:40.440
and awe-inspiring, not
unlike the paintings

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.520
of the Hudson River School
capturing the majesty

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.920
of the Alborz mountain
range and the sharp contrast

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.650
with the plains and plateaus below.

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:56.960
By 1891, his focus has turned to
the human element in the landscape.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.340
In his depiction of
a tent encampment,

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.090
which you see on the screen,

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:05.000
which pre-stages the artist's
more naturalistic approach

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.560
after his return from Europe.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:12.440
I now turn to the two
Italianate landscapes

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.720
which share sufficient
features to have been painted

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.460
at the same time and place.

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:28.190
One is signed and dated
1898-99, [inaudible] 1316,

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:30.250
and the other bears an inscription.

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:33.660
A very interesting inscription
which states it was copied

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:37.580
from an Italian painting
and given in exchange

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.250
for a work to another painter.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.910
So, his inscriptions are
incredibly chatty and informative

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:46.450
about even the relations
between artists and none

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:51.290
of this is currently known or
recorded in the study of his work.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:56.140
This episode between painters could
have occurred in either Florence

00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:01.690
or Paris since the dates
bridge the time in both cities.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.980
Stylistically, the
paintings share many feature

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:10.530
with Jean-Baptiste Camille
Corot, whose work you see

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:15.170
on the screen compared
with Kamal al Mulk's work.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:21.840
Italian landscapes by Corot
such-- and you see, as I said,

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:25.880
the comparison is when
Corot visited Italy.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:31.680 position:56%
And you see similarities such as the
focus on the bridges and aqueducts,

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:36.910
the style of the houses, the
flat treatment of the surface,

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:38.480
and the attention to light.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.890
These are all new.

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:45.270
However, an exact model remains
to be identified, but I haven't

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:50.090
yet gone through every single one
of Corot's thousands of paintings,

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:53.980
so I'm still hopeful,
but this is very close.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.900
The prototype could also
have been, we must admit,

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:01.430
by a later Italian
follower of Corot's style.

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:07.720 position:56%
Although Corot was active earlier in
the 19th century than Kamal al Mulk,

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.790
he was still extremely popular
at the turn of the century

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:15.740
and would have been held up to
the painter as a worthy model

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:20.180
of western landscape
painting to emulate.

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:24.090
As was the case with
the four previous works,

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:28.380
the two Italian landscape--
and here is the second one--

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:33.620 position:56%
I have identified this as an Italian
landscape based on the vegetation

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:37.290
and the presence of the
church in the middle ground.

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:42.220
They also document a key moment
in Kamal al Mulk's evolution.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.390
After his European trip,

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:49.350
he continued to paint
landscapes until the 1920's.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:54.640
There are-- these are
considerably looser in brush work

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:59.260
with a softer palette
and so fused with light

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:02.330
and air compared to
his earlier attempts.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:07.240
The two Italian landscapes
illustrate just how he got there.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.140
How do we get from here to there?

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:15.760
We may now asset that in all Kamal
al Mulk painted over 42 landscapes,

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:20.810
a considerable portion of his
[inaudible] throughout his career.

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:25.170
Now we pass finally to
the last part of my talk,

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:29.090
the invention of an
Iranian landscape.

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:32.420
The introduction and
development of the new genre

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:36.970
of European-style landscape
painting is a neglected aspect

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:41.190
of Kamal al Mulk's contribution
to modern Iranian art.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:47.030
The importance of his legacy,
which can be seen in the works

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:51.260
of his followers who studied
with him at the famous school

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.320
that Kamal al Mulk directed
for a very long time

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.470
in the early 20th century.

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:01.680
And, principally, Ali
Mohammad Heydarian.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:09.960 position:56%
Here on the screen, you see a work
by Ghaffari and a work by Heydarian.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:15.110
It is worth noting that
besides Kamal al Mulk's school,

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:17.780
which again you see--
with this comparison,

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.600
you can see how much
influence Heydarian

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:27.090 position:56%
and how closely he followed him--
besides the school of Kamal al Mulk,

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:31.070
there was also some
proponents of the school

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:35.960
of Europeanate [phonetic] landscape
style, but this time channeled

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.250
through Russian 19th
century painting.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:43.640
This was passed on
by the Rashti artist

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.690
and teacher Sayed Mohammed Habib
Mohammedi [assumed spelling]

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:51.500
and by another painter, Hod
Hussain Rasadi [assumed spelling]

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.460
to a new generation of artists
who were to become the pioneers

00:42:55.460 --> 00:43:00.810
of modernism, such as [inaudible],
Nikzad Nojoomi, and [inaudible]

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:04.610
who were all students of Mohammedi.

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:09.960 position:56%
In conclusion, Kamal al Mulk's early
landscape paintings may be seen

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.130
as part of experiments
and documentation

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:18.790
for the court enterprise of
recording and presenting an image

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:24.710
of Qajar Iran, an image based on,
they thought, empirical evidence.

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:28.430
When viewed in conjunction with
his later landscape paintings,

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:32.060
they also reveal to
be-- Kamal al Mulk

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:36.520
to be the truly innovative
artist he claimed to be.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:42.010
So, I view even artist's memoirs
with skepticism, but, in this case,

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:47.490
we I think confirm that indeed
how innovative he was early

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:48.790
in his career.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:51.450
The only known painter
of his generation

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:55.580
to compose his paintings outside
the studio is really remarkable.

00:43:55.580 --> 00:44:00.190
Equally important, the
Italianate works form a bridge

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:05.830
to his later landscapes using
a more modern visual language.

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:09.560
Hopefully we have advanced
our understanding

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:13.710
of later Persian painting and
its art historical issues.

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:18.640
These paintings are key works in
the evolution of Kamal al Mulk

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:23.550
from academic painting for the
court to naturalist paining

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:29.850
of Iranian modern life which was
to have the most profound influence

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:33.850 position:56%
on the course of Iranian modern art.

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:41.790 position:56%
The formation of Iranian modern art
involved not only European stylistic

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:46.330
and iconographic conventions,
but the introduction

00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:51.080
of new subject matter and genre
such as the realistic portrait

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:55.740
and what we've been discussing
today, the independent landscapes;

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.770
both of which would
have been impossible

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.400 position:56%
without the genius of Kamal al Mulk.

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.200
Thank you.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:12.460
[ Applause ]

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:13.760
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari:
Thank you, Dr. Diba.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.230
We have room for some questions.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:16.700
Feel free to ask.

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:20.380
&gt;&gt; That was good.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.030
Thank you very much.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:25.400
I mean that was very exciting
and it was an eye-opener.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:31.660
I wanted to ask you his painting
was primarily the landscape

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:32.960
in rural areas.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:36.120
Did he do anything in the city?

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.420
Did he--

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:38.720
&gt;&gt; Layla Diba: Yes.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.020
&gt;&gt; Major cities in Iran.

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:42.680
Did he try to convey as--

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:46.580
&gt;&gt; Layla Diba: Well, almost
everything he did in the beginning

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.270
of his career was to
record the architecture

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:55.960
of the Golestan Palace complex
and so there are many views

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.200
of the architecture and the
different buildings in the--

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:03.570
and I showed one, which-- and they
were extraordinary for the era,

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:08.000
but it's interesting, as
I said, when he had the--

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.370
he was no longer an official court
painter that he went to Karbala

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:19.130
and Najaf and he painted
scenes of those modest towns

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:20.520
and squares and the people.

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.390
So, he began going
beyond the parameters

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:27.560
of the court certainly by 1900.

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.630
And this continued much more
strongly after he returned

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:33.610
from Europe and I think
this broadening

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:40.270
of subject matter beyond the court
to a more modern kind of interest

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:44.610
in the-- in his own time.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:48.560
I think you see it evolving
and it becomes much stronger

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.240
in the early 20th century.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:54.660
So, yes, there are many,
many urban city views.

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.680
Yes. Her Majesty.

00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:03.000
&gt;&gt; Farah Pahlavi: Didn't he paint
also a lot of people and musicians?

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.300
&gt;&gt; Layla Diba: Oh, yes.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:09.090
Yes, yes. I mean his-- he's
primarily known for his portraiture

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:13.050
and they're remarkable,
the court musicians,

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:17.360
the court personalities,
and they're so incisive.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.340
People, you know, mention
photography

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.430
because they're so realistic.

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:25.990
I think the most interesting
things he did was a series

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:29.230
of self-portraits, which
again was completely--

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:34.250 position:56%
no Iranian painter ever had the
temerity to use himself as a subject

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:36.430
and there are like
six self-portraits

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:38.980
and he greatly admired Rembrandt.

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:43.670 position:56%
So, I think, you know, his interest
in portraiture once he got to Europe

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:46.270
and the Louvre-- and
you saw Rembrandts,

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:51.210
but his skill as a painter-- and I
think he was interested in humanity

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:56.860
and personality and many of his
greatest works are portraits.

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.160
Absolutely.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.460
Thank you.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.760
Yes, please.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Farah Pahlavi: You know, because
you're a scholar, where did you find

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:08.000
out all the story about his life,
going to Europe, [inaudible].

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:11.420
&gt;&gt; Layla Diba: Well, there-- yes.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:14.590
There is a-- there is a--
I wouldn't say enormous,

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:17.060
but a substantial bibliography

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:21.250
and I was mentioning
earlier well before I came

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:24.270
to the field there was a
scholar called Sohali Honsari

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:25.570
[assumed spelling].

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:26.870
You may remember him, Your Majesty.

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:30.710
And he wrote a very
comprehensive book on Kamal al Mulk

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:39.870
and reproduced many of the works
and I can base a lot of my remarks

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:44.000
on that book, but also
amazingly, again,

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.550
Kamal al Mulk himself left his
memoirs, wrote about 10 pages

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:55.120
in his own hand and these
were published in the memoirs

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:58.770
of Dr. Ghasem Ghani,
Cyrus Ghani's father,

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:01.250
which Cyrus then published
in eight volumes.

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:07.190
So, we have the painter's own
account and when I read these,

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:10.990
I was reading the name of
this painter, Gordigiani,

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:12.690
I said this can't be right.

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:14.570
You know? He must have
misunderstood.

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:19.400
How could-- what a strange name,
gorgeous dawn, you know, Florence,

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.660
but I went-- there--
you know, there are--

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:26.160
there are books of famous
artists, Tina Becker is known

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.680
as the bible of-- every
artist is listed--

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:32.590
and Kamal al Mulk gave
the correct spelling

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:34.140
and then we tracked this down.

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:38.610
So, his own memoirs are
a very valuable resource

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:42.470
that scholars have not used
enough and they didn't realize--

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:46.160
I mean there are incredible
nuggets in there and he talks

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.930
about his relationship with
the ruler and he was accused

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:53.580
at one point of stealing something
from the [inaudible] because--

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:57.810
I mean it was very
personal and so his memoirs,

00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:01.490
even though they are 10
pages long, they're very,

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:03.700
very informative about his life.

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:07.500
But-- so, there's been
a lot of scholarship.

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:16.500 position:56%
I would actually use this occasion
to mention something that is a plea.

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:22.300
In my work on this, because I was--
I am not able to go back to Iran.

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:24.060
I do not wish to.

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:30.210
I have to rely on printed
publications and, unfortunately,

00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:39.040
the quality of the color makes it
very difficult to draw conclusions

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:44.740
and so for the advancement of not
my work, but just the advancement

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:54.070
of history, if you look, I chose
a page from Heydarian's book,

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:59.310
but there are other books where the
colors are completely different.

00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:00.680
Completely.

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:08.310
And so it's a matter of-- for
scholars and connoisseurs worldwide

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:10.910
who really want to know what
Kamal al Mulk's paintings look

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:15.030
like who cannot go to Iran,
they need to publish things

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.590
that are accurate in color.

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:20.980
So, I'm still very careful
about what I say in terms

00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:25.990
of his later work and of all his
work, which is why this group

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:30.200
of paintings which I could
examine personally and I know

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.500
that the colors are right

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.000
and the inscriptions are
correctly read and so on.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.390
But I hope very much our Iranian
colleagues will understand how

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:40.790
important this would be
and they will publish--

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:43.710
they're almost all in
the Golestan Palace.

00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:46.110
Some in the Malek Library,
which is nice,

00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:51.910
but they really need better
printing and it's 30 year--

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:54.780
well, yeah, 1896, at least 20--

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:58.420
1996 I think is when
Sohali's book was printed.

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.510
Yes, sir. Yes.

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:10.500
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:11.800
Oh really?

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.600
Yes.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:16.220
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:19.510
Oh, really?

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:27.350
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:31.090
What was his first name?

00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:33.170
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:35.750
Title. Yes.

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:43.560
You know, there is all-- there
is really nothing published

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:48.300
on other painters of the Iranian
landscape, which why I'm careful

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.650
to say this is a work in progress.

00:52:50.650 --> 00:52:54.800
I think many of them
were destroyed during the

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.720
constitutional revolution.

00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.440
Many of them I think were created
for patrons who had mansions

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.890
and palaces in Tehran that
were just, you know, ransacked.

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:05.890
Because none of them are published.

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:08.840
And so this is a huge gap.

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:14.440
So, we need to use history
and anecdote to fill this

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:18.030
in a little bit and
hopefully Iranian families

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:21.130
who have paintings--
family paintings--

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:23.310
may eventually make them available

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:27.120
and as your comment is
something one can follow up.

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:31.440
We do know, actually, the
names of many of the students

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.680
in Kamal al Mulk's
school, but we don't know

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:38.630
which of them painted landscapes,
but you'll get my brain working.

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:40.510
Pardon?

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:45.890
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:49.710
Well, I think at the-- it may
be privately, as you said.

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:56.560
There is-- there is a source
which I haven't referred

00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:00.770
to because I've got
to find it again.

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:05.620
It's by [inaudible] and he
wrote a short two-page history

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:12.630
of the artists of Nassereddin
Shah and, in my next lecture,

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:17.340
I believe he refers to
landscape paintings,

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.960
but we have no surviving examples.

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.880
So-- you have some?

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:25.460
No? You're just going
I wish I had some.

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:31.750
But I believe in the potential of
research and I hope young scholars

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:34.980
and more-- through more
dialogues like this one,

00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:39.480
we just need to unearth, you
know, archeologically sort

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:43.560
of unearth this information
that's held in family archives,

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:46.140
family memories-- because
it's very recent memory.

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:50.960
We're talking about 1920's, 1930's.

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:55.590
So, really, I'm grateful
to learn about any painters

00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:59.530
and hopefully we can
follow up and we need

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:02.390
to note the existence, absolutely.

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:03.940
Absolutely.

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:05.240
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Thank you.

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.040
Go ahead, Simon.

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:31.610
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:32.910
&gt;&gt; Layla Diba: No.

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:34.210
No. By now, no.

00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:40.650
No. I mean he really stopped
painting for royal patrons

00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:45.420
by about 1900 and then he
founded his own school.

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:50.640
He-- his patrons were
mainly constitutionalists

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:55.680
and ministers and, you know, the
grandees of the constitutional era.

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.710
Because he was a constitutionalist
himself and so--

00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:02.220
no, I mean for instance he
never painted a portrait

00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:04.240
of Ahmad Shah, I don't think.

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.390
I think he-- the last one he
painted would have been Mozaffar

00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:08.690
ad-Din Shah.

00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:12.890
So, in my article and in
various places, I've mentioned--

00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:16.990
and many of the, you know,
the portraits are inscribed.

00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:22.080 position:56%
In my article, in Iran modern,
there's a painting of Hakim al-Molk.

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.910
He was minister of
education, I think.

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:28.850
So, the patronage shifts and
then when he has his own school,

00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:31.750
as I said, it's very
interesting to see an interest

00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:33.760
in the common people,
in ordinary people.

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.860
Those weren't made for a patron.

00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:40.730
Right? He was an artist and
he was a 20th century artist.

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:43.940
That's why I call him the
painter of modern Persian life

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:50.820
because even his personality
was amazing and very modern.

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:55.190
So, I think he was
an independent artist

00:56:55.190 --> 00:57:00.250
and the later patrons
throughout his life--

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:05.680 position:56%
and he was always commissioned, but,
you know, his eyesight began failing

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:09.930
and then he was no longer
director of the school,

00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:12.830
so we know his patrons I would say

00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:15.710
from the first two decades
of the 20th century.

00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:18.680
Does that answer?

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.040
Too long, eh?

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:23.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: The name Kamal
al Mulk to me is an honorific title.

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:24.420
&gt;&gt; Layla Diba: Yes.

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:26.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Is this something
that was given to him and he ended

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:28.610
up keeping it or did
he at some point revert

00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:30.810
to what his birth name was?

00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:32.110
I'm just curious.

00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:33.980
&gt;&gt; Layla Diba: That's a--
that's a great question.

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:35.690
Absolute great question.

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:40.590
I'd have to study all his inscribed
works to answer that, but--

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:43.100
and, you know, I mean we
look at that very carefully

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:47.470
because it helps us to date
and create the context.

00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:49.000
I mean you can see that, you know,

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.410
he will sign first
Mohammad Ghaffari.

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:54.730
Then Mohammad Ghaffari [inaudible].

00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:58.440
Then Mohammad Ghaffari Kamal
al Mulk or [inaudible].

00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:03.570
Or-- there's a whole vocabulary
of the artist's signatures

00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:06.880
which explain his titles and I do--

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:11.560
I would actually love to know
what happened later in his career.

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.520
How did he sign his works?

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:17.000
But, as I said, one of-- you know,
I would really need to collaborate

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.690
with a colleague in Iran or
someone who could go to Iran

00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:21.660
because it's very primary research.

00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:23.920
You're going to have to go
and look at those inscriptions

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:26.340 position:56%
which are not visible and it's not--

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:30.880
you know, the research interests
we have today are very different

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:34.160
from scholars of a generation ago.

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:36.080
The questions we ask.

00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:38.450
We have to go find
the answers ourselves.

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:39.750
That's your job.

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:41.050
Yes, certain.

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:42.350
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
I have a question.

00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:48.470
You know, in different parts of the
Middle East, for example in Turkey,

00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:52.690
in Egypt, in [inaudible] and other
parts, you had western artists

00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:57.920 position:56%
who came and then they settled
there and then they had an influence

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:01.060
on the painters and the community.

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:04.850
Was that the case then
in the beginning

00:59:04.850 --> 00:59:09.820
of the century-- of
the 19th century?

00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:13.150
&gt;&gt; Layla Diba: Very, very tenuous.

00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:19.420
I mentioned that-- very
difficult to document.

00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:22.060
I suggest that, you know, there
are some things you still have

00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:23.430
to suggest.

00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:27.310
I was very curious that none

00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:34.630
of the Iranian scholars mentioned
these painter diplomats who were

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:36.930
in Iran and some of them
were very well-known,

00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:42.420
Jean Laurent was a very well-known
19th century French painter

00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:44.870 position:56%
and great books of [foreign phrase].

00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:50.930
So, there were European
painters-- and this Colombari,

00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:52.720
there's a whole book of his works.

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:59.490 position:56%
So, there's no-- so far-- so far, no
historical record of the encounters,

00:59:59.490 --> 01:00:03.120
but I would think they
could be there.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:08.370
But I did look through E'temad
al-Saltaneh's index to see

01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:12.110
if he mentions any
European painters.

01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:13.410
He doesn't.

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:17.100
So, I think, you know, there's
still a great deal of research

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:20.090
that would answer that question.

01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:25.360
How do we explain Kamal al Mulk
doing this kind of painting?

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:30.370
Mozayyen-od-Doleh, you know,
nobody knows about this man.

01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:32.250
He was such an important figure.

01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:39.830
He was the painter, you know, the
chief teacher at the Dar ul-Funun.

01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:41.830
All his work is gone.

01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:44.950
He studied in Paris, he went to
the Beaux-Arts, he went to the--

01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:49.620
he actually went to the-- studied
in the studio of [inaudible].

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.340
So, there-- yeah!

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.770
But we only have one painting left.

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:58.100
Two paintings, maybe, and
they appeared out of nowhere.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.770
So, we don't-- we don't-- you
know, the evidence is so sparse,

01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:03.640
Dr. Deeb, but it's there.

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:10.290 position:56%
You know, one can hypothesize both--
but that's why I'm saying, well,

01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:14.590
Kamal al Mulk was an
original because we don't know

01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:18.090
who he learned this from,
but the other aspect is

01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:23.160
that the Nassereddin Shah by the
1880's had come back from Europe,

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.700
he brought European
paintings with him,

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.040
and some of these have
been published.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.040
I'm sure Her Majesty
remembers these--

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.370
they were 19-20th century
paintings in the Golestan Palace

01:01:35.370 --> 01:01:39.580
and I'm sure some of them
were in the other buildings

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:40.920
in [inaudible] and so on.

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.790
And so my assumption is
that Kamal al Mulk looked

01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:46.150
at those very carefully.

01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:47.580
Taught himself.

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.430
But it's-- he never says it.

01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:54.380 position:56%
All he says is that I taught myself.

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.680
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: I'm curious,

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:59.240
continuing with what Mary-Jane
just asked, Russian and Armenian--

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.380
which is not quite European,
but a bridge between the two

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:06.160
because there was the Russian and
Armenian connection also happening

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.300
at this time with the
west-- more western-- yeah.

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.220
&gt;&gt; Layla Diba: I've
also studied that.

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.000
I have an article coming
out on that,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
but that's why I mention
this painter Mohammedi.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.840
He was-- who knew?

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:25.500
One painter in Rasht.

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:29.410
In Rasht! Yes!

01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:33.290
He was a teacher of [inaudible]
and [inaudible] and Nojoomi!

01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:39.530
Nojoomi actually talked
about another one in Hamadan.

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:41.090
These painters-- again,

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:45.780
because Kamal al Mulk
overshadowed everybody else,

01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:51.060
so my job is a little bit to,
you know, give some attention

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:53.770
to the other currents
and other painters

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:57.130
and certainly Mohammedi
was trained in Russia.

01:02:57.130 --> 01:02:59.530
I know-- I know that for a fact.

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:05.310
And so this other-- that's why
I mentioned that this other form

01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:08.410
of landscape painting
and of modernism filtered

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:11.430
through Russia is part--

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:14.170
is a chapter in the history
of Iranian modernism.

01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:17.270
Not one we can go into
today, but it was--

01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:20.890
it's interesting that there were
these two channels of, you know,

01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:26.130
influence that could come
via France, Germany, Russia.

01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:30.510
So--

01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:47.250
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:54.960 position:56%
Well, you know, after World War II,
Iranian artists wanted to be modern.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.530
So, it was cubism, cubism, cubism.

01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:03.240
You know? They went to Paris and
especially [inaudible] came back

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:06.410
and Kamal al Mulk fell
into disfavor.

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:10.860
And also what's really
remarkable is the Iranian--

01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:18.600 position:56%
the level of discourse among Iranian
art critics, painters, artists,

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.280
and they got very heated arguments

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:25.450
over what Iranian modern
painting should be.

01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:30.060
And Kamal al Mulk who had
been so revered as the father

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:34.300
of Iranian modernism was then
accused of just, you know,

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:38.070
being an imitator and
he fell into disfavor.

01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:42.940
Because they were trying to find
a new path, yeah, but, you know,

01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:45.410
we as historians, we look back

01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:48.390
and that's why I kept saying
how innovative he was.

01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:52.300
Of course he's so well-known, but
he also did some remarkable things

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:55.400
that we can now reaffirm.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:58.440
But certainly I do--
and I've written this--

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.400
you know, his students
were not on his level.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:06.210
You know? Nobody could equal
Kamal al Mulk and neither--

01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:09.570
and we've looked at, you know,
Heydarian and there are books

01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:11.840
about the school of Kamal al Mulk.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:16.750
They were competent
painters, but none of them had

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:19.410
that drive, that passion.

01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:24.600
I mean Kamal al Mulk, you know,
it was that passion to learn

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:28.950
and to teach himself to paint and
then to transmit it to others.

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:33.600
But-- so I think if there had been
another great painter among his

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.750
students of his stature, his style

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:40.120 position:56%
of painting would have continued
longer, but I'm sorry the other half

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.260
of the equation is the revival
of interest in [inaudible].

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:47.580
So, these two collided and
that began in the 1920's,

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:52.090
1930's under Reza Shah
and artists begin painting

01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:54.510 position:56%
in the 17th century miniature style.

01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:59.770
So, you had these two competing
currents going on for 20, 30 years

01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:02.650
and then, you know,
abstract painting and cubism.

01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:07.680
So, his influence--
but I wanted to say

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.290
that his influence was very strong.

01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:11.160
Let's look again at Heydarian.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.980
Let's look again at
his other followers.

01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:19.350
That's very interesting.

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:27.110 position:56%
Yes. That's a very interesting kind
of leap, but I would have to go back

01:06:27.110 --> 01:06:30.700
and see-- I don't remember
[inaudible] speaking

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:33.490
about Kamal al Mulk.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:38.950
Some of the artists did
and there have been--

01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:45.160
as part of the more recent
literature, scholars have written

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:49.440
about all these arguments
about Kamal al Mulk

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:53.150
and what he was responsible
for, but I--

01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:57.740
so, people like Marcos Grigorian
wrote against Kamal al Mulk,

01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:03.760 position:56%
you know, and others-- I mean huge
battles that are all recorded really

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.180
in Ahmad Ashraf's section
of this article.

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:15.170
So, I do think that there's
a lot more to try and look at

01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:17.810
and I thank you for the
reference to [inaudible] who's--

01:07:17.810 --> 01:07:20.620
really was another
landscape painter.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.940
One painter I studied
very closely was Yektai

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:29.090
and Yektai actually knew Kamal
al Mulk and told me that he went

01:07:29.090 --> 01:07:31.710
with his mother to
Kamal al Mulk's home.

01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:34.880
I mean there are amazing
connections.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:38.790
So, hopefully for another time.

01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:41.150
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Well, folks,
it's getting a little late

01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:44.610
and most people have to go
back to their work and offices.

01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:49.220
Again, thank you so much for making
the trip, coming here, and visiting

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:51.510
and giving this amazing--

01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:57.580
[ Applause ]

01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:58.880
&gt;&gt; Layla Diba: Thank you

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.540
to my wonderful audience
and their questions.

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:02.750
I loved it.

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:04.050
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Absolutely.

01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:07.100
&gt;&gt; Farah Pahlavi: And
we're very proud of Layla.

01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:12.100
She's not like all Iranian
Americans that are exiled here.

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:15.960
She is really half-American
half-Iranian

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:21.960
and so the result has
become very important for us

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:26.990
in Iran before what happened and
even now we're very proud of you.

01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:30.170
And also-- and I don't know if I
have a few minutes for Negarestan.

01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:37.490
OK. Yeah, no, because Layla was
the head of Negarestan Museum and--

01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:42.790
no, sorry-- and the story
of these other paintings is

01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:44.510
that there was a collection
belonging

01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:48.790
to Mr. Amery [assumed spelling]
in London and he proposed to us

01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:53.730
to sell 100 other paintings
for $1 million.

01:08:53.730 --> 01:08:56.880
So, I asked the ministry of
culture to send a few people

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.500
to see if they're OK or not.

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:04.710
It took so long that I heard that
Amery gave it to [inaudible].

01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:06.030
I was in Switzerland.

01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:08.210
When I heard that, I really cried.

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:10.350
I had tears in my eyes.

01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:11.840
The head of my office was there.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.900
I said please go to them and tell
them we cannot come to [inaudible]

01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:20.290
and still-- and one by one buy--
this is a museum and so and--

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:24.590
and thankfully Amery
accepted and [inaudible] also.

01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:30.680
Of course, we had to pay a little
more, so the Negarestan Museum was

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:35.000
in an old palace which belonged
to the queen mother in Tehran

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.810
and Professor [inaudible],
which was a Czech artist

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:44.910
which had arranged every room for
different paintings, portraits,

01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:51.500
landscape, and Layla fortunately
was the curator and the--

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:58.820
it was a beautiful museum and when
the famous revolution happened

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:04.210
in Iran, these people made this
museum the house of the guardians

01:10:04.210 --> 01:10:09.480 position:56%
of the revolution as if there was
no building in Tehran such ages ago.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:12.690
God knows where they have
sent these paintings.

01:10:12.690 --> 01:10:16.150
Anyway, I wanted to say that about
the [inaudible] and thank you,

01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:18.030
Layla, for what you have done

01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:22.040
and there are books published
about those paintings.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:23.840
And thank you for--

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:29.050
[ Applause ]

01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:30.840
&gt;&gt; Layla Diba: I have a surprise.

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:37.060
Yes. Well, it's been
a great boon for me.

01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:41.220
If you remember, I kept
saying I need to find the date

01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:45.000
of the inauguration of the
museum and we asked the queen

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.490
and we asked our friends, we
asked other people, we couldn't--

01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:50.280 position:56%
nobody could remember, including me.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:54.060
I said, well, I think
it's like June, July--

01:10:54.060 --> 01:11:01.200
today, at the Library of Congress,
in the microfilm department,

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:07.110
I have found the front page
of Keyhan International

01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:11.950
with your photograph with little
me and Queen Sophia of Greece.

01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:16.510
April 13, 1975.

01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:25.320
[ Applause ]

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.860
I was off by two months
and then I kept saying,

01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:30.410
well, it's got to be earlier.

01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:34.730
It's got to be-- April 13.

01:11:34.730 --> 01:11:41.180
Actually, two days from now.

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:44.900
You were in Tehran-- yes.

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.490
Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:48.910
So, we now know.

01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:50.730
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Exactly.

01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:54.070
&gt;&gt; Farah Pahlavi: I have
to tell you another story.

01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:55.370
&gt;&gt; Layla Diba: Please.

01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:58.550
&gt;&gt; Farah Pahlavi: Many years ago,
of course, after what happened,

01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:03.630 position:56%
they wrote in a French magazine
that I have taken some of the jewels

01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:05.530
of the [inaudible] with me.

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:09.340
I knew that it was enough to
[inaudible] one of the newspapers

01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:13.320
in Iran that the direction
of the [inaudible].

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:20.760
I asked a friend of mine and
a member of my family to come

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:24.870
to the Library of Congress
find the article--

01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:30.380
she did and she copied and I
sent it back to the newspaper.

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:31.690
So, thank you Library of Congress.

01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:33.630
&gt;&gt; Layla Diba: Thank
you, Library of Congress.

01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:34.930
Thank you.

01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:39.000
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari:
You're very welcome.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.300
Wonderful.

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.260
Thank you very much.

01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:43.910
Thanks again, everyone, for coming.

01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:45.210
Have a wonderful day.
