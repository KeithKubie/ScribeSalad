00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.990
looks like sort of towards the end of
the rain last night and has walked

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000
the rain last night and has walked
 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.550
the rain last night and has walked
around here during the course of the day

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560
around here during the course of the day
 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.189
around here during the course of the day
it's very very badly obscured and a lot

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199
it's very very badly obscured and a lot
 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.930
it's very very badly obscured and a lot
of vehicles have driven over it but

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940
of vehicles have driven over it but
 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.490
of vehicles have driven over it but
before sure it's a cheetah track which

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500
before sure it's a cheetah track which
 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.080
before sure it's a cheetah track which
is incredibly interesting because

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090
is incredibly interesting because
 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.689
is incredibly interesting because
there's well not been many Chiefs has

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699
there's well not been many Chiefs has
 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.430
there's well not been many Chiefs has
seen on Juma for quite some time

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440
seen on Juma for quite some time
 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.649
seen on Juma for quite some time
it looks like it a female track it

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:36.659
it looks like it a female track it
 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.210
it looks like it a female track it
doesn't look like or a very young male

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220
doesn't look like or a very young male
 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.600
doesn't look like or a very young male
but like I say the disturbance there is

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610
but like I say the disturbance there is
 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.520
but like I say the disturbance there is
huge from the rain so it's going to be

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530
huge from the rain so it's going to be
 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.500
huge from the rain so it's going to be
interesting to check if this cheetah is

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510
interesting to check if this cheetah is
 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.000
interesting to check if this cheetah is
still around it might have gone all the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010
still around it might have gone all the
 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.469
still around it might have gone all the
way through and crossed again I

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479
way through and crossed again I
 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.020
way through and crossed again I
certainly have a really good scour of

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030
certainly have a really good scour of
 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.740
certainly have a really good scour of
this area and see if maybe just maybe we

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750
this area and see if maybe just maybe we
 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.300
this area and see if maybe just maybe we
get lucky with the cheetah

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310
get lucky with the cheetah
 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.189
get lucky with the cheetah
somewhere on Juma wouldn't that be a

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199
somewhere on Juma wouldn't that be a
 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.589
somewhere on Juma wouldn't that be a
spectacular way to have a Sunday

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599
spectacular way to have a Sunday
 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.260
spectacular way to have a Sunday
afternoon Drive I think so so we're

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270
afternoon Drive I think so so we're
 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.010
afternoon Drive I think so so we're
gonna try very hard to see where this

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020
gonna try very hard to see where this
 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.890
gonna try very hard to see where this
cheetah goes I want to probably check

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900
cheetah goes I want to probably check
 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.890
cheetah goes I want to probably check
the sort of western side and there's a

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900
the sort of western side and there's a
 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.050
the sort of western side and there's a
lot more open sections and areas that

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060
lot more open sections and areas that
 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.659
lot more open sections and areas that
are not bad for cheetah as opposed to

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669
are not bad for cheetah as opposed to
 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.010
are not bad for cheetah as opposed to
the more the sort of southeast the

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020
the more the sort of southeast the
 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.420
the more the sort of southeast the
southeast becomes a lot more kind of

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430
southeast becomes a lot more kind of
 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.520
southeast becomes a lot more kind of
liquidy in its environment there's a lot

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530
liquidy in its environment there's a lot
 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.770
liquidy in its environment there's a lot
more kind of thickets and drainage lines

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780
more kind of thickets and drainage lines
 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.719
more kind of thickets and drainage lines
whereas this western portion has a few

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729
whereas this western portion has a few
 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.730
whereas this western portion has a few
more clearings and openings that will be

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740
more clearings and openings that will be
 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.070
more clearings and openings that will be
conducive for cheetah to move around the

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080
conducive for cheetah to move around the
 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.469
conducive for cheetah to move around the
problem is is that there's vehicles that

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479
problem is is that there's vehicles that
 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.210
problem is is that there's vehicles that
have driven down this road during the

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220
have driven down this road during the
 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.950
have driven down this road during the
course of the day today or during the

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960
course of the day today or during the
 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.779
course of the day today or during the
morning drive and that's going to make

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789
morning drive and that's going to make
 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.420
morning drive and that's going to make
it very tricky to be able to pick up

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430
it very tricky to be able to pick up
 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.550
it very tricky to be able to pick up
where these

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560
where these
 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.890
where these
cheaters walked and at first wasn't sure

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900
cheaters walked and at first wasn't sure
 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.420
cheaters walked and at first wasn't sure
if it was a cheater when I first saw the

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430
if it was a cheater when I first saw the
 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.700
if it was a cheater when I first saw the
track I kind of um Dennard about it for

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710
track I kind of um Dennard about it for
 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.230
track I kind of um Dennard about it for
quite a while but one of the other guys

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240
quite a while but one of the other guys
 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.150
quite a while but one of the other guys
that I spoke to one of the landowners he

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160
that I spoke to one of the landowners he
 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.070
that I spoke to one of the landowners he
saw the tracks actually this morning and

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080
saw the tracks actually this morning and
 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.090
saw the tracks actually this morning and
he said to me there was definitely

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100
he said to me there was definitely
 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.620
he said to me there was definitely
cheetah tracks that he saw them in the

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630
cheetah tracks that he saw them in the
 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.810
cheetah tracks that he saw them in the
soft sand before they drove over them so

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820
soft sand before they drove over them so
 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.540
soft sand before they drove over them so
yeah it's good news in many respects

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550
yeah it's good news in many respects
 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.330
yeah it's good news in many respects
that there is a cheetah kind of hanging

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340
that there is a cheetah kind of hanging
 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.800
that there is a cheetah kind of hanging
around but what I'm going to do is I'm

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810
around but what I'm going to do is I'm
 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.990
around but what I'm going to do is I'm
not gonna do quarantine just yet I'm

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000
not gonna do quarantine just yet I'm
 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.180
not gonna do quarantine just yet I'm
gonna go around and do a loop around and

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190
gonna go around and do a loop around and
 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.070
gonna go around and do a loop around and
then we'll come back to quarantine just

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080
then we'll come back to quarantine just
 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.379
then we'll come back to quarantine just
now I just want to check if it didn't go

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389
now I just want to check if it didn't go
 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:19.300
now I just want to check if it didn't go
down towards kind of Impala planes

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310
down towards kind of Impala planes
 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.920
down towards kind of Impala planes
because Impala planes would be a good

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930
because Impala planes would be a good
 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.620
because Impala planes would be a good
place for a cheetah to hang out it's

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630
place for a cheetah to hang out it's
 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.300
place for a cheetah to hang out it's
quite interesting that there is one

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310
quite interesting that there is one
 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.860
quite interesting that there is one
moving around there was tracks for one I

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870
moving around there was tracks for one I
 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.469
moving around there was tracks for one I
believe on before hawk not yesterday the

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479
believe on before hawk not yesterday the
 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:34.180
believe on before hawk not yesterday the
day before coming past a dam then going

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190
day before coming past a dam then going
 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.070
day before coming past a dam then going
towards sort of tortured so I suppose

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080
towards sort of tortured so I suppose
 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.690
towards sort of tortured so I suppose
it's very possible that this cheetah is

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700
it's very possible that this cheetah is
 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.629
it's very possible that this cheetah is
angled from there onto the side and is

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639
angled from there onto the side and is
 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.020
angled from there onto the side and is
then kind of moved along through here

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030
then kind of moved along through here
 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.610
then kind of moved along through here
Jamie says to me though she had wild dog

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620
Jamie says to me though she had wild dog
 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.590
Jamie says to me though she had wild dog
tracks on a very similar kind of

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600
tracks on a very similar kind of
 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.290
tracks on a very similar kind of
trajectory so there's lots of rare and

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300
trajectory so there's lots of rare and
 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.480
trajectory so there's lots of rare and
endangered things that's moved about

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490
endangered things that's moved about
 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.580

the guys have been turning around trying
 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.250
the guys have been turning around trying
to see where they can find these tracks

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.260
to see where they can find these tracks
 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.330
to see where they can find these tracks
anyway and we're going to try and see

anyway and we're going to try and see
 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.340
anyway and we're going to try and see
what we can find see if we get any signs

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.350
what we can find see if we get any signs
 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.350
what we can find see if we get any signs

00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799
ideal I don't see any sign of Tandy at
 

00:28:59.799 --> 00:29:00.779
ideal I don't see any sign of Tandy at
the moment you can see there's a few

00:29:00.779 --> 00:29:00.789
the moment you can see there's a few
 

00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:02.219
the moment you can see there's a few
vultures there so I wonder if maybe

00:29:02.219 --> 00:29:02.229
vultures there so I wonder if maybe
 

00:29:02.229 --> 00:29:04.529
vultures there so I wonder if maybe
there's more of a kill somewhere in this

00:29:04.529 --> 00:29:04.539
there's more of a kill somewhere in this
 

00:29:04.539 --> 00:29:06.989
there's more of a kill somewhere in this
side and maybe that's kind of what's

00:29:06.989 --> 00:29:06.999
side and maybe that's kind of what's
 

00:29:06.999 --> 00:29:12.360
side and maybe that's kind of what's
going on but interesting to see

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:12.370
 

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:14.710
Michelle vyas very possible I mean you

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720
Michelle vyas very possible I mean you
 

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.040
Michelle vyas very possible I mean you
misunderstand if Tandy killed the day

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:18.050
misunderstand if Tandy killed the day
 

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:19.570
misunderstand if Tandy killed the day
before and then she kind of finished

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:19.580
before and then she kind of finished
 

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.770
before and then she kind of finished
that up and came down here and killed

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:20.780
that up and came down here and killed
 

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.290
that up and came down here and killed
again if Colombo ate a little bit she

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:23.300
again if Colombo ate a little bit she
 

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.090
again if Colombo ate a little bit she
ate a bird and in husana rocked up and

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:25.100
ate a bird and in husana rocked up and
 

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.740
ate a bird and in husana rocked up and
ate as much as he looks like he's eaten

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:26.750
ate as much as he looks like he's eaten
 

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.840
ate as much as he looks like he's eaten
then it's very possible that that could

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:28.850
then it's very possible that that could
 

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:30.070
then it's very possible that that could
have been you know it's could have been

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080
have been you know it's could have been
 

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.670
have been you know it's could have been
what's that now 24 hours 36 hours so

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:33.680
what's that now 24 hours 36 hours so
 

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.400
what's that now 24 hours 36 hours so
it's a lot of food but there has been

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:36.410
it's a lot of food but there has been
 

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:39.280
it's a lot of food but there has been
eaten but you know these cats can put

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:39.290
eaten but you know these cats can put
 

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.010
eaten but you know these cats can put
away quite a bit so it's interesting to

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:42.020
away quite a bit so it's interesting to
 

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.160
away quite a bit so it's interesting to
kind of figure out exactly what happened

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:45.170
kind of figure out exactly what happened
 

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:46.570
kind of figure out exactly what happened
but the way that Columbus sitting as

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:46.580
but the way that Columbus sitting as
 

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.670
but the way that Columbus sitting as
close as she is to where husana was

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:48.680
close as she is to where husana was
 

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.550
close as she is to where husana was
makes me think that potentially Tandy

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:51.560
makes me think that potentially Tandy
 

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.290
makes me think that potentially Tandy
had to kill or she's also been attracted

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:53.300
had to kill or she's also been attracted
 

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.880
had to kill or she's also been attracted
to the vultures much like you know

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:54.890
to the vultures much like you know
 

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:56.800
to the vultures much like you know
predators are they often do come and

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:56.810
predators are they often do come and
 

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:58.690
predators are they often do come and
kind of get curious with vultures and

00:29:58.690 --> 00:29:58.700
kind of get curious with vultures and
 

00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.860
kind of get curious with vultures and
they'll come and try and investigate

00:29:59.860 --> 00:29:59.870
they'll come and try and investigate
 

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:04.090
they'll come and try and investigate
what's going on and what's happening and

what's going on and what's happening and
 

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.610
what's going on and what's happening and
try and kind of see how everything's

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:06.620
try and kind of see how everything's
 

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.470
try and kind of see how everything's
going but it amazes me that we've got

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480
going but it amazes me that we've got
 

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.640
going but it amazes me that we've got

interesting one because they're not
 

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.330
interesting one because they're not
going to be very happy about seeing

careful with Sibley being around she
 

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.730
careful with Sibley being around she
would not want to tangle with her

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:24.740

afternoon because we obviously have our

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:20.970
afternoon because we obviously have our
 

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:22.760

everybody is but it seems as though

00:31:26.779 --> 00:31:26.789
everybody is but it seems as though
 

00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:28.310

everyone decided to have a party on the
 

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.799
everyone decided to have a party on the
main road close to chitwa and so it was

00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:30.809
main road close to chitwa and so it was
 

00:31:30.809 --> 00:31:32.720
main road close to chitwa and so it was
worthwhile kind of just coming down and

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:32.730
worthwhile kind of just coming down and
 

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.210
worthwhile kind of just coming down and
seeing what's going on this side the

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:35.220
seeing what's going on this side the
 

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.490
seeing what's going on this side the
thing is is that you know there's

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:37.500
thing is is that you know there's
 

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.710
thing is is that you know there's
obviously been kind of some interaction

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720
obviously been kind of some interaction
 

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.690
obviously been kind of some interaction
between Easley episod I don't think that

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:41.700
between Easley episod I don't think that
 

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.980
between Easley episod I don't think that
they can all be in the same place at

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:42.990
they can all be in the same place at
 

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.279
they can all be in the same place at
once

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:43.289
once
 

00:31:43.289 --> 00:31:45.320
once
with this many vultures without anybody

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:45.330
with this many vultures without anybody
 

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:46.909
with this many vultures without anybody
kind of realizing that there's a liquid

00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919
kind of realizing that there's a liquid
 

00:31:46.919 --> 00:31:48.680
kind of realizing that there's a liquid
here so I think they've all kind of come

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:48.690
here so I think they've all kind of come
 

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.289
here so I think they've all kind of come
in for the same reason and I wouldn't be

00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:51.299
in for the same reason and I wouldn't be
 

00:31:51.299 --> 00:31:54.230
in for the same reason and I wouldn't be
surprised if there's another lipid

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240
surprised if there's another lipid
 

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:54.830
surprised if there's another lipid
behind us

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840
behind us
 

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.230
behind us
hello Dundee so there's Tandy behind us

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.419
hello Dundee so there's Tandy behind us
I think it's Dundee behind us yes there

00:31:59.419 --> 00:31:59.429
I think it's Dundee behind us yes there
 

00:31:59.429 --> 00:32:03.220
I think it's Dundee behind us yes there

so there's actually five lipids in the

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:06.020
so there's actually five lipids in the
 

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:10.100
so there's actually five lipids in the
space of I don't even it's not even 500

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:10.110
space of I don't even it's not even 500
 

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:11.990
space of I don't even it's not even 500
meters that these five cats and you can

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000
meters that these five cats and you can
 

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.310
meters that these five cats and you can
see their tummies are full so I think

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320
see their tummies are full so I think
 

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.409
see their tummies are full so I think
they were on that kill as well but how

00:32:15.409 --> 00:32:15.419
they were on that kill as well but how
 

00:32:15.419 --> 00:32:17.480
they were on that kill as well but how
awesome is this to have time the entry

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:17.490
awesome is this to have time the entry
 

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:18.710
awesome is this to have time the entry

almost half of it and I guess chances

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:54.290
almost half of it and I guess chances
 

01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:57.580
almost half of it and I guess chances

so now let's quickly cross over to Jamie

01:49:45.370 --> 01:49:45.380
so now let's quickly cross over to Jamie
 

01:49:45.380 --> 01:49:53.350
so now let's quickly cross over to Jamie
and hear how she's doing okay so this is

01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360
and hear how she's doing okay so this is
 

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:57.030
and hear how she's doing okay so this is
the last active den site that we know of

01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040
the last active den site that we know of
 

01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:00.070
the last active den site that we know of
it's the one just south of Philemon scut

01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080
it's the one just south of Philemon scut
 

01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:04.090
it's the one just south of Philemon scut
line and there's a track or two in the

01:50:04.090 --> 01:50:04.100
line and there's a track or two in the
 

01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:06.130
line and there's a track or two in the
mud and I've noticed while I've been

01:50:06.130 --> 01:50:06.140
mud and I've noticed while I've been
 

01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:08.350
mud and I've noticed while I've been
sitting here there are flies around the

01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:08.360
sitting here there are flies around the
 

01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:12.520
sitting here there are flies around the
entrance to the den site itself I think

01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:12.530
entrance to the den site itself I think
 

01:50:12.530 --> 01:50:15.940
entrance to the den site itself I think
there is a possibility that they're

01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:15.950
there is a possibility that they're
 

01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:18.700
there is a possibility that they're
still here something a little bit

01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:18.710
still here something a little bit
 

01:50:18.710 --> 01:50:20.260
still here something a little bit
scuffed about that although that could

01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:20.270
scuffed about that although that could
 

01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:22.780
scuffed about that although that could

have just been washed in it's really
difficult to tell and I'm not gonna go

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:24.410
difficult to tell and I'm not gonna go
 

01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:26.230
difficult to tell and I'm not gonna go
stick my head down the entrance-hall if

01:50:26.230 --> 01:50:26.240
stick my head down the entrance-hall if
 

01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:27.970
stick my head down the entrance-hall if
there's potential for Cubs in there it

01:50:27.970 --> 01:50:27.980
there's potential for Cubs in there it
 

01:50:27.980 --> 01:50:31.090
there's potential for Cubs in there it
would terrify the absolute daylights out

01:50:31.090 --> 01:50:31.100
would terrify the absolute daylights out
 

01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:33.460
would terrify the absolute daylights out
of them so we're not we're not going to

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:33.470
of them so we're not we're not going to
 

01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:34.810
of them so we're not we're not going to
do that we're not going to terrorize

tiny hyena Cubs that's a little bit

01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:36.770
tiny hyena Cubs that's a little bit
 

01:50:36.770 --> 01:50:40.060
tiny hyena Cubs that's a little bit
unfair and so I think it is that we have

01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:40.070
unfair and so I think it is that we have
 

01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:42.850
unfair and so I think it is that we have
to move on and just see what else we can

01:50:42.850 --> 01:50:42.860
to move on and just see what else we can
 

01:50:42.860 --> 01:50:44.380
to move on and just see what else we can

difficult to find them if they haven't
 

01:51:00.710 --> 01:51:02.080
difficult to find them if they haven't
gone to one of their regular dens
