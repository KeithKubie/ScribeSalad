hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.259
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
Android team at Google I work on

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269
Android team at Google I work on
 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.060
Android team at Google I work on
graphics and animations and today I

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070
graphics and animations and today I
 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.950
graphics and animations and today I
wanted to talk a little bit about that

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960
wanted to talk a little bit about that
 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.959
wanted to talk a little bit about that
specifically I want to talk about value

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969
specifically I want to talk about value
 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.939
specifically I want to talk about value
animator and object animator and now you

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949
animator and object animator and now you
 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.470
animator and object animator and now you
can get different kinds of movement on

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480
can get different kinds of movement on
 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.480
can get different kinds of movement on
the screen so let's take a look at a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490
the screen so let's take a look at a
 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.109
the screen so let's take a look at a
quick demo I call this bouncer I have my

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119
quick demo I call this bouncer I have my
 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.820
quick demo I call this bouncer I have my
little electric sheep at the top of the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830
little electric sheep at the top of the
 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.710
little electric sheep at the top of the
screen and I click on the screen and the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
screen and I click on the screen and the
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.689
screen and I click on the screen and the
Sheep moves down in a very boring

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699
Sheep moves down in a very boring
 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.099
Sheep moves down in a very boring
fashion to the bottom of the screen

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109
fashion to the bottom of the screen
 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.340
fashion to the bottom of the screen
not much of a bounce so let's take a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350
not much of a bounce so let's take a
 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.250
not much of a bounce so let's take a
look at another variation which I call

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260
look at another variation which I call
 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.680
look at another variation which I call
bouncer one so we run bouncer one and

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690
bouncer one so we run bouncer one and
 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.000
bouncer one so we run bouncer one and
now we're actually going back up to the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010
now we're actually going back up to the
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.400
now we're actually going back up to the
top of the screen which is a good start

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410
top of the screen which is a good start
 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.440
top of the screen which is a good start
it's actually continuing to move which

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450
it's actually continuing to move which
 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.940
it's actually continuing to move which
is kind of what balancing is about but

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950
is kind of what balancing is about but
 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.080
is kind of what balancing is about but
it's got this weird sort of linear

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
it's got this weird sort of linear
 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.010
it's got this weird sort of linear
oscillation thing going on so let's see

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020
oscillation thing going on so let's see
 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.389
oscillation thing going on so let's see
if we can do a little better we have

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
if we can do a little better we have
 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.950
if we can do a little better we have
this other variation which I call

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
this other variation which I call
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.979
this other variation which I call
bouncer two and click that and all of a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
bouncer two and click that and all of a
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.240
bouncer two and click that and all of a
sudden we've got a bouncing motion so

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250
sudden we've got a bouncing motion so
 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.280
sudden we've got a bouncing motion so
we'll see how we create that with one

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290
we'll see how we create that with one
 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.940
we'll see how we create that with one
line of code and finally we've got this

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950
line of code and finally we've got this
 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.740
line of code and finally we've got this
other variation called bouncer three

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
other variation called bouncer three
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.390
other variation called bouncer three
which is going to look remarkably

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
which is going to look remarkably
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.580
which is going to look remarkably
similar to bouncer two we've got the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
similar to bouncer two we've got the
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.830
similar to bouncer two we've got the
same bouncing gravity motion going on

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
same bouncing gravity motion going on
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.320
same bouncing gravity motion going on
there the interesting part is in the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330
there the interesting part is in the
 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.030
there the interesting part is in the
code and how that one was created using

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040
code and how that one was created using
 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.190
code and how that one was created using
a different kind of animator so let's

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
a different kind of animator so let's
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.370
a different kind of animator so let's
look at the code now so we've got this

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380
look at the code now so we've got this
 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.100
look at the code now so we've got this
bouncer file go up to the top of it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
bouncer file go up to the top of it
 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.410
bouncer file go up to the top of it
you've got this activity called bouncer

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
you've got this activity called bouncer
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.510
you've got this activity called bouncer
we have a custom view where we're going

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520
we have a custom view where we're going
 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.950
we have a custom view where we're going
to be drawing this sheep as it moves

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
to be drawing this sheep as it moves
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.170
to be drawing this sheep as it moves
around on the screen and here we have a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180
around on the screen and here we have a
 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.780
around on the screen and here we have a
set up shape where we decode this

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
set up shape where we decode this
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.399
set up shape where we decode this
resource so this is the electric sheep

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
resource so this is the electric sheep
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.260
resource so this is the electric sheep
thing that I spent hours and hours

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270
thing that I spent hours and hours
 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.870
thing that I spent hours and hours
drawing because it's such complex art we

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
drawing because it's such complex art we
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.819
drawing because it's such complex art we
get the width and height of this thing

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829
get the width and height of this thing
 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.880
get the width and height of this thing
to position it appropriately later so we

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
to position it appropriately later so we
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.130
to position it appropriately later so we
can sort of Center it in the screen as

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140
can sort of Center it in the screen as
 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.859
can sort of Center it in the screen as
we change the position properties of the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
we change the position properties of the
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.270
we change the position properties of the
sheep to put it in the center of the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
sheep to put it in the center of the
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.880
sheep to put it in the center of the
screen or to move it down down and back

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
screen or to move it down down and back
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.980
screen or to move it down down and back
up the screen during the animations we

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
up the screen during the animations we
 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.899
up the screen during the animations we
call these setters set shape X and set

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909
call these setters set shape X and set
 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.440
call these setters set shape X and set
shape Y and this one basically figures

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
shape Y and this one basically figures
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.940
shape Y and this one basically figures
out the only reason there's any complex

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
out the only reason there's any complex
 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.040
out the only reason there's any complex
code in here at all is because we need

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
code in here at all is because we need
 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.199
code in here at all is because we need
to invalidate the correct area so that

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209
to invalidate the correct area so that
 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.630
to invalidate the correct area so that
we erase where the sheep was

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640
we erase where the sheep was
 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.490
we erase where the sheep was
and then draw the shape in the in the

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500
and then draw the shape in the in the
 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.750
and then draw the shape in the in the
correct area otherwise we're going to

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760
correct area otherwise we're going to
 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.670
correct area otherwise we're going to
leave litter artifacts all over the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680
leave litter artifacts all over the
 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.080
leave litter artifacts all over the
screen if we're not erasing correctly or

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090
screen if we're not erasing correctly or
 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.180
screen if we're not erasing correctly or
if we just do an invalidate of the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190
if we just do an invalidate of the
 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.400
if we just do an invalidate of the
entire view then we're basically going

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410
entire view then we're basically going
 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.750
entire view then we're basically going
to be doing too much work because

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760
to be doing too much work because
 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.150
to be doing too much work because
there's no reason to reate to erase the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160
there's no reason to reate to erase the
 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.250
there's no reason to reate to erase the
entire view if all you did was move the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260
entire view if all you did was move the
 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.770
entire view if all you did was move the
sheep from here to here so we get the

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780
sheep from here to here so we get the
 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.290
sheep from here to here so we get the
Union rectangle and we invalidate

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300
Union rectangle and we invalidate
 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.120
Union rectangle and we invalidate
appropriately and we do this for both of

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130
appropriately and we do this for both of
 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.910
appropriately and we do this for both of
the centers here on sides changed this

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920
the centers here on sides changed this
 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.530
the centers here on sides changed this
allows us to Center the Sheep or

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540
allows us to Center the Sheep or
 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.040
allows us to Center the Sheep or
proprietary drawing the sheep on the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050
proprietary drawing the sheep on the
 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.010
proprietary drawing the sheep on the
screen we simply draw the bitmap at the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020
screen we simply draw the bitmap at the
 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.380
screen we simply draw the bitmap at the
shape X and shape Y properties that were

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390
shape X and shape Y properties that were
 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.410
shape X and shape Y properties that were
set before for running the animation we

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420
set before for running the animation we
 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.840
set before for running the animation we
have the start animation method here

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850
have the start animation method here
 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.699
have the start animation method here
that gets called when you click on the

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709
that gets called when you click on the
 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.729
that gets called when you click on the
thing and we create a value animator

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739
thing and we create a value animator
 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.080
thing and we create a value animator
object and this is one of the new

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090
object and this is one of the new
 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.630
object and this is one of the new
classes that was created in the 3.0

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640
classes that was created in the 3.0
 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.660
classes that was created in the 3.0
release part of an overall more robust

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750
and value calculation mechanism doesn't
 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.090
and value calculation mechanism doesn't
know about views doesn't know about

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100
know about views doesn't know about
 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.370
know about views doesn't know about
objects at all all it knows how to do is

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380
objects at all all it knows how to do is
 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.600
objects at all all it knows how to do is
to calculate values based on parameters

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610
to calculate values based on parameters
 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.060
to calculate values based on parameters
that you give it for the start and the

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070
that you give it for the start and the
 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.310
that you give it for the start and the
end values as well as durations and

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320
end values as well as durations and
 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.289
end values as well as durations and
other properties which we'll see today

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299
other properties which we'll see today
 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.150
other properties which we'll see today
so we create this value animator by

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160
so we create this value animator by
 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.740
so we create this value animator by
calling get value animator this comes

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750
calling get value animator this comes
 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.840
calling get value animator this comes
down here and says value animator dot of

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850
down here and says value animator dot of
 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.320
down here and says value animator dot of
float and this is going to calculate

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330
float and this is going to calculate
 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.270
float and this is going to calculate
animation values between starting value

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280
animation values between starting value
 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.370
animation values between starting value
of zero and an ending value of one and

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380
of zero and an ending value of one and
 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.320
of zero and an ending value of one and
then we add an update listener and if

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330
then we add an update listener and if
 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.970
then we add an update listener and if
you use value animator which is a more

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980
you use value animator which is a more
 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.490
you use value animator which is a more
manual way of doing an animation then

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500
manual way of doing an animation then
 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.440
manual way of doing an animation then
you probably want to have an update

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450
you probably want to have an update
 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.759
you probably want to have an update
listener and this will get called on

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769
listener and this will get called on
 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.140
listener and this will get called on
every frame of the animation and then

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150
every frame of the animation and then
 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.870
every frame of the animation and then
you can do whatever you want to with the

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880
you can do whatever you want to with the
 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.659
you can do whatever you want to with the
values so every time we get a call let

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669
values so every time we get a call let
 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.219
values so every time we get a call let
me reposition this code a little bit so

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229
me reposition this code a little bit so
 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.740
me reposition this code a little bit so
you can actually see it on the screen on

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750
you can actually see it on the screen on
 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.350
you can actually see it on the screen on
animation update we get a reference to

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360
animation update we get a reference to
 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.450
animation update we get a reference to
the animation object itself and then we

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460
the animation object itself and then we
 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.680
the animation object itself and then we
can get the

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690
can get the
 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.990
can get the
animated fractions so we can find out

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000
animated fractions so we can find out
 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.990
animated fractions so we can find out
between value of 0 and 1 what is the

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000
between value of 0 and 1 what is the
 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.170
between value of 0 and 1 what is the
current animation fraction and we could

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180
current animation fraction and we could
 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.030
current animation fraction and we could
also get the animated value at that time

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040
also get the animated value at that time
 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.710
also get the animated value at that time
if we wanted here we're just going

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720
if we wanted here we're just going
 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.240
if we wanted here we're just going
between 0 &amp; 1 it doesn't really matter

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250
between 0 &amp; 1 it doesn't really matter
 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.070
between 0 &amp; 1 it doesn't really matter
and we basically use that animation

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080
and we basically use that animation
 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.500
and we basically use that animation
fraction between 0 &amp; 1 to effect the

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510
fraction between 0 &amp; 1 to effect the
 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.240
fraction between 0 &amp; 1 to effect the
height of the sheet so we basically want

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250
height of the sheet so we basically want
 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.470
height of the sheet so we basically want
to move the sheep from the top of the

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480
to move the sheep from the top of the
 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.150
to move the sheep from the top of the
screen down to the bottom of the screen

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160
screen down to the bottom of the screen
 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.490
screen down to the bottom of the screen
minus the height of the sheep so we're

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500
minus the height of the sheep so we're
 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.040
minus the height of the sheep so we're
going to take the 0 &amp; 1 factors that we

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050
going to take the 0 &amp; 1 factors that we
 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.750
going to take the 0 &amp; 1 factors that we
get during the during the animation

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760
get during the during the animation
 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.090
get during the during the animation
itself and simply apply that directly as

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100
itself and simply apply that directly as
 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.640
itself and simply apply that directly as
a proportion of the height at which the

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650
a proportion of the height at which the
 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.420
a proportion of the height at which the
sheep is drawn and that's all - bouncer

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430
sheep is drawn and that's all - bouncer
 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.890
sheep is drawn and that's all - bouncer
so it gets a little bit more interesting

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900
so it gets a little bit more interesting
 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.990
so it gets a little bit more interesting
once we start adding actual bouncing

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000
once we start adding actual bouncing
 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.460
once we start adding actual bouncing
capabilities all this one does is

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470
capabilities all this one does is
 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.380
capabilities all this one does is
animate the thing down to the bottom of

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390
animate the thing down to the bottom of
 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.080
animate the thing down to the bottom of
the screen in a very boring fashion

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090
the screen in a very boring fashion
 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.980
the screen in a very boring fashion
bouncer 1 is a way to do that with a

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990
bouncer 1 is a way to do that with a
 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.480
bouncer 1 is a way to do that with a
little bit of repetition this is the one

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490
little bit of repetition this is the one
 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.340
little bit of repetition this is the one
that oscillated down to the bottom of

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350
that oscillated down to the bottom of
 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.620
that oscillated down to the bottom of
the screen and then back up so here we

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630
the screen and then back up so here we
 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.330
the screen and then back up so here we
get value animator same exact thing

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340
get value animator same exact thing
 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.440
get value animator same exact thing
going on

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450
going on
 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.510
going on
but we also set a repeat kind of

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520
but we also set a repeat kind of
 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.980
but we also set a repeat kind of
infinite which means it's just going to

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990
infinite which means it's just going to
 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.870
infinite which means it's just going to
repeat until you finally quit the

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880
repeat until you finally quit the
 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.100
repeat until you finally quit the
application because it's not very

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110
application because it's not very
 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.290
application because it's not very
interesting and it's also going to set a

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300
interesting and it's also going to set a
 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.390
interesting and it's also going to set a
repeat motor reverse so when it reaches

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400
repeat motor reverse so when it reaches
 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.340
repeat motor reverse so when it reaches
the bottom it's going to animate back up

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350
the bottom it's going to animate back up
 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.760
the bottom it's going to animate back up
to 1

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770
to 1
 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.560
to 1
internally what that means is the value

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570
internally what that means is the value
 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.480
internally what that means is the value
animator is going to run from 0 to 1 and

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490
animator is going to run from 0 to 1 and
 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.050
animator is going to run from 0 to 1 and
then back to 0 and ad infinitum until

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060
then back to 0 and ad infinitum until
 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.610
then back to 0 and ad infinitum until
you kill the application then we start

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620
you kill the application then we start
 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.530
you kill the application then we start
the animation ok that was the second

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540
the animation ok that was the second
 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.850
the animation ok that was the second
animation the third one was the one

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860
animation the third one was the one
 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.350
animation the third one was the one
where it was actually bouncing it was

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360
where it was actually bouncing it was
 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.390
where it was actually bouncing it was
speeding up as it fell down and then it

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400
speeding up as it fell down and then it
 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.950
speeding up as it fell down and then it
slowed down as a windbag up sort of a

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960
slowed down as a windbag up sort of a
 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.470
slowed down as a windbag up sort of a
gravity motion to it so that logic is in

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480
gravity motion to it so that logic is in
 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.480
gravity motion to it so that logic is in
the bouncer to file and it's exactly

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490
the bouncer to file and it's exactly
 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.950
the bouncer to file and it's exactly
like the previous one we looked at

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960
like the previous one we looked at
 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.990
like the previous one we looked at
except for this one line of code where

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000
except for this one line of code where
 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.240
except for this one line of code where
we set an interpolator an interpolator

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250
we set an interpolator an interpolator
 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.980
we set an interpolator an interpolator
you can think of as a way of

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990
you can think of as a way of
 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.650
you can think of as a way of
reinterpreting time and by

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660
reinterpreting time and by
 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.840
reinterpreting time and by
reinterpreting time we also reinterpret

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850
reinterpreting time we also reinterpret
 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.520
reinterpreting time we also reinterpret
how the values are calculated because

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530
how the values are calculated because
 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.380
how the values are calculated because
those are based on the time value so

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390
those are based on the time value so
 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.440
those are based on the time value so
here we're saying use an accelerate

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450
here we're saying use an accelerate
 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.730
here we're saying use an accelerate
interpolate er which means the longer

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740
interpolate er which means the longer
 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.110
interpolate er which means the longer
you go the faster you're going to get

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120
you go the faster you're going to get
 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.470
you go the faster you're going to get
but then interestingly when it reverses

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480
but then interestingly when it reverses
 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.120
but then interestingly when it reverses
it's going to use the interpolate er in

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130
it's going to use the interpolate er in
 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.560
it's going to use the interpolate er in
Reverse so it's going to speed up on the

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570
Reverse so it's going to speed up on the
 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.610
Reverse so it's going to speed up on the
way down to 1 and then it's going to

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620
way down to 1 and then it's going to
 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.860
way down to 1 and then it's going to
slow down back up to 0 and that's how we

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870
slow down back up to 0 and that's how we
 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.560
slow down back up to 0 and that's how we
get the bouncing behavior as we go down

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:35.570
get the bouncing behavior as we go down
 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.320
get the bouncing behavior as we go down
and up the screen and then finally we

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330
and up the screen and then finally we
 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.460
and up the screen and then finally we
can take a look at the bounce of three

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470
can take a look at the bounce of three
 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.719
can take a look at the bounce of three
file which

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:40.729
file which
 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:42.790
file which
produced exactly the same visual result

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800
produced exactly the same visual result
 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.249
produced exactly the same visual result
but with a little less code this gets

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:45.259
but with a little less code this gets
 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:47.980
but with a little less code this gets
into use of the new object animator

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990
into use of the new object animator
 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.649
into use of the new object animator
class that also came out in 3.0 and this

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:50.659
class that also came out in 3.0 and this
 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:53.230
class that also came out in 3.0 and this
is a class that specifically not just

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240
is a class that specifically not just
 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.850
is a class that specifically not just
about animating values but about

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860
about animating values but about
 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.550
about animating values but about
animating the values on a target object

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560
animating the values on a target object
 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.680
animating the values on a target object
and a set of target properties in

00:06:59.680 --> 00:06:59.690
and a set of target properties in
 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.899
and a set of target properties in
particular we're going to have an object

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:01.909
particular we're going to have an object
 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:04.330
particular we're going to have an object
animator which is created right here

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340
animator which is created right here
 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.309
animator which is created right here
that's going to animate integer values

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319
that's going to animate integer values
 

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:10.059
that's going to animate integer values
it's going to use this target which is

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:10.069
it's going to use this target which is
 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:12.580
it's going to use this target which is
the custom view and we're going to

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.590
the custom view and we're going to
 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.890
the custom view and we're going to
animate the shape Y property which is

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900
animate the shape Y property which is
 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.300
animate the shape Y property which is
just a string that we're passing in

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.310
just a string that we're passing in
 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.180
just a string that we're passing in
which will then use reflection or j'ni

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190
which will then use reflection or j'ni
 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.520
which will then use reflection or j'ni
underneath to say okay well given this

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:21.530
underneath to say okay well given this
 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.580
underneath to say okay well given this
string name is there a setter of this

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:24.590
string name is there a setter of this
 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.499
string name is there a setter of this
type that I can associate with this and

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:26.509
type that I can associate with this and
 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:28.149
type that I can associate with this and
then call that setter over time to

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:28.159
then call that setter over time to
 

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:30.999
then call that setter over time to
animate and in fact it does find that

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:31.009
animate and in fact it does find that
 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:34.420
animate and in fact it does find that
because we have the set shaped Y setter

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:34.430
because we have the set shaped Y setter
 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.249
because we have the set shaped Y setter
that we saw earlier and it's going to

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:36.259
that we saw earlier and it's going to
 

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:38.080
that we saw earlier and it's going to
animate that property from the value of

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.090
animate that property from the value of
 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.839
animate that property from the value of
zero to the maximum value so you can

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:40.849
zero to the maximum value so you can
 

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:42.459
zero to the maximum value so you can
compare this to what we saw before where

00:07:42.459 --> 00:07:42.469
compare this to what we saw before where
 

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:44.350
compare this to what we saw before where
we created the value animator and then

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360
we created the value animator and then
 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.209
we created the value animator and then
we needed to use an update listener to

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:46.219
we needed to use an update listener to
 

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:48.100
we needed to use an update listener to
actually use that value over time object

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.110
actually use that value over time object
 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.839
actually use that value over time object
animator does that all for you you

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:49.849
animator does that all for you you
 

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:51.490
animator does that all for you you
pointed at the target object to animate

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:51.500
pointed at the target object to animate
 

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.230
pointed at the target object to animate
the properties in that object to animate

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:53.240
the properties in that object to animate
 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.019
the properties in that object to animate
and the values to use then you simply

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:56.029
and the values to use then you simply
 

00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:57.879
and the values to use then you simply
start the animation and away it goes it

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:57.889
start the animation and away it goes it
 

00:07:57.889 --> 00:07:59.769
start the animation and away it goes it
calculates the values it sets it on the

00:07:59.769 --> 00:07:59.779
calculates the values it sets it on the
 

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.019
calculates the values it sets it on the
target object and it's basically a set

00:08:02.019 --> 00:08:02.029
target object and it's basically a set
 

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:03.249
target object and it's basically a set
and forget thing you create the

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:03.259
and forget thing you create the
 

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:05.800
and forget thing you create the
animation you run it and you're done so

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:05.810
animation you run it and you're done so
 

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.839
animation you run it and you're done so
this was a little bit about the property

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:07.849
this was a little bit about the property
 

00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:10.809
this was a little bit about the property
animation system that started in 3.0 so

00:08:10.809 --> 00:08:10.819
animation system that started in 3.0 so
 

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:12.399
animation system that started in 3.0 so
if you're running on devices with 3.0 I

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:12.409
if you're running on devices with 3.0 I
 

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.140
if you're running on devices with 3.0 I
would suggest you take a look at these

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:14.150
would suggest you take a look at these
 

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.209
would suggest you take a look at these
classes in addition to the view property

00:08:16.209 --> 00:08:16.219
classes in addition to the view property
 

00:08:16.219 --> 00:08:17.559
classes in addition to the view property
animator class which we'll see in a

00:08:17.559 --> 00:08:17.569
animator class which we'll see in a
 

00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:21.009
animator class which we'll see in a
future episode thanks
