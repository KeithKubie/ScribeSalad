00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
Every Hanukkah Jewish people around the world retell the legendary story of Judah and the Maccabees but hundreds of years ago many Jews also,

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:11.099
celebrated the story of Judith and a severed head

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.750
The story begins it was the twelfth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.499
Who ruled over the Assyrians in the great city of Nineveh because Nebuchadnezzar took power in a 605 BCE

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.829
We know our story starts in 593 BCE Nebuchadnezzar

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.559
Is at war with our Fox on a median King ruling over an empire in ancient Iran

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.328
Nebuchadnezzar asks other nations to join him in his fight against our Fox odd

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.350
but nobody bites

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.590
But it doesn't matter because five years later

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.169
Nebuchadnezzar defeats our Fox odd on his own and vows to destroy those nations who did not join him

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.859
The next year he sends Holofernes his most loyal general to carry out this campaign of revenge

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.049
Holofernes and his massive army crushed any resistance in his way until there is only one nation left the Kingdom of Judah

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.338
Holofernes wants to capture Jerusalem, but his path is blocked by the small town of Bethulia instead of fighting

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.460
The Israelites Holofernes cuts off the thule 'as water supply

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.359
34 days later the people of Bethulia are ready to surrender

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.390
But Isaiah the town magistrate convinces the people to wait five more days for God to rescue them

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.649
Enter Judith a beautiful pious Widow living in Bethulia

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:33.059
She's angered by the idea of setting a time limit on God's work and scolds the town's leaders for doing so but they are

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.400
Suffering so Judith promises to carry out a deed that will be known from generation to generation

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.020
That night Judith and her handmaiden leave the town for Holofernes camp

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.619
They convinced the Assyrians that they are ready to betray their fellow Jews and want to share information with Allah ferny's

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.320
Judith and her maids spend the next four days with the Assyrians when Holofernes invites Judith to a banquet

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.319
Knowing that Holofernes was attempting to seduce her Judith dresses in her finest clothing and jewelry

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.609
She seduces the general into eating cheese and wine a lot of wine

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.269
More than he had ever drunk on any day since he was born

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.119
Holofernes passes out on his bed Judith takes challah for sword and makes her move saying

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.200
Now is the time to shatter the enemies who have risen against us

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.700
and

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.290
cuts off his head

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.760
Judith Ann, her maid escaped the Assyrian cab Holofernes head in tow

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.829
She returns to Bethulia a hero holding up the head for the whole town to see

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.940
the Assyrians meanwhile

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.040
Discover the headless Holofernes on the floor of his tent the camp goes into a panic and most of the troops scatter the Israelite army

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.260
Plunders what is left and kills the stragglers?

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.130
Judith continued to live as a widow in Bethulia and died at the ripe old age of 105 the story ends by saying

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.389
No one attacked the Israelites during or in the time after Judith's life. However, this isn't reflected in the historical record

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.640
in fact, a lot of Judith's story isn't

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.359
Remember how we said our story began in 593 BCE because it was the 12th year of Nebuchadnezzar's rule

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.589
Well the great city of Nineveh had already been destroyed in 612 BCE Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian Empire

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.779
So when it fell so did the Empire and who destroyed it. It was Nebuchadnezzar himself

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:26.609
because he was a Babylonian king and the Assyrians were actually his arch enemies and he had just destroyed their capital later when

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.970
Holofernes seeks to attack Jerusalem well in reality

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.239
Nebuchadnezzar had already been besieging Jerusalem for the past two years and Bethulia Judith's town

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:44.280
No one really remembers where Bethulia was and it's only mentioned in this story as for the ending where the Jews live happily ever after

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.589
Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians actually destroyed Jerusalem in 587 BCE and

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.969
Ended the kingdom of Judah pretty much the opposite of what the story describes

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.110
Perhaps because of that the book of Judith wasn't included in Jewish Holy Scripture

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.410
but her story

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.850
persisted and Jews in medieval Europe would retell it during Hanukkah due to the themes it shares with the story of Judah Maccabee in

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.480
some oral traditions

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.909
Judith was even recast as Judah Maccabees aunt or daughter and like Judith and Holofernes tent they would eat cheese as part of their festive

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.750
meal often frying it in oil

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.410
While most Jews today now fry potatoes to make latkes during Hanukkah others still use cheese out of family tradition

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.080
even if the reason why has been long forgotten

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.880
