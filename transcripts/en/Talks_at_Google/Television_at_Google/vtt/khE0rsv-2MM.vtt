[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:06.805
BROOKE HEINICHEN:
So give a round

00:00:06.805 --> 00:00:09.070
of applause for Matt
Ingebretson, Jake Weisman,

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.925
and Pat Bishop.

00:00:09.925 --> 00:00:11.050
MATT INGEBRETSON: Hey, hey.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.160
BROOKE HEINICHEN: Guys.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.815
Have a seat.

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:16.370
MATT INGEBRETSON: Hello.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.330
Thanks for having us.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.830
BROOKE HEINICHEN:
Welcome to Google.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.621
So we just got the
opportunity to check out

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:21.820
episode 4 of "Corporate."

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.819
What did you guys think?

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:24.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.140
MATT INGEBRETSON: Thanks.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.500
BROOKE HEINICHEN: So why
don't we kick it off?

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.589
You guys can just talk
a little about the show

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.630
and your inspirations and
how you sort of came up

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.262
with the very unique concept
for an office-based show.

00:00:34.262 --> 00:00:36.220
MATT INGEBRETSON: Yeah,
well, first of all, I'm

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.615
excited to be at Google.

00:00:37.615 --> 00:00:39.150
I owe you guys my life.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.370
If you guys went away, things
would crumble so quickly.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.670
I'm desperate for you.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.150
Thank you so much.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.650
JAKE WEISMAN: Well, I mean--

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.280
I don't share those sentiments.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.070
I'm just kidding.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.570
I do.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.560
Thanks for everything.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.030
I think, first of
all, obviously,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.934
it's a darker look at
office life, which we--

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:00.850
but it's frustrating
when people call it dark,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.580
because it's also, just
I think, more honest.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.400
You guys have a lot of smiles on
your face, which we don't often

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.240
see at offices.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.611
MATT INGEBRETSON: You guys'
snack room is incredible,

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:10.110
by the way.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.640
I stole so much
food from you guys.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.769
Thank you for that as well.

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:14.560
JAKE WEISMAN: Yeah.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.240
I think that we were
trying to make--

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.350
trying to do a few things.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.600
One of the first
things we wanted to do

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.150
was create a show about
working that is a little more

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.516
honest than other shows.

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:26.140
And when "The Office" came out,
which I think is a great show--

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.330
the American version-- it
was considered like dark,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.960
but it's so goofy and so silly
and has a really goofy boss.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.460
And it's actually just about how
people get along at a company.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.660
And the real wonderful part
of work is your coworkers.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.430
And I think our point
is everyone's sad.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.790
There's no God.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.310
And you're going to die
screaming into the void.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.660
So you think about that when
you're at work, wondering

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.650
where your life went wrong.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.691
That was one of the first
things we wanted to do,

00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:55.790
was portray office life, how
most people feel about it.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.330
MATT INGEBRETSON: Yeah,
some of the inspirations

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.180
came from day jobs I had
working at large corporations

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.590
that I dreaded going
into work every day.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.320
I typically left on Friday
not excited about the weekend,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.180
but just wanting to
kill myself that I

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.580
was going to have to come
back there on Monday again.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.110
And again, maybe this
doesn't apply to you guys,

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.730
because you work at
a wonderful company,

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.938
who, again, I owe my life to.

00:02:16.938 --> 00:02:17.770
Thank you again.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.060
JAKE WEISMAN: But
overall, you're not happy.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.434
MATT INGEBRETSON:
Yeah, we know--

00:02:20.434 --> 00:02:22.080
we see the sadness in your eyes.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.575
JAKE WEISMAN: You live in
SF and you're open-minded,

00:02:23.575 --> 00:02:23.830
but you're sad.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.770
MATT INGEBRETSON:
You work at Google,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.936
and this was like a dream
for you, but you come here

00:02:26.936 --> 00:02:29.420
and the snacks don't matter
to you anymore, which

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.850
is why I stole them from you.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.640
I know you don't
actually care about them.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.110
But yeah, so that's the
inspiration for the show.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.750
And we're fans of
like-- we also, I

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.300
think, were frustrated
with a lot of TV comedies.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.800
I should be talking
to you, I guess.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.275
BROOKE HEINICHEN:
Nah, talk to them.

00:02:45.275 --> 00:02:46.530
JAKE WEISMAN: Oh, yeah,
what are we supposed to do?

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.655
MATT INGEBRETSON: Whatever.

00:02:47.655 --> 00:02:48.470
It doesn't matter.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.330
JAKE WEISMAN: The
camera's over other.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.747
BROOKE HEINICHEN:
Nothing matters.

00:02:50.747 --> 00:02:52.205
MATT INGEBRETSON:
But yeah, I think

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:53.819
frustrated with a
lot of TV comedies

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.110
just feeling a little lazy
in terms of how they shot it

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.570
and the filmmaking of it and
not taking advantage of the fact

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.640
that they're using cameras that
can do anything they fucking

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.940
want.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.350
And-- I can-- it doesn't matter.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.270
JAKE WEISMAN: Yeah,
you can curse.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.570
PAT BISHOP: But not at Google.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.190
MATT INGEBRETSON:
Yeah, not at Google.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.557
The censors of Google.

00:03:09.557 --> 00:03:11.140
And so we wanted to
make a little more

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.212
of an ambitious show
for Comedy Central that

00:03:13.212 --> 00:03:15.670
felt a little darker in tone
than what they would typically

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.330
do.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.710
BROOKE HEINICHEN: Can you
talk a lot about like--

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.600
are there any parts of the
storyline that are specifically

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.580
inspired by specific
instances that you've

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.600
had in your work life?

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.050
MATT INGEBRETSON:
Yeah, a lot of them.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.007
The episode that
aired last night--

00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:29.840
was that last night?

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.190
JAKE WEISMAN: No.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.200
MATT INGEBRETSON: What is today?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.900
Saturday?

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.200
PAT BISHOP: Friday.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.010
MATT INGEBRETSON: Friday.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.720
Wednesday.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.930
Our show is on at Wednesdays
at 10:00 PM on Comedy Central.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.529
In an episode about my
character taking naps in his car

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:43.570
in the parking garage at
work, which is something

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.150
that I actually did and got
caught doing by my boss,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.310
and it was a humiliating
experience for me.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.720
And Jake's storyline
is about him

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.390
getting spinal fusion surgery,
which you actually did.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.190
JAKE WEISMAN: Yeah,
well, and also people

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.560
that I dated and friends
of mine would check in

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.820
on me when I was recovering.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.236
And I thought they
cared about me,

00:03:59.236 --> 00:04:00.977
but they just wanted
my pain pills.

00:04:00.977 --> 00:04:03.435
MATT INGEBRETSON: It was an
incredible learning experience.

00:04:03.435 --> 00:04:04.530
JAKE WEISMAN: Opioid
addiction in America is real.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.512
MATT INGEBRETSON: Yeah.

00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:07.720
JAKE WEISMAN: But yeah, I
think what we tried to do--

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.242
the truth is, also, that
when writing the show,

00:04:10.242 --> 00:04:11.950
beyond the pilot, we
did interview people

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.700
from your company and from
Amazon and other corporations,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.430
and were like, off the
record, how bad is it?

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.104
And we tried to-- we had
postulated theories about what

00:04:23.104 --> 00:04:24.520
it's like to work
in corporations,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.250
and we had some specifics
given, but mostly,

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.190
it was just confirmed that
there's-- even in a wonderful

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.970
environment like Google, there's
just all this bureaucracy,

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.041
this necessary insanity
that can't be avoided.

00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:39.040
We tried to include as
much as that as possible.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.164
BROOKE HEINICHEN: Oh, good.

00:04:40.164 --> 00:04:42.550
Good to know Google is
not secluded from that.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.655
So I mean, I feel like if
I had watched the show--

00:04:44.655 --> 00:04:46.780
I used to work in a much
more corporate environment

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.494
in my prior job--

00:04:47.494 --> 00:04:48.910
I feel like if I
watched this, I'd

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.700
be very depressed, because
it doesn't seem like there's

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.320
much of a way out or much hope.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.552
Is there any hope for people
that work at Hampton Deville?

00:04:56.552 --> 00:04:58.010
MATT INGEBRETSON:
I don't think so.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.650
Or I mean, like
maybe quit your job.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.744
We had-- I told this story once,
but we had a friend of ours

00:05:04.744 --> 00:05:06.410
who worked at a very
corporate job watch

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.060
the pilot when that
was all we had made.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.018
We had just made the
pilot, and she watched it.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:13.300
And then shortly after
went and did ayahuasca,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.510
which everyone at Google
knows what ayahuasca is--

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.720
I assume-- did ayahuasca.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.830
And while she was hallucinating,
had hallucinations of our show.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.090
And it like was a life-changing
experience for her.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.880
When she got back,
she quit her job.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.970
So I think that's the
goal of this show.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.540
I don't-- is to get people to do
intense hallucinogens and then

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.410
abandon their life.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.060
I think that-- I
don't know if there's

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.470
a ton of hope in
this show, but I

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.320
think that there is catharsis in
it, in that like we understand

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.030
what you're going through.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.539
There's a darkness to it that
hopefully you can relate to.

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.580
I just don't think there's
a lot of hope in life.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.071
I think you can like--

00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:49.820
you can be good to one
another, and that's

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.000
about the best you can do.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.810
But in terms of like
working in this environment,

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.350
it is-- it typically
feels a little hopeless.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.725
PAT BISHOP: I
mean, I feel like--

00:05:55.725 --> 00:05:56.950
well, we work for Viacom.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.350
And we managed to like make a
show that makes fun of Viacom,

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.390
among other things that we--

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.090
I feel like we sort of
succeeded by turning

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.957
the system against itself.

00:06:07.957 --> 00:06:09.790
BROOKE HEINICHEN: Yeah,
I just watched that.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.789
There was a quote in that
episode that was like,

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:13.550
"All great artists
sell out," and you guys

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.755
work for Comedy Central and
are doing a talk at Google.

00:06:15.755 --> 00:06:16.940
So does that make you guys?

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.220
PAT BISHOP: Yeah, I think.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.520
MATT INGEBRETSON: We're
absolutely sellouts.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.740
Absolutely.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.240
JAKE WEISMAN: There's
a movie called

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.200
"SLC Punk!" that has a
great line where he's

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.000
like, "I'm not selling out.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.900
I'm buying in."

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.850
And I feel like in a world and
especially a country structured

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.109
for corporations to
win every single time,

00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:35.900
the best you can do is
buy in and try to be

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.200
nice to the people around you.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.030
What are you supposed to do?

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.450
Even if you go
live off the grid,

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.574
you're doing that in
reaction to a corporation.

00:06:41.574 --> 00:06:44.240
So all you can do is try to find
as good a situation as possible

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.490
that a corporation
is letting you do.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.270
MATT INGEBRETSON: I
do think if you're

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.710
in the darkest
moments of your life,

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.990
this show might
be-- you might want

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.364
to watch like
"Lord of the Rings"

00:06:51.364 --> 00:06:53.960
or something that's escapist,
like takes you out of it.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.626
JAKE WEISMAN: Yeah,
"Lord of the Rings,"

00:06:55.626 --> 00:06:57.562
that movie that
always takes you out.

00:06:57.562 --> 00:06:59.770
MATT INGEBRETSON: I don't
know why that came to mind.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.750
I haven't seen "Lord of the
Rings" in like 15 years,

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.090
but that's top of mind for
me today for some reason.

00:07:06.572 --> 00:07:09.155
BROOKE HEINICHEN: It seems like
your two main characters, Matt

00:07:09.155 --> 00:07:14.270
and Jake, are pretty unaffected
by the corporate brainwash.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.399
Why are they the only two?

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:16.940
Or do you think that
other characters

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.260
will come out as cynical?

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.240
JAKE WEISMAN: I think
unaffected maybe

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.770
like how our
characters seem, but I

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.050
think both of the
characters' lives

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.264
are completely in
reaction to corporations.

00:07:30.264 --> 00:07:32.930
Like my character-- I don't know
if you guys have seen the pilot

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.760
or not-- but my character
used to be in a punk band

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.180
and really failed at that.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.480
And he wanted to be an artist.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.080
He also was a street artist.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.780
He tried to express himself
artistically, failed at that,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.297
and realized that, oh, the
world is a capitalist nightmare,

00:07:47.297 --> 00:07:48.130
so I have to buy in.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.350
So I'm still structuring my
life around a corporation.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.670
I've just-- it's just basically
because also I'm depressed.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.950
And so it's like, OK,
well, this is what life is.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.085
I'll just live it out.

00:07:59.085 --> 00:08:00.710
MATT INGEBRETSON: I
think, too, that we

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.570
tried to explore,
build into the show

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.090
the idea that it's
no character's

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.730
like fault necessarily
that they're behaving badly

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:08.355
to some extent.

00:08:08.355 --> 00:08:09.938
It's like the fact
that they're a part

00:08:09.938 --> 00:08:12.360
of this larger corporation
that's doing very bad things.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.560
And so like the bosses
that we have in the show

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.570
are both essentially
psychopaths who

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.090
behave like maniacs towards us.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.150
But I think that they're just
further along down this path

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.790
than we are, and have been
corrupted a little more deeply

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.379
than we have.

00:08:27.379 --> 00:08:28.920
BROOKE HEINICHEN:
They were once you?

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.430
JAKE WEISMAN: Yeah, in the
episode, in the season finale,

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.229
you'll see--

00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:34.520
I'm not going to say what
happens-- but you'll see them

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.860
in our position, like
a flashback to them

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.590
in our position.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.086
So they used to be
excited like us,

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:42.210
but they've been beaten
down, and now they're rich.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:43.168
MATT INGEBRETSON: Yeah.

00:08:43.168 --> 00:08:45.170
BROOKE HEINICHEN: So it
doesn't matter anymore.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.670
Well, Pat, I want to give you
a chance to talk a little bit.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.426
Pat is the writer and director
and editor of the show.

00:08:50.426 --> 00:08:51.800
So can you talk
about the choices

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.560
you made as a director that
differentiates this idea,

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.727
either from other office
comedies or your past work?

00:08:56.727 --> 00:08:58.101
There's some more
obvious things.

00:08:58.101 --> 00:09:00.200
There's the darkness,
like the actual darkness

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.580
of the shots, the music.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.830
So can you just talk about
some of your choices there?

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.121
PAT BISHOP: Yeah, I think an
idea we had from the start

00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:08.070
was that we wanted to
make it more cinematic.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.320
And I think most companies
are kind of brightly lit

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.780
and have bright colors, because
it is supposed to be fun

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.405
and you're supposed
to want to hang out

00:09:16.405 --> 00:09:17.840
with this group of friends.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.940
But for this show, the
story we wanted to tell,

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.810
we needed it to
be darker and make

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.750
it feel a little
oppressive to be there.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.990
So yeah, we borrowed from
people like David Fincher

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.960
or like kind of just more
dramatic kind of sources

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.649
and mixed that in with
the comedy and stuff.

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:37.190
And we also got like
dramatic actors,

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.880
like Lance Reddick from "The
Wire," and Anne Dudek who

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.800
plays Kate on the show has
been in a bunch of stuff.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:51.110
And we tried to just kind of
take it more seriously in a way

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.640
and let the kind
of absurd things

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.450
that were happening play
in contrast to that.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.400
MATT INGEBRETSON: Yeah, I think
a lot of our favorite movies

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.920
and stuff are not things
that are pure comedies.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.290
They exist in a
sort of like drama

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.270
but that dips into comedy world.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.780
So we wanted to be a little
more in that vein than something

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.510
that takes everything
extremely likely, I think.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.760
BROOKE HEINICHEN: I'm curious.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.832
What would those
be, those dramas?

00:10:15.832 --> 00:10:17.540
JAKE WEISMAN: Well,
we love like the Coen

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.460
brothers and Paul Thomas
Anderson and stuff,

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.300
where's it's like--

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.790
"Boogie Nights" is a sprawling
drama, but really funny.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.260
And the Coen brothers
movies look incredible.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.400
And then so when the jokes come
out of these incredibly well

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.890
lit scenes-- and Pat has said
this before-- it's almost

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.230
like the joke is you set
up this beautiful painting,

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.760
and then said something stupid.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.050
Like that's the joke itself.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.716
It's the fact that
you did all this work

00:10:37.716 --> 00:10:39.146
to say a dumb joke
about a penis.

00:10:39.146 --> 00:10:40.020
You know what I mean?

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.080
And that's like,
that's the joke.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:42.705
But also--

00:10:42.705 --> 00:10:44.830
MATT INGEBRETSON: We like
people like Todd Solondz.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.710
Does anybody know
who Todd Solondz is?

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.306
JAKE WEISMAN: He did "Welcome to
the Dollhouse" and "Happiness,"

00:10:50.306 --> 00:10:51.680
but just really
like bleak humor.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.638
But also-- and I've talked
about this a bunch--

00:10:53.638 --> 00:10:55.190
but the movie "Airplane!"

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.712
is a really incredible comedy.

00:10:56.712 --> 00:10:58.670
It's very silly, but what
people don't remember

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.780
is it's a drama that's just
taken in a very silly way.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.910
Like Leslie Nielsen
was a dramatic actor,

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.089
and they picked him to
do extremely dumb jokes.

00:11:07.089 --> 00:11:08.505
But if you watch
"Airplane!", it's

00:11:08.505 --> 00:11:11.062
an intense drama about something
happening in an airplane

00:11:11.062 --> 00:11:12.520
and the dumbest
stuff is happening.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.924
I think we're more in that vein.

00:11:13.924 --> 00:11:16.340
We're getting Lance Reddick,
who could read the phone book

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.430
and you'd be engrossed, to
say incredibly dumb things.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.610
And that, to us, is
just the best comedy.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.920
And it's also just we're
trying to make a satire.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.020
And so it has to look good.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.536
Otherwise, you don't think
we're talking about anything.

00:11:29.536 --> 00:11:30.910
BROOKE HEINICHEN:
It makes sense.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.137
What's it like to work with
Lance or Aparna and the other--

00:11:34.137 --> 00:11:35.720
MATT INGEBRETSON:
Lance is incredible.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.190
He's very intimidating.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:42.680
He's like-- he made me feel
ashamed of my acting abilities.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.880
He's like a meticulously
prepared perfect actor.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.202
And offscreen, he's
like the sweetest guy,

00:11:49.202 --> 00:11:51.410
who is a great listener and
super politically minded.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.020
He's like amazing, A-plus.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.290
And Aparna is like a unicorn
genius, like brain-exploding,

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.280
wonderful person, who we
were lucky to work with,

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.420
because she just brings--

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.430
she adds like so many other
layers to the character

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.630
that we're not
necessarily even on.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.700
JAKE WEISMAN: I think one
thing that we're good at is--

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.160
and this is an obvious thing
you're told a lot, I think,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.802
in business, but
then when you do it,

00:12:11.802 --> 00:12:13.760
you realize how important
it is-- you just pick

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.250
people better than you.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.070
And you get the credit for it.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.660
So we just like cast people
that are way smarter,

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.952
way funnier, way more talented.

00:12:21.952 --> 00:12:24.076
And then, since we wrote
it, then everyone is like,

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:24.830
wow, you did it.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.800
But they're the best people.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.710
We just cast them.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:28.515
We just cast well.

00:12:28.515 --> 00:12:30.830
Everyone we cast was
like a friend or someone

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.000
we really admired.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.420
And we wrote Baron
Vaughn into the show.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.340
He wasn't in that episode,
but he's a genius.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.640
We wrote for specific people,
and we cast it extremely well.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.670
And that just does
so much of the work.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.130
BROOKE HEINICHEN: I feel
like every episode has

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.740
like this very stark, if
not written out on a bumper

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.466
sticker, reminder that
we're all going to die,

00:12:51.466 --> 00:12:53.140
in case you didn't know.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.430
So why that message?

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:56.780
Especially why Comedy Central?

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.710
JAKE WEISMAN: Why
did we do this?

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:58.090
BROOKE HEINICHEN: Yeah.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.465
Do you think people
are expecting

00:12:59.465 --> 00:13:02.230
to turn Comedy Central and
be like, ah, I want to die.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.080
MATT INGEBRETSON:
We did-- we have

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.330
gotten that question a little
bit of like, why did you

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:05.840
do this?

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.870
Or like, why did you make a show
with this type of messaging?

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.390
For me, it was I
found it extremely--

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.180
I have found it extremely
helpful in my life

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.240
to get that messaging
drilled into my head, which

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.402
is like, you're going
to die, but that's fine.

00:13:19.402 --> 00:13:20.360
We're all going to die.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.440
That's OK.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.850
It's very comforting to me.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.160
I'm sure it isn't for
everybody, but like--

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.927
JAKE WEISMAN: Who here is
thinking about dying right now?

00:13:25.927 --> 00:13:26.741
MATT INGEBRETSON: Yeah.

00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:27.824
JAKE WEISMAN: None of you?

00:13:27.824 --> 00:13:29.074
I don't believe anyone of you.

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:30.532
I'm thinking about
dying right now.

00:13:30.532 --> 00:13:32.300
On the plane here
just a few hours ago,

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.500
Matt and I were
having a conversation.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.930
It's like, if the plane crashed
right now, it'd be fine.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:36.290
MATT INGEBRETSON: Yeah.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.690
BROOKE HEINICHEN: Because if you
die, then there's no more pain.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.340
If you live, we get
to do cool stuff.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.120
But if you die, it's over.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.030
It's not that big a deal.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.820
And I think the craziest
thing about life

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.020
is that you're going to die.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.750
It's like-- it's the
best joke possible.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.320
It's structured as a joke.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.570
You do all this stuff.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:51.660
Create a family.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.710
Build a career.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.670
Ah, man, get mad at people
who break up with you.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:57.740
Do an amazing things.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:58.460
Learn lessons.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.501
And then it's over, and
it really doesn't matter.

00:14:00.501 --> 00:14:02.900
So that's just, to me,
the essence of comedy.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.010
There's a lot of like great
satirists, a lot of like--

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.650
French people who smoked
cigarettes and wrote

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.370
bleak things all
wrote about that.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.200
And so I just don't-- the thing
is, so much comedy avoids that.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.610
It's all escapism.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.620
And pure just mirth.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.930
And it's sometimes
funny, but it's not

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.430
based in the human truth,
where most of the people--

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.430
being around comedians,
you think they're silly,

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.235
but they're really
serious people.

00:14:27.235 --> 00:14:29.360
And they're thinking about
this stuff all the time.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.890
And we just-- that's
what we think is funny.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.348
PAT BISHOP: Yeah,
I think there are

00:14:32.348 --> 00:14:34.670
some comedies that start
with like a depressed parent

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.750
or something who is not happy
with their life and whatever.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:41.570
And then the answer for them
is like, go to Vegas and party.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:44.020
Have a crazy weekend.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.740
But that's not an answer.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.160
There is no great answer.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.172
MATT INGEBRETSON: Yeah.

00:14:48.172 --> 00:14:50.630
JAKE WEISMAN: It's just sort
of like, I think the problem--

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.840
one of the problems in life
is that we look at things--

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.970
we call certain things dark.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.150
And that is because
we're-- that's incorrect.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.080
Death is not dark.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.430
It's just a fact of life.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.360
You know what I mean?

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.310
Things that are dark
shouldn't be called dark.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:05.670
They're just things that are.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.836
But we call them dark,
because we're afraid of them.

00:15:07.836 --> 00:15:09.420
So if you talk
about death and you

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.420
talk about whatever people
perceive as darkness,

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.380
you're deflating the balloon.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.400
You can live a better
life in the meantime.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.040
If you don't take
life so seriously,

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.239
you can have a
better time, I think.

00:15:19.239 --> 00:15:21.530
BROOKE HEINICHEN: You should
be a motivational speaker.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.190
JAKE WEISMAN: Listen to me.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.840
MATT INGEBRETSON: Jake
as a motivational speaker

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.130
would be a huge mistake.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.851
It would be the most
psychotic, insane thing.

00:15:27.851 --> 00:15:30.100
JAKE WEISMAN: 99% of the
people would kill themselves,

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.246
but the 1% would truly live.

00:15:34.246 --> 00:15:35.534
That's what I'm meant for.

00:15:35.534 --> 00:15:37.450
BROOKE HEINICHEN: I hope
we're all in that 1%.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.612
JAKE WEISMAN: This
is a very crazy talk.

00:15:39.612 --> 00:15:41.570
BROOKE HEINICHEN: We're
going to take questions

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:43.150
from you guys in a
couple of minutes,

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.967
so start thinking about those.

00:15:44.967 --> 00:15:47.300
I did pull another quote from
one of the episodes, which

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.925
is that "We all want
to kill ourselves,

00:15:48.925 --> 00:15:51.682
but you can't, because the
internet cares about you."

00:15:51.682 --> 00:15:53.972
Do you think that's true?

00:15:53.972 --> 00:15:56.180
I mean, you're talking to
a lot of the internet here.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.170
MATT INGEBRETSON: Oh,
yeah, that's right.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:57.680
JAKE WEISMAN: The internet.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.010
PAT BISHOP: Well, I
think it's like that's

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:04.490
said to a character who
his job is tweeting.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:07.460
So I think people
care about you.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.520
There are other people.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.420
And I think, sometimes,
like even the interactions

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.820
we have can be just
through the internet,

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.940
or something that
feels like superficial.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.150
But I feel like even
that is like positive,

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:24.050
or you can get something out of
that, or a reason to like live

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.300
is to find people
to connect with,

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.400
either in real
life in a real way,

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.180
or on the internet
in a fake way.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.680
MATT INGEBRETSON:
Yeah, the internet

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.340
is just like a hyperbolic
version of what's going on.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.830
You can live or die
by it in a crazy way.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.940
It can turn on you, but
then make you feel good.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.670
It's very like a
wild relationship

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.230
we have with the internet.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.072
And the internet
cares about you.

00:16:47.072 --> 00:16:48.530
The other thing,
too, that comes in

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.460
that episode is the internet
cares about you right now,

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.570
but tomorrow, it doesn't
care about you at all

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.200
and has forgotten
you existed, and it's

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.280
back to talking about crumb.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.000
JAKE WEISMAN: Guys, I just
want to say something.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.910
The show is funny.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.700
So I know that it's very dark.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.120
MATT INGEBRETSON: It's fun.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.140
JAKE WEISMAN: It's
cloaked in darkness,

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.750
but there's a lot of jokes.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.420
Please watch it.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.170
MATT INGEBRETSON: I
don't know if we're

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.329
good salesmen for the show yet.

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:06.470
But we're working on that.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.760
Whatever we need to say to get
you to watch it, we'll say it.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.968
JAKE WEISMAN: If we were
selling clinical depression,

00:17:10.968 --> 00:17:12.339
we would sell out.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:17.120
We're the Costco knives
salesmen of depression.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.369
BROOKE HEINICHEN: Do you
think that as corporations, I

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:21.493
feel like, are shifting
generally towards like very

00:17:21.493 --> 00:17:23.420
employee-friendly
work environments--

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.880
like we have nap rooms here
at Google or free food--

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.400
and you see a lot of companies
starting to adopt that.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.250
It's almost like a
recruitment perk.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.960
Do you think that sort
of that the vision

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.937
of like a corporation as sort
of a jail for people's freedom

00:17:36.937 --> 00:17:38.020
is going to change at all?

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.440
Or is it just a
nicer box to be in?

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.981
PAT BISHOP: That
seems like an excuse

00:17:40.981 --> 00:17:42.786
to not let people go home.

00:17:42.786 --> 00:17:45.750
If you can't afford
housing in San Francisco,

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:49.760
you can just stay at
work all the time.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.010
MATT INGEBRETSON: I think,
too, that a lot of the show

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.980
comes about like the--

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.884
it's not the setting you're
in so much, but the people

00:17:56.884 --> 00:17:58.300
around you or the
structure of it,

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.170
where you have
somebody above you,

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.750
a boss, who essentially owns
your life while you're work.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.425
And hopefully, they're nice to
you and they're a good person.

00:18:05.425 --> 00:18:06.800
But if they're
not, they're going

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.050
to slowly degrade your
sense of well-being

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:10.140
over a period of time.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:10.580
JAKE WEISMAN:
Yeah, I was talking

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.770
to Aparna, Aparna Nancherla, who
is a genius and is on the show.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.740
And she was-- she
talks about companies

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.570
doing all these wellness
things as viruses

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:18.860
that are getting smarter.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.430
So really, they're just trying
to destroy you with a bigger

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:23.732
smile on your face.

00:18:23.732 --> 00:18:24.440
And I don't know.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.660
I make comedy for a living.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.134
I really shouldn't be talking
about any of this stuff.

00:18:28.134 --> 00:18:28.950
BROOKE HEINICHEN:
No, that's good.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:29.540
I mean--

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.160
MATT INGEBRETSON: That
means that I love bean bags,

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.340
and I would love to
sit one every day.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:32.750
JAKE WEISMAN: Yeah,
I mean, you guys

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:33.870
seem to have a good situation.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.060
MATT INGEBRETSON: We're going
to steal some bean bags--

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:35.280
JAKE WEISMAN: You're
smiling a lot.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.660
MATT INGEBRETSON:
--on the way out.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.701
JAKE WEISMAN: I think
they're like pumping Prozac

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:40.510
through the vents or something.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.451
BROOKE HEINICHEN: Heck, yeah.

00:18:42.451 --> 00:18:42.950
Awesome.

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:45.020
Well, I do want to make sure
we get time for some audience

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:45.780
questions.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.079
Does anyone have--

00:18:47.079 --> 00:18:48.620
MATT INGEBRETSON:
If you don't, we're

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.744
happy to just keep talking.

00:18:49.744 --> 00:18:50.780
Yeah.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.460
BROOKE HEINICHEN: Do we want
to do a hand-held mic before,

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:52.900
because I know this-

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.108
JAKE WEISMAN: Oh, that's fun.

00:18:56.901 --> 00:18:58.400
You guys seem like
very nice people.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.770
MATT INGEBRETSON: By the
way, thanks for having us.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:18:59.940
We--

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.025
JAKE WEISMAN: I've always
wanted to go to Google.

00:19:01.025 --> 00:19:02.233
My brother-in-law works here.

00:19:02.233 --> 00:19:04.460
I'm not going to say who he is.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.251
BROOKE HEINICHEN:
They've got to leave here

00:19:06.251 --> 00:19:08.740
and go back to their desks,
go back to their managers.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.900
Try to be productive now.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.691
AUDIENCE: Is it on?

00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:11.330
OK.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.080
What would you guys
change about your show

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.289
if you had like 10
times the budget?

00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:16.580
JAKE WEISMAN: I think I would--

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.390
MATT INGEBRETSON: Well,
it would have been--

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.220
it was so hard to make
the show look like it did,

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.094
because we barely had
a budget for this show,

00:19:21.094 --> 00:19:22.310
compared to like--

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:23.885
we wanted it to feel
like-- we wanted

00:19:23.885 --> 00:19:25.760
it to feel and look
expensive, and we did not

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.540
have the money to do that.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.470
JAKE WEISMAN: I think we
would burn stuff down.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:29.428
MATT INGEBRETSON: Yeah.

00:19:29.428 --> 00:19:32.329
JAKE WEISMAN: I mean, I
have a boyish need for fire.

00:19:32.329 --> 00:19:34.370
So yeah, I would blow up
a building or something.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:35.210
But that's about it.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.660
I think, actually, though,
the restriction of a budget

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:39.260
is good.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.369
It makes you be a
little more creative.

00:19:41.369 --> 00:19:41.910
I don't know.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:43.120
But Pat is the one
who really has to say.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.994
PAT BISHOP: We would
have had more protesters

00:19:44.994 --> 00:19:46.280
in that episode.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.900
We tried to make
it look like a lot.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.316
MATT INGEBRETSON: The practical
things that we couldn't do

00:19:50.316 --> 00:19:54.650
are like more locations, more
extras, and more shoot days.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:58.125
So that even more shots could
have been cool as fuck looking.

00:19:58.125 --> 00:19:59.500
AUDIENCE: I have
a few questions.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.590
I'll just ask one.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.990
Where did the creation
and development--

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.240
how did that line up
with the 2016 election?

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.940
And do you think that the
fact that our culture,

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.380
like the greed
and everything, is

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.000
more bald-faced in the
culture makes your jokes

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.790
land more or less?

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.050
MATT INGEBRETSON: We want--

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:18.450
oh, go ahead.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:18.950
Sorry.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.540
AUDIENCE: And let
me think if I have

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.990
another question about that.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.300
Yeah, I'm just curious.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.739
Like for me, I saw the
first two episodes.

00:20:25.739 --> 00:20:26.780
I haven't seen the third.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.090
And the fourth one, this
was the darkest for me,

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.790
by far, because of
the co-optation.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.860
When I heard the folk
music on the sound,

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.847
that was heartbreaking.

00:20:35.847 --> 00:20:37.180
You guys broke my fucking heart.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.140
JAKE WEISMAN: We're trying
to break your heart.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.000
AUDIENCE: Anyway, that's
my first question.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.958
MATT INGEBRETSON: Well,
there are a few things.

00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:45.760
One is that episode
was written way

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.004
before the-- is it Kylie
Jenner or Kendall Jenner?

00:20:48.004 --> 00:20:48.670
AUDIENCE: Kylie.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.000
MATT INGEBRETSON:
Do you remember

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.890
that Pepsi thing she did?

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.680
She did this thing where she
did like a Pepsi commercial

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.720
where she was like Pepsi was
like being with the protesters.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.720
JAKE WEISMAN: Pepsi solved
the race wars, right?

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.620
Isn't that what it was?

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.490
MATT INGEBRETSON: It was one
of the most insane things.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.365
And this was written
well in advance of that.

00:21:03.365 --> 00:21:05.620
We did-- we wrote the
whole show and shot--

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.880
when did the election happen?

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.515
During the shooting?

00:21:07.515 --> 00:21:08.430
JAKE WEISMAN: In November.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:08.931
MATT INGEBRETSON:
Yeah, that's right.

00:21:08.931 --> 00:21:09.556
Oh, yeah, 2016.

00:21:09.556 --> 00:21:11.149
Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:12.940
JAKE WEISMAN: That's
when elections happen.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.148
MATT INGEBRETSON: Oh, my God.

00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:15.300
It's all such a crazy blur.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.310
PAT BISHOP: It's a
repressed traumatic event.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.530
MATT INGEBRETSON: I just
don't want to think about it.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.870
JAKE WEISMAN: I think that we--

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.729
so obviously, Trump
is a nightmare.

00:21:21.729 --> 00:21:23.020
There's no question about that.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.570
And what's going on right now
is bringing that to the surface

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.520
maybe a little more
than if Hillary had won.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.060
But I do--

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.080
MATT INGEBRETSON: A lot more.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:29.860
JAKE WEISMAN: But
I don't think it

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.450
would have been any more true.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:33.200
I think we were writing--

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.470
I mean, obviously, the
fact that Trump won shows

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.630
that neither
candidate was really

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.900
making America very happy.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.700
So I do think we were
writing to whoever won.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.350
We didn't know who-- we
thought that Hillary would win.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:46.240
So we were shocked.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.350
But I think if we wrote stuff,
it would still ring true today.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.310
And that was our point.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.460
Our point is not to make any
specific political points.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.170
It's supposed to just
be about society.

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.057
We're coming at it from more
of a libertarian perspective,

00:21:59.057 --> 00:22:00.640
I think, comedy-wise,
and just talking

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.180
about society and corporations
and their hold on society

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:04.815
as a whole.

00:22:04.815 --> 00:22:05.950
MATT INGEBRETSON:
Well, yeah, I think--

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:06.760
yeah, exactly.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.910
I think that regardless
of who had gotten elected,

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.100
it still would have been
about how corporations

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.300
are dominating our lives.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.380
That was kind of
what we were trying

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.921
to get at versus
trying to comment on

00:22:15.921 --> 00:22:17.914
like the political
space that we're in.

00:22:17.914 --> 00:22:19.580
Although, by talking
about corporations,

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.648
you're doing that to some
extent, no matter what.

00:22:21.648 --> 00:22:24.064
AUDIENCE: I guess my question,
and maybe you did answer it

00:22:24.064 --> 00:22:26.350
a bit, but do you
think the jokes land

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:31.530
better or worse, given that
everything, all of this

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:32.220
is like--

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:32.710
MATT INGEBRETSON: Yeah.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:33.694
AUDIENCE: It was
very hidden before,

00:22:33.694 --> 00:22:35.170
but it's really not hidden now.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:36.267
MATT INGEBRETSON: Yeah.

00:22:36.267 --> 00:22:38.350
JAKE WEISMAN: I mean, maybe
it helps a little bit.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.340
It's hard to say.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.890
I mean, we weren't--

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:45.424
yeah, I think Trump,
just being a psychopath,

00:22:45.424 --> 00:22:47.590
and obviously, like
corporations getting tax breaks,

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.548
like that's only going
to help us, because it's

00:22:49.548 --> 00:22:50.920
more distrust of corporations.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.045
But I think it's sad that
it would be more now.

00:22:54.045 --> 00:22:56.170
People should have been
more aware, no matter what.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:56.500
MATT INGEBRETSON:
Yeah, it's kind

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.080
of like I think if Hillary got
elected, this would have been

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.387
more subversive, and
kind of like a little

00:23:01.387 --> 00:23:03.220
to the side of what
felt like was happening,

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.520
whereas now it feels like
we're all an open wound,

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.129
and so it's like watching.

00:23:07.129 --> 00:23:08.920
Everything's burning
around us and the show

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.200
is also commenting on how
everything's burning around.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.712
So I don't know.

00:23:12.712 --> 00:23:14.170
AUDIENCE: Can you
tell us something

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.330
about the whole
process of pitching

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.830
the show to Comedy Central?

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.470
How did they react
to this pitch?

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.624
PAT BISHOP: Well, they--
yeah, we pitched them--

00:23:24.624 --> 00:23:27.040
we pitched it initially as a
sketch show, essentially kind

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.060
of like "Portlandia," but
it's inside a corporation.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.720
And they wanted
it more narrative

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.310
and kind of based
around Matt and Jake

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:35.470
as kind of central
characters for the audience

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:37.116
to like hang onto.

00:23:37.116 --> 00:23:38.740
And I think they were
very open to-- we

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.114
were very clear about the kind
of dark tone and direction

00:23:41.114 --> 00:23:42.520
of it from the
start, and I think

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.490
they were supportive of
that, and wanted something

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.520
that was different
from "Workaholics,"

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.550
which was the other office
place comedy show they had on.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.890
So I think they were ready
to take a chance on something

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:58.900
and really responded to our kind
of like ideas visually for it.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.440
And then we had a kind of long
development process as it goes,

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.990
but we kind of figured out
what the show should be

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:09.430
and how to build a world
that could allow us to hit

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.610
a lot of different topics.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.890
And was broad enough
in its concept

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.550
to let us kind of talk
about whatever we wanted to.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.110
JAKE WEISMAN: And
also, one reason

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:18.735
why we were allowed
to do the dark tone

00:24:18.735 --> 00:24:22.060
is we made YouTube videos
and sketches for years.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.060
And they're pretty dark.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.730
So I mean, we think
they're silly,

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.580
but we have a general
dark tone, or what

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.110
is called the dark tone.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:32.380
And we showed that for
many years on YouTube.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.940
And so that allowed
us to be like,

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.002
we can pull this
kind of thing off.

00:24:36.002 --> 00:24:37.960
MATT INGEBRETSON: Yeah,
what we found typically

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.200
is that development executives
who work at networks

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.500
are desperate for someone to
come in and know what they're

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.170
talking about or have like a
very specific idea, that they

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:50.800
spend most of their
time just like miserable

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.990
hoping that somebody comes
in with the right idea.

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.000
And so if you like
have the right idea,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.700
it was pretty smooth
getting through it.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.840
Although, it was a lot of work.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.923
And it's been three years
since we had pitched it,

00:25:00.923 --> 00:25:02.530
which is crazy to think about.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.440
AUDIENCE: In this
last episode, you

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.580
have the CEO talking about
how the protesters are buying

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.345
the products made of oil.

00:25:11.345 --> 00:25:14.020
And in your own show, which is
kind of like a protest against

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:18.720
corporations, you have
your plug for Chili's.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.770
Is there any true
way-- or in your mind,

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.070
what would be a
true way to stage

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:26.340
a protest of corporations?

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.120
Is there a way to do that?

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.270
MATT INGEBRETSON: Well,
I think that I think so.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.900
I mean, I think it essentially
is what people have been doing,

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.275
which is like the
best you can do

00:25:34.275 --> 00:25:36.640
is try to get new
messaging out there,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.660
and I think be aware that you
can be co-opted very easily,

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:46.030
or like kind of enveloped in the
capitalist system very quickly.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:50.200
But I mean, we talked
about the Wall Street--

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.079
what was the Wall
Street protest called?

00:25:52.079 --> 00:25:52.870
PAT BISHOP: Occupy.

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:54.850
MATT INGEBRETSON: Occupy
Wall Street as like--

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:56.800
that it's sort of
thought of as--

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.220
my memory is just failing me.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.510
But it's sort of,
I think, talked

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:04.000
about kind of as a
failure in a lot of ways,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.737
but we do talk about the 1%.

00:26:06.737 --> 00:26:08.320
There's a lot of
stuff that has become

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.450
a part of the popular
like mainstream

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.340
conversation that has
resulted from that.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.700
So I don't think the
messaging in this episode was

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.270
a little bit like it's all
futile or you will be co-opted,

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:22.960
but I think our actual view
is not quite that cynical.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.960
Or I don't know.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.430
PAT BISHOP: Yeah, it is true.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:29.080
But the media is like what you
need to get your message out

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:29.830
there.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.630
And the media has its
own sort of agenda,

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.910
or its own kind of
sources of funding.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.260
So yeah, it is hard to like--

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:41.260
I do think there is a sort of
hesitancy to like give light

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.810
to people who are really
saying there's something

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:46.480
wrong with the whole system,
because so many people are

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:50.310
benefiting from it.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:51.960
I don't know what
the solution is.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.470
JAKE WEISMAN: I honestly
like-- and this is maybe

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:55.900
coming from an extremely
ridiculously privileged point

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.820
of view, but on
a personal level,

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.397
just try to do what you
want to do with your life.

00:27:00.397 --> 00:27:01.480
Like you know what I mean?

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.800
Like what can you
really do except

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.175
follow your dreams, if you're
able to follow your dreams?

00:27:05.175 --> 00:27:05.770
We do comedy.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:06.700
It's a joke.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.764
It's a lot of hard work.

00:27:07.764 --> 00:27:09.430
And we work for a
corporation right now.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.390
But it's still really fun.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.990
And in some way, it's
a protest personally.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:16.390
It's like, well, I'm
doing what I want to do.

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:17.645
I'm doing the best I can.

00:27:17.645 --> 00:27:19.270
I don't know if
there's another answer.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.728
PAT BISHOP: I do
think the internet

00:27:20.728 --> 00:27:24.430
and just people's ability to
get videos and communication out

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:27.200
there has like lead to a
lot of protests and kind

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.480
of issues that weren't
coming up before coming up.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.810
So I do think there's
positive things.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:36.140
And it can be kind of chaotic,
or the kind of mob mentality

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.276
of the internet, but it is--

00:27:38.276 --> 00:27:39.650
I think there's
more of an outlet

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:42.530
now than there
used to be to shine

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:46.370
a light on something that
people don't want to be seen.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:51.030
AUDIENCE: So as comedians, what
is your actual work schedule

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:51.530
like?

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.030
When do you write?

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:53.810
How do you write?

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:55.340
How much time do
you spend writing?

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.010
Do you spend a lot of time doing
work not related to the show

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.170
and advancing your
comedian careers?

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:02.118
JAKE WEISMAN: This is
going to sound crazy.

00:28:02.118 --> 00:28:04.201
But what we do is we just
show up on set and riff.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.090
We work really hard.

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:09.710
We work really, really hard.

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:11.257
If you're making--
are you talking

00:28:11.257 --> 00:28:13.840
about comedians making this show
or just comedians in general?

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.548
AUDIENCE: Oh, just
yourselves in general,

00:28:15.548 --> 00:28:16.590
like your own kind of--

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.300
MATT INGEBRETSON: Yeah,
I feel like it's not

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.449
cool to admit how hard you
work, but we worked really hard

00:28:20.449 --> 00:28:20.990
on this show.

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:23.531
JAKE WEISMAN: We work-- yeah,
we were writing like seven days

00:28:23.531 --> 00:28:25.460
a week for many months.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.260
And there's always
rewriting to do.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.710
There's always
punching up to do.

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.626
And then when we're
shooting the show, I mean,

00:28:30.626 --> 00:28:32.040
that's really hard.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.474
That's a lot of hours per
day, every single day.

00:28:34.474 --> 00:28:36.140
And you have to go
home, memorize lines.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.624
Sometimes be punching up
scripts for the next day.

00:28:39.624 --> 00:28:41.540
Again, it took us three
years to get this show

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.790
on air, and probably
like 3 and 1/2 years

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.440
from the conception of it.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.670
So I would say in order
to make a TV show,

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:50.407
if you want to be good,
it's your whole life.

00:28:50.407 --> 00:28:51.990
You're thinking about
it all the time.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.700
It's like your child.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.390
MATT INGEBRETSON:
Yeah, we wrote.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:54.230
JAKE WEISMAN: You just
think about it constantly.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:55.850
MATT INGEBRETSON:
Yeah, we wrote--

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:59.720
when we were writing it,
which we wrote for 12 weeks,

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.780
we wrote from like, I guess
like 10:00 to 5:00 or 6:00,

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.750
but then the three of us would
always either meet up afterward

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.210
or go home individually
and continue doing work.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.060
So also, this is not
us complaining at all.

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.830
Just it's like we're more
than happy to do this work.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.480
I feel like sometimes
I'm like bitching

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.610
about writing comedy
for a living, which

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:17.690
is like an insane job.

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.201
But there was a lot of work.

00:29:19.201 --> 00:29:21.200
JAKE WEISMAN: It's just--
it's like as much work

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.290
as anything that's
hard to do takes.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:27.980
It's seven days a week, and
it takes everything you have

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.630
and all of your intelligence.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:30.770
PAT BISHOP: And then
every now and then, you

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.540
have to wait like four
months for the network

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.956
to tell you whether or not
they're going to make the show.

00:29:34.956 --> 00:29:36.760
And you have nothing
to do except worry.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.520
MATT INGEBRETSON: Yeah, after
we turned in the finished pilot

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.279
that we had shot, they
waited like three months

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:45.320
to tell us whether or not
it was going to series.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.500
And I went on a
lot of long walks.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.240
I got into the band Fleet Foxes.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.710
I unexpectedly found myself
listening to Fleet Foxes a lot

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.604
in that period.

00:29:56.604 --> 00:29:57.770
JAKE WEISMAN: If you're in--

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.397
but also, just in comedy, if
you do stand-up or you act

00:30:00.397 --> 00:30:02.480
or whatever, like the
second you finish something,

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.110
you always feel
like you're behind.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.830
So then we had to take time
off from performing, because we

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:10.134
do stand-up as well, to
then get back to stand-up

00:30:10.134 --> 00:30:12.050
and doing that every
single night and writing.

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:13.466
There's always--
because it's kind

00:30:13.466 --> 00:30:15.800
of an entrepreneurial
thing, and because comedy

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.437
is a thing that kind of doesn't
need to exist in the world,

00:30:18.437 --> 00:30:21.710
you have to work
so much extra hard

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:25.670
in order to make yourself
be commercially viable.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.970
So you're working almost every
day of the year, if you really

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:30.312
want to make it work, I think.

00:30:30.312 --> 00:30:32.270
BROOKE HEINICHEN: Well,
thank you guys so much.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.500
Hopefully, we can
see in the future

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.600
an episode of "Corporate"
based around Google,

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.430
or some sort of tech influence.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.584
I'm excited to see how
that comes through.

00:30:39.584 --> 00:30:41.000
Yeah, so you guys
should check out

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.640
"Corporate," Wednesdays,
10:00 PM on Comedy Central,

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.890
or online.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.412
ComedyCentral.com, or on the
app, you can watch it there.

00:30:47.412 --> 00:30:49.370
And let's thank these
guys for coming by today.

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:51.161
MATT INGEBRETSON: Thank
you guys very much.

00:30:51.161 --> 00:30:55.720
[APPLAUSE]
