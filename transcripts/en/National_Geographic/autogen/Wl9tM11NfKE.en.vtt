geologists studying the stone found that

geologists studying the stone found that
 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.520
geologists studying the stone found that
the patina was continuous across the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530
the patina was continuous across the
 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.700
the patina was continuous across the
front of the stone and crucially within

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710
front of the stone and crucially within
 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.510
front of the stone and crucially within
the inscribed letters

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.520
 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.370
they concluded the inscription must have

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
they concluded the inscription must have
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:16.969
they concluded the inscription must have
been carved in the distant past

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.399
next the geologists analyzed the

next the geologists analyzed the
 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.880
next the geologists analyzed the
chemical makeup of the patina they were

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890
chemical makeup of the patina they were
 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.490
chemical makeup of the patina they were
looking for calcium carbonate and other

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
looking for calcium carbonate and other
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.620
looking for calcium carbonate and other
chemicals which would tell them if it

chemicals which would tell them if it
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.020

had formed in the Jerusalem area they

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030
had formed in the Jerusalem area they
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.899
had formed in the Jerusalem area they
found that the trace elements like

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
found that the trace elements like
 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.050
found that the trace elements like
strontium iron magnesium and other

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
strontium iron magnesium and other
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.029
strontium iron magnesium and other
elements that are in the calcium

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039
elements that are in the calcium
 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.990
elements that are in the calcium
carbonate they said exactly the same

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000
carbonate they said exactly the same
 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.289

the patina tests indicated that the

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069
the patina tests indicated that the
 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.609
the patina tests indicated that the
stone came from Jerusalem and that the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
stone came from Jerusalem and that the
 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.990
stone came from Jerusalem and that the
inscription really was very old the big

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000
inscription really was very old the big
 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.330
inscription really was very old the big
question now was how old

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340
 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.010
although it was impossible to date the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020
although it was impossible to date the
 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.580
although it was impossible to date the
stone itself remarkably within the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590
stone itself remarkably within the
 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.120
stone itself remarkably within the

there were minut particles of charcoal

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350
there were minut particles of charcoal
 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:28.510
there were minut particles of charcoal
and these could be carbon-dated the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520
and these could be carbon-dated the
 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.010
and these could be carbon-dated the
results were conclusive

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020
results were conclusive
 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.480
results were conclusive
they were 2,300 years old so the carving

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490
they were 2,300 years old so the carving
 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:44.220
they were 2,300 years old so the carving
beneath the patina had to be even older

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230
 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.009
there seemed to be no doubt that the

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019
there seemed to be no doubt that the
 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.830
there seemed to be no doubt that the
stone came from the Jerusalem area and

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840
stone came from the Jerusalem area and
 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.559
stone came from the Jerusalem area and
the inscription was thousands of years

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569
the inscription was thousands of years
 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.319
the inscription was thousands of years
old

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329
 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.069
and there was one last discovery that

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079
and there was one last discovery that
 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.349
and there was one last discovery that
reinforced the conclusion that it came

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359
reinforced the conclusion that it came
 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.399
reinforced the conclusion that it came
from the temple of Solomon the patina

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409
from the temple of Solomon the patina
 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:15.390
from the temple of Solomon the patina
contained tiny flecks of gold just what

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400
contained tiny flecks of gold just what
 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.789
contained tiny flecks of gold just what
one might expect from a stone that had

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799
one might expect from a stone that had
 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.550
one might expect from a stone that had
been through a fire in a temple lined

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560
been through a fire in a temple lined
 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.219
been through a fire in a temple lined
with gold
