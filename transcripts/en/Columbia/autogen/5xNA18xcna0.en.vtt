how this one corner differs from the
other corners and I'm going to discuss

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160
other corners and I'm going to discuss
 

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.600
other corners and I'm going to discuss
that in a second but basically this part

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:22.610
that in a second but basically this part
 

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:26.069
that in a second but basically this part
of the jig is going to go into the vise

00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079
of the jig is going to go into the vise
 

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:29.859

00:13:27.669 --> 00:13:27.679
on or screwed down with these screws now
 

00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:29.470
on or screwed down with these screws now
these happen to be called Allen cap

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480
these happen to be called Allen cap
 

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.619
these happen to be called Allen cap
screws they take a special sort of

00:13:32.619 --> 00:13:32.629
screws they take a special sort of
 

00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:34.449
screws they take a special sort of
hexagonal wrench to tighten them and

00:13:34.449 --> 00:13:34.459
hexagonal wrench to tighten them and
 

00:13:34.459 --> 00:13:36.489
hexagonal wrench to tighten them and
you've probably seen them before and

00:13:36.489 --> 00:13:36.499
you've probably seen them before and
 

00:13:36.499 --> 00:13:41.080
you've probably seen them before and
these will be tightened like this

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.090
 

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.740
once your nameplate is down on the jig

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:44.750
once your nameplate is down on the jig
 

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.780
once your nameplate is down on the jig
these screws tighten below the surface

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:47.790
these screws tighten below the surface
 

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:51.500
these screws tighten below the surface
of at the bottom of the jig they'll come

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:51.510
of at the bottom of the jig they'll come
 

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.960
of at the bottom of the jig they'll come
down like this and we will be free to

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:53.970
down like this and we will be free to
 

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.320
down like this and we will be free to
machine all the surfaces of this plate

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:57.330
machine all the surfaces of this plate
 

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.200
machine all the surfaces of this plate
while making your nameplate so we'll be

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:00.210
while making your nameplate so we'll be
 

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.600
while making your nameplate so we'll be
able to for example change the shape of

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:02.610
able to for example change the shape of
 

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.430
able to for example change the shape of
this rectangular block into whatever

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440
this rectangular block into whatever
 

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.700
this rectangular block into whatever
whatever we want really and the only

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:07.710
whatever we want really and the only
 

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:09.740
whatever we want really and the only
thing you kind of have to appreciate is

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:09.750
thing you kind of have to appreciate is
 

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.040
thing you kind of have to appreciate is
that to cut in to cut all the way around

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:13.050
that to cut in to cut all the way around
 

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.320
that to cut in to cut all the way around
your piece and complete the profiling

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:15.330
your piece and complete the profiling
 

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.900
your piece and complete the profiling
we're going to have to cut a little bit

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:17.910
we're going to have to cut a little bit
 

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.410
we're going to have to cut a little bit
into this jig that's okay because these

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:21.420
into this jig that's okay because these
 

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.450
into this jig that's okay because these
screws go below the surface and they

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:23.460
screws go below the surface and they
 

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.060
screws go below the surface and they
were made to do that and we won't go too

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:26.070
were made to do that and we won't go too
 

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.030
were made to do that and we won't go too
far below but while we profiling out

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040
far below but while we profiling out
 

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.400
far below but while we profiling out
your nameplate we will actually cut into

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:31.410
your nameplate we will actually cut into
 

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.960
your nameplate we will actually cut into
this into the Plexiglas a little bit now

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:34.970
this into the Plexiglas a little bit now
 

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.610
this into the Plexiglas a little bit now
the reason why we've made the jig like

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620
the reason why we've made the jig like
 

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.490
the reason why we've made the jig like
this is as follows after you make your

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:40.500
this is as follows after you make your
 

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.010
this is as follows after you make your
nameplate one of your fellow classmates

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:43.020
nameplate one of your fellow classmates
 

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.490
nameplate one of your fellow classmates
will want to make his or hers now we

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:46.500
will want to make his or hers now we
 

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.240
will want to make his or hers now we
will determine from this corner of the

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:50.250
will determine from this corner of the
 

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.120
will determine from this corner of the
jig we will set our zero zero of our CNC

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.130
jig we will set our zero zero of our CNC
 

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.680
jig we will set our zero zero of our CNC
machine and everything will be

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:54.690
machine and everything will be
 

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.590
machine and everything will be
referenced from the same corner and

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:56.600
referenced from the same corner and
 

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.850
referenced from the same corner and
therefore when we take out your

00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:58.860
therefore when we take out your
 

00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:59.510
therefore when we take out your
nameplate

00:14:59.510 --> 00:14:59.520
nameplate
 

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.540
nameplate
and replace it with someone else's we

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:02.550
and replace it with someone else's we
 

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.940
and replace it with someone else's we
will not have changed our X Y zero and

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:04.950
will not have changed our X Y zero and
 

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.830
will not have changed our X Y zero and
we won't have to go through the somewhat

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:06.840
we won't have to go through the somewhat
 

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.890
we won't have to go through the somewhat
time-consuming task of read establishing

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:09.900
time-consuming task of read establishing
 

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.900
time-consuming task of read establishing
the corner of the piece every single

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:11.910
the corner of the piece every single
 

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.330
the corner of the piece every single
time we change plates so that's why

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:14.340
time we change plates so that's why
 

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:19.260
time we change plates so that's why
that's the philosophy of this jig

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:19.270
 

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.329
here are the Allen screws I mentioned

00:15:21.329 --> 00:15:21.339
here are the Allen screws I mentioned
 

00:15:21.339 --> 00:15:23.460
here are the Allen screws I mentioned
that are on the jig and this is what's

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:23.470
that are on the jig and this is what's
 

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.829
that are on the jig and this is what's
going to hold the nameplate down to that

00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839
going to hold the nameplate down to that
 

00:15:25.839 --> 00:15:29.730
going to hold the nameplate down to that
upper Plexiglas plate on the jig this is

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:29.740
upper Plexiglas plate on the jig this is
 

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.620
upper Plexiglas plate on the jig this is
an Allen cap screw you can tell because

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:31.630
an Allen cap screw you can tell because
 

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.170
an Allen cap screw you can tell because
it has the hex it uses an Allen wrench

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:34.180
it has the hex it uses an Allen wrench
 

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.410
it has the hex it uses an Allen wrench
the hex is in here and it happens to be

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:37.420
the hex is in here and it happens to be
 

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:41.400
the hex is in here and it happens to be
what's called a 1/4 - 28 screw now what

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:41.410
what's called a 1/4 - 28 screw now what
 

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.310
what's called a 1/4 - 28 screw now what
that means is the screw is 1/4 of an

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320
that means is the screw is 1/4 of an
 

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.060
that means is the screw is 1/4 of an
inch in diameter and it is it has 28

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:48.070
inch in diameter and it is it has 28
 

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.370
inch in diameter and it is it has 28
threads per inch so if you could count

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:50.380
threads per inch so if you could count
 

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.540
threads per inch so if you could count
these there'd be 28 of these for him we

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:54.550
these there'd be 28 of these for him we
 

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:58.260
these there'd be 28 of these for him we
must tap 1/4 28 hole and in order to do

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:58.270
must tap 1/4 28 hole and in order to do
 

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.970
must tap 1/4 28 hole and in order to do
that we need to determine the drill

00:15:59.970 --> 00:15:59.980
that we need to determine the drill
 

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.699
that we need to determine the drill
needed to make such a hole we consult

00:16:02.699 --> 00:16:02.709
needed to make such a hole we consult
 

00:16:02.709 --> 00:16:04.980
needed to make such a hole we consult
the drill chart and see that the quarter

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:04.990
the drill chart and see that the quarter
 

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.940
the drill chart and see that the quarter
28 hole requires a number 3 drill this

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:08.950
28 hole requires a number 3 drill this
 

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.910
28 hole requires a number 3 drill this

00:21:53.639 --> 00:21:53.649
is re-enter the drill menu and we will
 

00:21:53.649 --> 00:21:56.310
is re-enter the drill menu and we will
select pattern now we only have to drill

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320
select pattern now we only have to drill
 

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.100
select pattern now we only have to drill
two holes and I could simply put in the

00:21:59.100 --> 00:21:59.110
two holes and I could simply put in the
 

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.840
two holes and I could simply put in the
coordinate information of those two

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:00.850
coordinate information of those two
 

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.000
coordinate information of those two
holes but to show capability of the

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:03.010
holes but to show capability of the
 

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.029
holes but to show capability of the
machine will bring up the drill pattern

00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039
machine will bring up the drill pattern
 

00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:08.580
machine will bring up the drill pattern
menu and here we are in a position if we

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:08.590
menu and here we are in a position if we
 

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.769
menu and here we are in a position if we
wanted to to drill hundreds of holes but

00:22:10.769 --> 00:22:10.779
wanted to to drill hundreds of holes but
 

00:22:10.779 --> 00:22:13.139
wanted to to drill hundreds of holes but
we only need two our first one is at

00:22:13.139 --> 00:22:13.149
we only need two our first one is at
 

00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:16.139
we only need two our first one is at
negative two zero we have two holes in

00:22:16.139 --> 00:22:16.149
negative two zero we have two holes in
 

00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:20.009
negative two zero we have two holes in
the X direction and one in the Y and the

00:22:20.009 --> 00:22:20.019
the X direction and one in the Y and the
 

00:22:20.019 --> 00:22:22.879
the X direction and one in the Y and the
increment in the X Direction is 4 inches

00:22:22.879 --> 00:22:22.889
increment in the X Direction is 4 inches
 

00:22:22.889 --> 00:22:25.320
increment in the X Direction is 4 inches
so it's kind of a lot of work for two

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:25.330
so it's kind of a lot of work for two
 

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:29.519
so it's kind of a lot of work for two
holes but you get the idea after

00:22:29.519 --> 00:22:29.529
holes but you get the idea after
 

00:22:29.529 --> 00:22:32.519
holes but you get the idea after
entering this command we are in a

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:32.529
entering this command we are in a
 

00:22:32.529 --> 00:22:34.769
entering this command we are in a
position to check to see if we are

00:22:34.769 --> 00:22:34.779
position to check to see if we are
 

00:22:34.779 --> 00:22:37.289
position to check to see if we are
programming correctly now all the

00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:37.299
programming correctly now all the
 

00:22:37.299 --> 00:22:39.990
programming correctly now all the
information we really need is there it's

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000
information we really need is there it's
 

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.720
information we really need is there it's
going to do the basic drilling described

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:42.730
going to do the basic drilling described
 

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.450
going to do the basic drilling described
on line seven and it's going to apply it

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:45.460
on line seven and it's going to apply it
 

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.360
on line seven and it's going to apply it
to the pattern of holes described on

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:48.370
to the pattern of holes described on
 

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:51.000
to the pattern of holes described on
line eight in our program and again

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:51.010
line eight in our program and again
 

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.120
line eight in our program and again
that's the philosophy of the machine to

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:54.130
that's the philosophy of the machine to
 

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.100
that's the philosophy of the machine to
check our program will hit the draw

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:56.110
check our program will hit the draw
 

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.180
check our program will hit the draw
button F

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:57.190
button F
 

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:05.099
button F
- once the draw button is hit there are

00:23:05.099 --> 00:23:05.109
- once the draw button is hit there are
 

00:23:05.109 --> 00:23:07.200
- once the draw button is hit there are
a couple of options under the draw menu

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:07.210
a couple of options under the draw menu
 

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:09.539
a couple of options under the draw menu
and one is to select the view and we

00:23:09.539 --> 00:23:09.549
and one is to select the view and we
 

00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:12.839
and one is to select the view and we
will select the XY plane which is a top

00:23:12.839 --> 00:23:12.849
will select the XY plane which is a top
 

00:23:12.849 --> 00:23:16.499
will select the XY plane which is a top
view and the display will hit fit and up

00:23:16.499 --> 00:23:16.509
view and the display will hit fit and up
 

00:23:16.509 --> 00:23:18.779
view and the display will hit fit and up
on the screen you can see the two holes

00:23:18.779 --> 00:23:18.789
on the screen you can see the two holes
 

00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:21.899
on the screen you can see the two holes
that will be drilled one at negative two

00:23:21.899 --> 00:23:21.909
that will be drilled one at negative two
 

00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:31.730
that will be drilled one at negative two
and the other one at positive two

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:31.740
 

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.730
the next thing we must do at the end of

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.740
the next thing we must do at the end of
 

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.860
the next thing we must do at the end of
all drilling operations you must enter

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:36.870
all drilling operations you must enter
 

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.769
all drilling operations you must enter
what's called the drilling off command

00:23:39.769 --> 00:23:39.779
what's called the drilling off command
 

00:23:39.779 --> 00:23:42.500
what's called the drilling off command
it tells a machine to stop drilling

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:42.510
it tells a machine to stop drilling
 

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:45.380
it tells a machine to stop drilling
so that's necessary as well now the

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:45.390
so that's necessary as well now the
 

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.630
so that's necessary as well now the
second hole is almost exactly like the

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640
second hole is almost exactly like the
 

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.700
second hole is almost exactly like the
first hole so by copying and pasting

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:49.710
first hole so by copying and pasting
 

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:51.980
first hole so by copying and pasting
lines and then editing them it'll make

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:51.990
lines and then editing them it'll make
 

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:55.070
lines and then editing them it'll make
life easier now copying and pasting is a

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080
life easier now copying and pasting is a
 

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.080
life easier now copying and pasting is a
little weird on this machine so you must

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:57.090
little weird on this machine so you must
 

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.269
little weird on this machine so you must
get into the menus you've just seen hit

00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279
get into the menus you've just seen hit
 

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:02.210
get into the menus you've just seen hit
the more button and bring up the mark

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.220
the more button and bring up the mark
 

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.630
the more button and bring up the mark
line when you enter the mark line it

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.640
line when you enter the mark line it
 

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.669
line when you enter the mark line it
will allow you to highlight the lines

00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679
will allow you to highlight the lines
 

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:10.100
will allow you to highlight the lines
that you wish to copy this is somewhat

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:10.110
that you wish to copy this is somewhat
 

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.649
that you wish to copy this is somewhat
of an archaic programming method but

00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659
of an archaic programming method but
 

00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:15.139
of an archaic programming method but
nonetheless it does work we are going to

00:24:15.139 --> 00:24:15.149
nonetheless it does work we are going to
 

00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:17.990
nonetheless it does work we are going to
highlight lines three all the way down

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000
highlight lines three all the way down
 

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.899
highlight lines three all the way down
to line nine the drill off command we're

00:24:20.899 --> 00:24:20.909
to line nine the drill off command we're
 

00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:23.360
to line nine the drill off command we're
going to copy and paste it and then

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:23.370
going to copy and paste it and then
 

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.460
going to copy and paste it and then
we're going to edit it for our second

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:25.470
we're going to edit it for our second
 

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.310
we're going to edit it for our second
drilling operation you hit more again

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320
drilling operation you hit more again
 

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.549
drilling operation you hit more again
and it will bring up the copy command so

00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559
and it will bring up the copy command so
 

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:34.519
and it will bring up the copy command so
we'll select copy next and when you hit

00:24:34.519 --> 00:24:34.529
we'll select copy next and when you hit
 

00:24:34.529 --> 00:24:38.690
we'll select copy next and when you hit
enter notice it says block saved now all

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.700
enter notice it says block saved now all
 

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.789
enter notice it says block saved now all
we have to do is move the cursor down

00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799
we have to do is move the cursor down
 

00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:43.279
we have to do is move the cursor down
one line and then we will select the

00:24:43.279 --> 00:24:43.289
one line and then we will select the
 

00:24:43.289 --> 00:24:46.430
one line and then we will select the
paste command and all those lines will

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440
paste command and all those lines will
 

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.549
paste command and all those lines will
be pasted above line number ten so we

00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559
be pasted above line number ten so we
 

00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:52.580
be pasted above line number ten so we
hit more one more time go down to paste

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:52.590
hit more one more time go down to paste
 

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.940
hit more one more time go down to paste
hit enter and we have copied the blocks

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:55.950
hit enter and we have copied the blocks
 

00:24:55.950 --> 00:25:01.880
hit enter and we have copied the blocks
of programming to the next line so as

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:01.890
of programming to the next line so as
 

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.399
of programming to the next line so as
you can see you have tool number one to

00:25:04.399 --> 00:25:04.409
you can see you have tool number one to
 

00:25:04.409 --> 00:25:06.139
you can see you have tool number one to
the drill off command and then tool

00:25:06.139 --> 00:25:06.149
the drill off command and then tool
 

00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:08.389
the drill off command and then tool
number one once again to the drill off

00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399
number one once again to the drill off
 

00:25:08.399 --> 00:25:11.960
number one once again to the drill off
command we're going to enter line ten so

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:11.970
command we're going to enter line ten so
 

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.230
command we're going to enter line ten so
we can edit it and we're going to change

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240
we can edit it and we're going to change
 

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.960
we can edit it and we're going to change
tool number one to tool number two now

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:17.970
tool number one to tool number two now
 

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.730
tool number one to tool number two now
this will be our number three drill

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:19.740
this will be our number three drill
 

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.159
this will be our number three drill
which will we be used to tap to drill

00:25:22.159 --> 00:25:22.169
which will we be used to tap to drill
 

00:25:22.169 --> 00:25:24.100
which will we be used to tap to drill
the hole for the quarter twenty-eight

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:24.110
the hole for the quarter twenty-eight
 

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.590
the hole for the quarter twenty-eight
now everything else is reasonably good

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600
now everything else is reasonably good
 

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.470
now everything else is reasonably good
but to show the capabilities of the

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480
but to show the capabilities of the
 

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.560
but to show the capabilities of the
machine we're going to rather than do a

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:33.570
machine we're going to rather than do a
 

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:36.260
machine we're going to rather than do a
basic drilling operation we're going to

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:36.270
basic drilling operation we're going to
 

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.870
basic drilling operation we're going to
use a pecking drilling operation so I'm

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880
use a pecking drilling operation so I'm
 

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.180
use a pecking drilling operation so I'm
going to go to 14 and hit the Clear

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:41.190
going to go to 14 and hit the Clear
 

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:43.600
going to go to 14 and hit the Clear
button and that erases that line

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:43.610
button and that erases that line
 

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:45.670
button and that erases that line
and now I'm going to go back to the

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:45.680
and now I'm going to go back to the
 

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.330
and now I'm going to go back to the
drill program or the drill menu and this

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:49.340
drill program or the drill menu and this
 

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.360
drill program or the drill menu and this
time instead of selecting basic drill we

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:52.370
time instead of selecting basic drill we
 

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:56.020
time instead of selecting basic drill we
will select what's called pecking now

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:56.030
will select what's called pecking now
 

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:58.360
will select what's called pecking now
pecking is a cycle that's normally used

00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:58.370
pecking is a cycle that's normally used
 

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.420
pecking is a cycle that's normally used
for deep hole drilling and the idea is

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:01.430
for deep hole drilling and the idea is
 

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.970
for deep hole drilling and the idea is
like a bird pecking at its feed the

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:03.980
like a bird pecking at its feed the
 

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.310
like a bird pecking at its feed the
drill bit will go down to the depth you

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320
drill bit will go down to the depth you
 

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.350
drill bit will go down to the depth you
program it to but it will do it in

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360
program it to but it will do it in
 

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.810
program it to but it will do it in
little pecking increments each time

bringing the drill out and clearing the
 

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.090
bringing the drill out and clearing the
chips from the hole and I'm entering the

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:16.100
chips from the hole and I'm entering the
 

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.010
chips from the hole and I'm entering the
pertinent information we're going down

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:18.020
pertinent information we're going down
 

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.580

pick 0.1 pecks so it's going to Peck 3.1

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880
pick 0.1 pecks so it's going to Peck 3.1
 

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.170
pick 0.1 pecks so it's going to Peck 3.1
pecks and then the final Peck will be

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:31.180
pecks and then the final Peck will be
 

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.720
pecks and then the final Peck will be
0.075 so we'll make for pecks for each

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:34.730
0.075 so we'll make for pecks for each
 

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.150
0.075 so we'll make for pecks for each
hole which is a bit ludicrous for a

again we'll select a feed rate of two
 

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:50.040
again we'll select a feed rate of two
and basically our entire program is done

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:50.050
and basically our entire program is done
 

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:52.510
and basically our entire program is done
before running our program it is

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520
before running our program it is
 

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.990
before running our program it is
necessary to obtain the tool offsets now

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000
necessary to obtain the tool offsets now
 

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.540
necessary to obtain the tool offsets now
when the machine is first hold the tool

this is where the tool changes are made

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:05.260
this is where the tool changes are made
 

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.050
this is where the tool changes are made
since we are using tool number one we

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:08.060
since we are using tool number one we
 

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.060
since we are using tool number one we
now have to switch this to tool number

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:10.070
now have to switch this to tool number
 

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:13.510
now have to switch this to tool number
one having switched it by hitting the

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520

one we have to actually execute this

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:19.040
one we have to actually execute this
 

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.850
one we have to actually execute this
command to make it happen so we hit the

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:21.860
command to make it happen so we hit the
 

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.700
command to make it happen so we hit the
green execute button and the machine

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:24.710
green execute button and the machine
 

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.500

necessary to use tapping compound while

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.100
necessary to use tapping compound while
 

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.340
necessary to use tapping compound while
tapping holes otherwise you stand a good

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:40.350
tapping holes otherwise you stand a good
 

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:43.279
tapping holes otherwise you stand a good
chance of breaking the tap I should warn

00:32:43.279 --> 00:32:43.289
chance of breaking the tap I should warn
 

00:32:43.289 --> 00:32:45.289
chance of breaking the tap I should warn
you now that when a tap gets broken

00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:45.299
you now that when a tap gets broken
 

00:32:45.299 --> 00:32:47.720
you now that when a tap gets broken
inside a hole it is very difficult

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:47.730
inside a hole it is very difficult
 

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.210
inside a hole it is very difficult
usually impossible to remove it

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220
usually impossible to remove it
 

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.430
usually impossible to remove it
frequently you have to start the entire

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440
frequently you have to start the entire
 

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.940
frequently you have to start the entire
job over again we move the tip right

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:55.950
job over again we move the tip right
 

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.640
job over again we move the tip right
over the hole bring the z-axis down a

00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:58.650
over the hole bring the z-axis down a
 

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:00.649
over the hole bring the z-axis down a
little bit to create some tension in the

00:33:00.649 --> 00:33:00.659
little bit to create some tension in the
 

00:33:00.659 --> 00:33:03.140
little bit to create some tension in the
tip and that will keep the tap going

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:03.150
tip and that will keep the tap going
 

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.810
tip and that will keep the tap going
straight for tapping holes the rule is

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:05.820
straight for tapping holes the rule is
 

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.330
straight for tapping holes the rule is
to go one revolution clockwise followed

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:08.340
to go one revolution clockwise followed
 

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.659
to go one revolution clockwise followed
by a quarter revolution counterclockwise

00:33:10.659 --> 00:33:10.669
by a quarter revolution counterclockwise
 

00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:14.270
by a quarter revolution counterclockwise
that quarter revolution counterclockwise

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:14.280
that quarter revolution counterclockwise
 

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.539
that quarter revolution counterclockwise
is done to break off the chips if the

00:33:17.539 --> 00:33:17.549
is done to break off the chips if the
 

00:33:17.549 --> 00:33:19.789
is done to break off the chips if the
chips continue to pile up inside the

00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799
chips continue to pile up inside the
 

00:33:19.799 --> 00:33:22.480
chips continue to pile up inside the
hole that too can lead to a broken tap

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:22.490
hole that too can lead to a broken tap
 

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:25.460
hole that too can lead to a broken tap
once the tap has been started by this

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:25.470
once the tap has been started by this
 

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.909
once the tap has been started by this
technique you can finish it off by

00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919
technique you can finish it off by
 

00:33:27.919 --> 00:33:30.710
technique you can finish it off by
taking the tip up and just tapping the

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720
taking the tip up and just tapping the
 

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.520
taking the tip up and just tapping the
hole once again when when you're a

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:34.530
hole once again when when you're a
 

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.830
hole once again when when you're a
novice at doing this breaking taps is

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840
novice at doing this breaking taps is
 

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.140
novice at doing this breaking taps is
pretty common so I'm just warning you be

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:39.150
pretty common so I'm just warning you be
 

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.720
pretty common so I'm just warning you be
careful when you tap holes quarter

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:41.730
careful when you tap holes quarter
 

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.960
careful when you tap holes quarter
twenty eights fairly large size tap it's

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:44.970
twenty eights fairly large size tap it's
 

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:47.360
twenty eights fairly large size tap it's
not likely to break but when you're

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:47.370
not likely to break but when you're
 

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:49.549
not likely to break but when you're
using smaller taps you have to be even

00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559
using smaller taps you have to be even
 

00:33:49.559 --> 00:33:52.220
using smaller taps you have to be even
more careful we'll play the same game on

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:52.230
more careful we'll play the same game on
 

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.950
more careful we'll play the same game on
the right side lowering the tip down and

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960
the right side lowering the tip down and
 

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.930
the right side lowering the tip down and
in a short amount of time that hole is
