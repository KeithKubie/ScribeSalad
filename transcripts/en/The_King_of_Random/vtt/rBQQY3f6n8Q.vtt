00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
[Captioned via Y Translator]
Today, we're going to look at a fun
and easy way to build yourself

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.180
a rocket using PVC pipe,
water, and a soda bottle.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.660
[Music]

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.740
To get started, we'll need
a length of 1/2 inch PVC pipe,

00:00:15.142 --> 00:00:18.980
four 1/2 inch PVC pipe caps,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.160
three 1/2 inch T's,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.560
and one piece of 1 and 1/4 inch
pipe about 2 inches long.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.000
We'll want a pipe cutter, a saw,
or some way to cut the PVC.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.300
This is what we've got in mind.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.500
We'll build a frame and latch
system out of our PVC pipe,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.900
fill a soda bottle a little bit
with water, and then add pressure.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.300
Once it's where we want it,
we pull a string, and let it fly.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.000
First off, just a quick test,
we want our soda bottle to just

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.740
barely fit over the PVC pipe,
and with 1/2 inch PVC,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.220
that's what it should do.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.700
First up, we want to cut off
a piece just over 1 foot long.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.400
I'm going to go
for about 13 inches.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.900
This is the first piece
of our launch set up,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.800
and this is what's going to fit
inside of our soda bottle,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.842
which will be turned into our rocket.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.640
We now need to build a frame,
and it's going to be sort of H-shaped

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.580
with this piece coming right
out of the center of the H.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.940
Let's cut two pieces
that are 10 inches long,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.040
and four pieces that are 6 inches long.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.140
[Music]

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.612
We want to attach a T on
to the bottom of this first piece.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.200
We'll have two pieces coming
off of either side,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.800
those will each end in a T-shape,
and then we'll have arms coming

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.000
off of each of those spots.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.200
With each of those four
arms covered with a cap.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.200
And with that,
we have the basic frame

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.800
for our rocket launcher.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.920
It's pretty stable.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.400
It doesn't twist
either direction.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.900
Of course, right now,
it's not held together with anything

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.862
but a little bit of friction,
so it does collapse.

00:01:48.862 --> 00:01:50.700
We'll be using glue
once we're ready though.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.400
Our soda bottle, which
we're going to fill

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.740
with water, wants to fit down
onto this launcher about two-thirds

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.800
of the way up the bottle.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.472
Just mark that point.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.800
That's about how far down we want
the neck the bottom of our bottle.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.500
As a launching mechanism,
we're going to be using

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.340
a bunch of zip ties.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.600
These things are durable, they're springy,
and they're cheap,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.500
which makes them a great tool.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.302
We want eight of these.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:16.532
Eight, there's eight.

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.500
These are going to be held
in place with a pipe clamp.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.000
We're just going to take that,
and right now, we're

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.100
going to drop that down onto our pipe.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.100
We want to be able to take
all eight of these zip ties,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.900
and space them just right evenly
all the way around this pipe.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.562
To do that, let's take
a piece of duct tape,

00:02:32.802 --> 00:02:34.500
wrap that all the way around the pipe,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.600
and then mark where it starts
and finishes, so we can line all

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.260
of our zip ties up
against the tape.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.100
We're going to leave about 3
and 1/2 inches of our zip tie

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.300
above the tape,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.200
and you can see
that on one side

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.100
of the zip tie, the head is just flat,
and on the other side, it's a bump.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.162
And we want the bump
to be sticking up towards us,

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:55.442
and the flat side to be
attached to the tape.

00:02:55.442 --> 00:03:02.000
[Music]

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.700
There we go.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.880
That's much better.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.300
We've got almost a perfectly even
distribution all the way around.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.700
It's going to be off
by a little bit here and there,

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.120
and that's not a problem.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.300
We just want to try
and make it as evenly spread as we can.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.100
Let's just trim off the bottom
of all eight zip ties right

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.892
below our tape.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.820
[Music]

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.000
Now, we need our soda
bottle down in place.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.500
We've already measured that,
and we want these zip ties

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.100
to be lined up so they are right
above the widest lip on our bottle.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.840
Not these little bumps that are
the threads putting the cap on,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.400
but this collar around the neck.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.600
We want our zip ties
to fit right above that.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.680
[Music]

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.600
With the tape on there,
it actually doesn't really stick too much,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.200
because there's so
many zip ties in the way,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.580
that the tape isn't touching PVC.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.300
But that's alright.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.622
It lets us make sure we've got
our alignment just right.

00:03:51.622 --> 00:03:53.860
[Music]

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.800
The bottle where we want it.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.102
Check the zip ties.

00:03:57.382 --> 00:03:59.400
This is why we want
our hose clamp.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.500
This is going to squeeze down
and really hold all

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.072
of those zip tie pieces in place.

00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:04.300
There we go.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.580
Now our zip ties
aren't going anywhere.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.400
You can already see
the we can get a pretty

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.000
good grip on the bottle.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.632
To get an idea of how
this mechanism is going to work,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.400
our 1 and 1/2 inch piece of PVC pipe,

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.460
we can fit right down
over those zip ties,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.600
when we drop our bottle down into place,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.500
and lift this portion
of PVC, it holds all

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.900
of the zip ties in place.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.940
They can't move away anymore,
and so now,

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.400
they're holding that bottle

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.700
right where we wanted,
and even if you add a lot

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.460
of pressure pulling it up,

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.380
it's not going to go anywhere
until we drop down this collar,

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.560
and set it loose.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.200
One more thing we do want to do is
that our bottle does fit pretty

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.800
nicely right over the PVC,
but it's not a perfect fit.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.500
And it doesn't need to be 100% perfect,
but we do want a little bit tighter

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.580
than it is now.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.700
We're going to use
some electrical tape,

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.800
wrap it around this PVC post,
and that will create a seal

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.300
that is water and air tight,

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.900
or at least, pretty
close that will hold

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.500
while we add pressure to our bottle.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.920
This marking where all
of our zip ties reach to right now,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.900
because this step, well,
it may not always be

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.800
technically necessary, I think helps.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.572
So I'm just going to loosen
our hose clamp a little bit.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.580
Now that we've seen how
these are going to work,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.160
I can drop them down out of the way.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.400
This line here represents where
our water bottle neck will reach,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.462
and so we're going to start
about halfway over that line.

00:05:36.462 --> 00:05:40.200
I'm going to pull
this electrical tape nice and tight.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.712
So it's a very thin barrier.

00:05:43.712 --> 00:05:46.172
I'm just going to wrap it
around a few times.

00:05:46.172 --> 00:05:51.100
[Music]

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.520
I'm taking the bottle,
and I'm pressing it down,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.400
and it's actually just smushing
that electrical tape.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.820
And that's just going to build up
into sort of a ring.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.100
That ring is what's going to hold all
of the water and compressed air back

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.200
as we add pressure into our bottle.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.900
Now, we need to take one of our caps
and add a Schrader valve into it.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.940
That's the same kind you
see on a bicycle tire,

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.660
and that's how we're going to add
pressure into the whole system.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.840
We've got a 1/2 inch drill bit,

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.692
drill a hole right into one of our caps.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.580
[Music]

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.300
Schrader valve stuck through,
and now we need to pull it.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.700
There we go,
until it seats self.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.000
There's a groove in the valve,
and that's what we want

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.700
to sit right along the edge
of where we drilled the hole.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.200
At this point, we need
to take some PVC glue,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.400
and attach all of our pieces
together permanently, making sure

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.432
that we have enough glue,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.300
and they're really well attached,
so that no air will leak out.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.600
That glue does need to dry all the way
before we start doing

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.700
any pressure testing on it,

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.300
but while it's drying,
I think this is going

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.400
to be a good time to add some decoration.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.432
Because we love declaration.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.940
[Music]

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.500
Now, we do like decoration
on all parts of the launcher.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.600
However, the top part of this post
really needs to be pretty smooth

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.200
so that our bottle will launch off
into the way we want,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.100
and we don't really
want to get paint all

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.500
over all the moving parts,
the zip tie pieces that

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.300
are gonna be holding stuff together.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.400
So this top post will just
be the color it is.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.100
We've also taped off the Schrader valve,
because we don't want to get

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.180
that plugged up.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.600
The rest of it though,
let's make it a little more interesting.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:35.100
[Music]

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.200
Now that everything is decorated,
we can move on to adding a little bit

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.000
of a spring system.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.900
Now, this pipe is what's going
to hold all of these zip ties closed,

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.100
but it you know, it's...

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.600
Gravity is currently
pointing down.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.900
We want it to stay up so that it
holds our bottle locked in place

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.500
until we pull down on it.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.300
So to make that spring,
we're just going to use

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.700
a couple more zip ties.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.500
We're going to attach them
around this tube,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.100
and around this T joint,
and that should give us the spring that

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.102
we need to hold it in place.

00:08:00.472 --> 00:08:05.500
I think it's time for a quick test
with no water in our bottle,

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.100
and very low pressure.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.340
This is just to see how
everything is working out so far.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.000
It is still really
low pressure though.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.242
It hasn't even hit like 10 psi.

00:08:15.242 --> 00:08:20.800
[Music]

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.100
Tiny delay in taking off,
but that hit my hand

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.900
with some good power.

00:08:23.912 --> 00:08:26.500
So this is working out nicely.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.200
We've got this all painted up,
and we need to be able to pull this down

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.700
from a little bit of a distance,

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.000
so that we're not just
like always getting soaked

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.700
every time we launch this.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.300
Plus it's hard to watch it
for right here firing.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.000
So we need to attach some cord on here,
and make it so we can pull from the side,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.860
and have it drop this down.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.600
So we're going to over engineer
this just a little bit.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.160
We're going to attach two
of these eye hooks down into the PVC,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.800
and they're going to be drilled,
and then thread it in,

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.600
and we're going to add
some epoxy just to make sure

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.742
that we keep our air tight seal
through all the pipes.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.320
Then we're going to have cord attached
to the side of the PVC coming down

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.000
through the eye hooks,
and connecting in the front.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.480
So when we pull forward,
it will pull down

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.600
on our trigger mechanism.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.600
Our launcher is now built.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:17.300
It should be complete and working well,
so what we need now is to turn our bottle

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.300
into a rocket,
and there's lots

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.800
of different ways we can do that.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.100
Today, we're just going to use
a little bit of craft foam

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.600
and duct tape to add
a cone on the front,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.400
and some fins on the sides.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:34.820
[Music]

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.900
I'd say that works
and it's time to start

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:38.600
filling this with water.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.060
Take it somewhere like a field,
instead of you know, inside.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.980
See what it can do.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.900
We've got our launcher,
we've got our rocket,

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.500
and I'm just going to use some
of these little garden stakes to make sure

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.100
that it holds the launcher down,

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.500
and I can already pull on this
and trigger it pretty well.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.000
But you know, if I pull too hard,
I don't want it to tip,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.800
and then shoot the rocket off,
whatever weird angle.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.100
We now want to fill our rocket
partially with water,

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.700
and I say partially
because it kind of ends up

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.400
being a little bit different every time.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.892
Sometimes you want about 1/3 full,
sometimes 1/2 full,

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.252
and we'll have to do
some experimentation to figure out.

00:10:12.952 --> 00:10:13.232
All right.

00:10:13.232 --> 00:10:15.200
I'm just going to try
and pop this on as quick

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.082
as I can to avoid spilling
too much water down the tube.

00:10:18.082 --> 00:10:21.580
[Music]

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.400
That worked all right.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.000
Now, there may even be a little bit
of leaking down at the seal,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.200
and more once I
start adding pressure,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.500
but it's going to be minut.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.000
It won't be severe,
and it should still

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.020
work pretty well, even though it's gonna--

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.480
I don't think it's leaking at the moment,
but it probably will

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.300
once I start adding pressure.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.100
Just little bits trying
to escape out that seal

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.200
between the water bottle
and the tape around the PVC pipe.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.800
All right, let's add some pressure,
and see how this goes.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:50.680
Oh!

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.800
Oh, I think it it popped off
our lock a little bit.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.300
When I say a little bit,
I mean completely, because obviously,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.760
it just popped right off.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.300
It may be that we just need
to add two more zip ties

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.300
on the sides to give
some extra push up on this.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.600
All right, we've got more
zip ties adding pressure.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.540
Let's see if that actually increases
how much we can put in.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.360
3, 2, 1.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.200
More pressure.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:28.760
[Music]

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.200
Random Fact: The fastest rocket record
was set by the ATLAS V in 2006,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.300
which reached a top speed
of 47,000 miles per hour

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.752
or about 76,000 kilometers per hour.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.820
There might be a little bit
of water in the system.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.382
3, 2, 1

00:11:49.102 --> 00:11:51.342
Oh, almost had it.

00:11:52.622 --> 00:11:55.200
So I think so far,
we've had a lot of good launches.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.200
Our best ones, probably went
about a hundred feet up,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.080
which is not bad for a soda bottle
and some PVC powered by a bike pump.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.400
We do have one more thing
we want to try with this,

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.500
and that's just see what happens
if we use a little bit

00:12:09.512 --> 00:12:11.700
more luminescent fluid than water.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.000
All right guys,
now it's night time,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.800
and we have two jars full of the two
different components of glow fluid.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.712
One of which is slightly going already
because of a an inadvertent break

00:12:23.132 --> 00:12:24.600
in the glass as I was emptying them out.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.000
However, we'll add some fuel,
and we'll see if we can get this

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
to launch with glowing fuel,
the color of like rocket fire

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.300
flying out of the back of this.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.540
I hope it works out.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.260
We kind of only have
one shot because...

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.700
Do you know how many glow sticks you
have to get for this much liquid?

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.912
This is like 60 glow sticks right here,
and they're big glow sticks too.

00:12:43.772 --> 00:12:45.592
Maybe more, it might be
as much as a hundred.

00:12:46.152 --> 00:12:47.300
I wasn't counting to carefully.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.072
But there's a lot.

00:12:48.472 --> 00:12:50.692
And so yeah, we get
about one shot of this.

00:12:50.692 --> 00:12:55.100
I got super fancy high
quality funnel that I made

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:55.802
out of duct tape.

00:12:55.802 --> 00:13:03.600
[Music]

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.700
All right, I'm gonna add soap,
swirl it around,

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.100
and then load it up.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:12.920
[Music]

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.360
Ultra bright.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:19.820
[Music]

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:20.580
All right.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.400
Starting to leak.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.700
3, 2, 1.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.260
Whoa.

00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:37.822
Yeah.

00:13:38.392 --> 00:13:39.662
Oh that poor bike pump.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.760
That poor everything.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.900
Well, there's our-- Our spent rocket.

00:13:45.792 --> 00:13:48.200
Little residual glow fluid
coming out there.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.582
I mean, Rocket Fuel
coming out there.

00:13:50.832 --> 00:13:51.700
That look great.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.900
We got a couple
of cool swirl patterns here.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.200
I think maybe it's spun is
it went out or something?

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.500
I'm not really sure,
but we've got like a swirl arm that

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.500
that reaches around that way,

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.702
and then another one
coming out this direction,

00:14:04.702 --> 00:14:08.172
and you can just
see the whole spray pattern everywhere.

00:14:08.652 --> 00:14:10.200
The whole project is quick.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:10.800
It's cheap.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800
It goes together easily.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.500
This is a great thing to do
with young kids, because it's just

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.100
water spraying out of a bottle.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.240
Gonna be a lot of fun.

00:14:17.962 --> 00:14:18.600
Guys, thanks for watching.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.400
But that's not all,
we've got more for you to see.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.300
That box up at the top
will transport you

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.500
directly to our last video,
and you should go check that out.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.400
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.540
you should be watching next,

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.700
and if you aren't a subscriber,
just hit this bomb to get in the club,

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.200
and that way you never miss out
on a cool video.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.800
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we will see you in the next one.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.500
Talk to you then.
