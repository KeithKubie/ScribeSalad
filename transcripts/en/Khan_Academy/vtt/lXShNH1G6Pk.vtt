00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:02.204
- [Voiceover] All right, let's
see if we can find the limit

00:00:02.204 --> 00:00:05.184
of 1 over the square
root of 2 sine of theta

00:00:05.184 --> 00:00:06.626
over cosine of 2 theta,

00:00:06.626 --> 00:00:09.876
as theta approaches negative pi over 4.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.759
And like always, try to give
it a shot before we go through

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:14.899
it together.

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:17.125
Well, one take on it is well, let's just,

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:19.153
let's just say that this is
going to be the same thing

00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:20.397
as the limit,

00:00:20.397 --> 00:00:23.742
as theta approaches negative pi over 4

00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:26.825
of 1 plus square root of 2 sine theta

00:00:28.731 --> 00:00:29.898
over the limit

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:34.545
as theta approaches negative pi over 4.

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:37.296
Make sure we can see that negative there,

00:00:37.296 --> 00:00:39.046
of cosine of 2 theta,

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:43.384
and both of these expressions are,

00:00:43.384 --> 00:00:44.969
if these were function definitions

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.493
or if we were to graph y equals

00:00:47.493 --> 00:00:50.203
1 plus square root of sine,

00:00:50.203 --> 00:00:51.989
square root of 2 times sine theta,

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.325
or y equals cosine of 2 theta,

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:55.978
we would get continuous functions,

00:00:55.978 --> 00:00:59.389
especially at theta is
equal to negative pi over 4,

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:01.072
so we could just substitute in.

00:01:01.072 --> 00:01:03.532
We'll see well this is
going to be equal to

00:01:03.532 --> 00:01:05.941
this expression evaluated
at negative pi over 4,

00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:08.006
so 1 plus square root of 2

00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:10.756
times sine of negative pi over 4,

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:13.218
over cosine

00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:17.386
of 2 times negative pi over 4.

00:01:19.156 --> 00:01:21.156
Now, negative pi over 4,

00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:26.140
sine of negative pi over 4 is going to be

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.793
negative square root of 2 over 2,

00:01:28.793 --> 00:01:32.886
so this is negative
square root of 2 over 2,

00:01:32.886 --> 00:01:34.241
we're assuming this is in radians,

00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:35.760
if we're thinking in
degrees, this would be

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.106
a negative 45-degree angle,
so this is one of the,

00:01:38.106 --> 00:01:41.065
one of the trig values
that it's good to know

00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:43.077
and so if you have,

00:01:43.077 --> 00:01:44.751
if you have 1,

00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:45.922
so let's see,

00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:46.879
actually, let me just rewrite it,

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:50.190
so this is going to be equal to 1 plus

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.324
square root of 2 times that

00:01:52.324 --> 00:01:55.730
is going to be negative 2 over 2,

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.038
so this is going to be

00:01:58.038 --> 00:01:59.331
minus 1,

00:01:59.331 --> 00:02:00.369
that's the numerator over here.

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.958
All of this stuff simplifies to negative 1

00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:03.791
over,

00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:07.943
this is going to be cosine of

00:02:07.943 --> 00:02:10.809
negative pi over 2, right?

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:13.489
This is negative pi over 2,

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.866
cosine of negative pi over
2, if you thought in degrees,

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:17.444
that's going to be negative 90 degrees.

00:02:17.444 --> 00:02:22.015
Well, cosine of that is
just going to be zero,

00:02:22.015 --> 00:02:24.512
so what we end up with

00:02:24.512 --> 00:02:27.294
is equal to zero over zero,

00:02:27.294 --> 00:02:28.868
and as we've talked about before,

00:02:28.868 --> 00:02:31.066
if we had something
non-zero divided by zero,

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:32.564
we'd say, okay, that's undefined.

00:02:32.564 --> 00:02:33.543
We might as well give up,

00:02:33.543 --> 00:02:35.464
but we have this indeterminate
form, it does not mean

00:02:35.464 --> 00:02:36.985
the limit does not exist.

00:02:36.985 --> 00:02:39.292
It's usually a clue that
we should use some tools

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.923
in our toolkit, one of which
is to do some manipulation

00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:44.537
here to get an expression
that maybe is defined

00:02:44.537 --> 00:02:46.049
at theta is equal to,

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.014
or does not,

00:02:47.014 --> 00:02:48.263
is not an indeterminate form,

00:02:48.263 --> 00:02:50.231
that theta is equal to pi over 4

00:02:50.231 --> 00:02:53.401
and we'll see other tools in
our toolkit in the future.

00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:56.678
So let me algebraically
manipulate this a little bit.

00:02:56.678 --> 00:03:00.007
So if I have 1 plus the square root of 2,

00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:02.674
sine theta, over cosine 2 theta,

00:03:05.493 --> 00:03:06.811
as you can imagine,

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:10.612
the things that might be useful
here are our trig identities

00:03:10.612 --> 00:03:14.040
and in particular, cosine of
2 theta seems interesting.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.381
Let me write some trig
identities involving cosine

00:03:16.381 --> 00:03:17.546
of 2 theta.

00:03:17.546 --> 00:03:18.650
I'll write it over here.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.063
So we know that cosine

00:03:21.063 --> 00:03:21.896
of 2 theta

00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:24.073
is equal to

00:03:25.344 --> 00:03:28.023
cosine squared of theta

00:03:28.023 --> 00:03:31.094
minus sine squared of theta

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:32.677
which is equal to 1

00:03:34.152 --> 00:03:36.569
minus 2 sine squared of theta

00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:39.472
which is equal to

00:03:40.562 --> 00:03:43.145
2 cosine squared theta minus 1,

00:03:44.794 --> 00:03:47.662
and you can go from this
one to this one to this one

00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:49.668
just using the Pythagorean identity.

00:03:49.668 --> 00:03:52.553
We proved that in earlier
videos in trigonometry

00:03:52.553 --> 00:03:54.485
on Khan Academy.

00:03:54.485 --> 00:03:56.608
Now, do any of these look useful?

00:03:56.608 --> 00:03:58.819
Well, all of these three
are going to be differences

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.034
of squares, so we can factor
them in interesting ways,

00:04:02.034 --> 00:04:04.682
and remember, our goal
at the end of the day

00:04:04.682 --> 00:04:07.258
is maybe cancel things out
that are making us get this

00:04:07.258 --> 00:04:08.740
zero over zero,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.704
and if I could factor this

00:04:11.704 --> 00:04:14.465
into something that involved
a 1 plus square root

00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:15.388
of 2 sine theta,

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:16.356
then I'm going to be in business,

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:17.656
and it looks like,

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.591
it looks like this right over here,

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:21.342
that can be factored as

00:04:21.342 --> 00:04:24.175
1 plus square root of 2 sine theta

00:04:25.982 --> 00:04:27.368
times

00:04:27.368 --> 00:04:30.368
1 minus square root of 2 sine theta,

00:04:31.812 --> 00:04:33.119
so let me use this.

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:36.051
Cosine of 2 theta is the same thing,

00:04:36.051 --> 00:04:37.483
cosine of 2 theta is the same thing

00:04:37.483 --> 00:04:39.782
as 1 minus 2 sine squared theta,

00:04:39.782 --> 00:04:41.663
which is just a difference of squares.

00:04:41.663 --> 00:04:43.197
We can rewrite that as,

00:04:43.197 --> 00:04:44.986
this is a-squared minus b-squared,

00:04:44.986 --> 00:04:47.736
this is a plus b times a minus b,

00:04:48.953 --> 00:04:51.818
so I can just replace this with

00:04:51.818 --> 00:04:54.651
1 plus square root of 2 sine theta

00:04:56.923 --> 00:05:00.423
times 1 minus square root of 2 sine theta,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.384
and now, we have some nice cancelling,

00:05:04.384 --> 00:05:06.773
or potential cancelling that can occur,

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:08.301
so we could say

00:05:08.301 --> 00:05:09.637
that cancels with that

00:05:09.637 --> 00:05:12.869
and we could say that
that is going to be equal,

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:14.511
and let me do this in a new color,

00:05:14.511 --> 00:05:16.198
this is going to be equal to,

00:05:16.198 --> 00:05:17.413
in the numerator we just have 1,

00:05:17.413 --> 00:05:19.486
in the denominator we just are left with

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:22.486
1 minus square root of 2 sine theta,

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:26.941
and if we want these
expressions to truly be equal,

00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:29.833
we would have to have
them to have the same,

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:31.844
if you view them as function definitions,

00:05:31.844 --> 00:05:33.408
as having the same domain,

00:05:33.408 --> 00:05:34.621
so this one right over here,

00:05:34.621 --> 00:05:36.108
this one we already saw is

00:05:36.108 --> 00:05:39.914
not defined at theta is
equal to negative pi over 4,

00:05:39.914 --> 00:05:41.238
and so this one,

00:05:41.238 --> 00:05:42.611
in order for these to be equivalent,

00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:44.867
we have to say that this one is also not,

00:05:44.867 --> 00:05:47.077
and actually, other
places, but let's just,

00:05:47.077 --> 00:05:48.472
let's just say theta

00:05:48.472 --> 00:05:49.802
does not,

00:05:49.802 --> 00:05:52.153
does not equal negative,

00:05:52.153 --> 00:05:53.736
negative pi over 4,

00:05:55.095 --> 00:05:56.942
and we could think about
all of this happening

00:05:56.942 --> 00:06:00.377
in some type of an open interval
around negative pi over 4

00:06:00.377 --> 00:06:02.149
if we wanted to get very precise,

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:03.284
but if we wanted to,

00:06:03.284 --> 00:06:05.413
for this particular case,

00:06:05.413 --> 00:06:06.638
well, let's just say,

00:06:06.638 --> 00:06:09.019
everything we're doing
is in the open interval,

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:09.852
so in,

00:06:11.403 --> 00:06:12.820
in open interval,

00:06:15.926 --> 00:06:17.926
in open interval between

00:06:19.177 --> 00:06:20.381
theta,

00:06:20.381 --> 00:06:22.734
or, say, negative 1 and 1,

00:06:22.734 --> 00:06:24.081
and I think that covers it

00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:25.805
because if we have pi,

00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:27.938
if we have pi over 4

00:06:27.938 --> 00:06:30.260
that is not going to get us the

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.927
zero over zero form,

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.142
and pi over 4

00:06:34.996 --> 00:06:37.261
would make this denominator equal to zero

00:06:37.261 --> 00:06:39.006
but it also makes,

00:06:39.006 --> 00:06:41.873
let's see, pi over 4 also
will make this denominator

00:06:41.873 --> 00:06:43.022
equal to zero,

00:06:43.022 --> 00:06:45.156
'cause we would get 1 minus 1,

00:06:45.156 --> 00:06:46.069
so I think,

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:47.559
I think we're good if we're just assuming,

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:48.844
if we're restricted to this open interval

00:06:48.844 --> 00:06:50.346
and that's okay because
we're taking the limit

00:06:50.346 --> 00:06:53.777
as it approaches something
within this open interval,

00:06:53.777 --> 00:06:56.047
and I'm being extra precise
because I'm trying to explain it

00:06:56.047 --> 00:06:57.748
to you and it's important to be precise,

00:06:57.748 --> 00:06:59.295
but obviously, if you're
working this out on a test

00:06:59.295 --> 00:07:00.930
or notebook, you wouldn't be taking,

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:01.821
putting,

00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:03.328
or taking as much trouble

00:07:03.328 --> 00:07:06.643
to be putting all of these caveats in.

00:07:06.643 --> 00:07:09.220
So, what we've now realized

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.413
is that, okay,

00:07:10.413 --> 00:07:11.552
this expression,

00:07:11.552 --> 00:07:12.681
actually, let's think about this.

00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:15.716
Let's think about the limit,

00:07:15.716 --> 00:07:20.110
the limit as theta
approaches negative pi over 4

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.094
of this thing,

00:07:21.094 --> 00:07:22.316
without the restriction,

00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:25.684
of 1 over 1 minus the square root of 2

00:07:25.684 --> 00:07:26.851
sine of theta.

00:07:28.222 --> 00:07:29.532
If we're dealing with this over,

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.421
you know, with this open interval,

00:07:31.421 --> 00:07:33.748
wait, actually, even disregarding that,

00:07:33.748 --> 00:07:34.667
theta,

00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:35.570
this theta,

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.389
or this expression is continuous at,

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:40.445
it is defined and it is continuous

00:07:40.445 --> 00:07:43.434
at theta is equal to negative pi over 4

00:07:43.434 --> 00:07:45.045
so this is just going to be equal to

00:07:45.045 --> 00:07:48.327
1 over 1 minus the square root of 2

00:07:48.327 --> 00:07:49.410
times sine of

00:07:51.362 --> 00:07:53.691
negative pi over 4.

00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:55.941
Sine of negative pi over 4.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.955
Sine of negative pi over 4,

00:07:59.955 --> 00:08:03.693
we've already seen is negative
square root of 2 over 2,

00:08:03.693 --> 00:08:07.068
and so this is going to be equal to 1 over

00:08:07.068 --> 00:08:10.134
1 minus square root of 2 times

00:08:10.134 --> 00:08:12.081
the negative square root of 2 over 2,

00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:13.421
so negative, negative,

00:08:13.421 --> 00:08:14.403
you get a positive,

00:08:14.403 --> 00:08:16.347
square root of 2 times square root of 2

00:08:16.347 --> 00:08:18.182
is 2, over 2 is going to be 1.

00:08:18.182 --> 00:08:21.139
So this is going to be equal to 1/2.

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:22.423
And so,

00:08:22.423 --> 00:08:23.695
I want to be very clear.

00:08:23.695 --> 00:08:26.697
This expression is not the same thing

00:08:26.697 --> 00:08:28.496
as this expression.

00:08:28.496 --> 00:08:31.371
They are the same thing
at all values of theta,

00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:33.608
especially if we're dealing
in this open interval

00:08:33.608 --> 00:08:35.763
except at theta equals

00:08:35.763 --> 00:08:36.967
negative pi over 4.

00:08:36.967 --> 00:08:38.320
This one is not defined

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.191
and this one is defined,

00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:42.094
but as we've seen multiple times before,

00:08:42.094 --> 00:08:43.940
if we find a function

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.831
that is equal to our original

00:08:46.831 --> 00:08:47.664
or an expression,

00:08:47.664 --> 00:08:49.480
is equal to our original expression,

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.342
and all values of theta

00:08:51.342 --> 00:08:52.444
except,

00:08:52.444 --> 00:08:55.216
except where the original
one was not defined

00:08:55.216 --> 00:08:56.049
at a certain point,

00:08:56.049 --> 00:08:59.427
but this new one is defined
and is continuous there,

00:08:59.427 --> 00:09:02.818
well then these two limits
are going to be equal,

00:09:02.818 --> 00:09:04.881
so if this limit is 1/2,

00:09:04.881 --> 00:09:06.898
then this limit is going to be 1/2,

00:09:06.898 --> 00:09:08.405
and I've said this in previous videos.

00:09:08.405 --> 00:09:09.867
It might be very tempting to say, well,

00:09:09.867 --> 00:09:11.339
I'm just going to algebraically
simplify this in some way

00:09:11.339 --> 00:09:12.347
to get this,

00:09:12.347 --> 00:09:14.006
and I'm not going to
worry about too much about

00:09:14.006 --> 00:09:15.678
these constraints, and then
I'm just going to substitute

00:09:15.678 --> 00:09:17.303
negative pi over 4,

00:09:17.303 --> 00:09:18.909
and you will get this answer

00:09:18.909 --> 00:09:20.202
which is the correct answer

00:09:20.202 --> 00:09:22.093
but it's really important to recognize

00:09:22.093 --> 00:09:24.553
that this expression and this expression

00:09:24.553 --> 00:09:26.285
are not the same thing

00:09:26.285 --> 00:09:29.012
and what allows you to do this is,

00:09:29.012 --> 00:09:30.553
is the truth

00:09:30.553 --> 00:09:32.758
that if you have two functions,

00:09:32.758 --> 00:09:34.425
if you have f and g,

00:09:37.097 --> 00:09:39.522
two functions equal,

00:09:39.522 --> 00:09:40.558
let me write it this way,

00:09:40.558 --> 00:09:41.391
equal,

00:09:42.696 --> 00:09:43.529
equal for

00:09:44.481 --> 00:09:45.314
all x,

00:09:46.384 --> 00:09:47.634
except for all,

00:09:49.059 --> 00:09:50.197
wait, let me just write this this way,

00:09:50.197 --> 00:09:52.364
for all x except for a,

00:09:53.407 --> 00:09:54.657
then the limit,

00:09:55.764 --> 00:09:58.527
then, and let me write it this way,

00:09:58.527 --> 00:10:00.753
equal for all except,

00:10:00.753 --> 00:10:02.208
for all x except a

00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:03.625
and f continuous,

00:10:06.362 --> 00:10:07.695
continuous at a,

00:10:10.083 --> 00:10:10.916
then,

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.777
then the limit of f of x

00:10:15.028 --> 00:10:16.642
as x approaches a

00:10:16.642 --> 00:10:19.790
is going to be equal
to the limit of g of x

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.290
as x approaches a,

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.434
and I said this in multiple videos

00:10:22.434 --> 00:10:23.923
and that's what we are doing right here,

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:27.194
but just so you can make
sure you got it right,

00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:29.861
the answer here is 1/2.
