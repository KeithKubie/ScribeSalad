00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.860
Ok, guys, I get it. You want a chocolate chicken.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.560
So, yes I m back in the kitchen today. Because of you! You called me out to make a chocolate chicken, so that's what I'm spending my day doing today.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.040
I'm making a chocolate chicken for no other reason than to give it to one of you.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.960
Just picked up over $30 worth of melting chocolate here. We got our acrylic case and our gummi mold all dried out.

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.769
This is totally clean and ready for chocolate so i'm going to reassemble this

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.510
thing, then melt down the chocolate using

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.620
this double boiler

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.210
I have a dish in a pot of water that's

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.250
boiling and this is going to be used to

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.540
melt our chocolate make sure it doesn't

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.680
burn

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.980
did you know i'm giving away prizes on

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.479
your subscribers have been joining

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.070
recently from the gummy chicken video

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.390
it's good to have you on board it's fun

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.950
to have you here and you are the reason

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.360
that I'm making this chocolate chicken

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.460
today you guys requested it so I'm doing

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.080
this for you can see it's had a couple

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.360
of days to dry out so this thing should

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.800
be ready for pouring chocolate. All we have

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.930
to do now is melt it down, and pour it in.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:48.630
Guess I better turn that down a little bit.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:57.390
We got six pounds of chocolate here.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.060
So how do you join the notification

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.979
squad? Here it is step-by-step. First of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.510
all if you're not subscribed then go

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.979
ahead and hit the red subscribe button

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.420
and then you're going to notice that

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.310
there is a bell right beside it

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.990
click on that bell. You want to click the

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.250
box that says send me all notifications

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.620
for this channel and then you want to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.690
click save. Now when you look back at the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.730
bell it should be ringing and that means

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.950
you're on the notification squad. That's

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.360
a good amount of chocolate right there.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.580
There's a chance we're going to have

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.220
some left over.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:38.020
Let's do it, let's pour ourselves some chicken!

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.860
Ooh that's beautiful. That just jiggles into place there.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.020
Alright I think that's gonna be it.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.800
Surprisingly that chicken didn't take as

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.250
much chocolate as i thought i was going to.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.459
We might have about 4 or 5 pounds into it.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.050

It's two thirty in the morning, i'm still

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.629
working on this video for you guys.

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.120
That is one heavy block of chocolate.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.560
Don't drop it now.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.000
This thing's been sitting in the fridge

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.340
for about 10 hours, and you can see

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.520
as it cooled how the chocolate sunk down a

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.090
little bit

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.350
there's a little bit of an indentation

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.970
in the center there. I was gonna wait till

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.980
tomorrow morning but I guess technically

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.240
it is tomorrow morning. It's already 2:s0 am.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.300
OK, let's crack this thing open

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.209
I just took two of the walls off of this

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.190
acrylic box and now we should be able to

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.560
grab the rubber and there we go now we

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.840
can get to work on separating this thing.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.420
Whoaaa no way... That's amazing!

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.680
Oh no! Snapped the leg. Bummer.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.500
So to whoever wins this chicken,

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.420
I'm sorry I broke off one of the legs, I

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.080
was a little bit excited to get out and

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.030
try to get a camera angle and I wasn't

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.160
quite gentle enough.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.720
Wow, look at that. Well there's your solid chocolate chicken, guys.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.780
Now who wants it?

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.860
Ok, let's weigh this beast and see what we got.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.700
Just about four pounds, that's

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.410
probably because that other little bone

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.480
broke off, lemme go get that. This is the

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.190
piece of the chicken leg broke off.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.900
It does look like a bone, but if you look at

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.280
the cross section you can tell it's

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.830
definitely chocolate. And if we add that to

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.900
the pile, you can see that brings us

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.380
almost up to an even four pounds.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.910
Now check this out, just for laughs I went

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.020
and picked up an actual chicken

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.160
container, to store this chocolate chicken in.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.400
Now

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.130
it genuinely looks like the real thing

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.070
oh my gosh it's unbelievable. whoop--

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.110
almost lost it there. It's just like one

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.580
massive chicken-shaped chocolate bar.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.900
four pounds solid chocolate chicken and

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.280
this is going to one of YOU.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.439
so hop over to my instagram, follow me,

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:54.419

in the next couple of days. In the

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.240
meantime, I'm gonna pack this thing away in the fridge.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.260
