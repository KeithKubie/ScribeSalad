00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.680
Let R be the region in the
first quadrant enclosed

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.670
by the graphs of f
of x is equal to 8x

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.830
to the third and g of x
is equal to sine of pi x,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.052
as shown in the figure above.

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:11.760
And they drew the
figure right over here.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.060
Part a, write the equation
for the line tangent

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.574
to the graph of f at
x is equal to 1/2.

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:17.990
So let me just
redraw it here just

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.530
so that-- I like drawing on
the black background, I guess,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.730
is the main reason
why I'm redrawing it.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.860
So the function f of x is
equal to 8x to the third,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.870
looks like this.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:29.920
It looks like that.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.530
This is our f of x-axis,
and this is our x-axis.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.590
And we want the equation
for the line tangent

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.440
at x is equal to 1/2.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.975
So this is x is equal to 1/2.

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:44.060
If you go up here, if
you evaluate f of 1/2,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.240
you get 8 times
1/2 to the third,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.562
which is 8 times
1/8, which is 1.

00:00:49.562 --> 00:00:51.770
And they actually gave us
that already on this point.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.730
This is the point 1/2 comma 1.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.690
And we need to find the
equation for the tangent line.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.664
So the tangent line will
look something like that.

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:02.330
And to figure out
this equation, we just

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.580
need to figure out
its slope, and then

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.220
we know a point that it's on--
and you could use point-slope

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.230
or you could just use your kind
of standard slope-intercept

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.404
form to give an
equation for that line.

00:01:13.404 --> 00:01:15.320
So the first part, let's
figure out its slope.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.694
And the slope of
the tangent line

00:01:16.694 --> 00:01:18.670
is going to be the
same slope as the slope

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.816
of our function at that point.

00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:22.190
Or another way to
think about it,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.170
it is going to be
f prime of 1/2,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.400
or the derivative
evaluated at 1/2.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.860
The derivative
gives us the slope

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.750
of that line at any point.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.110
So what is f prime
of x? f prime of x

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.840
is just the derivative of this.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.320
So 3 times 8 is 24
times x squared.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.050
24 x squared.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.260
f prime of 1/2 is equal
to 24 times 1/2 squared,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.610
which is equal to 24 times
1/4, which is equal to 6.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.780
So the slope of this
line is equal to 6.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.000
I'll use m for slope.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.660
That's the convention
that we used

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.900
when we first learned
it in algebra.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.480
So the slope is going to be 6.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.240
So the general
equation for this line

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.551
is y is equal to mx plus b.

00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:13.300
This is the slope.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.700
This is the y-intercept.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.010
We already know
that the slope is 6,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.240
and then we can use the
fact that the line goes

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.810
through the point 1/2, 1
to figure out what b is.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.440
So when y is 1, 1 is equal to
our slope times x. x is 1/2.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.200
Or another way to say
it, when x is 1/2,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.950
y is 1 plus some y-intercept.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.810
Or if I take x is
1/2, I multiply

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.210
it times the slope plus the
y-intercept, I should get 1.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.600
And so I get 1 is
equal to 3 plus b.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.610
I can subtract 3 from both
sides, and I get negative 2

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.870
is equal to b.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.120
So the equation of the
line is going to be y

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.670
is equal to 6x minus 2.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.580
That is the equation
of the tangent line.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.190
Now part b, find
the area of R. So R

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.810
is this region right over here.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.630
It's bounded above
by g of x, which

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.160
they've defined as sine of pi x.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.350
It's bounded below by f
of x, or 8x to the third.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.680
So the area is going
to be-- actually,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.870
let me just do it-- I'll
scroll down a little bit.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.580
I still want to be able to see
this graph right over here.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.440
Part b.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:37.650
The area of R is going to be
equal to the integral from 0,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.390
that's this point of
intersection right over here,

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.100
to 1/2.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.470
So let me make it clear.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.260
This is 0 to 1/2.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.660
And then the
function on the top--

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.307
so we could just take
the area of that,

00:03:52.307 --> 00:03:54.390
but then we're going to
have to subtract from that

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.010
the area underneath
the function below.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.760
Or one way to think about
it is the integral from 0

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.495
to 1/2 of the top function is
g of x, which is sine of pi x.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.920
But if we just evaluated
this integral--

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.630
let me just put a dx over here.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.730
If we just evaluated
this, we would

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.557
get the area of
this entire region.

00:04:20.557 --> 00:04:22.140
But what we need to
do is subtract out

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.880
the area underneath the
second, underneath f of x.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.660
We just subtract out
the area under that.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.710
So we just subtract
from that f of x.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.430
And f of x, we already
saw, is 8x to the third.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.920
Is 8x to the third power.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.574
And now we can
just evaluate this.

00:04:40.574 --> 00:04:41.990
So let me draw a
little line here.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.290
It's getting a little bit messy.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.850
I'll just do it down here.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.390
So we need to take the
antiderivative of sine of pi x.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.170
Well, the derivative of cosine
of x is negative sine x.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:02.650
The derivative of cosine of pi
x is negative pi cosine of pi x.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.200
So the antiderivative
of sine of pi

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:13.060
x is going to be negative
1 over pi cosine of pi x.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.560
And you can verify
it for yourself.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.160
And you might say, wait.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.770
Sal, how did you know
it was a negative.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.145
Well, I put the
negative there so

00:05:18.145 --> 00:05:21.390
that when I take the derivative
of the cosine of pi x,

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.100
I would get a negative sign, but
that negative will cancel out

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.766
the negative to give
me a positive here.

00:05:25.766 --> 00:05:27.850
And you say, why do you
put a 1 over pi here.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.099
Well, when you take the
derivative of this thing using

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:32.760
the chain rule, you take
the derivative of the pi x,

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.560
you'll get pi, that you
would multiply everything by,

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.380
and then you would get
negative sine of pi x.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.464
And that pi doesn't
show up here.

00:05:40.464 --> 00:05:42.380
So I need something for
it to cancel out with.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.070
And that's what this 1 over pi
is going to cancel out with.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.640
And you could do use
substitution and all the rest,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.920
if you found something
like that useful.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.700
But it's in general,
a good habit

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.580
or I guess it's good to be able
to do this almost by sight.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.090
So, and you can verify
that this derivative is

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.410
equal to sine of pi x.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.010
So the antiderivative
of sine of pi x is this.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.440
The antiderivative of
negative 8x to the third power

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.260
is negative 8-- I'm going to
divide it by 4-- so negative 2x

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.030
to the fourth power.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.560
And all I did is I
incremented the 3 to a 4,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.362
and then I divided
by 8 by the 4.

00:06:23.362 --> 00:06:25.070
And you could take
the derivative of this

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.920
to verify this it is the
same thing as negative 8x

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.730
to the third power.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.650
And we're going to have to
evaluate that from 0 to 1/2.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.190
When you evaluated 1/2,
I'm going to get negative 1

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:48.770
over pi cosine of pi
over 2 minus 2 times 1/2

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.630
to the fourth power is 1/16.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.160
So that's evaluated at 1/2.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.450
And then from that, I'm
going to subtract negative 1

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.609
over pi cosine of 0.

00:06:59.609 --> 00:07:00.650
Let me just write it out.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:10.590
So minus negative 1 over
pi cosine of pi times 0.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.780
Let me just write
cosine of 0 pi,

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.100
I could write, or pi times 0,
minus 2 times 0 to the fourth.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.750
So that's just
going to be minus 0.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.660
So let's evaluate this.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.250
So to simplify it, we have
a cosine of pi over 2.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.350
Cosine of pi over 2
is just going to be 0,

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.680
so this whole thing
just becomes zero.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.790
And then you have a
negative 2 divided by 16.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.830
That's negative 1/8.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.760
And then from that, I'm going
to subtract this business here.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.250
Cosine of 0, this is 1.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.677
So this is just a
negative 1 over pi.

00:07:47.677 --> 00:07:48.760
And then I have a 0 there.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.635
so I can ignore that.

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:56.090
So this is equal to negative
1 over 8 plus 1 over pi.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:56.767
And we are done.

00:07:56.767 --> 00:07:59.100
This part of it, you're not
allowed to use a calculator.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.880
So this is about
as far as I would

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.474
expect them to
expect you to get.

00:08:06.474 --> 00:08:07.640
And so I'll leave you there.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.528
In the next video,
we will do part c.
