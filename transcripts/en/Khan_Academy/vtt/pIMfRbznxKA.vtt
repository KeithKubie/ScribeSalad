00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.788
- [Voiceover] "Carter has noticed a few

00:00:01.788 --> 00:00:03.425
"quantitative relationships related

00:00:03.425 --> 00:00:05.558
"to the success of his football team

00:00:05.558 --> 00:00:07.955
"and has modeled them with
the following functions."

00:00:07.955 --> 00:00:09.296
All right, this is interesting.

00:00:09.296 --> 00:00:10.394
So he has this function,

00:00:10.394 --> 00:00:12.425
which he denotes with the capital N

00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:13.522
and it's the winning,

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:16.103
and the input of it is
the winning percentage, W

00:00:16.103 --> 00:00:19.902
and the output is the average
number of fans per game.

00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:21.812
So, he's making some
type of model that says,

00:00:21.812 --> 00:00:23.356
look the number of fans per game

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.347
are gonna be in some way dependent

00:00:25.347 --> 00:00:26.850
on what your winning percentage is.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.866
And, I'm assuming he's modeled

00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:28.923
the higher the winning percentage,

00:00:28.923 --> 00:00:31.276
the more fans are gonna show up at a game.

00:00:31.276 --> 00:00:33.494
Now this is, W,

00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:37.356
the input is the average
daily practice time, x,

00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:39.427
and the output is the winning percentage.

00:00:39.427 --> 00:00:40.456
All right, that makes sense.

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:41.296
Probably once again,

00:00:41.296 --> 00:00:44.425
probably some type of a positive
effect of practicing more

00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:47.514
is going to create a
higher winning percentage.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:48.651
And this other function,

00:00:48.651 --> 00:00:50.927
number of rainy days, r

00:00:50.927 --> 00:00:52.633
and then average practice time.

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:55.518
Yup, well the more rainy days you have

00:00:55.518 --> 00:00:58.119
well that's going to lower
your average practice time.

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:00.638
So, I definitely see how practice time, P,

00:01:00.638 --> 00:01:03.402
would be a function of
number of rainy days.

00:01:03.402 --> 00:01:08.196
"The expression N(W(x)) represents
which of the following?"

00:01:08.196 --> 00:01:09.416
Well before we even look at the choices,

00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:10.737
let's think about what's happening.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.402
This is another way of denoting

00:01:12.402 --> 00:01:14.028
we're gonna take x,

00:01:14.028 --> 00:01:16.425
we're gonna take x right over here,

00:01:16.425 --> 00:01:20.143
and we are going to input it into W

00:01:20.143 --> 00:01:23.597
and we're going to get out W(x)

00:01:23.597 --> 00:01:28.230
and then we're going to input
that into the function N.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.230
And, we are going to get out, N(W(x)).

00:01:33.443 --> 00:01:36.542
So, what does the function W do?

00:01:36.542 --> 00:01:39.590
What does the function
W do, right over here?

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.012
Well, that's winning percentage

00:01:41.012 --> 00:01:43.105
as a function of practice time.

00:01:43.105 --> 00:01:45.567
So, you input practice,

00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:49.027
practice time,

00:01:49.027 --> 00:01:50.196
and it gives you,

00:01:50.196 --> 00:01:53.528
it somehow predicts a winning percentage,

00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:57.286
winning percentage.

00:01:57.286 --> 00:01:58.846
And, then you take that winning percentage

00:01:58.846 --> 00:02:01.187
and you input it into function N.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:05.149
Function N is going to output
the number of fans per game,

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.836
based on winning percentage.

00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:10.931
So this is number of fans.

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:12.890
So when you take the composite function,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.353
you're actually creating a function

00:02:14.353 --> 00:02:17.076
that starts with practice
time as the input

00:02:17.076 --> 00:02:18.538
and shows the number of fans

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:22.094
that are gonna be dependent
on your practice time.

00:02:22.094 --> 00:02:23.394
So this is interesting.

00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:25.101
So, we should look for a choice that says,

00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:27.539
how does the number of
fans that show up at a game

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:32.539
how is that dependent on practice time, x?

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.573
All right.

00:02:33.573 --> 00:02:35.930
"The team's winning
percentage as a function

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.593
"of the average daily practice time."

00:02:38.593 --> 00:02:40.644
Now that would be just W(x).

00:02:40.644 --> 00:02:43.407
If they said just W(x)
that'd be winning percentage

00:02:43.407 --> 00:02:45.337
as a function of average
daily practice time.

00:02:45.337 --> 00:02:49.644
So, I can cross that one out.

00:02:49.644 --> 00:02:51.879
The average number of fans per game,

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:52.794
all right this is interesting

00:02:52.794 --> 00:02:55.008
because that's what the
final output's going to be

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.203
in terms of the average
number of fans per game,

00:02:57.203 --> 00:02:59.864
that is the output of the function N,

00:02:59.864 --> 00:03:01.876
the function N right over here.

00:03:01.876 --> 00:03:03.176
"The average number of fans per game

00:03:03.176 --> 00:03:07.586
"as a function of the number
of rainy days in a season,"

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:08.215
Nope.

00:03:08.215 --> 00:03:09.048
We're not doing that.

00:03:09.048 --> 00:03:10.754
We're doing it as a
function of practice time.

00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:11.811
You could construct that.

00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:13.700
In fact, if you wanted to do this

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.641
that would be N as a function of W

00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:22.121
as a function of P of r.

00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:23.818
So, that would have been this choice

00:03:23.818 --> 00:03:27.628
where you input the number of rainy days

00:03:27.628 --> 00:03:29.833
from that you're able to
figure out practice time

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:31.560
and then you input practice time

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.286
to figure out win perecentage

00:03:33.286 --> 00:03:35.135
and then you input win percentage

00:03:35.135 --> 00:03:37.635
to figure out the number
of fans in the crowd.

00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:38.874
But that's not what we're doing here.

00:03:38.874 --> 00:03:42.226
We're just starting
with daily practice time

00:03:42.226 --> 00:03:44.237
and getting to fans per game.

00:03:44.237 --> 00:03:47.123
So let me rule this one out.

00:03:47.123 --> 00:03:48.628
And if you found this one a little bit,

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:49.622
what I just did a little bit confusing

00:03:49.622 --> 00:03:51.369
I encourage you to try to set up a diagram

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:52.682
like I just did in the beginning.

00:03:52.682 --> 00:03:56.448
Instead of saying, oh well,
we could start with r to get,

00:03:56.448 --> 00:03:58.663
use that as input to get
average daily practice time

00:03:58.663 --> 00:04:00.695
and then use that as an input into W

00:04:00.695 --> 00:04:01.914
to get winning percentage.

00:04:01.914 --> 00:04:04.860
Then use that as an input into N

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.400
to get average number of fans per game,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.463
but that's not what they're
describing for N(W(x)).

00:04:11.463 --> 00:04:13.536
"The average number of fans per game

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:16.969
"as a function of the team's
average daily practice time."

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:18.249
Yeah, that's what's going on.

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:19.773
You have your average practice time, x

00:04:19.773 --> 00:04:22.068
being inputted into the function W.

00:04:22.068 --> 00:04:25.807
So your average practice
time is going inputted into W

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.001
and it outputs winning percentage,

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.561
which you then input into N

00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:33.060
to get the average
number of fans per game.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.259
The average number of fans per game

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.063
as function of the team's
average daily practice time.

00:04:37.063 --> 00:04:40.964
So, yup, I definitely like that choice.

00:04:40.964 --> 00:04:42.183
Let's do another one of these.

00:04:42.183 --> 00:04:44.602
This is interesting.

00:04:44.602 --> 00:04:48.441
"Deniz studied the park near her home

00:04:48.441 --> 00:04:51.205
"where she identified several
quantitative relationships

00:04:51.205 --> 00:04:54.069
"and modeled them with
the following functions."

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.705
So, B, it inputs the height
of a tree in terms of x

00:04:57.705 --> 00:05:00.957
and it outputs the number of
birds nesting in that tree.

00:05:00.957 --> 00:05:04.877
H, input the average temperature
at a specific location

00:05:04.877 --> 00:05:07.580
and it outputs the height of
the tree at that location.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.948
And T, the altitude of a specific location

00:05:11.948 --> 00:05:13.655
and then, if that's the input,

00:05:13.655 --> 00:05:15.463
and then the output is
the average temperature

00:05:15.463 --> 00:05:16.154
at that location.

00:05:16.154 --> 00:05:17.109
All right, this is interesting.

00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:19.323
"According to Deniz's findings,

00:05:19.323 --> 00:05:20.911
"which of the following
expressions represents

00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:24.971
"the height of a tree as a
function of its altitude?"

00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:26.314
So we want to figure out,

00:05:26.314 --> 00:05:29.766
we want to output the height of a tree

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:33.444
and we want to input, the
altitude of a specific location.

00:05:33.444 --> 00:05:34.419
So, let's think about it.

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.854
If we take our altitude
at a specific location, r

00:05:37.854 --> 00:05:40.941
and we input it into the function T,

00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:45.025
out of that we're going to get T(r).

00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:46.813
T, I'll be writing a little bit neater.

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:49.088
We're gonna get T(r),

00:05:49.088 --> 00:05:52.584
which would represent average
temperature at that location,

00:05:52.584 --> 00:05:55.366
average temp,

00:05:55.366 --> 00:05:57.703
and then if we take the average
temperature at that location

00:05:57.703 --> 00:06:00.692
and input it into function H,

00:06:00.692 --> 00:06:02.762
and then we input it into function H,

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:06.956
we are going to get the height
of a tree at that location.

00:06:06.956 --> 00:06:11.845
So, we're going to get H(T(r))

00:06:11.845 --> 00:06:16.701
and so this is going to be
height of tree at that location,

00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:20.114
height of tree.

00:06:20.114 --> 00:06:23.771
And so, there you have it, H(T(r)).

00:06:23.771 --> 00:06:26.184
You start with r, altitude
at a specific location.

00:06:26.184 --> 00:06:26.981
Input it into function T.

00:06:26.981 --> 00:06:29.683
T's gonna spit out the average
temperature of that location.

00:06:29.683 --> 00:06:31.105
You input that into H.

00:06:31.105 --> 00:06:33.054
It's gonna get you the height
of the tree at that location.

00:06:33.054 --> 00:06:35.087
So, H(T(r)).

00:06:35.087 --> 00:06:39.946
H(T(r)) is this choice right over there.
