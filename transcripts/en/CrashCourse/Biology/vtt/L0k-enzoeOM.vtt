00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.850
Hey, check this out. 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.729
Cool, huh?

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:05.930
I bet you wish you could do this
have a clone clean up around the

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.460
apartment for you go to class,
maybe take your Mom

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.740
to dinner on her birthday?

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.340
Well, you can't do that.
And actually there are some really

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.190
good reasons why you can't do that.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.600
We're going to talk about
those in the next episode.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.210
But, do you know what
CAN clone themselves?

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.970
Your cells.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.850
Like, almost every single
one of them. And in fact

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.240
they're doing it right now!

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.460
For any creature bigger than a
single-celled organism,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.910
all of life stems from cells'
ability to reproduce themselves,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.769
because that's what allows organisms

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.429
to develop, grow, heal and keep from
dying, for as long as possible.

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.149
This particular kind of cell
division is called mitosis,

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.600
and it's responsible for a whole
lot of your body's key functions.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.859
If you get a cut, your body needs
to make new cells. Mitosis.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.309
Have too much to drink
and damage your liver?

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.909
You gotta replace those
cells. Mitosis.

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:57.039
Tumor growing in your spine?
Unfortunately, again mitosis.

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.149
While you go from a seven pound baby
to a seventy pound child it's not

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.559
your cells that are
increasing in mass;

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.089
you're just getting more of them.

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.189
Over and over and over again.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:06.969
That's mitosis.

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:10.500
This process is so central to your
life that it will take place

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.609
in your body, over your lifetime,
about 10 quadrillion times.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.890
That's 10 thousand billion times!

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.909
Like all split ups, it's not easy.
It's going to maybe be

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.990
a little bit messy,
there's a lot of drama,

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.570
and it can take a surprisingly
long amount of time.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.570
But trust me, after we're done
with it we'll all be better off.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.710
So you are made of trillions
of cells just like giraffes

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.929
and redwood trees.

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.119
And remember that inside each cell
there's a nucleus that

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.249
stores your DNA, which contains
all of the instructions

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:53.789
on how to build you.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.429
That DNA is organized
into chromosomes

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:56.719
and as we've mentioned before,

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.530
in your body cells, or somatic
cells, you have 46 chromosomes

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.749
grouped into 23 pairs,

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:04.569
one in each pair is from your mom,
and the other one's from your dad.

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.289
Cells with all 46 chromosomes
are called diploid cells,

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.100
because they have 2 sets each.
And that's what we're

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.300
focusing on today.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.000
You also have haploid cells that
have half as many chromosomes (23).

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.360
And those are your sex cells.
They're produced in an equally

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.710
fantastic process called meiosis,
which we'll be talking about

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.180
in the next episode.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.220
But for now, the main thing to
remember about mitosis is that

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.580
it allows one cell with
46 chromosomes to split into

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.970
two cells that are
genetically identical,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.390
each with 46 chromosomes.
All in order to keep the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.940
party of life going.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.930
Now, the nucleus in your cell
controls everything that

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:37.760
goes on in the cell.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.830
It has all of the instructions
necessary for making

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.440
the cell survive so you don't
need to duplicate the whole cell.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.500
All you need to do is duplicate
the DNA, get it wrapped up,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.440
and then if you have two separate
pockets of DNA, that's all you need

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.220
to have two new cells.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.440
Mitosis takes place in a series
of discrete stages called

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.250
prophase, metaphase,
anaphase, and telophase.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.730
And you can just say that
over and over again,

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.210
and let it sink into your head.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.510
And part of what's really amazing
about this whole process is that,

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.450
while we know what these stages are,
we don't always know the underlying

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.550
mechanisms that make
all of them happen.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.620
And this is part of science.
Science isn't all the stuff we know,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.450
it's how we're trying to
figure all this stuff out.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.600
Consider it job security
if you want to be a biologist;

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.150
there is a lot of stuff that future
biologists have to still figure out,

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.380
and this is one of them.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.160
Alright, let's get our clone on.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.440
So, most of their lives,
cells hang out in this

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.240
limbo period called interphase,
which means they're in between

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.760
episodes of mitosis, mostly growing
and working and doing all the stuff

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.180
that makes them useful to us.
During interphase, the long strings

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.570
of DNA are loosely coiled and messy,
like that dust bunny of dog fur

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.160
and laundry lint under your bed.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.650
That mess of DNA
is called chromatin.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.330
But as the mitosis process
begins to gear up,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.820
lots of things start
happening in the cell

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.600
to get ready for the big division.
One of the more important things

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.950
that happens is that this little

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.090
set of protein cylinders next to the nucleus,
called the centrosome, duplicates itself.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.360
duplicates itself.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.660
We're going to have to move a lot
of stuff around in the nucleus

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.110
and that's going to be regulated
by these centrosomes.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.910
The other thing that happens
is all of the DNA begins

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.200
to replicate itself too,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.510
giving the cell two copies
of every strand of DNA.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.130
To brush up on how DNA
replicates itself like this,

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.340
check out this episode
and then come on back.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.930
Now the cell enters the first phase,
or the prophase, when that mess of

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.030
chromatin condenses and
coils up on itself

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.850
to produce thick strands of DNA

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.230
wrapped around proteins - those
my friends, are your chromosomes.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.790
Instead of dust bunnies,
the DNA is starting to look

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.660
a little bit more like dreadlocks.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.620
And the duplicates that have been
made don't just float around freely;

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.360
they stay attached to the original,
and together they look like little X's;

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.750
these are called the chromatids
and one copy is the left leg

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.960
and arm of the X, and the other
copy is the right leg and arm.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.150
Where they meet in the
middle is the centromere.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.950
Just so you know, these X's are
also called chromosomes

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.640
sometimes double chromosomes,
or double-stranded chromosomes.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.020
And when the chromatids separate,
they're considered individual

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.000
chromosomes too.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.720
Now, while the chromosomes are
forming, the nuclear envelope

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.260
gets out of the way by
completely disintegrating.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.080
And the centrosomes then peel away
from the nucleus, and start heading

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.500
to opposite ends of the cell.
As they go, they leave behind

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.490
a wide trail of protein ropes
called microtubules running from

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.889
one centrosome to the other.

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.860
You might recall from our
anatomy of the animal cell

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.470
that microtubules help provide
a kind of structure to the cell;

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.250
and this is exactly what
they're doing here.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.910
Now we reach the metaphase,
which literally means "after phase"

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.820
and it's the longest
phase of mitosis.;

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.050
It can take up to 20 minutes.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.880
During the metaphase,
the chromosomes attach

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.770
to those ropey microtubules
right in the middle,

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.000
at their centromeres.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.810
The chromosomes then begin to be
moved around, and this seems to be

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.670
being done by molecules
called motor proteins.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.440
And while we don't know too much
about how these motors work,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.480
we do know, for instance,
that there are two of them

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.580
on each side of the centromere.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.400
These are called
Centromere-associated protein E.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.160
So, these motors proteins attach
to the microtubule ropes and

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.570
basically serve to spool up the
tubules' slack. At the same time,

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.200
another protein, dynein, is pulling
up the slack from the other ends

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.660
of the ropes near the cell membranes.
After being pulled in this

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.120
direction and that, the
chromosomes line up, right down

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.600
the middle of the cell.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:16.600
And that brings us to the latest
installment of Bio-lography.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.090
So how do those chromosomes
line up like that? We know that

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.900
there are motor proteins involved
but like, how?

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.919
What are they doing?
Well, remember when I said earlier

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.230
that there are a lot of things
that we don't totally understand

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.430
about mitosis? It's sort of weird
that we don't, because we can

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.060
literally watch mitosis happening
under microscopes, but chromosome

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.550
alignment is a good example of a
small detail that has only

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.870
very recently been figured out,
and it was a revelation

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.240
about 130 years in the making.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.940
Mitosis was first observed by a
German biologist by the name of

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.180
Walther Flemming, who in 1878
was studying the tissue of

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.080
salamander gills and fins when
he saw cells' nuclei split in two

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.139
and migrate away from each other
to form two new cells.

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:02.540
He called this process mitosis,
after the Greek word for thread,

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.870
because of the messy jumble of
chromatin, a term he also coined,

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.669
that he saw in the nuclei.

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:10.730
But Flemming didn't pick up on
the implications of this discovery

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.370
for genetics, which was still a
young discipline. And over the

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.740
next century, generations of
scientists started piecing

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.870
together the mitosis puzzle,
by determining the role of

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.699
microtubules, say, or identifying
motor proteins.

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:24.230
Now, the most recent contribution
to this research was made by a

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.740
postdoctoral student named
Tomomi Kiyomitsu at MIT.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.320
He watched the same process that
Flemming watched, and figured out

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.780
how at least one of the motor
proteins helps snap the

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.910
chromosomes into line.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.250
He was studying a motor protein
called dynein, which sits

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.419
on the inside of the membrane.

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:42.180
Think of the microtubles as
tug-of-war ropes, with the

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.280
chromosomes as the flag
in the middle.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.690
What Kiyomitsu discovered was that
dynein plays tug of war with itself.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.699
Dynein grabs onto one end of the
microtubules and pulls the tubules

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:55.310
and chromosomes toward one
end of the cell.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.440
When the ends of microtubules
come too close to the

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.020
cell membrane, they release
a chemical signal that punts

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.690
the dynein to the other side
of the cell. There, it grabs

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.320
onto the other end of the
microtubles and starts pulling,

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.540
until SMACK it gets
punted back again.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.050
All of this ensures that the
chromosomes will line up

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.889
exactly in the middle,
so that they will be split evenly.

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:16.729
That discovery was published in
February 2012, a couple of weeks

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:20.979
before I sat in this chair, and
134 years after mitosis was

00:08:20.979 --> 00:08:21.750
first observed.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.260
If you want to join the ranks
of scientists who are answering

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.540
the many questions left
about mitosis, and lots of

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.300
other things about our lives
maybe someday I'll do a

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.889
Bio-lography about you.

00:08:32.889 --> 00:08:34.860
Now so far we've gone through
the interphase, when the

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.569
centrosomes and DNA replicate
themselves and get ready for

00:08:38.569 --> 00:08:39.219
the split;

00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:41.949
the prophase, when the chromosomes
form and the centrosomes

00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:43.490
start to spread apart;

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.899
and metaphase, where the
chromosomes align in the

00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:46.740
middle of the cell.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.629
And now it's time to separate
the chromosomes from their copies.

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:52.959
This time, motor proteins start
pulling so hard on the ropes

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:56.259
that the X-shaped chromosomes
split back into their individual,

00:08:56.259 --> 00:08:58.720
single chromosomes. Once they're
detached from each other, they're

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.079
dragged toward either
end of the cell.

00:09:01.079 --> 00:09:04.180
The prefix 'ana' means 'back'
that may help you remember

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.930
the name of this phase,
called anaphase.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.269
After this, it's just a matter
of using all of that genetic

00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:13.459
material to rebuild, so that the
copied genetic material has all

00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:14.860
the accouterments of home.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.720
In the last phase, telophase,
each of the new cell's structures

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.589
are reconstructed.

00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:23.069
First, the nuclear membrane re-forms,
and nucleoli form within them.

00:09:23.709 --> 00:09:26.139
And the chromosomes relax
back into chromatin.

00:09:26.139 --> 00:09:29.170
Then a little crease forms
between the two new cells,

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.720
which marks the beginning of
the final split. That division

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.930
between the two new cells
is called cleavage.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.050
All that's left is to
make a clean break.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.339
This is done by cytokinesis
literally "cell movement"

00:09:40.339 --> 00:09:43.110
by which the two new nuclei move
apart from each other,

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.119
and the cells separate.

00:09:44.119 --> 00:09:47.459
We now have two new cells, each
with the full set of

00:09:47.459 --> 00:09:48.209
46 chromosomes.

00:09:48.209 --> 00:09:50.459
These clones are called the
daughter cells of

00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:53.600
the original cell,
and like identical twins they are

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.389
genetic copies of each other
and also of their parent.

00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:58.040
But, that's obviously not
the case for you.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.610
Even if you are an identical twin.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.490
Shout-out to identical twins!

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:02.569
See me in the comments.

00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:05.410
while you kind of are a clone
of your sibling you are not

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.170
a clone of your parents.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.449
Instead, half of your DNA in each
of your cells is from your mom,

00:10:10.449 --> 00:10:11.929
and half is from your dad.

00:10:11.929 --> 00:10:14.910
To understand why that is,
we have to understand how eggs

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.850
and sperm are formed. And that
is meiosis, and that's what we're

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.629
going to be talking about
next week on Crash Course.

00:10:21.629 --> 00:10:24.329
Until then, you can just watch
this video over and over again

00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:27.029
or you can just watch the bits
that you want to re-watch

00:10:27.029 --> 00:10:29.350
using our table of contents,
which is also available

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.970
in the description for people
who are using iPhones

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.459
and can't click annotations

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:35.529
If you have any questions,
you can reach us on Facebook

00:10:35.529 --> 00:10:36.480
or on Twiiter
or of course,
