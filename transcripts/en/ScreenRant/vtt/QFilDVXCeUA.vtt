00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.879
Growing up is hard to do no matter who you
are but to have a camera capturing all of

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.519
those unforgiving pubescent years, it can
be downright tragic.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.880
Some child actors are adorable children who
are unable to maintain that same quality as

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.180
they age.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.790
Others are ugly duckling who became scorching
hot swans.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.750
Here are 10 Nerdy Child Actors Who Grew up
to be Super-Hot.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.800
Joseph Gordon-Levitt
Joseph Gordon Levitt has been acting since

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.079
he was a young child in films like Angels
in the Outfield.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.960
He went through his awkward adolescence on
television with his role as the wisest yet

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.740
most hormonal alien on 3rd Rock from the Sun.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.080
He was certainly showing his potential for
hotness as the adorable and endearing Cameron

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.080
opposite Larisa Oleynik in 1999’s 10 Things
I Hate about You, but it wasn’t until his

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.900
roles in independent films The Lookout and
Uncertainty that showed audiences his sexy

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.900
side.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.480
After that, he melted hearts in 500 Days of
Summer, showed off some killer calf muscle

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.600
in Premium Rush and even made a Jersey mook
seem hot in Don Jon.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.600
His company, HitRecord, not only helps others
come together to make art but also provides

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.600
the perfect excuse for him to show off his
musical talent and skills on the dance floor.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.180
Lacey Chabert
When Lacey Chabert was on Party of Five, her

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.180
character Claudia was just the annoying little
sister.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.180
With her chipmunk cheeks and squeaky high
pitched voice, it was hard to imagine that

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.100
she would grow up to be comparably hot as
her older Party of Five Co-stars Neve Campbell

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.100
and Jennifer Love Hewitt.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.100
2004’s Mean Girls certainly proved that
all she needed was some growing up and maybe

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.100
a brighter and more form fitting wardrobe.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.990
Chabert has maintained a productive career
in television and film.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.850
While her looks have surely helped her, she
uses that voice of hers for a lot of animated

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.490
shows and video games and even played Meg
in the first season of Family Guy.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.970
Nicholas Hoult
Nicholas Hoult was a cute kid in the 2002

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.420
charmer, About a Boy.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.200
His toothy grin and thick accent won over
Hugh Grant’s obnoxious cad but also won

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.200
over audiences.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.200
While he may have been sweet, it was pretty
unexpected that he grew up as good looking

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.200
as he did.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.560
It was his role in X-Men First Class as Hank
McCoy AKA Beast that showed that puberty is

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.970
sometimes very kind to people.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.970
After X-Men, Hoult kept popping up in films
like Warm Bodies and Dark Places continuing

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.970
to be insanely attractive even when it wasn’t
exactly a requirement for the role.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.970
Who would have thought his role as Nux in
Mad Max: Fury Road would still make him appealing?

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.970
The man is a beast indeed.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.110
Michelle Trachtenberg
Michelle Trachtenberg has been acting since

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.920
she was a youngster making rounds in Nickelodeon's
shows, The Adventures of Pete and Pete and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.000
Clarissa Explains it all.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.570
Nickelodeon liked her enough to give her the
starring role in their first feature film,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.570
Harriet the Spy.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.570
Her big blue eyes and awkwardly oversized
lips were covered by a mop of hair.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.390
She went on to play Buffy’s annoying little
sister on the three final seasons of Buffy

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.530
the Vampire Slayer, but it wasn’t until
2004’s Eurotrip that Trachtenberg emerged

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.260
as a hot adult.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.189
The CW’s Gossip Girl showcased her beauty
and seductive qualities as the meddling Georgina

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:10.189
Sparks.

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:14.310
Her usual look of silky dark locks, smoky
eyes, and slight smirk highlight just how

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.080
far she has come since being a gawky child
spy.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.470
Matthew Lewis
Matthew Lewis may be the poster child for

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.740
nerdy child actors who grew up to be hot.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.000
The British actor is best known as Neville
Longbottom in the Harry Potter films.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.020
Attending Hogwarts for a decade must have
been good to him.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.090
Lewis went from being a chubby tween with
buck teeth to being an attractive guy who

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.770
regularly shows off his athletic body.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.480
Lewis is one of the more shocking transformations.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.580
He went from looking like a thin Augustus
Gloop to a young Clive Owen

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.580
Emma Watson
Matthew Lewis is not the only Harry Potter

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.580
alum to improve with age.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.580
Emma Watson endeared audiences when she was
barely hitting double digits as Hermione Granger.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.580
Who doesn’t love Hermione with her know-it-all
attitude and courageous sensibility?

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.580
Watson was a sweet kid with a mess of hair
that seemed to have weighed more that she

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.580
did.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.580
Growing up in front of the eyes of audiences
as Hermione, it was quite obvious she was

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.580
becoming a beauty.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.780
Her career has taken off post-Potter with
The Bling Ring, and as Sam, the girl everyone

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.050
wishes they knew in High School from The Perks
of Being a Wallflower.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.690
Along with some roles in smaller films, she
is proving to be a rare kind of Disney gorgeous

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.690
who is portraying Belle in 2017’s live action
Beauty and the Beast.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.900
Emma Watson went from being a cute kid to
a super-hot adult who totally put a love spell

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.900
on audiences.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.900
Zac Efron Zac Efron has always been popular
with the kiddie set.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.450
He may have been a teen dream to ten year-olds
back when he was playing a popular basketball

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.349
player in Disney’s High School Musical,
but for the rest of us, he was a goofy looking

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.330
kid with a terrible haircut.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.610
A decade later, Efron grew up to be the kind
of hot that all ages can agree upon.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.200
Along with a smoking body, Efron learned how
to dress, and commit to a more classic hairstyle.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.480
After his stint with Disney, Efron attempted
more serious roles.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.730
The Lucky One established his position as
a romantic lead as he played a devastatingly

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.730
handsome Marine who comes to a small town
with a secret.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.220
More recently, Zac showed off his sexy sense
of humor in movies like Neighbors and Bad

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.220
Grandpa.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.220
The newest progression of Zac Efron is definitely
the hottest and when comparing it to his Bieber-hair

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.220
sporting former version, the improvement is
substantial.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.409
Shia Labeouf
Shia Labeouf has gone off the rails a bit

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:45.409
in the last few years, but it is hard to deny
that the man got hot.

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.640
He spent his early years as the wacky younger
brother Louis Stevens on Disney Channel’s

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.690
Even Stevens.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.230
His nerdy look slowly improved once he began
making films, especially with starring roles

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.230
in Disturbia and the massively budgeted Transformers
films.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.620
Along with becoming a bigger name in Hollywood,
he hooked up with quite a list of stunning

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.220
celebrities including Carey Mulligan and Isabel
Lucas.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.650
Shia also admitted what many assumed to be
true that he had a fling with the insanely

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.650
hot Megan Fox.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.650
The fact that he has had such an odd public
persona in recent years that included public

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.650
brawls and unnecessary instances of plagiarism
still hasn’t detracted from his hotness.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.520
&nbsp;His odd performance art pieces and career
choices are enough for even James Franco to

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.910
suggest he simmer down his antics.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.380
With all of the craziness that has stemmed
from his career, Labeouf still managed to

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.870
go from giant dork to hot weirdo.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.029
Emma Roberts
Emma Roberts is another actor who has been

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.029
known to have a screw loose in her real life,
but luckily her equally insane characters

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.029
have leveled out her hotness.

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:29.270
Starting out as a child actor on the Nickelodeon
show Unfabulous, Roberts was known more for

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.719
having a famous father and an aunt who is
one of the biggest movie stars ever.

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:35.300
She had a lot to live up to and in her early
years she seemed to have inherited only the

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.300
long-limbed gawkiness of Julia Roberts.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.169
After playing one of the psychotic killers
in Scream 4, Roberts found her niche in playing

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.750
characters who were truly bonkers.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.389
In American Horror Story: Coven she was bewitching
and in Scream Queens she was a batty, yet

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.099
hilarious sorority leader.

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:55.740
Emma Roberts is off the charts on the Crazy/Hot
scale, something that is only slightly unexpected

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.360
from a former Nancy Drew.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.009
Demi Lovato Recalling Demi Lovato back when
she was a ten year-old on Barney and Friends,

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.778
it is proof positive that some things improve
with age The once pudgy best friend of Selena

00:05:05.778 --> 00:05:06.778
Gomez has grown into a hot singer and actress.

00:05:06.778 --> 00:05:10.800
As a teenager, she rocked out with the Jonas
brothers in the Disney original film Camp

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.800
Rock, already exhibiting a more improved appearance.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.190
In the last few years she has evolved into
a confident and sexy performer.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:24.830
Lovato went through a few personal struggles
that ended up in the spotlight but none of

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.439
that matters today.

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:33.719
She went from a nerdy kid whose best friend
was a giant imaginary dinosaur to being a

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:34.719
Demi Goddess.

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:36.819
