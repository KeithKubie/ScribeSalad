[music playing]

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.266
[splash]

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.333
[shout]

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.133
NARRATOR: After a
season of frustration--

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.367
BEN SHARP: Right there.

00:00:14.367 --> 00:00:16.967
--Regina and her team have
a killer whale in sight.

00:00:16.967 --> 00:00:18.533
BEN SHARP: He's coming
towards the edge.

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.000
NARRATOR: Now, they just
need it to be in range.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.467
REGINA EISERT: Often the
whales pop up out of nowhere.

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:25.400
You've got half a
second to take your aim.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.333
Because the thing's
moving, and you need

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.600
to shoot it while it's moving.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.200
And it's only above the water
for a very short period.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.367
BEN SHARP: It's coming
this way, Rowan.

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:36.600
Right there.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.600
[spouts water]

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.667
[music playing]

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.200
Got it.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.000
Got it.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.967
Got it.

00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:45.233
All right.

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:48.100
REGINA EISERT: Hey.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.900
BEN SHARP: Awesome.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:52.367
Perfect.

00:00:55.734 --> 00:00:57.367
REGINA EISERT: It's all right.
You're good.

00:00:57.367 --> 00:00:59.166
BEN SHARP: There's a little
piece of blubber and skin.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.934
It'll take a little
piece of skin, smaller

00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:02.066
than the end of my fingernail.

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.233
But that's enough for us
to do genetics and also

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:05.567
stable isotope analysis.

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:09.633
Stable isotopes allow us to
position where the animal is

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:12.567
eating in the food chain, and
so it helps us to reconstruct

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:14.233
what the diet of the whale is.

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:15.767
Once we match those
with the photo IDs,

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:20.133
we start to understand family
structure and population size.

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.767
NARRATOR: Information
from a single whale

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:24.700
helps the team learn
about the individual.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.266
But multiple samples help
them understand a section

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.734
of the population, and
that's the goal they've

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:33.033
been working toward all season.

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:35.200
BEN SHARP: Regina!

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.200
Regina!

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.233
REGINA EISERT:
There's the other one.

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:39.300
Success is if you
get any samples.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.600
What we need-- as many
killer whales as we can.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.266
Big male out over here.

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:47.367
BEN SHARP: [sighs] Here he is.

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:48.333
[shot]

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:49.300
Got him?
BEN SHARP: Yep.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.400
He reacted.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.333
So there's a group
right out over there.

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:54.033
BEN SHARP: Then
there's more out there.

00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:55.266
REGINA EISERT: I
hate to say it, but I

00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:56.900
told you there would be whales.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.967
BEN SHARP: Saw
another one coming.

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:00.100
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.033
Go-- not the other guy.

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:02.166
REGINA EISERT: Where's
the other rifle?

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:03.367
BEN SHARP: Go for the
other gun, right there.

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:06.333
[music playing]

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:09.767
[spout]

00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:11.834
[shot]

00:02:11.834 --> 00:02:12.633
BEN SHARP: You got her?

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:13.433
I didn't even see it.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.633
Good shot.

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.200
REGINA EISERT: I'm very
pleased with our samples,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.000
because it was a lot
of work getting them.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.400
As opposed to some days-- you've
got 50 whales milling around.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.700
And they're just
all over the place,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.400
and you don't know what to
shoot first-- we had to run

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.500
up and down the ice edge.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.834
And there was one or
two animals at a time,

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:27.033
and we had to chase them.

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:28.667
[laughs]

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:30.467
BEN SHARP: Well, we
finally saw some whales.

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:32.300
We had to move fast
to get to them.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.567
Here we go.
Here we go.

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:34.367
He's closer.

00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:35.467
He's right here.

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:36.567
BEN SHARP: He's right there.

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:37.967
Nice shot.

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:40.900
Regina just got a biopsy
from that second big male

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.800
in that group.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.734
Nice.

00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:43.600
Right there.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.567
[music playing]

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.100
BEN SHARP: We got six biopsies.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.433
REGINA EISERT: Hey!

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:55.133
BEN SHARP: I think we did
really good on the photo IDs.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.867
That first group was the same
group over and over again.

00:02:57.867 --> 00:03:00.133
So we probably got that
whole family group.

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:02.166
Regina found a place
where the whales are.

00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:03.700
Regina ended up
getting biopsies.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.100
We got good data.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.066
As we work it up, we're going
to be able to do a lot with it.

00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:08.433
BEN SHARP: Good day.

00:03:08.433 --> 00:03:09.734
All right, we did good.

00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:10.533
