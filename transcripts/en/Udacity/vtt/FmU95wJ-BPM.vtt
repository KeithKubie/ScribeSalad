Thank so much for coming, Joanna. It's been

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.640
great having you here, and we've learned a lot.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.350
&gt;&gt; It's been my pleasure. and I'm really excited about what

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.670
all of you are going to be learning in the remaining lessons.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.160
&gt;&gt; Now, for the rest of the course, we're going to be building on

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.910
the knowledge we've gained in all the

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.340
previous lessons, especially this one. Where we've

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.510
had our own personal genetics expert show us how we can interpret some of

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.090
our own genetic information. We're going to first

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.530
learn about simple and then complex traits,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.540
move on to some pharmacogenetics, before

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.780
learning about human ancestry and evolution.
