&gt;&gt;Lisa: I definitely think that the
digital media provides a different

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:31.846
way of looking at the content.

00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:34.446
The thing that I love the
most about the Puzzle Maker

00:00:34.446 --> 00:00:37.666
and my algebra students especially
just loved was, we were talking

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.876
about parabolas and we were
talking about vertical motion

00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:43.186
and then we built it and they got
to go in the game and experience it.

00:00:43.256 --> 00:00:45.126
Because you talk about,
"Oh, we're throwing the ball

00:00:45.126 --> 00:00:46.196
or we're bouncing off the thing."

00:00:46.416 --> 00:00:49.836
Well, you go into the Puzzle Maker,
you jump off the aerial faith plate

00:00:49.836 --> 00:00:52.386
and it was neat for them
to actually experience how

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.666
that changes the motion virtually.

00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.506
&gt;&gt;Joshua: Portal 2 is basically a
game-based really simple premise.

00:00:57.506 --> 00:01:00.286
It's this idea that you can do
this impossible thing in our world,

00:01:00.286 --> 00:01:03.326
which is open a hole in space
in one place and another,

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.556
and if I go in one hole,
I'll come out the other one.

00:01:05.986 --> 00:01:08.326
That world fit really
well into a space

00:01:08.326 --> 00:01:10.826
where you could actually have an
editor and make your own puzzles

00:01:10.826 --> 00:01:12.706
so that, you know, you
weren't just being challenged

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:13.646
by what we could create.

00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:15.446
You could actually
create your own challenges

00:01:15.446 --> 00:01:16.626
and you could share
them with friends.

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:19.776
So the Puzzle Maker is really all
about that, giving people that chance

00:01:19.776 --> 00:01:22.946
to put on the hat of a designer,
sit down and try their hand

00:01:22.946 --> 00:01:23.796
at what they can come up with.

00:01:23.946 --> 00:01:26.856
&gt;&gt;Yasser: I think that what
makes an authentic experience is

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:29.606
that it's really open.

00:01:29.736 --> 00:01:34.846
We didn't really frame the problem,
other than giving you a set of rules

00:01:34.846 --> 00:01:36.586
for how these items interact.

00:01:36.956 --> 00:01:39.836
It really is kind of
an open play space.

00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:43.426
&gt;&gt;Student: I think the best thing
about working with Portal 2 is

00:01:43.426 --> 00:01:46.806
that you can just do what you want

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:49.776
and the community test
chambers are really awesome,

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.736
because it's just your
design that you can play,

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:54.356
instead of playing the levels
that are there for you.

00:01:54.586 --> 00:01:57.826
&gt;&gt;Yasser: We kind of sense that
people are really interested in

00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:00.756
and have started talking
about puzzle craft itself.

00:02:00.946 --> 00:02:04.246
We've kind of been thinking
about features that can kind

00:02:04.246 --> 00:02:08.786
of help people learn from each
other, and to take the process we go

00:02:08.786 --> 00:02:13.586
through of creating something,
play testing it, iterating on that

00:02:13.586 --> 00:02:16.506
and then building that
into the game itself,

00:02:16.676 --> 00:02:20.236
so that process becomes
a fun, natural extension

00:02:20.346 --> 00:02:22.236
of learning how to create puzzles.

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:25.336
&gt;&gt;Joshua: If we think about what
worked with the Puzzle Maker

00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:28.906
and what didn't, I think what felt
like we got right was the kind

00:02:28.946 --> 00:02:30.986
of lowering that bar
to entry for people.

00:02:31.146 --> 00:02:33.256
A week after we released
it, we had like a hundred

00:02:33.256 --> 00:02:35.636
and twenty thousand
submissions, which is well

00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:37.256
and above anything we
would have expected.

00:02:37.696 --> 00:02:40.536
And so I think it was
exciting, not just to see

00:02:40.536 --> 00:02:43.326
that many people making maps, but
that many people sharing their maps,

00:02:43.326 --> 00:02:46.416
because I think making a map is
one thing, but actually putting it

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.136
out there for everybody
else is another.

00:02:48.176 --> 00:02:51.016
&gt;&gt;Leslie: When you are
able to, within seconds,

00:02:51.466 --> 00:02:54.756
transfer from building the
puzzle with the different assets

00:02:54.756 --> 00:02:58.486
in the palette, to actually
playing the level you just created,

00:02:58.486 --> 00:03:02.096
you are in the video game playing
it, that is an unbelievable sense

00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:03.746
of accomplishment for a young person.

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:09.866
The puzzle maker has a threshold
that's so low for someone to just try

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:15.506
to put in some effort that what
comes out of it feels really good.

00:03:15.806 --> 00:03:17.766
&gt;&gt;Yasser: Over time,
I think my concept

00:03:17.766 --> 00:03:20.916
of where games provide
value has kind of shifted.

00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:22.896
Now I kind of think of it more

00:03:22.896 --> 00:03:26.346
as instilling a useful
pattern of learning.

00:03:27.036 --> 00:03:31.976
So rather than presenting the
information and then challenging

00:03:31.976 --> 00:03:37.686
and then testing, I think it's
more interesting to present a place

00:03:37.686 --> 00:03:40.566
where kids can practice kind
of the love of learning,

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:45.276
kind of show them how once
they've kind of attained agency

00:03:45.276 --> 00:03:50.556
in that skill set, they can
then create and share and kind

00:03:50.556 --> 00:03:53.696
of loop back in a way that's
kind of relevant to their peers.

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:57.506
&gt;&gt;Lisa: Learning is enhanced
when students are engaged.

00:03:57.846 --> 00:04:01.436
The kids that are engaged come at
it from a different perspective

00:04:01.436 --> 00:04:03.706
with a different excitement
and I think a different type

00:04:03.706 --> 00:04:05.506
of retention and ability to apply it.
