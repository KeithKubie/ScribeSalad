00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.530
Let's see if we can divide
30.24 divided by 0.42.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.160
And try pausing the video
and solving it on your own

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.654
before I work through it.

00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:14.820
So there is a couple of
ways you can think about it.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:26.590
We could just write it
as 30.24 divided by 0.42.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.240
But what do you do now?

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.110
Well the important
realization is,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.750
is when you're doing a
division problem like this,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.260
you will get the
same answer as long

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.880
as you multiply or divide both
numbers by the same thing.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.850
And to understand that,
rewrite this division

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.200
as 30.42 over 0.42.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.620
We could write it
really as a fraction.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.920
And we know that when we
have a fraction like this

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.950
we're not changing the
value of the fraction

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.110
if we multiple the numerator
and the denominator

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.480
by the same quantity.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.010
And so what could we
multiply this denominator by

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.610
to make it a whole number?

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.460
Well we can multiply it
by 10 and then another 10.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.070
So we can multiply it by a 100.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.950
So lets do that.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.650
If we multiply the
denominator by 100 in order

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.100
to not change the
value of this, we also

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.500
need to multiply the
numerator by 100.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.140
We are essentially
multiplying by 100 over 100,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.030
which is just 1.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.960
So we're not changing the
value of this fraction.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.330
Or, you could view this,
this division problem.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.020
So this is going to
be 30.42 times 100.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.020
Move the decimal two places
to the right, gets you 3,042.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.430
The decimal is now there
if you care about it.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.460
And, 0.42 times 100.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.820
Once again move the decimal
one, two places to the right,

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.400
it is now 42.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.360
So this is going to be the
exact same thing as 3,042

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.920
divided by 42.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.379
So once again we can move the
decimal here, two to the right.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:02.920
And if we move that
two to the right,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.330
then we can move this
two to the right.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.170
Or we need to move
this two to the right.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.130
And so this is where,
now the decimal place is.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.260
You could view this as 3,024.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.950
Let me clear that
3024 divided by 42.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.950
Let me clear that.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.950
And we know how to tackle
that already, but lets

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.210
do it step by step.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.940
How many times
does 42 go into 3?

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.670
Well it does not go at all,
so we can move on to 30.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.380
How many times
does 42 go into 30?

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.060
Well it does not go into 30
so we can move on to 302.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.320
How many times does
42 go into 302?

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.250
And like always this is a bit
of an art when your dividing

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.230
by a two-digit or a multi-digit
number, I should say.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.110
So lets think about
it a little bit.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.720
So this is roughly 40.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.770
This is roughly 300.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.390
So how many times
does 40 go into 300?

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.980
Well how many times
does 4 go into 30?

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.810
Well, it looks like
it's about seven times,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.320
so I'm going to try out
a 7, see if it works out.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.630
7 times 2 is 14.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.250
7 times 4 is 28.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.590
Plus 1 is 29.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.430
And now I can subtract.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.570
Do a little bit of
re-grouping here.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.320
So lets see, if I regroup--
I take a 100 from the 300.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.730
That becomes a 200.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.250
Then our zero tens,
now I have 10 tens,

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.220
but I'm going to need
one of those 10 tens,

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.430
so that's going to be 9 tens.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.888
And I'm going to
give it over here.

00:03:26.888 --> 00:03:28.780
So this is going to be a 12.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.670
12 minus 4 is 8.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.780
9 minus 9 is 0.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.490
2 minus 2 is 0.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.620
So what I got left
over is less than 42,

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.447
so I know that 7 is
the right number.

00:03:44.447 --> 00:03:46.030
I want to go as many
times as possible

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.420
into 302 without going over.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.840
So now lets bring
down the next digit.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.990
Lets bring down
this 4 over here.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.669
How many times
does 42 go into 84?

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.460
Well that jumps out at
you, or hopefully it

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.470
jumps-- It goes two times.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.750
2 times 2 is 4.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.840
2 times 4 is 8.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.030
You subtract, and we
have no remainder.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.120
So 3,042 divided by
42 is the same thing

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.060
as 30.42 divided by 0.42.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.752
And it's going to
be equal to 72.

00:04:25.477 --> 00:04:27.185
Actually, I didn't
have to copy and paste

00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:28.310
that, I'll just write this.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.480
This is equal to 72.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.450
Just like that.
