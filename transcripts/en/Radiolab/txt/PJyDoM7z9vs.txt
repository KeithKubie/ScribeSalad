Speaker 1:          00:00          Come on. Totally. You guys can say we want to talk to you about three. Okay. Okay, let's do it. Let's do that. Let's do that then. Like keep what we can't do. Hey, this is radiolab I'm Jad Abumrad. We're going to do something that's a little bit unorthodox today, at least for us. Um, you know, if you've listened to the show in the last 10 years or so, however long we've been doing this, uh, you understand that like we like to edit, right? We like, we like a good edit or 70, but today I want to play you something that has almost no edits at all. It's just a conversation which has of course the foundation of what we do these long rambling about the occasionally profane error strewn conversations that we then edit into something coherent. But today, today I want to show you the messiness, no edits.

Speaker 1:          00:46          This is a chunk of a conversation with science writer at Carl Zimmer. He came and sat down with us a while back and we talked for four hours. Two of those hours became the basis for the CRISPR podcast. That was a few podcasts ago. This was about gene editing, but then we kept on going for another two hours and he told us this story. Actually two stories, but we're only gonna play one that I thought was really cool. And it's about this new way of looking at life. This is a, is this a long story, a medium story or short story? It's not a, yeah, we can get through this a lot faster than CRISPR. Okay. Okay. I really like CRISPR, by the way. Who Do I, I mean, CRISPR is, yeah, it's the bomb. Hmm. Yeah. That's a perfect way to describe it. Yeah. By logical bomb. Okay. So, uh, uh, chapter two can, maybe you can start

Speaker 2:          01:38          the story once, if the once upon a time. Sure. So once upon a time being, um, I'd say once, once upon a time being before 2003, we basically had two kinds of living things on earth. We had sell your their life and we had viruses and there was nice and distinct and clear cut. And so cells included us. Our bodies made her cells and bacteria, which are single celled. And all the other things that can grow and let their cells divide. They have DNA, they have proteins in them. They all got that stuff. And then over here you had viruses and viruses were just little packages of genetic material that would go from cell to cell and use the cell to make new viruses. And so inside of them, all they had were jeans and a couple of proteins that would then just sort of hijack their host.

Speaker 2:          02:42          They seem like soap, soap, preliminary. They don't even, maybe not even qualify as life. Right? They can't grow on their own. Um, they can't generate their own energy. So, you know, us and all other Shangler life, we, um, we make a kind of a fuel called ATP and we need that to do every little thing in our body. And viruses don't make ATP. So, you know, they're in shock when we say that life is us cells and multicellular beings. And then there's a sort of pseudo life, which is these little things that live off of us. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people, a lot of scientists don't really think viruses are truly alive. Even though they just sort of take advantage of life to make more copies of themselves. Okay. Can I say dumb questions? So viruses, they don't have a wall around them. And the way that that cell cells, our walls essentially are walled off areas.

Speaker 2:          03:31          Um, they might have a protein shell. [inaudible] and, and so, you know, when the flu virus goes into a cell, that protein shell kind of breaks open and the genes and proteins inside come out. They do have containers that contain them for, for a while. I see. Well isn't that one of the, somebody who had a, had a list of rules that make you alive and what wasn't a container was one of those rules. Yeah. But yeah, I mean that, that don't do that energy. But they have the container at least. Right. So the problem with viruses is that they have some of the things that we think are essential for life, but not quite all of them. So it's been convenient just to say viruses are not alive. Put them over there cause they don't have everything that sells really. Life has. So we'll just say they're not alive to just viruses.

Speaker 2:          04:17          Gotcha. And then, so then what happened is that there was a scientist named Timothy Robotham, uh, in England who was investigating a Timothy Robotham Timothy go about them. Yes. The English name in road Buffum with the fuck the robot was a, it was working in Bradford City in England. And, um, he was, uh, looking at the kinds of bacteria that might be growing in a hospital. You know, like there they were having some problems with pneumonia outbreaks and so on. And he was like, okay, well what's growing around here? Uh, and so he went to a, uh, sort of a cooling tower for water on top of the hospital, and he took a sample and he went and put it under his microscope. And he's like, hmm, some interesting bacteria here. Oh, here's a very interesting bacteria that doesn't really look like anything I've seen before. This guy would just kind of crawl around to weird places and just snatched little snippets of scum or what would he, yeah, I mean, was he, what was his job?

Speaker 2:          05:23          He's a microbiologist. Oh, of course. So you know, that it would be good to know, like, I mean some microbiologists, do they just go scrape little bits of rock or, or they search the world. Yeah. I mean microbes are everywhere. So microbiologists go everywhere to find microbes. So they're even, you know, in a water tower on a hospital. Does he do it? Was he in a, in a kind of an investigatory role? He was trying to help them, help them figure out which bacteria are making people sick. Um, that was one of the hopes, but you know, he was thinking of doing a survey because you know, they're diseases like legionnaires disease, which can, you know, grow in these, these sort of containers of water, you know, that's, there, there is some concern about that. So you know, better to get to know what's growing.

Speaker 2:          06:08          Um, so he's particularly taken by one um, thing that he assumes is bacteria and it's got a kind of interesting kind of roundish shape. Um, and he calls and when bacteria around you can call him Cockeye or caucus. Um, so he names this Bradford caucus cause it a name. That's why the caucus name that comes to me was referring to the shape like strep streptococcus is, because it's, it's around my, I did not know that the things you learn from talking to Carl Zimmer. My God. Okay. So, so, um, so he's, he's trying to study this thing and he's trying to, so one, when you're a microbiologist, the way you study bacteria is you get them to grow and he can't get this to grow. He's feeding at things and it's like smart growing. Why is it not growing? I can't figure it out. And eventually, um, you know, he, he just hits, hits a, it hits a wall and unfortunately, um, uh, his lab, uh, got shut down.

Speaker 2:          07:11          Um, and so he basically said, okay, I don't want to, uh, throw this stuff out so I'm gonna, I'm going to give it to some of my colleagues in France. It was, it wasn't dying, which wasn't growing. Yeah. So he gave it to a scientist named Bernard Lascola and his colleagues and they kind of put them and we, and, and he just says, I'm, he just sets it aside for a while and doesn't, you know, it's just more bacteria, you know? And, and for some reason he decided to, you know, take a look at this Bradford Caucus. You know, I'm like, what? What was this thing that that robot them was talking about? So he looks at it and he says, okay, it's this, this is the size of bacteria, but it looks like a gigantic virus. You know it. So what is a giant virus was usually very small.

Speaker 2:          08:06          Exactly. So bacteria to a virus is like, like hundreds of times bigger, hundreds of times. Okay. So queen married too small. So he looked up close and he was like, what is this thing? This doesn't look right. This, this. If I didn't know better, I'd say this, this was a virus. And he's saying this based on its internal orientation. It's appearance. It's because it had the protein thingy and stuff. So a lot of viruses, they have a shell made a protein and the shell is kind of composed of plates. So it's kind kinda looks like a soccer ball. Uh hmm. So it's a very distinctive look. Okay. And it looked like that. It looked like that. It didn't look like bacteria. Oh, interesting. I was like, wait a minute, could this be a virus? So this would be like maybe like finding an soccer ball in the woods.

Speaker 2:          08:57          Yes. Two he'd found the, the Leviathan equivalent of a virus. Right. It didn't make sense. It was, it was kind of crazy in that microscopic realm to say, maybe this is a virus. Wait, so didn't. So Brad Mumford, what's his name again? Timothy Robotham. Robotham didn't have this realization. Nope. He hadn't looked at it closely enough. He looked at it, but he just didn't somehow put the, put the this as a virus and click to the bacteria. No Wednesdays, that's a virus day and this was Tuesday. And, and it's, it's likely that other people were looking at the same things in years before. I'm thinking there were bacteria in there and they're saying, here's a big, here's something the size of bacteria. Well, in fairness, because viruses are always small than the, that you wouldn't think a big thing would be fire. Well, viruses are always small in the sense that they were discovered because they were small.

Speaker 2:          09:55          So basically signed. What scientists did was they discovered viruses by filtering fluid from a sick plant or a sick animal through a filter. Porcelain actually, and it was so small that that anything besides that bacteria got trapped in the porcelain and anything smaller came out. Oh and low and behold they could find things that could cause sickness in that fluid that pass through the filter. Most of the discovery of viruses meant it was innately small because that's how you filtered for them. That's what they were looking for. This is interesting. So there were probably generations of scientists who were looking in through microscopes, saw some interesting round thing and assumed it was bacteria and it was probably a virus. What the fuck is this giant, giant Leviathan virus? I assume that was his question. Well, I mean, he first he had to to really establish that it was, and so what happened was that, um, he, he looked very closely at it and kind of worked at it's chemistry.

Speaker 2:          10:51          And the more he looked at it, the more it looked like a virus. He started, he started actually looking at it to DNA, which hadn't been possible before. It turned out that its DNA resembled the DNA of viruses and not have any known bacteria. Um, it didn't have, it didn't, it actually didn't have the, the, the equipment for making fuel inside of it. Uh, and then the real kicker was that he found out how to grow it. What he had to do was he had to stick this thing inside of Amoeba and then out of the Amoeba would come more Bradford Caucus, just like a virus. Exactly like a virus. So he needed to change the name from Bradford Caucus to something else. Right. So, so they named it Mimi virus, Mimi virus virus, because they were in France and me music in the, in a French shop probably. But because it was a mimic and he was mimicking, mimic. Yeah. Interesting. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Is

Speaker 3:          11:54          that like a French word for Mac?

Speaker 2:          11:56          Um, I think they just took, you know, the beginning of Mimic and added it to virus.

Speaker 3:          12:00          Hello. Mimi virus. Very nice. I guess it's the same thing twice. Me, me. It's like mimic. Yeah. Okay. I get it. So interesting.

Speaker 2:          12:07          Yeah. So this, so this was, I mean this was really bizarre when they published their report on this in 2003 and men, people really scratch their head because remember, you know, ordinary viruses have, you know, maybe 10 genes. Uh, this one had a 1080

Speaker 3:          12:24          p and g when you have 10 genes, those are the genes that, so you have a protein capsule and so you can swim through the thing. So when you land on a cell, you can borrow in and then explode and then make babies. So those are, there's not much to being a virus and just need a few genes for that. W thousand. This does this thing have particular talents that the other viruses didn't have. Maybe it looks like, does it? Oh it does. What does that, okay.

Speaker 2:          12:52          Well, so what's one thing that's really interesting is what happens when it goes inside its host and Amoeba. It goes in a, but instead of kind of shedding off that protein code and just spilling out its contents, it actually goes in and stays as it was. You mean it stays in a container and everything just sort of, yeah. Oh, it's called the virus factory. Once it's inside there, the that it's this thing they call the virus factory and it basically is able to, um, to, to uh, things, you know, components come into it and then, uh, then it sort of has enzymes that can refashion them and then they outcome the components for new. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          13:39          Yeah. It doesn't have to go into the nucleus of the already existence. Hell no, it just floats in there. Oh, interesting. So it, it, what does it do? Like [inaudible] portal and it sucks up some stuff.

Speaker 2:          13:49          Yeah. It has this beautiful sort of a, they call it a stargate because it's shaped like it's a doorway shape, like a star and things come in. And then I, I had another stargate, the, the con, the, these sort of manufactured things come out. And then in the cell they assemble into new giant viruses.

Speaker 3:          14:08          Oh. So it spits out the raw materials and that then self assemble into a giant and giant Leviathan, no baby gentler biases, which then how do they get out of the, do they explode through the surface and blow out? Yeah. That's like a totally, that's a totally different number. Yeah. I thought normally viruses just go into the machine that's already there cause they're parasites. They just use the living thing. This thing is, I'm an, I have a weird kind of a respect for this thing.

Speaker 2:          14:35          Oh yeah. It's amazing. And you know, one of the amazing things about it is that it can get its own viruses. It gets, there are really, yes. So there are viruses and viruses. These things are called Viro phages and they actually go into virus factory and high jacket. Oh, interstate outcome. Viro phages. Oh Wow. Yeah. As soon as you have a virus factory, that's what a virus wants. It's none of the virus has its own virus factory. Well, it's going to get, it's going viral infected viral lies by the other viruses. Right? Weird. Yeah. Weird is the right word. I think right now done in 2003 you know, you could say, well this is one weird virus, but the scientist said, well hm, I wonder what else there is like, did that create a, wait a second. So they said, okay, it's got all this extra genetic power, but he's doing this sort of special circus act here.

Speaker 2:          15:29          It's building its own factory and it's just behaving differently for others. So maybe it just needs all those genes to do this special thing is doing. The problem was that when they looked at these, you know, 1,018 genes, most of them didn't match anything anyone had found before. Hmm. These are new genes. Genes. Yeah. That you couldn't even guess at what they were at. This is gotta be from like, this is like an alien is from Saturn. This thing, is that where you're driving with the story? Not quite, but kind of. I mean, so waiting. So they look at all the genes. They look at the, the chemistry of life as, as it's known and they don't find any matches for this little thing, this big thing for most of the jeans. They couldn't find a match. Huh? You know, you can look at, I mean that's a double mister.

Speaker 2:          16:11          Like what is it? What is this and where does it come from? Cause it doesn't seem to have the smell of earth life. Yeah. Except that it uses DNA. I mean, it uses protein, it uses our chemistry, but it's doing something weird. Um, and so these scientists said, well, okay, they looked in an English hospital, you know, water cooling tower, let's go look at one here in France. And so they looked and they found another giant virus, which is even bigger than the one that they had already found. [inaudible] hospital in France, in the air conditioning. You know, it was in another cooling tower. Jesus is like a, this is a cooling tower phenomenon so far. Rooftop biology. Well, it's excitement Galore. It's more like the drunk looking for the keys under the lamppost. You know, it's like, you know, that openness, wherever you look there, we know that, we know there was giant viruses found in one water tower.

Speaker 2:          17:04          So let's go look in another water tower. Like that's our safest bet and hey look, we found an even bigger one. Uh, you know, which they, um, which has even bigger. It was even bigger. Yeah. So instead of 1,018 jeans, it had 1,059 genes. Um, so they named this one mama virus, Mimi's first cousin Mama. Right, right. Your Mama duly and things in the cells that Mimi didn't do, or did it also built the industry? Yeah, it was, it was making a virus factory. So it was like, so there's something, there's a common theme here with these two. Now you have two giant viruses doing the same thing in the whole stargate and everything. Uh, yeah. Um, what's weird is that, you know, the Mamma virus has a bunch of genes that Mimi virus doesn't have. So it's like, and again, don't match anything that, so they don't know what these extra ones do.

Speaker 2:          17:55          Some of them look like they're involved in building proteins, which doesn't make any sense because viruses are not supposed to do that. Huh. So it's, it's, this is all completely confusing, Huh? But then they say like, okay, um, maybe we need to kind of get away from the whole water power thing and, you know, widen our a little, where would you go? Like to the opposite of a water tower would be like the bottom of a well, or is it or do you go to a library and look in the interior of old parchment books? Now you start looking at places like 'em you look, you look in the ocean or you look in sediment or you look inside animals, um, or, or you look in the soil and they start finding giant viruses over and over and over again. Really? Yeah. In all of those places.

Speaker 2:          18:46          In oil, inside of animals, like in animals, tummies or something. Yeah. So, um, they, uh, they went to, um, these, these researchers went to Brazil and said, let's go look at animals and see if we can find giant viruses. And they found a new species in cows and they found a new species living inside of a monkey. And these were, were they finding giant or giant viruses? I mean, the numbers of genes were going up and up and they would, they would keep finding new record breakers. So, so the, the biggest one right now is called mega virus virus. I mean, there's, you know, the mega in a world you got it. That's right. It's like the truck of sorts. You know, I was like, this is like, I, I, I'm wondering what they're gonna do as they keep finding bigger ones because you keep on having to find Sapelo for these days.

Speaker 2:          19:46          Well, where was mega found and where it was workers? Meg, I believe, was found in the ocean. And how many genes does mega have? Mega has a 1000, 120 genes. Okay. So, but it's not actually the big, so it has the most jeans, but it's not actually that physically the biggest giant virus, which was, so this, this one is a called a Pandora virus in a box, in a sealed box. And then I opened it and well, it's shaped, it has this bizarre shaped like an earn a Ho, which is completely nuts. There's no urn shaped, viral, crazy. And the earn. Does that remind somebody of the myth of Pandora's box was actually an earn? Oh, it was? Okay. Oh, I see. Why is it be called Pandora's box then? God, this is a very list to make you happy because you love where they found it.

Speaker 2:          20:44          Where did they find it? So what they did, uh, these Russian scientists, they were collaborating with dug up frozen Tundra that had been frozen for 30,000 years. And they said, let's throw this out and see what's in there. What kind of things had been asleep for 30,000 years? And it sounds like the beginning of the Psi Phi movie right there, among other things, they found pendulum screws. They found Pandora virus. Huh? And they, not only did they find it, but they, when they let it warm up a bit, uh, and then they gave it some amoeba checkout. They, they did it. They did its thing. Wow. And it w how much bigger if the first a giant virus introduced us to was like an elephant sized mouse. It compared to that elephant size mouse. How much bigger is this one? Um, maybe it's more specific than you might be.

Speaker 2:          21:40          I need to look at the numbers, but you know, you're kind of going from, I don't know, elephants to dinosaurs. You're getting bigger and bigger and bigger. You're, uh, you know, we're not talking about, you know, Pandora virus is bigger than a lot of bacteria. Wow. So these things are now being found everywhere. You look. I mean, they are incredibly common. They've even been able to get giant viruses out of people. Really? Yeah. We deal with where are you find them in a person and our intestines or something. Um, I believe they found one sample in somebody's lungs. Um, and another sample was found in someone's blood, but it's really hard to tell whether they're actually like actively invading us and making us sick. You know, maybe seven reading Amoebas, they can invade human cells cause maybe on human cells are surprisingly similar. Um, or is it just kind of along for the ride with some Amoeba that infect us?

Speaker 2:          22:42          Um, or does it kind of drift in and when people are sick, their defenses are down. So we don't know if giant viruses have anything to do with human disease. But you have a category problem here. If you've got a giant virus that's virus like in it's general shell but it's making proteins, it's got a bunch of genes that viruses don't have. You're already bigger than some bacteria shouldn't be, call it as its own separate thing at this point. That's what people are, are arguing about right now. I mean do, do we keep that line between viruses and cellular life and just put the giant viruses with the viruses or do we kind of blur the line a bit? This feels like it's on its way from one category to the other. So that's, that's one of the big questions is like what way did this thing go? And evolution, what does that mean? Well, how do you get a giant virus? Like how do you, how do you, well that so, so we'll get to the potential answer to that question, which I think is totally fascinating.

Speaker 1:          25:43          Hey, Jad here. Radio labs, so we're going to return to our conversation with science writer Carl Zimmer. It's an unedited conversation. And A, we were talking about giant viruses and what they can teach us about life, which really starts with a simpler question of like, where the hell did they come from?

Speaker 2:          25:59          How do you get a giant fires? Like how do you, how do you, well that and so, so one clue comes from those jeans. So now that they're finding more and more of these giant viruses, they're finding enough, a variety of them. They can, they can look for a serious and some common genes that they share some, some common mutations in genes. And they're finding actually that, that it looks like giant viruses might actually belong to one lineage. Oh, interesting. Sure. Their cousins, they have a common ancestor. Yeah. So this tribe of us, right. And if that, if that's true, it could be an incredibly old tribe. These, these giant viruses could be a lineage, conceivably, that goes all the way back to, you know, the stages of life,

Speaker 3:          26:44          the dawn of time in order. It's really, oh, like I went back to the very beginning of life on earth, um, to that era. Yeah. Yeah. I mean maybe

Speaker 2:          26:56          when cellular life was getting started, but the question is, well, what were the giant viruses like then? Now some people have said, well no, giant virus is actually started out as teeny tiny viruses and they've just been like gathering up new genes through time and just been getting bigger and bigger, bigger. Um, but you know, a number of the people who actually study giant viruses and have really, you know, helped us to understand the most are saying, no, we don't think so. We actually think that these things started out as cellular life. They were cells, they were full blown cells.

Speaker 3:          27:34          Oh, you mean they were from the other side of the road? They were cellular life. And then what? They switched sides. They changed teams. Yeah. How, how to know that like I can't have a plant that becomes an animal. How did they, so they started off as like what we would call creatures, right. And then they started out truly alive. You know, they, they for you standing out there in the air or the water or the ground or just some like some free living microbe. Yeah. And then that could be, why would they be, why would you go demoed yourself? This is, this is your problem with parasites. You keep saying mean things about parasites. Well, how am I here that we've been talking about parasites taught you nothing. If I have a choice between being ace intake, having my own integrity and choosing to make a living on my own or to suck off you, I would just live on my own.

Speaker 3:          28:29          Excuse me for no, you like parasites, but honestly could you not use that? That passage in the recording actually it's already been cut of. So say wait a second. So you, according to this theory you have a man's true. Nevertheless, we have a micro that is, that is doing its thing and then something happens. What is the something? It becomes a parasite. It becomes a parish or at least you know maybe a symbiotic here. They basically, what it does is it starts living inside another cell. You need gives up its integrity as a, as a, as a free life form of free standing life form. Just so we understand what that means. That means that it's got a shell, it's got a border, it's making its own energy. It's replicating in the way that let the beginning at the beginning, at the beginning, it can make its own energy. It can grow, it can divide, they can do all the things that living things do. Yeah. And then for some reason it chooses to require some other creatures existence for it's own. It has, it has to become dependent on some other organism for its very, very existence. Well, let's flip it the other way. Say it discovers

Speaker 2:          29:42          a wonderful new home inside of another cell. It says, it comes in and it's like, just like, I love leaving my park off in new apartment for a dark cave and exciting opportunity. No, no, no. Oh, contrare AU. Contraire like imagine, imagine you. Like let's say, let's imagine you're like bear Grylls. Okay. Let's imagine you are like hiking around and killing your own food. Okay, let's, let's try to picture this. Okay, Robert, doing this. You're gutting your deer. You're starting your own fires. You're going on and on and on. And you do that for like a few years and then you're walking through the jungle and then very, very skinny cause it's not going well. So Robert Krulwich that the haggard hunter, um, and let's say you're doing this in Minnesota, right? So it's like cold. Okay. And then suddenly like you, you, there's a break in the forest and you come across a giant mansion and you're like, what is this place?

Speaker 2:          30:42          And you open the door and inside there's like conveyor belts with ice cream and steak and you know, and, and there are slippers waiting for you and you know, anything you need, it's somebody else's taken care of it. There is one thing you left out. When I walk into this magical kingdom, it doesn't let me out. I can't leave ever again. Sure. You can become so dependent on its natural wonders that I lose my independence, my integrity and the very, very thing that I walked in with is now gone. We did literally have this conversation a few years ago. We did. It's true. We did. And I did point out to you at the time that you are quite dependent on on other species. Do you want me to bring, yeah, no, no, no, no. But I will just, I would just say see episode 32 droughts, eyes will rule right out of their sockets.

Speaker 2:          31:40          So, so like becoming big, being able to take advantage of another cell, evolutionarily speaking is, is a great way to go because you have all these things taken care of for you. Now. Um, the, the, according to this theory, these, these mysterious, ancient, uh, microbes started going into these cells and reproducing there and then going out again and then finding another host cell to infect. Okay. Were they making like, um, where they making their hosts sick? Uh, probably, yeah, probably. Yeah, because giant viruses are not good to get. Let's see. This is, this complicates your mentioned metaphor just a tiny bit because what it means is that you go in the conveyor belt swirl and you're feeding yourself and having a good time, but then your filth starts to muck up the place and it starts to collapse from within. That doesn't sound so nice.

Speaker 2:          32:33          Strain the metaphor bed boy, go boy, Robert Frank to me, me now it's to go to him. Okay, I understand. So, so you, you spend some time in this wonderful mansion. You, you rest, it's warm, it's comfortable selling you, you, you eat with your filth, you start a family, you know, and then all of a sudden you and your descendants, you know, leave the mansion. The mansion just collapses from all the damage you did to it. But you know, actually you see in the distance there's another mansion. Let's just go over there and now you feel like rested and ready and like, yeah, that all we gotta do is get over there. So let's just go there. We don't have to, we don't have to stop to, to kill a deer. We just go to that next mansion. The ice cream is waiting. I still got to walk.

Speaker 2:          33:19          So I need my legs so to speak, to get to the next mansion. Right. But I don't need the powerful muscles that I would have needed to kill the deer. I can let you don't even, you don't need even need, you know, let's say that you're, you know, you don't even need the knowledge of how to kill a deer, wouldn't be blind, dumb and fat. So these are these things, these things turn these things they get rid of, they start getting rid of these jeans and, and how does that happen? Just, you know, a random mutation comes along and just cuts out a bit of DNA. She doesn't need them. You're fine. Yeah. You're like, no, that's okay. Is it a moment where, oh, there goes a big chunk of me gone. Yeah. I don't need that. That's a regular kind of mutation that happens all the time really in sales.

Speaker 2:          34:07          Oh yeah, yeah. But then you're, you're, your successor being just travels a little bit lighter and is able to succeed just as well. Right. So, you know, if, if, if, if, you know, if we are born, you know, with, with a part of our DNA that's deleted, that had some, you know, like hemoglobin genes in it, like goodnight, like that's bad. I mean, but um, you know, but if you cut out a gene that this giant virus no longer needs because it's got everything supplied to it and its host fine. So chuck that chuck it out. So you have this, so the idea is that you have these viruses, they're giant viruses, but they're actually been shrinking. Huh? And at a how fast does a giant, like the g imagining back in the beginning there was, there was not mega, not giant. No. In the beginning it was a cellular B. Oh, cellular.

Speaker 2:          35:03          Right. Okay. So this, I mean, privileges independent life size wise, it's a blimp. It's a massive thing. And then suddenly it starts to shrink bit by bit by bit by bit. What at what rate does it start to shrink and shed itself? Well, it could be that these giant viruses, we're finding these giant viruses that scientists are finding could be shrinking very, very, very slowly. It could be that there are other viruses that made this transition that shrank faster. So maybe, maybe it's a race to the bottom, maybe some, some, maybe some tiny viruses or just former giant viruses

Speaker 3:          35:54          that just shrank really fast. Race to the bottom. It's sure. Different way of thinking about life. You, you generally assume being a multicellular organism yourself. Yeah, that little things in some deep sense though. You're not supposed to say this. I want to be big things. You don't want to say this. I know, I know. But most people unlike you asshole, most people think that it's better to be more complex than to be simple. But here you're talking about a different voyage altogether. It might just work out for you to be simple rather than complex. Um, well, given that, that viruses

Speaker 2:          36:37          are insanely abundant on this planet, I mean there are by some estimates a 10 to the 31st power viruses on earth. I think about that. Like it's a, it's a, you know, it's a one with 31 zeros after it. I mean it's inconceivable how many viruses there are on earth. So it's their world. So apparently, you know, nature has not agreed with you, but you know, it is interesting like, uh, thinking about how, how life gets smaller and

Speaker 1:          37:11          simpler. Yeah. It's interesting. Yeah. If it's true that this trajectory is as, as, as common as you say, that that things start out sometimes start out big and then learn to live inside other things and in the process get smaller and smaller and smaller. And this is actually maybe what happens to a lot of viruses, not just sound viruses in a way it gives the virus and honorable history. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          37:35          I feel that way else. This boy isn't going to sign up for nothing. He's not going to sign up for that. And then I don't know. It's okay. I will

Speaker 2:          37:41          an honorable history, but then I mean it abandoned it's free living path, right? It did. It gave into the temptations of the mansion full of steak and ice cream. Yeah, it's true. But yeah,

Speaker 1:          37:53          always assumed, and this is not, not something wants you to seem that viruses were a kind of prodo organism. They were somehow at the beginning of something and they never quite got going. Yeah. But this, you're actually saying that these viruses are in a way at the end, not at the end, but they're at the, I don't know how to quite use the words that I want to use this. They feel somehow at the end of something, not at the beginning, like you've just took the, you just took what I considered to be the beginning and you've now made it an and an end and end. And that's interesting. I never, that's very interesting.

Speaker 2:          38:29          Yeah. Very interesting. So, so life can go in different directions.

Speaker 1:          38:33          Okay. And how far can that journey

Speaker 2:          38:36          go? I mean, can you go from like how big did that it, was it ever like a turtle with, with uh, with things or no, like a giant dinosaur? No, no, sorry. Yeah. There are things called, I believe they're called mixes zones, um, which started out as free living animals and have become parasites. And they're just down to just a few cells, maybe mixed zones. You say we didn't free living animals. You don't mean animals in the way that animals that anyone would think of an animal like a jelly. Oh look, my pet and my pet fluffy. Not like that. Well my pet jellyfish. Really? Really? Yeah. So you're saying a jellyfish size thing has now reduced itself to a tiny spec microscopic parasite of fish. Get The for, I won't even say it because you can't do it if you're that small. That's insane. It really, it's like going from something you can see and would want to avoid while swimming down to something that you might even just breathe in without even knowing it. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          39:38          wow. Oh, you're blowing my mind. Shrinking my, what was it called again? Mixes. Mixes. Zone mixes zone. Yeah. How do you spell that? M Y. X. Z. O. H. N. I'm trying in my mind to construct a scenario where we like the mix zone could begin to shed. Like if we were living inside the, like not the iPhone but the I I own the I universe. Well, you know, but, but the fact is that we, you know, we have cast aside some things, you know, what have we cast to say? Well we can't, I mean we used to smell better. I know that. I knew that I felt better. Yeah. We used to be able to make our own vitamin C in our own bodies. Our own bodies were vitamin C factories. Really? Yes. Wait, what, what changed that? Probably did we want to let go of that? That sounds great.

Speaker 2:          40:24          Sunshine, vitamin C, yeah. Making your own supply of vitamin C. Well, um, if you are sitting around eating fruit all the time, fruit, which is loaded in vitamin C, then if you get a mutation on your vitamin C gene, well in Europe you're fine cause you, you're, you, you're getting your vitamins c from somewhere else. You don't feel that lack, you know, C and you don't start getting scurvy because you're treating yourself on fruit. And then that mutated gene may then spread out and end up being in every member of your species, which seems to happen to us. I mean you can literally like see like these, we have these broken vitamin C genes. So sometimes we shrink to, yeah.

Speaker 7:          41:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          41:23          okay. So there you have it. A raw conversation with science writer Carl Zimmer about shrinking shrinkage in life. No, usually what happens these conversations is uh, cause you're just talking and cause you don't really have like an encyclopedia sitting right next to you. You get a lot of a little things wrong details, little facts, names, dates, whatever. And then you know, you fact check it later. Uh, so in fairness to Carl, as we were fact checking, we gave him the chance to listen back to the raw conversation, make a couple of amendments.

Speaker 2:          41:54          This is fact checker. Caro a scolding rambling Carl. Okay. So, okay, we were saying that, um, this is microbiologist, uh, Tim Robotham took his samples to France, but actually there was another microbiologist named Richard Bertles that did it. Um, Gotcha. Small but important. Sorry Richard. My, our apologies. Yeah. And Mama virus turns out to have a thousand, 23 genes, not 1,059 genes going. Apologies. Then I started talking about echo virus. At the time in 2011, it was indeed the biggest virus known 1000, 120 genes. Okay. Okay. However, there was in 2013 a another virus found, um, called Pandora virus. Now I was saying that this was something found this had Green Tundra wrong. This was found the ocean and this virus has oh lot of genes. How many I had has 2,500. Whoa. 2,500. I mean, that's way more than a lot of bacteria.

Speaker 1:          43:02          Also a it at a certain point. And we do refer to Pandora virus as being the biggest virus in size actually. That uh, that distinction goes to hippo virus. And, uh, also it seems that since we talked, there's evidence that there might actually be a couple separate lineages of giant viruses. One may have evolved from big to small as we talked about, but another one might have gone in the usual direction from small to big.

Speaker 2:          43:27          Um, there's one last thing that I see. So apparently, uh, apparently I didn't quite spell mixes zone correct. This is how you spell mixes zone. M Y, X. O. Z. O. A. N. Apparently I missed one of those. Those I can remember. I mean, I would be lying if I say I didn't think a little bit less of, you know. Okay. Extra. Oh, back in the raw stupidity that goes into radio lab. Yeah. Stupid people interviewing stupid people about smart things. That's funny. That's a great taglines, dude.

Speaker 1:          44:07          Okay. Uh, that's our new tagline. I'm Chad IPM. Rod, thanks for listening.
