00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.544
Now you've got your
chance to use this scale

00:00:03.544 --> 00:00:05.210
to figure out how
much something weighs.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.310
So we're asked, how much
does Old Spice Man weigh?

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.750
We have Old Spice Man,
this little guy here, plus

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.900
you have 3 blocks.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.316
So on the left-hand
side, you have

00:00:14.316 --> 00:00:15.746
Old Spice Man plus 3 blocks.

00:00:15.746 --> 00:00:17.370
And you see that the
scale is balanced.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.170
On the right hand side,
you have 8 blocks.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.049
So Old Spice Man plus
3 is equal to 8 blocks.

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:25.090
And you can see what
happens when we do something

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.950
to one side of the
scale or another.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.060
If we were to take a block
from the right-hand side, all

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.100
of a sudden, the right-hand
side becomes lighter

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.260
and it tilts up.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.140
And our scale is
no longer balanced,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.090
and we can no longer
say that the left

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.540
and the right-hand
side is equal.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.390
And there's an explanation
of it below here.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.464
So what we want to do
is add or remove blocks

00:00:43.464 --> 00:00:44.880
from the left or
right-hand sides.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.480
So essentially we're
just left with Old Spice

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.900
Man on the left-hand side,
but the scale is balanced.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.540
So whatever is on
the right-hand side

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.150
is how much he weighs in blocks.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.530
So let's see if we can do that.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.050
So let me add that block back.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.810
That's where we started from.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.060
So let's see, I want
to get rid of these 3.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.450
So if I take 1 away
from the left-hand side,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.209
well, I can't just do it there,
because now, all of a sudden,

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.410
the left-hand side is too light.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.020
So I'm going to have to take 1
away from the right-hand side

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.160
as well.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.270
Well, let me do it again.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.770
Take 1 away from
the left-hand side.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.860
We'll have to do 1 from the
right-hand side as well.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.720
And I'm getting close-- 1
from the left-hand side,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.160
now 1 from the right-hand side.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.520
And it is a balanced.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.100
Old Spice Man is
equal to 5 blocks.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.470
And you see what happened
here algebraically.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.700
I took 1 from the left
and right-hand side.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.830
I did it 3 times.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.500
So we started with
essentially Old Spice Man,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.720
or you could call it x, plus 3.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.480
But then we ended up subtracting
3 from the left-hand side

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.740
and subtracting 3 from
the right-hand side.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.400
So we subtracted the same
number from both sides

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.250
to get the weight
of Old Spice Man.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.490
And we could check
it right over here.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.680
And very good.
