JONATHAN BERI: Hi, and welcome
to this week's Google

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.910
Developers Live.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.070
My name is Jonathan Beri.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.040
I'm a developer advocate
for Google+.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.090
And with me is--

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.630
JOANNA SMITH: I'm Joanna Smith,
and I'm a developer

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.550
programs engineer.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.710
And I'm really happy to be
kicking off 2013 Google+

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.320
Developers Live.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.710
JONATHAN BERI: Awesome.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.290
Yes it is.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.410
It's also a kickoff up for
our new platform--

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.610
the next generation of the
Google+ Platform, and a major

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.780
leap for developers.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.320
Today we introduce Google+
Sign-in, which is a simple and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.530
secure way for users to sign
into your apps, both on the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.750
web and in mobile.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.060
Leveraging the power of Google+,
integrating it deeply

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.960
applications, as well as some
other magic that we are

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.300
introducing with this release.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.520
So we're super excited
about it.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.570
JOANNA SMITH: It's
really cool.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.710
And to show you guys-- so you
can visualize how this is

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.200
going to look-- we actually have
a demo that we wanted to

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.550
show you to kick off
today's episode.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.160
And the most important thing
to notice as we go to our

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.319
website is the shiny,
red button.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.535
We're very proud of our Sign-in
with Google button.

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:08.785
JONATHAN BERI: So we have
a quick link here.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.210
JOANNA SMITH: And so
when you go to--

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.810
as a developer, you can offer
this button in your app, on

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.470
mobile-- iOS, or Android--
or on your website.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.180
And any user can just come to
your site like normal, see the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.720
button, and decide to connect
their profile, which will open

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.960
an authentication dialog where
they can enter their

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.480
credentials.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.360
Or if they're already logged
in to Google, they can just

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.180
continue with the
authorization.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.550
What's really great about this
dialogue, though, is it makes

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.680
it very clear for the user
to see how they can

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.300
control their privacy.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.420
JONATHAN BERI: So I have
this dialogue open.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.780
Why don't you walk us through
what we're seeing right now?

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.410
JOANNA SMITH: So there's
a list of every bit of

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.920
information that an
application is

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.240
asking for the user.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.320
And they can actually control
not only which friends are

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.020
going to see their app activity,
but which friends

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.440
that app can see.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.400
So if a user decides to regulate
that, they can

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.400
actually choose which circles
gets sent to that app.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.040
And maybe restrict it down.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.419
So maybe they have some people
in their circles that they

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.810
don't necessarily want being
involved with them on this

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.450
application, because it's
just not relevant.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.910
And they can control that.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.090
JONATHAN BERI: So I'm going to
remove my family circle, just

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.840
because they don't take
really good pictures.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.850
JOANNA SMITH: Yeah,
they're terrible.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.310
And then we're going to--

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.600
and then you can also control
which circles get to see any

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.230
content generated by this
app, which is great.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.140
If you maybe don't necessarily
want to share photos with your

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.840
sister, because she likes
to steal them all--

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.430
so we'll go ahead and
take her out.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.420
JONATHAN BERI: And these are
called App Activities.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.870
JOANNA SMITH: And it also makes
it really easy for you

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.900
to decide you don't want
to share anything.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.660
And you can go ahead at
the very top level

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.160
and choose Only Me.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.030
And I think that's a really
powerful thing for the user.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.920
And it makes it really easy for
the developer, because you

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.640
don't have to do anything
to allow this.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.190
JONATHAN BERI: And one great use
case for users-- and why

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.200
we provide this as
a clear option--

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.900
is if a particular application
is for your personal use.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.780
Maybe it's a fitness
application.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.510
And you may not want to share
all the activities you're

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.020
doing within that fitness
application, but you do want

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.940
that record.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.350
This is a great option for
those type of users.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.510
JOANNA SMITH: So it's really
great altogether.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.880
And then once they actually
authenticate, we have a really

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.250
powerful option where if you
have an Android device, you

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.530
can auto-install the application
on the user's

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.260
Android phone just by
having them log in.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.480
JONATHAN BERI: And this
is from the website.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.010
We're not going to a
different store to

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.270
initiate this process.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.620
This is from Photo Hunt's
application.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.070
JOANNA SMITH: It's the same pop
up that they're already

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.340
seeing to continue
their login.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.130
And they can just choose right
now-- oh, yeah, I do want this

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.670
on my phone.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.410
This is really simple.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.850
They don't have to search
through the Play store.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.520
They don't have to go through
any extra hoops.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.360
It's right there, and
it's really simple.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.510
So let's go ahead and add
it to our demo account.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.330
JONATHAN BERI: So I'm going
to hit install.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.710
It says it's downloading.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.100
JOANNA SMITH: So while that
downloads, we'll go ahead and

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.440
look at the website.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.500
Now if you notice the demo
account is signed in-- it's

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.130
personalized.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.120
We've got the profile picture.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.380
We've got their name.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.330
You can welcome them
to the site.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.930
And then you can also
show them their

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.040
friends along the side.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.620
We have a list of friends
are also using this app.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.220
JONATHAN BERI: So this is
actually a new feature that

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.690
we've introduced with
the sign-in button.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:12.910
JOANNA SMITH: Friend's list--

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.580
the list of people in
a circle has not

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.980
previously been available.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.180
It's important to note that
this is still a flat list.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.630
You cannot see the user's
actual circles.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.430
But you can see who they've
included in

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.820
their social sphere.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.350
JONATHAN BERI: That's super
powerful to make social proof

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.240
as part of your application.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.880
JOANNA SMITH: Definitely.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.600
And it can help you if you also
have support for a social

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.910
graph within your
app natively.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.520
You can start using this to
connect users that already

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.680
have accounts with you.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.860
So let's go ahead and
go to the phone.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.045
Is it still installing?

00:04:42.045 --> 00:04:43.780
JONATHAN BERI: I think
it may still be--

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.140
JOANNA SMITH: Did we
get a notification?

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.655
JONATHAN BERI: We didn't.

00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:49.610
JOANNA SMITH: Are we on Wi-Fi?

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.790
JONATHAN BERI: We're on Wi-Fi.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.970
JOANNA SMITH: Well, let's go
ahead and talk about a

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.090
different feature while
we wait for the

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.210
internet to catch up.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.980
So the other thing that I'm
really excited about,

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.200
personally, from this launch,
is the ability to use an

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.910
interactive post.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.870
And this is very similar to
what we already have.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.760
It's a share that's
been expanded to

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.300
have additional features.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.740
So now, in addition to that
normal share [INAUDIBLE], you

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.530
might start seeing in your
stream a share with a button.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.840
And this button has a verb--
some sort of call to action.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.260
And that button can pull a user
from the Google+ stream

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.880
into your application.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.420
JONATHAN BERI: So lets go ahead
and create one of these

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.060
interactive posts.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.820
Right here, this is a
button, actually.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.880
It's part of the application--

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.210
the Photo Hunt application.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.580
And there's a JavaScript API, so
you can scan it and make it

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.220
integrated with your
application.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.360
So the user flow is nice.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.090
I did a vote.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.006
Which, in this case, I didn't do
an interactive post, but I

00:05:43.006 --> 00:05:44.075
can go ahead and promote it.

00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:46.520
So why don't you tell us
what's going on here?

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.410
JOANNA SMITH: So at this, when
we're soliciting votes for our

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.660
friends as well, because we
really like this photo, we are

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.850
presented with a dialogue.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.400
And this dialogue-- like I
said, it's built off the

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.490
existing share.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.000
But now we've got the
button that's there.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.960
And as a developer, you
can control that

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.830
text on that button.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.030
You get to choose that string.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.570
And we have, I think,
over 100 right now.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.650
We have a lot of different
options, and we're taking more

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.060
suggestions as we move along.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.230
The other thing that is
incredibly powerful is you can

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.260
prefill the text in the
share dialogue.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.660
I think that's already been
done here with Photo Hunt.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.450
So you can get the user started
with maybe what you

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.080
most want to promote from this
part of your application.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.430
You can also prefill up
to 10 recipients.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.340
So they won't be tagged in the
post, but they'll be directly

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.930
shared with.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.575
So it will trigger a
notification on their end.

00:06:35.575 --> 00:06:39.270
JONATHAN BERI: And a powerful
part of including users

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.310
already in the post.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.840
So prefilling recipients.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.040
Part of Google and Google+ is
our notification system.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.050
And when you explicitly mention
a user-- or sorry,

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.730
include them in a share--

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.600
we notify them across all
Google properties.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.710
So anywhere you see that little
red box, that will

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.260
light up for those
particular users.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.920
Because the user who's allowing
this prefill has the

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.350
intent to actually deliver
that message.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.110
So we have a guaranteed
delivery.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.370
And if those recipients also
have email configured for

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.050
notifications, they'll get
an email if they're

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.350
not by their desktop.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.250
And you can actually prefill
with email addresses.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.180
So if those users have a Google+
but maybe not using

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.860
the app, or they haven't signed
up for Google+, yet

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.220
they'll get that user flow and
can even upgrade which is

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.430
pretty powerful to get more
users using your app.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.260
JOANNA SMITH: What's also
powerful is that if they are

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.650
mentioned, or if the user
stumbles across your

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.270
application's interactive person
that a different user

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.630
has shared, when they click
on that, they may be

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.820
taken to your app.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.670
But if they haven't already
signed up for your app,

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.740
they'll be taken first to an
authentication screen so that

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.800
they can sign up.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.190
And also they can install the
application onto their phone

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.830
directly through the
identification screen, just

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:45.650
like before.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.150
So there's a lot of different
entry points for a user to

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.110
make their way into your
app from the Google+.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.010
JONATHAN BERI: So I'm going to
actually complete that share.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.476
And so now it should
be posting.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.010
JOANNA SMITH: I think we might
have forgotten to log into a

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.340
second demo account, but we'll
just look at it on the stream

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.010
of this one.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.360
JONATHAN BERI: Sure.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.610
Sure.

00:08:09.115 --> 00:08:10.090
There we go.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.690
This is the post we
just created.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:13.410
JOANNA SMITH: So you
can see, it's

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.920
actually incredibly engaging.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.260
Because not only can users share
something that they care

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.720
about with the people in their
circles, but now the people in

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.600
their circles are involved
in that action.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.440
They can choose to go into the
app and create their own

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.865
shares, or maybe they can do the
same action within the app

00:08:28.865 --> 00:08:30.160
and start interacting there.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.010
And so I think it's a really,
really engaging way to let

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.100
your users interact.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.960
JONATHAN BERI: And ask their
friends to join them.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.159
That's the whole point of
an interactive post.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.520
It's about bringing your friends
who are across Google+

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.490
into your app in a way
that they can start

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:47.680
interacting with it.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.340
That's where the interactivity
comes from.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.310
And so we saw the preview
of the interactive post.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.200
And now this is what
users would see

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.570
on the desktop stream.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.030
I'm going to click
on that post.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.830
And what's happening when
I click on that post?

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.340
You see that I open
up the app.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.810
And what's unique about
this is the URL--

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.700
that I was deep linked
back into the app.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.520
JOANNA SMITH: So we actually
enabled the deep link

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.320
functionality last fall,
and a few of our clever

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.660
developers caught it.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.680
But it's really, really
compelling.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.493
Because not only is a user taken
to your app, but they're

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:23.440
taken into your app, to a
particular part-- a particular

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.570
photo, or maybe particular
song.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.450
And that is the part that
they cared about.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.080
And so they get to skip the rest
and already be involved.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.420
And that's more likely to keep
a user in your app and grow

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.900
your user base.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.830
JONATHAN BERI: And another
powerful thing about deep

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.130
linking is support across
all platforms.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.290
So web, Android, iOS.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.680
So if a user is using an Android
application and they

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.510
share it to their friends who
happen to be on a desktop, the

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.900
deep link will take the user
to that desktop version.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.000
And now if another one of their
friends is on iOS, it

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.770
will know and will take
them to be iOS app.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:54.910
JOANNA SMITH: And this is part
of the Google magic.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.750
You don't have to initiate the
support for these different

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.920
deep links to determine which
one is the appropriate one.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.920
We do that for you.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.770
You just have to provide
the links.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.240
JONATHAN BERI: And a neat thing,
especially here-- we

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.540
talked over-the-air install.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.490
But with deep links, if a user
doesn't have your application

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.150
installed already, we will take
them to the app store.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.940
And on Android, once they've
completed the download, we'll

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.410
take them back the deep
link that they

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.350
intended to click on.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.470
So follow all the way through,
and you just got

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:22.500
a new mobile user.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.620
JOANNA SMITH: Our goal is to
make sure that you don't lose

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.610
users along the way.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.230
We want to make sure that they
are interested in your app.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.950
And they make it all the way to
the point that they wanted

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.430
to be, even if they have to
detour through authentication

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.330
or installation.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.520
So it did it ever install?

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.690
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah,
I believed in did.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.500
JOANNA SMITH: So let's go
ahead and look at that.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.150
And like I said, this is
really compelling.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.000
Because they don't have to do
anything on the phone in order

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.870
to make this happened.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.570
I chose this when I
authenticated, and now I have

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.950
a notification telling me my
download's ready to go, and I

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:50.380
can start using.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.850
JONATHAN BERI: So first thing
you'll notice is that

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:52.380
notification.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.800
I haven't dismissed it yet.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.710
That is what a user would see.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.550
So they actually get to
see the rich icons

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:59.530
from the Play Store.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.480
Your service notification
is installed.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.540
And like many apps,
it gets installed

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.690
onto your home screen.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.170
And just to show you
that it works--

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:12.090
hopefully our wi-fi
is back up--

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:16.060
I can sign in using a native
Android sign in.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:20.380
Pick the account.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.860
And then you can see we have
that same off process.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.890
JOANNA SMITH: And it's the
exact same dialogue.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.270
A little more compact for the
phone, but it's all of the

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.630
same features that I
already mentioned.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.690
It can still control both which
people in our circles

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.890
the app sees, and which app
activities are seen by people

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.080
in their circles.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.180
It's great.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.860
So that's Photo Hunt.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.400
And for developers, throughout
the day we're going to be

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.170
releasing new samples to
help you get started.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.690
And one of those is actually
the back end for

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:55.480
the Phone Hunt app.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.570
And we want you to be able
to see a full end-to-end

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.570
integration.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.320
That might help you figure out
how you can best integrate

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.300
Google+ Sign-In with
your existing app.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.430
And so look forward to seeing
this today, and also in

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.810
multiple languages
in the future.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.040
JONATHAN BERI: So now that
we actually saw what we

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.350
introduced today at a high
level, I just wanted to run

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.320
through, pretty quickly, all the
different features and the

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.160
way a developer might
approach it.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.185
So things they need to know
to actually integrate.

00:12:21.185 --> 00:12:25.510
And I have a quick deck that
goes over each piece by piece.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.660
So Google+ Sign-in--

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:28.910
simplified sign-in.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.400
The first thing to note
is that we take

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.100
privacy very seriously.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.720
You saw with the circles picker
and app activities how

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.200
a user can control who and what
sees their activities and

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.830
their user data.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.780
We also take revoking data and
deleting data very seriously

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.570
in our terms of service
and provide APIs to

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.890
simplify that process.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.590
So if a user does not want
to be connected with an

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.310
application anymore we,
help and enable that.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.100
So the developer can
facilitate that.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.500
JOANNA SMITH: You can see this
in Photo Hunt, because after

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.070
we signed in, the Sign
Up button became

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:02.860
a Disconnect button.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.880
And it was a very clear and very
obvious at the top level,

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.180
how to remove yourself
from an app.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.300
JONATHAN BERI: And we also make
the integration pretty

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.550
easy if you have an
existing sign-in.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.970
Really, it's just adding column
to your database,

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.400
merging with your existing
homegrown solution--

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.100
where there will be other
social networking.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.470
And we have a bunch of showcases
on our site that

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:28.480
talk about the integration
process for launch partners

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.770
and how quickly they're able
to integrate with their

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.340
existing solutions.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.890
And ultimately, this is about
giving users choice and making

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.320
it easier for you to acquire
those users.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.970
If they have a preferred social
network, this will

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.710
basically help you onboard
than quickly and easily.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.920
So, going to go at a little
bit of code and show you

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.780
actually what you have to
implement these features,

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.110
starting with web.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.870
For anybody's who's used the
Google platform before, we

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.736
start out with a plug-in.

00:13:57.736 --> 00:14:00.340
In the same fashion of our
previous plug-ins, you put a

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.300
little JavaScript on your page,
put a little bit of mark

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.780
up, and we render a stylized
and configurable button.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.600
It's just that simple.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.850
From that point on, we
handle the OAuth.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.640
We handle the authorization
pop-ups.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.380
And then you can go ahead and
integrate those tokens and

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.280
APIs within your application.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.900
The basics is literally, you
give us a client ID that

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.310
you've created through our
Google APIs console.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:29.160
Maybe requests some scopes,
like a login scope, and

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.960
activities you might
want to write.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.660
On the Android side, it's
native to Android.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.950
We worked with the Android team
to make sure that our STK

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.250
is comfortable and easy to
integrate for Android

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:40.770
developers.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.230
So you would add the button
to your layout.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.560
Initialize a plus client-- an
object that allows you to make

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.600
API calls, including sign in.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.590
And then register on connected
call back.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.120
And once that's fired, you can
go ahead and actually start

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:56.970
getting user data.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.080
It's just that simple.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.770
We have starter applications
that show how little code it

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.000
actually takes to make a
full-fledged Sign-in button.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.640
JOANNA SMITH: And our goal this
entire time was to make

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.600
it very easy for you
to implement.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.445
There shouldn't be a
lot of hoops and a

00:15:10.445 --> 00:15:11.280
dance, so to speak.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.320
We've heard feedback from
you that OAuth has been

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:13.780
challenging.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.100
So we worked really hard
to make it very simple.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.630
So look for these code snippets
throughout the

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:18.430
documentation.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.890
And also look at the samples as
they become available today

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.270
to really see what's going on.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.800
To see a full integration.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.640
JONATHAN BERI: That's
a good point.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.140
And moving along, we've also
done the same sort of heavy

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.890
lifting for you on iOS.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.600
This is an SDK.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.120
It allows you to go ahead and
instantiate and create a

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.450
delegator for your object.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.440
And then make the API calls
against the Sign-in button.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:50.580
And more on responding to that
call back-- now I have a user.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.620
Now, the future that was
really exciting to

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.130
developers--

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.350
especially Android
developers--

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.160
is the over-the-air install,
which we demoed.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.220
It allows you to push your
Android app directly from your

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.790
website, without taking the user
to a different context,

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.270
and having it magically
appear on their phone.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.050
With little overhead except for
confirming whether or not

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.580
they want to approve
such an action.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.280
It's no more than modifying
your sign-in button.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.050
All you have to do is register
your app package on Google's

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.170
API council and in the
Sign-in button.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.390
And we take care of
the rest for you.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.870
And we also make sure that
a user can dismiss it--

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.130
that we don't nag them with
multiple prompts if

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.000
they don't want it.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.930
And for the user, it
seems natural.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.100
With the sign-in button,
we also make it

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.490
pretty easy to register.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.580
Because you can integrate that
button, you can stylize it and

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.600
make it look--

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.580
along with our branding
guidelines--

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.830
natural within your app.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.950
So just looking at
the code, it's

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:51.450
really just a web feature.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:55.080
So all we've done is added
a new element--

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.520
the app packaging.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.370
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:58.360
to the Sign-in button.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:58.990
And that's it.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.870
Once the link's there, we
take care of the rest.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.710
It's partly the dialogue,
and the user

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.180
just gets that prompt.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.550
JOANNA SMITH: It should
not be difficult.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.349
And if you are having any
difficulty, let us know

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.859
immediately, because it's
probably a simple fix.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:14.060
And we've probably dealt
with it already.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.710
JONATHAN BERI: The other thing
that I'm showing here too,

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.960
which is a little nuance-- we
also support a way to use your

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.180
own button.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.730
And this is a very important
feature that, when we were

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.119
designing this product, we heard
loud and clear from our

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:26.079
launch partners.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.190
That as long as they can
follow our branding

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.910
guidelines, they'd like to use
their own span or stylize the

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:31.970
button in a different way.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.440
So by doing this similar but
different mark up, you can get

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.330
that same effect.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.210
JOANNA SMITH: And you
can still use the

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.220
over-the-air install.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.220
That ability is not
lost because you

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.920
used a custom button.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.160
JONATHAN BERI: Exactly.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.630
And now, the user's signed in.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.030
We also have APIs to take
advantage of the user data

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.330
that they've authorized
with you.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.340
And that's where you can
customize your app to add

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:56.540
social data and customization.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.350
You can take their user
profile information--

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.390
this is very similar to the
APIs we have today.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:02.470
Nothing's changed there.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.190
We've now enabled more data.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.510
You can ask the user for their
email, for example--

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.270
their age range, their preferred
speaking language.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.920
And you can integrate that into
your application to make

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.970
sure that it's welcoming and
it's tailored to them.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.480
You can also use that data for
people in their circles.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.710
So when two people are connected
on Google+ sign into

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.560
an app, you can show social
proof and help them discover

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.460
contact their friends might be
interested or acting on, and

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.525
service that to make it
more discoverable.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.660
Now how to you add that
personalization.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.270
I'm going to run through this
a little bit quickly.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.740
This is a snippet of JavaScript
for anybody's user

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.760
APIs today.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.940
It's the same API and points.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.200
The same JavaScript
Client Library.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.340
The same Python Client
Library.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.930
It's the same Java
Client Library.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.980
And it's just now, we get more
data if it's available.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.140
So if you have an integration
today, it's a

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.080
pretty smooth upgrade.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.540
Almost no change except
to handle more good

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.610
stuff to work with.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.800
On Android, it's again--

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.310
you get these from the
connected call back.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:10.420
You may be able to request a
listener and get the user data

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.980
and display that.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.530
And in iOS, very similar.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.620
You do use a Plus service
to go ahead and to get

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.740
that same user data.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.880
JOANNA SMITH: So this user
data is still data that

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.940
they've made publicly available,
with a few

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:25.530
exceptions.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.630
We include age range
and region.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:30.130
JONATHAN BERI: Locale.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:30.930
JOANNA SMITH: Locale.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.100
JONATHAN BERI: So their
preferred speaking language.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.090
And of course there's a separate
a scope for email, is

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.250
if the explicitly
request that.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.660
We don't want to give it
away for no reason.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.970
But once you do we, we
also provide you the

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.910
user's Google email.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.860
JOANNA SMITH: And we have that
scope in our documentation, so

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.850
you don't have to look around
or hunt for it.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.990
It's all very clear for you.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.320
So you can make sure
your development

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.650
process is very simple.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.690
JONATHAN BERI: And the neat
thing about scopes in the

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:58.370
Google+ Sign-in experience on
web and Android and iOS is we

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:00.890
combined that into a single
off dialogue.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.120
So if you add another scope
from Google-- for example,

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.220
let's say it's Drive
or it's Calendar--

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.840
that'll be combined with
the same scope.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.040
It's to be clearly highlighted
what that scope and what data

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.440
the user's providing.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.230
And they can choose to approve
or deny that prompt.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.370
JOANNA SMITH: Excatly.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.610
They should not have to sign
in multiple times.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.720
JONATHAN BERI: Now, one of the
newer features-- and one that

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.900
we could spend a lot of
time talking about--

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.380
is interactive posts.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.840
It's a way to capture users in
the stream with this powerful

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.930
call to action that deep links
back into your app.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:36.320
And it allows you to invite
friends to engage, maybe

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.190
connect on their network
or their site or

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.610
vote up and vote down.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.830
It also allows you to control
the messaging that's seen in

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:45.800
the stream.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.360
So we talked about
prefilling tags.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.120
We talked about the call to
action, choosing different

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.390
labels for that action--

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.210
I have a little snippet of
what you have there.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.920
And also because it's
shared on Google+,

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.070
we have a rich snippet.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:02.810
So you can control the text and
the content and all the

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:03.570
description.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.180
And really have your app
presented and make it

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.590
appealing for people in their
circles to click back.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.810
Now that deep link is
pretty powerful.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:17.020
You can control where
the user goes.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.490
And there's a little
bit of nuances.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.680
For example, you could
have a content URL.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:26.560
So if it's a TV show, the
content URL might be the

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.555
station-- or sorry, the
episode, or series.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.060
And the deep link might be
a particular episode.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.020
So the user might want to click
on-- well, I see this

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.320
thing for Photo Hunt, but
I'm not quite sure

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.120
what Photo Hunt is.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.900
So it'll take them to the
Photo Hunt content URL.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.030
And then if they actually click
on the button, it'll

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.740
take them to the deep links and
maybe actually the photo.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.100
JOANNA SMITH: So the user can
really explore your app

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.000
through a variety of gateways.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.457
JONATHAN BERI: And definitely,
once they get familiar with

00:21:53.457 --> 00:21:56.250
your app and they've seen your
app a few times in the stream,

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.750
they'll probably click right
on the deep link and go

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:58.710
directly into your app.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:02.930
And these are qualified users
who really want to engage.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.810
So the little bit
of code on web.

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:10.870
It is basically an extension
of the share model.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.660
The pop-up that we saw is very
similar to the existing share

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.540
box that we have today, through
the share link and

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.360
share plug-in.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.690
And now we have one for creating
interactive posts.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:20.620
JOANNA SMITH: One
thing to note--

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.860
even though it is an extension
of the existing share model,

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.760
you do need to make sure you
have the plus.login scope,

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.970
which is our new scope, in order
to use the interactive

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:29.950
functionality.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:30.620
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.090
It is [INAUDIBLE] assign it, and
it allows us to do all the

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:35.180
magic of routing and going
cross platform.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.540
But it's a minor delta
to get this enabled.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.410
And then you have to have a
client ID, which is new.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:44.350
And you can use for us but for
facilitating all that and all

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:46.800
the configuration options-- the
prefilled tax the content

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.920
URL deep links, and
things like that.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.750
But otherwise, it's a simple
JavaScript call, and you can

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:56.320
create custom UI to integrate
within your application.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.090
And similarly Android,
it's an intent.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.800
Very simple, straightforward
intent.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.900
It's like our share intent that
allows you to add those

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:04.560
more options.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.530
You create an intent builder,
and you can basically start

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.850
that activity on result.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.620
And easy to handle
the response.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.120
So when the user comes back
from the stream, have a

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.830
handler for the intent, and then
you can take them exactly

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:21.305
where they intended to go.

00:23:21.305 --> 00:23:22.290
Intent for the intention.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:23.400
JOANNA SMITH: We chose
our words carefully.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.460
Now we're out of synonyms.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:28.500
JONATHAN BERI: And sharing on
iOS is also very similar.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.190
You just create a shared
dialogue and

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:31.440
you're good to go.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.030
And App Activity is another
feature that we've taken out

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.240
of developer preview, which we
previously called History.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.360
But the core of it is allow
you to write activities to

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.340
Google about what your users
are doing within your

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.230
application.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.560
And then make your app more
engaging, and we engage those

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.790
users and take them
back to your app.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:56.660
We have very simple integration
today, where you

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.110
can see all the activities
that you've

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.330
done on your profile.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.525
And then depending on how you've
authorized permission,

00:24:02.525 --> 00:24:04.440
you can control who sees that.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.160
JOANNA SMITH: And one thing that
we've heard is that both

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.650
developers and users are
concerned about the idea of

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:13.820
being viewed as "spammy." And
so the app activities do not

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.530
surface on the user stream.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:16.790
They have their own--

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:21.020
very prominent, but their own
separate part of Google+.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.080
And that's what a user can
go and browse and see

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:23.880
what's going on.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.240
And they can see which App
Activities from their friends

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.400
and similar apps that they have,
assuming that all the

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.380
promotions have been granted.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.690
And it's a very engaging place,
but separate from the

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:38.450
stream, so nobody feels
overwhelmed by App Activities.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.970
JONATHAN BERI: Exactly.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.230
And if it's one of those--

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.620
if you've authorized only you,
for example, you may be the

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.590
only one who ever sees this.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.580
So you won't have to worry about
every run you've ever

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.630
done or every song you've
ever listened to

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.080
show up in the stream.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.240
But if you do have, let's say,
foodie friends, all the

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.360
restaurants you go
to might show up.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.360
They can go ahead and see
that on your profile.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.070
I mentioned this as part
of our history preview.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:01.560
It has now been promoted as
part of Google+ Sign-in.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.690
We've also introduced the
ability to write activities,

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:06.470
read activities, and then
also delete activities.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:09.010
So really manage the
relationship between your app

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.255
and Google, and how it surfaces
to the users.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.520
And writing is just like our
RESTful APIs before, and

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.660
native on different platforms.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.140
Simple API call.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.680
This is using JavaScript.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.060
Of course, you can use any of
our support client libraries

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.290
and write your own.

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:29.240
On Android, very simple.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.050
You create an ItemScope
builder.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:31.650
You build it.

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.160
And it writes that through
Google Play Services.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.610
So you make that simple
and easy.

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:40.090
In iOS, we have a builder there
too that you can write

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:43.110
for activities.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.040
And a little bit more.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.790
That's it.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:51.470
That's the 10,000 foot--

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:52.770
what we're launching
for developers.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:53.760
JOANNA SMITH: Well,
10,002 feet.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.920
Two things I want to say.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.010
One is with disconnect,
we've made it--

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:00.010
one, it's required by our terms
of service that you

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:01.850
offer your users a way
to disconnect.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.560
But if that's hard for them to
find or they don't want to go

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.430
into your app, we've made
it really easy for them.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.210
And they can view that at
plus.google.com/apps.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.270
And they can see all of the apps
that they are connected

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:15.940
with, in addition to maybe
controlling which activities

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.700
they want to service, or which
ones they might want to

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.930
disconnect from.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:21.890
And a disconnect isn't
permanent.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.660
They can always come back and
re-authenticate into your

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.660
application as well.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:25.900
JONATHAN BERI: I'm actually
going to and

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.460
demo that right now.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.690
JOANNA SMITH: So this page is
very simple to get to and very

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:30.760
engaging for the users.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.050
And so you can know that without
too much extra work

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:36.820
from you, they have a clear
way to communicate.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.270
But you do still need to offer
them a way to disconnect in

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:41.220
order to be compliant.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.240
And then the other thing I
wanted to talk about were

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.960
Google+ Insights.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.140
And so we have a few new
metrics added to our

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.510
analytics, where you can
actually track some of these

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:55.920
new features and see how your
application is getting traffic

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.650
or changing the way that the
user's behave because of these

00:26:58.650 --> 00:26:59.250
new features.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.510
And so you should definitely go
out and connect your Plus

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:06.820
Page ID with your Dove Console
client ID and your project ID,

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.490
and you'll be able to start
seeing these things.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.720
JONATHAN BERI: And they actually
make it really easy.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.510
Go to your Plus page.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:13.140
You'll see Platform Insights.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.110
You basically get the client--

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:19.370
the profile ID connected
with your project.

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.110
And once that link's
established, you can start

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.130
seeing all the different pieces
of data that may be

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:25.930
either hard or impossible to
do with existing Analytics,

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.610
because it's from deep
within our system.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:29.890
So over-the-air installs,
interactive posts--

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:30.225
all those.

00:27:30.225 --> 00:27:32.080
And those are going to get
better over time as well.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.610
JOANNA SMITH: So we're really
excited to see how this goes.

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.130
And we'd love to
hear from you.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:39.240
Can you think of any other
features we should talk about?

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:39.500
JONATHAN BERI: No.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.610
I think we should
go to questions.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:41.340
JOANNA SMITH: So we
actually have

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.530
several questions already.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:45.060
And I'm really excited
about this.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.190
And so the first one is
from Paul Erickson.

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.400
And I think it's actually
two questions, just

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.440
from reading it.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.550
But the first is more abstract,
so I'm going to let

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:53.120
you take it.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.270
Which is, "How does this new
platform affect Google's role

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:58.770
as an identity provider?"

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.020
JONATHAN BERI: That's
a good question.

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:04.140
So at Google, we've provided
different identity solutions

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.660
for a long time.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.440
Definitely this is the next
big step for Google as an

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.530
identity provider.

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:12.250
We think this is going to be
very powerful for developers

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:16.860
to rely on Google as a secure
and safe way to let the users

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.520
basically enjoy their apps.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.260
For us, this is basically
our big bet.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.970
We hope you all adopt this as
your Google sign in solution

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.650
for Google+ Sign-In.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.230
JOANNA SMITH: And then the
second part of your question--

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:31.970
which was related, but I think
it actually hints at a bit of

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.050
confusion--

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:36.820
is wondering about how a
verified identity doesn't

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:40.230
appear to be used consistently
or tied back into things like

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:43.340
maintaining credit card
information or the other

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.965
authentication options
that Google offers.

00:28:44.965 --> 00:28:46.930
So I was wondering, Jonathan,
do you want to clarify a

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:48.960
little on what a verified
identity means?

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.130
What that check mark next
to a profile means?

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.580
JONATHAN BERI: So it also
depends on if it's a user or

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.130
if it's a page, and
if it's a website.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:02.970
So verified it just means that
Google has found out if this

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.410
is a real user or if there's--
let's say they have

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.530
relationship with Google.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:07.760
They said hey, this
is my account.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.810
There's other people who have
similar names and are

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:10.800
impersonating me.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.060
And for us, that's just to help
users discover the right

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.550
celebrity or the right
president.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.150
It's mostly just a flag.

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:21.080
JOANNA SMITH: It's basically
meant to help users so that

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.655
anyone who might be confused
or impersonated is covered.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.050
And then one other thing that
I think we should mention

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:33.810
about Google's roles as an
identity provider is that

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:35.850
Jonathan mentioned that
this is our big bet.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:39.820
And so this is a part of a
really large identity effort

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.780
here Google.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.970
Because as some of you
may follow Tim Bray.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.930
And he's mentioned several times
that social is actually

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.330
the plural of identity.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:51.250
And so we are taking great
pains to make sure we can

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.660
integrate the two and
do it correctly.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.970
And so we'd love your feedback
as we move forward in this

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.690
process, because we want to make
sure we're doing what's

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:00.770
best for our developers
and our users.

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.500
So with that, I'm going to
move on to the second

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.710
question, which is
really easy.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:05.500
So this is going to be great.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.120
So Shira wants to know, can you
have the Sign-in button

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.530
for a website without the app?

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:10.850
And the answer is yes.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:12.020
It's just a simple yes.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.900
We support web, iOS, and
Android, either individually

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.420
or together in some
combination.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:22.550
And to some extent, we even
support custom integrations.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:23.220
JONATHAN BERI: Oh,
that's right.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:26.980
So one of our launch partners
who is rolling out slowly over

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.350
today is Fitbit.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.540
And they've done a pretty
cool integration.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.760
It's kind of web and
kind of not.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.275
Still a lot of Fitbit users
use the desktop client.

00:30:35.275 --> 00:30:39.690
It's actually a native desktop
app for Windows and Mac.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:41.380
And they have an embedded
web view.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.250
It's pretty cool that they can
actually get over the install

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:47.140
working from when a user first
signs up to Fitbit from a

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:47.870
desktop app.

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:49.330
JOANNA SMITH: So I strongly
encourage all of you to check

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:52.910
out our case studies part of
developers.google.com/plus, so

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:56.080
you can see maybe a head start
on how you might want to go

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.070
about your integration.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.530
Maybe what features
are most important

00:30:58.530 --> 00:30:59.840
based upon our partners.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.220
Because we're really excited
to have partnered with all

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:02.680
these people.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.940
And we want to show you
what they have.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.160
JONATHAN BERI: And hopefully
inspire.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.080
JOANNA SMITH: And several of
them will be coming to visit

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.600
on future GDLs.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.440
Spoiler alert.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.710
So Funner Goat wants to know if
they are right in thinking

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:19.490
that an ability to push moments
or App Activities to

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:21.510
the profile is restricted
to Sign-in--

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.180
enabled apps on mobile,
not on websites.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.180
And answer is just no.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:29.010
JONATHAN BERI: It's basically
part of the plus.login scope.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.700
So once the user authorizes
that scope, writing App

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.280
Activities is part of it.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.010
Now, you have to explicitly
request an individual App

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:40.270
Activity across all platforms.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.600
Same format.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.220
And then once you have that
permission, you can go ahead

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:47.320
and write moments from web,
from Android, and iOS.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.900
And I think I showed some
snippets for all of those.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.270
JOANNA SMITH: And a good
example is, say

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.710
someone's on a news site.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:56.680
You as a developer could be
writing App Activities for

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.950
every time they read
a news article.

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:00.620
And so later, that user can
go back and see the

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:01.270
articles they read.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.680
Maybe find a link that they
thought was interesting at the

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.400
time but forgot to
take note of.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:10.810
And also, you write privately,
but the user can share

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:12.090
whenever they desire.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.180
So there's no risk of spam.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.300
It's just as in the
history preview.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.910
And I think that's
really cool.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.410
So Lars on YouTube wants to know
how much control do the

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:26.030
users have over what data
is given to the app?

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:28.530
JONATHAN BERI: So if you
remembered when I showed that

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:29.600
off dialogue--

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.800
within there, of course they
can just dismiss it.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.690
They don't actually have to.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.770
If they try to sign in, and
they see these permissions

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:36.190
they don't want, they
can say no.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.680
And the developer can't keep
on prompting them.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.730
But within that dialogue--

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.910
let's look at just the Plus
style login data.

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.130
We provide basic profile
information, which is what we

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.640
had before.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.590
Profile name, profile
URL, profile pic.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:51.000
And anything that you've
set public.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.110
So for example, my birthdate
is set public, but my home

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.550
address isn't.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:56.740
So a developer would be able to
actually get my birthday,

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.510
because I've exposed that.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.720
Now with additional scope,
such as email--

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.620
we provide email, of course.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.270
And the age range and the
preferred language.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:09.060
And all that falls under our
data retention policy.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.510
You have to keep a fresh cache
of the data, and if the user

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:13.430
disconnects, you have
to delete it.

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:15.940
But the user can go ahead
and change that.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.932
And there's the other part--
that's what you were

00:33:17.932 --> 00:33:19.230
about to remind me.

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:22.485
They can also control who from
the people in their circles

00:33:22.485 --> 00:33:24.190
that your app can actually
know of.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:27.060
So they have a full list,
or they can limit

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.145
it down to a subset.

00:33:28.145 --> 00:33:30.480
JOANNA SMITH: So they pretty
much have control over almost

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.460
everything.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:35.300
I think that the name, the
profile picture, and the age

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:40.200
range and locale are given, but
the language and the name

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.550
and profile picture, those are
already very important and

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.130
public things anyway.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.120
And the age range
is in a range.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.850
It's not a specific
date or a year.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:51.580
So they are very protective
there as well.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.830
So Matt?

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:54.620
Nate?

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.980
Wants to know if he can use
direct app installs to install

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:02.000
an app that he doesn't own.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.580
JONATHAN BERI: No.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:07.050
So we protect app developers
from fishing or issues that

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:08.380
they may be impersonated.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.800
Because the app--

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.330
the package name-- has
to be both on the

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:15.000
button and in the project.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.139
You can't spoof that.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:17.344
And there's also an integration
with the Play

00:34:17.344 --> 00:34:20.780
store to further
restrict that.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.699
JOANNA SMITH: So no.

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:27.840
So Lars is worried because he
has nightmares still about

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.310
those mobsters and farmers
spam that he

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:31.730
got for quite a while.

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:35.625
So how can we reassure him
that won't happen again?

00:34:35.625 --> 00:34:39.870
JONATHAN BERI: So at a course of
Google+ is controlling how

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:45.300
broadly and how wide a
user could broadcast.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.690
And with App Activities, we
mentioned that it's contained

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:50.585
within a user's profile.

00:34:50.585 --> 00:34:52.230
So it does not go
to the stream.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:57.270
So every time you-- let's say
you love those farming games.

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:59.530
If a farming game didn't
integrate with App Activities

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:02.950
in Google+ Sign-in, that they
could write all those App

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.010
Activities to your profile, but
it wouldn't go into all

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:06.100
your friends' streams.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.430
You can rest assured that your
friends won't be annoyed by

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:10.940
the spam it may be creating.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:14.630
And actually for apps, you can
talk to developers to say,

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.885
hey, this is the wrong type of
App Activity and actually

00:35:16.885 --> 00:35:18.120
create a feedback loop.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.840
Especially if it's a mobile app,
by providing reviews in

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.750
the Play store.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:22.990
JOANNA SMITH: I definitely
think so.

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:25.740
So Chris wants know if a call
back can kick off a

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.380
server-side process.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:31.580
And as an engineer, I can tell
you yes, just through XHR.

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.680
And we actually have
a lot of samples.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.410
Like I said, they're going
to be coming out today.

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:37.290
And we're moving them to GitHub,
so this is going to be

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.850
really great for all of our
developers, if you have ideas

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.360
and you're going to start
contributing.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.790
But the one thing you might want
to look at now is we have

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:50.590
a lot of documentation on pure
client-side integrations or a

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.420
hybrid client-side server-side
sort of flow.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:58.160
And you can go ahead and start
exploring all of these things.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:03.080
So Lost wants to know if the
plus.login scope will become

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.290
the default scope for Hangout
apps instead of plus.me.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:10.600
JONATHAN BERI: So plus.me is not
the default Hangout scope.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.790
There's actually no scope.

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:15.220
But with the power of Hangout
apps-- which is one of my

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.400
favorite topics to talk about
besides the new Google+

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.150
Sign-in button--

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:20.540
you can add additional scopes.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.730
So we actually have a sample
to be written, or maybe

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:26.030
written by you, to
use plus.login as

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.020
part of Hangout Apps.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.400
So think of them as
separate things.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.200
JOANNA SMITH: And on that note,
while we're talking

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:30.700
about Hangouts--

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.590
I know many of you have already
noticed we launched

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.605
Hangouts version 1.4 recently.

00:36:34.605 --> 00:36:38.170
And we're very proud to say that
we're excited about all

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:39.810
the things that are happening
with Hangouts.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.640
And definitely now, with the
launch of Google+ Sign-in,

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.240
being able to see integrations
between authentication and

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.430
Hangout Apps.

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:48.150
We're definitely looking forward
to what you guys have

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:50.940
the offer coming forward.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:54.960
So we've reached a lull in the
questions, but we'll probably

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.070
hang out for just
a little bit.

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:59.060
I want to go ahead and make one
more announcement, which

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:03.380
is that in 2013, we're pleased
to say we now have three

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.510
Google+ Developer experts.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:08.950
Previously, I know most of you
have already seen Gerwin.

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:11.450
He's been hanging out in all
of our forums and our

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:13.590
community, and he's definitely
one of our more powerful

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:14.170
developers.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.130
And we're really pleased
to work with him.

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:19.470
But adding to his company, we're
now all offering Allen

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.600
Firstenberg and Abraham
Williams.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.520
So as you see them in our
Google+ community, or if you

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.440
go ahead and look them up on
their own, definitely, you can

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.610
trust almost anything that
these guys will tell you.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:34.000
They are very, very well
informed about our platform.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.580
And we are constantly in
communication with them, and

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.500
letting them know what's going
on, and seeing what they have

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.190
to offer in their opinions
on our products.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:43.250
So any time they answer
a question,

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:44.230
you are in good hands.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:45.320
Don't worry.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.370
JONATHAN BERI: Yup.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:48.472
Love them.

00:37:48.472 --> 00:37:49.590
JOANNA SMITH: I think
that's all of our

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.210
questions right now.

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.290
JONATHAN BERI: Just to wrap up,
super excited about the

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:55.810
new introduction of Google+
Sign-in and all the APIs.

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:58.490
And the mobile support we've
introduced, and the cool

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:00.060
over-the-air installs.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.890
This is now rolling out today.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:05.440
And it will be available to
Google Developers broadly.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.110
There's no registration
or sign-up flow.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:08.770
You just have to create a
project and accept those terms

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:10.230
there, and you're good to go.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:13.610
And it's supported in all
locations and locales that

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:15.250
Google+ is supported today.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:18.170
So you can consider this
a global launch today.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:19.700
JOANNA SMITH: Over 60
something languages?

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.790
JONATHAN BERI: That's
about right, yeah.

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:22.220
JOANNA SMITH: So please
get started.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.910
Let us know what you think.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.160
JONATHAN BERI: Thank you.

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:44.153
