00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.009
A machine that can sustain motion forever
with no energy input is the greatest dream

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.149
in engineering.

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:11.190
And while many have tried to invent a perpetual
motion device, all have failed.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.250
Will we ever create such a machine and harness
free energy forever?

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.920
Short answer?

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.160
Nope.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.710
Sorry to be a stick in the mud, but a machine
that can keep its parts moving forever violates

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.009
some pretty fundamental laws that govern how
we think our universe works, and videos on

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.900
the youtubes where people claim to have invented
perpetual motion machines are as fake as my

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.070
girlfriend’s laughs at my jokes.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.110
First let’s lay out just what we mean when
we say a machine that can keep going forever.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.930
If you created a perpetual motion machine
and set it running it would just keep going,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.280
longer than any of us would live, longer than
our sun would live, as long as the entire

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.920
universe itself would live.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.740
And getting more energy from an outside source
is cheating, it should keep running in total

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.740
isolation.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.920
You’re not allowed to power it with light
or ambient heat or by leaving money in your

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.170
will for your grandchildren if they give it
a push every now and then.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.400
That’s a pretty daunting challenge, but
it hasn’t stopped people from trying.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.259
Over the years they’ve come up with ideas
that seem plausible in a sketch on a patent

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.030
application, but less workable in reality.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.499
A classic example that comes in many variations
is the overbalanced wheel.

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:26.899
No matter if they use fluids or rolling balls
or weights on articulated arms, the concept

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.499
is always the same: as the wheel spins, masses
on one side move to a wider radius, providing

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:36.680
more torque and unbalancing the wheel to keep
it spinning forever.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.280
Except the wheel isn’t unbalanced.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.139
There are more weights on one side of the
wheel, balancing out the side with fewer weights

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:45.520
but more torque.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.380
All that really accomplishes is the center
of gravity gets shifted below the axle, making

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.420
the wheel behave more like a pendulum, swinging
back and forth before stopping.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.689
A simple wheel might work better, and while
a well made wheel will spin for a long time,

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.470
it will eventually succumb to the great nemesis
of all machines: friction.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.760
If friction could be totally eliminated it
would be possible to make a machine that runs

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.760
forever.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.170
Just give it that initial bit of energy and
so long as it doesn’t lose any, it’ll

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.230
just keep going.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.530
But no surface is smooth enough to be frictionless.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.130
Well maybe with the exception of superfluids,
but even those are usually supercooled which

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.930
means you’d need to use energy to maintain
those low temperatures.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.570
Mechanical parts will rub, which will turn
some of the mechanical energy into heat and

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.410
cause the machine to slow down.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.130
But while a machine that, once started, can
run forever is theoretically possible at best,

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.200
machines that power themselves and generate
free energy from nothing are flat-out breaking

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200
the law.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200
Which law?

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.930
The first law of thermodynamics, which is
you do not talk about thermo- wait no I’m

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.000
thinking of something else.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.760
It’s the idea that in a closed system, energy
cannot be created or destroyed, only converted

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.540
into other forms of energy.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.290
This is one of those laws on which we’ve
built our entire understanding of the universe,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.040
anything that would upend it would rewrite
multiple scientific disciplines.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.340
A machine that can keep itself running forever
and could power your toaster to boot would

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.150
be more than 100% efficient.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.660
In other words, it would get something from
nothing, and from everything we’ve ever

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.270
seen ever, that’s just not possible.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.370
So, sorry but every time a video surfaces
of some zany wheel that can supposedly spin

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.580
forever, you can rest assured that it’s
fake.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.500
At this point the never-ending stream of phony
claims about them is the only thing that’s

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.500
perpetual.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.160
So getting your own perpetual motion machine
might be a far away fantasy, but getting a

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.430
brand new cell provider isn’t.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.400
Visible is the new way to think about phone
service.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.400
No stores.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.400
No annual contracts.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.400
No hidden fees.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.430
Just 40 bucks a month for unlimited messages,
minutes, and data at speeds up to 5 megabits

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.430
per second.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.430
All on Verizon’s 4G LTE Network.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.430
When you think the future of phone service,
think Visible.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.430
Visible is the new way to think about phone
service.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.430
$40/mo phone service that's actually $40/mo.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.430
Unlimited everything (including data at speeds
up to 5 Mbps).

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.430
All on Verizon's 4G LTE Network.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.430
No hidden fees.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.430
Ever.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.430
When you think the future of phone service,
think Visible.

on the science of engineering.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.300
One last thing- Despite their impossibility
people still keep dreaming up perpetual motion

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.870
machines, to the point that the U.S. patent
office flat out refuses to review new patents

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.870
for them.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.349
