You're probably thinking at this point, this is really low

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.420
level. I really want to be able to pinch, zoom, and

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.590
rotate a single visual element. Well, that's a complex gesture

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.970
and there's no built-in gesture recognition in the web platform.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.970
However, there are some great gesture recognition libraries out there.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.110
Hammer JS, JQTouch, even what's built into Centure touch. If

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.460
you want more complex gesture support you might want to look

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.530
at one of these. Rather than attempting to roll your own.
