00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this unit, we've been focusing primarily on what's called the electrostatic force

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which is the force that makes different charges come together

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and like charges go apart from each other.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And you may be wondering yourself, how does this electrostatic force

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
compare to our old favorite force, gravity.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In this problem, we're going to work out which of those two forces,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the electrostatic force, which I've called Fe here, and the force of gravity

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which I'm calling Fg here, reign supreme.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Let's imagine that we have two positively charged particles here,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and each one of these charges has a positive charge of 1 Coulomb.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Let's also assume that their masses are the same value.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We know from this unit that because both of these particles have positive charges,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the electric force will push them apart from each other.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But because both of these particles have nonzero mass, gravity will try and pull them back together.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
For this problem, your goal is to figure out what the mass of these two particles has to be

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
such that the gravitational force and the electric force are perfectly balanced out

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so that these particles, when released, will not move.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
They'll just stand at their current positions.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now in order for you to figure this out, I'm going to have to give you a little bit of extra information.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In problem set4, we learned Newton's Law for universal gravitation.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
That the force of gravity is equal to this constant G times the mass of the two particles

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
divided by the distance between them squared and it turns out that for charged particles,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
we have almost an identical law.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This equation here which we called Coulomb's Law says that the electric force

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
between two charged particles is equal to some constant K times the charge of both

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
of those particles divided by the distance between them squared.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Now, I didn't include any information about which direction this force is going in here,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
but you can figure out what the direction of the force is going to be

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
just by comparing the charges of the two particles.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If they're both the same, they'll push away from each other

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and if they're both different, then they'll pull towards each other.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Now I hope you find it as awesome as I do that these equations for

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the gravitational force and electrostatic force ended up being almost exactly the same.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
This seems to indicate that there's something fundamental about physics

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
underlying both of these two equations and I encourage you

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
to discuss this idea more on the forms.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
All right, so now that you know the equations for both of the forces

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
we're concerned about in this problem, you're ready to try and balance them out.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
All right, so given these two values of K and G,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
can you tell me what the mass of these two particles have to be

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
such that the forces balance each other out perfectly?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Put your answer here and use scientific notations.

00:02:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Put the decimal part up here and the exponent over here. Good luck.
