00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.460
What will happen?
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.560
when was your first time ever getting on stage?
Do you remember?

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.680
First time that they used to be a club called Radio Tron here in the 80s.

4
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:15.660
Right.
And it was the hip hop club.
If you were into hip hop,
any aspect of it,

5
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:17.520
whether it was wrapping,
break,
dancing,

6
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.530
popping graffitiing all the people went to that spot and um,

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.210
it was hard to get in there and it was hard to get on the mic no less.
Um,

8
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.910
but we had a homie who was like a legendary Dj out here when,
when,
um,

9
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.870
the am station was playing hip hop,
his name was Tony g and he was,
uh,
the,

10
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.760
the leader of the mix masters show.

11
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.080
They had mixed master and he had a residency at the radio tron.

12
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:47.520
So we grew up with one of his,
um,
when his boys,

13
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:51.510
that was his,
like,
um,
is a protege.

14
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.470
So they invited us over and myself and San got on the mic and mellow and I froze

15
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:02.130
the fuck.
I tell you,
I froze up.

16
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:06.380
I forgot every rap I ever wrote or ever memorized.
I was like,
uh,

17
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.120
it would be one of the two times that I would freeze in my life.
And it was,

18
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.620
that was the first time I was on stage and all those people looking at me

19
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:20.310
waiting,
expecting something,
I totally blew it,
you know?

20
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.150
And I told myself,
okay,
I got to get over the nervousness.

21
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:28.310
And then the other thing we were doing was,
uh,
it was like,
um,

22
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.600
they,
they wanted rappers to do this PSA for some bullshit,
right.

23
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.660
And they wanted us to write this wrap and put all this certain information in

24
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:41.700
there.
And I had it,
I had it memorized.

25
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:46.170
I hadn't locked in the minute they said go and they were filming it,
you know,

26
00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:50.340
this is the film it,
I kept fucking it up horribly.

27
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.580
I didn't even get through it.
I was like,
I'm sorry I can't do it.
Fuck,
you know,

28
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.460
I was getting mad at myself to that fuck.
What's wrong with me?
You know,
I wasn't,

29
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.160
maybe that was a problem.
That was probably the problem,
you know,

30
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:05.130
cause when I'm not high as,
when it's shit like this happens.
Right.

31
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.840
So those are the two times that I totally fucked it up.

32
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.380
And I like from the last time I said,
I'll never do that again.

33
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:17.340
I'm going to be prepared and I'm going to get through the anxiety or whatever it

34
00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:21.510
is.
And um,
so those were the first two times.

35
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:26.511
But the first time on stage where I actually pulled it off was probably one of

36
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:31.230
our first showcases.
It was at,
uh,
it was at this place off of the 10.

37
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.800
And it wasn't a showcase,
it was actually a competition.
You know,

38
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:39.060
how they used to do competitions.
It's clubs like fucking uh,

39
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.660
what do they call it?
A,
forgot what they used to call them,
but you know,

40
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:45.630
different bands with,
it was like a battle of the bands,
right?

41
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:48.810
So we went in and uh,

42
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.700
I'm coming off of that horrible fucking deal that had just happened,
you know,

43
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:55.320
maybe a month or two before.

44
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.920
And I totally got over it and we were performing real estate,
you know,

45
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.710
in this showcase and we lost.

46
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.580
But we made the biggest impression there because the song,
you know,

47
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.600
we performed it like,
you know,
the way that it's supposed to be.

48
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.370
And then at the end,
Sen dog jumped on the big judges' table and he,
you know,

49
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:18.520
he grabbed his balls right in front of the fucking female judge.

50
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.990
And then as he jumps off the table,
it breaks in half into her lap.

51
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.950
And,
and everybody loved it.

52
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:31.060
We lost to these dudes who are like new,
new edition,
want to as we call them,

53
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:34.360
tootsie rolls.
But we don't remember they won.

54
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.030
But in reality we won because that's,

55
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.640
everybody was talking about us at the end,
you know,
like how raw that was.

56
00:03:41.641 --> 00:03:46.090
And after that show I realized,
you know,

57
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.230
this is,
this is how I'm supposed to do it.
And I seen Krs one,
uh,

58
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.480
do a show one time where the sound went out.
He didn't have a stage,

59
00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.550
he was on a couple of tables that were put together and he just got up in front

60
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:05.230
of the whole club,
no microphone,
no music,
and just started rapping his versus,

61
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.910
and people were rapping right along with them not giving a fuck that the sound

62
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.691
turned off,

63
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:15.691
but the fact that he just continued to do the show and that right there taught

64
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:20.770
me a lot about how you control shit on stage as,
yeah.

65
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.500
Sometimes when things go wrong,
it's a great opportunity.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

66
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.310
Did it show at the Improv last month?

67
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.790
Like maybe my last month or the month before the power went out and they're
like,

68
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.140
uh,
what do you want to do?
Said fuck it.
Let's do a show.
I could yell.
Yeah.

69
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.380
So we just did with everybody just did the show at no microphone.
But that was,

70
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.420
you know,
the Improv is a small room.
It's only 180 people.
Yeah.
I mean that,
that,

71
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:48.070
that place was,
you know,
a small place too.
But I mean,
it goes to show you,

72
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:51.810
man,
like if you got it,
you got to do it.
Yeah.

73
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.220
It's probably better sometimes because it's unique.
Yeah.

74
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:57.760
Cause people will remember,
you know,
the other way.
Yeah.
You know,

75
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:00.670
it probably would have been a great show and people would be talking about it,

76
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:05.170
but they'll remember the fact that you got over that adversity and we're able to

77
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:09.730
still deliver.
And that's the shit that krs one did for me.

78
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:11.680
He showed me through the adversity,

79
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.270
he kept doing the show and the people were still with them.
And I thought,
okay,

80
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.920
one day that's going to be me and I'm going to do what the teacher does.

81
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.170
And,
uh,
you know,
that,
that,

82
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.880
that had been one of the most important things that I learned,
you know,

83
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:32.881
and watching others do shows and stuff like that and what I would do when I got

84
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:38.050
up there,
you know,
and,
uh,
I,
uh,
I applied all those,
those,
you know,

85
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:39.500
lessons men,
you know,
and,

86
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.390
and it's made me who I am as my part of Cypress Hill.

87
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:47.470
And when I do my solo stuff and when I'm with profits of rage that,
you know,

88
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:51.850
that got me prepped for everything that I do now in terms of music now,

89
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.950
how did you,
well,
it's good that to you,

90
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.500
for you to tell people that you had a real hard time your first time performing.

91
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.510
Oh yeah.
There's probably a lot of people out there.

92
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:03.620
They'll never say anxious and yeah,
a lot of people would never say that the lie,

93
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:04.454
you know?
But that's,

94
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.160
I think that's important and there's nothing wrong with those feelings,
man.
It's,

95
00:06:08.161 --> 00:06:12.530
it's good.
You've got to learn,
man.
You're a kid.
It's,
it's,
it's like,
uh,

96
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.710
you liken it to to like college stars that are coming into the professional

97
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:21.410
sports now.
Like basketball players for instance.

98
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:23.000
You get this number one draft pick,

99
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.990
he comes to a team and everybody has these high expectations.

100
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.420
No one knows that this kid,
you know,

101
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.450
some people own the space like Lebron and Kolby and Kevin Garnett who came

102
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:38.840
straight from high school and they own the space.
The minute they got in it.

103
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:42.710
I mean,
Colby had to work.
He wasn't the greatest,
you know,
when he,

104
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:46.460
when he started,
he had to work to get to where he was at and,

105
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.260
and a,
a lot of these guys do,
some of them,
you know,

106
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.450
again,
they come in and they already got it.
You know,
like Lebron,
he was,

107
00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:01.370
you know,
plan and groans,
met grown man's game right when he got into the league,

108
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:05.470
thrown into the fire.
But he was ready for that.
He got better and,

109
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.050
and learn the role and learned who he was as he's gone.

110
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:13.520
But he was one of those rare things,
rare people that can just jump into it.

111
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:16.490
Some people have to get better at it.
And you know,

112
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.280
it's the same thing with music.
Like you get thrown on,

113
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.030
on that big stage for the first time.
If you're not prepped for it,

114
00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:25.400
you're going to definitely be nervous.
You know,

115
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:28.190
you could either embrace that and it'll,

116
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.250
it'll be your first show and you could do a good one or you could do a horrible

117
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:36.140
one.
But either way gonna learn from that.
Yeah.
And,
uh,
if you don't learn from it,

118
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:39.920
then the run is short.
If you learn from it,
you know,
you know,

119
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.550
you learn how to get better and,
and sustain a longer career.

120
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.480
How did you learn how to get over the anxiety,
like your first show,
having a,

121
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.100
the first show suck like that.
What was it?
What was,
what did you learn?

122
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.870
Like how did you,
how did,
did you take classes?
Did you read a book?

123
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.280
We don't,
what we did that,

124
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:03.050
that helped me was that we rehearsed a lot because for me it was like more

125
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:04.190
remembering the songs.

126
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:08.960
It wasn't like the nerve to go out in front of people because we came from the

127
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:13.280
break dance in bboy culture,
uh,
popping and stuff like that.

128
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:18.281
So much of that is going against someone battling someone in front of a crowd.

129
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.570
And if you can be in front of a crowd doing that,
cause that's vulnerable.
I mean,

130
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:27.410
you know,
because in a battle you could either win or you lose.
And if you lose,

131
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:27.741
you know,

132
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:32.540
obviously you could lose it in an embarrassing way or you lose in a close

133
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:36.110
battle.
But either way,
people are sitting there watching you,
judging.

134
00:08:36.111 --> 00:08:39.920
You either cheer in your boot in you when you know any one of those.

135
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:45.560
So that helped me be able to get on stage and perform in front of people.

136
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.020
It will for more from me.

137
00:08:48.021 --> 00:08:51.260
It was more about knowing the songs,

138
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.500
making sure that I know him through the nervousness,
you know?
And it is,

139
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:56.370
so for us,

140
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.050
we did a lot of rehearsals in the early days just so that those first shows that

141
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:04.470
we did,
that we were locked in and we made an impression.

142
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.120
And you know,

143
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:11.121
when we did that and we saw the results of how people were reacting to our show,

144
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.970
it gave me more confidence.
So,
you know,
I'd,

145
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.860
I'd rehearsed the songs in my head,
you know,
when I wasn't around the other guys,

146
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.940
I'd be kicking the songs and I'd be,
or be on a treadmill working out,

147
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.070
say in the songs,
you know,

148
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:30.270
getting them in my head and just gave me the confidence that I know this fucking

149
00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:32.880
shit.
I go up there,
I'll rock this fucking thing.

150
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.660
I'm not going to forget it because that's always the problem for me.

151
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:38.850
It was never getting in front of people.

152
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:43.770
It was do I know my shit and now I know it in such a way that like,

153
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.420
you know,
it's,
it's second nature.
Do I still get those nervous butterflies?

154
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.660
Yeah,
for sure.
Some shows depending who's watching,

155
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:55.540
who's on the side stage or how big the crowd is and whatnot.

156
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.630
Yet I still get some of that.
But you know,
I,

157
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.720
I do a quick meditation before I go out there,
you know,

158
00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:05.610
just in my head real quick.

159
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:10.470
And then our band prayer and then that's the,
that's the switch right there.

160
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:14.100
And we go and we're ready and it,
but it took me a while to get to that,
you know,

161
00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:17.460
because it takes work.
It's like anything,
if you're an athlete,
if you're a boxer,

162
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.500
you're only gonna get better by boxing all the time.
Training all the time,

163
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:25.530
not overtraining,
but making sure that you're in,
they're putting in the work.

164
00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:29.160
And it's the same thing when you're rocking stages,
you know,
um,

165
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.920
a lot of us sometimes forget to go and put the time in and rehearse and you

166
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:39.921
could see that when there's a sloppy show or someone's out of breath or they're

167
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:42.600
not seeing the whole line or they said the line wrong,

168
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:46.230
or they're changing up fragments of the song to make it easier for their

169
00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:49.890
performance and it doesn't necessarily fit.
That's when,
you know,

170
00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:54.420
somebody's putting in the work.
But for us,
you know,
we always,

171
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.570
you know,
that was a part of the draw for Cypress.

172
00:10:57.571 --> 00:11:02.130
That's how we won a lot of people over was the energy of our live show.
So,
um,

173
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.470
but it took that the rehearsals,

174
00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:07.890
men and I would tell any artists coming up right now,
man,

175
00:11:07.891 --> 00:11:10.290
before you start doing your shows you,

176
00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:15.291
because you may get a hit like that fast these days and you may be called to go

177
00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:16.890
do that show.
Now.

178
00:11:16.891 --> 00:11:21.870
If you don't do that show right and you suck as good as that song is,

179
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:25.230
you're never going to sell tickets when they fucking say,
hey,

180
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:30.210
so and so's performing at the,
you know,
this place,
ah fuck that.

181
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:35.070
I'd rather just listen to the record.
He sucks alive,
you know,
so rehearse,
man,

182
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:38.490
rehearse and then after that,
hey,
take,
you know,
do what you will.

183
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.010
But those they fucking help man.
You know,
uh,

184
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.320
for your confidence on performing the song,
that's a wise thing to tell people,

185
00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:49.950
man.
Beat up professional,
be a pro.
You can be a professional.

186
00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:52.530
Decide you're professional,
that's turn that fucking work.

187
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.170
That work does give you confidence and it works with fighting.

188
00:11:56.171 --> 00:11:59.200
It works with comedy.
I'm sure it works with everything.
Yeah,
man.

189
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:03.110
You gotta be proficient,
professional,
red,
d professional,

190
00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.240
an official at the same time.
[inaudible] what is the meditation that you do?

191
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.130
Just the self awareness,
you know what I mean?
Like the circular breathing,

192
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.080
you know,
and uh,
concentrating on that and in the moment and then,

193
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.501
you know,

194
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:22.300
just letting that clear my head,

195
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.570
you know what I mean?
Just focus,
focusing on the breathing.

196
00:12:25.571 --> 00:12:28.740
I mean as what they tell you pretty much in any meditation to focus on the

197
00:12:28.741 --> 00:12:31.120
breathing and all these things and can come through your head.

198
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.750
But if you keep on focusing on that,
you know,

199
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:40.420
everything sort of goes away and your,
your reset.
So,
you know,
I'll,

200
00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:41.830
I'll do that when,

201
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:47.050
when I feel maybe some sort of anxiety before going on if I don't feel that I

202
00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:48.940
don't necessarily do the meditation now,

203
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.720
we'll just do the prayer and that's sort of like,
you know,
sets it all in.

204
00:12:52.721 --> 00:12:56.230
But yeah,
like some shows,
man,

205
00:12:56.231 --> 00:13:00.640
all I'll have to let go in a room and just sit there and you know,

206
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.740
do the breathing man in it helps.

207
00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:05.320
People might think about what the fuck is I going to do?

208
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:09.460
It's going to reset your mind and give you some clarity.
You know?
For me,

209
00:13:09.461 --> 00:13:10.660
at least,
that's what it did.
