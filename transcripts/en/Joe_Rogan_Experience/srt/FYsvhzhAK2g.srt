1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,420
And we're live. Hi Sir. What's going on
man? Very well. Thank you. First of all,

2
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:08,290
thank you very much for
the coffee machine in this.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,270
I just learned that it's turmeric.
I used to say Tumeric,

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,650
I used to not even think there was an RN
in there for some strange reason. Well,

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:20,100
in Hawaii it's Olana. So it just depends
on which country you're in. Yeah,

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,360
it's a diff what did, what is, what
is, it's a root, right? Yup. Ginger,

7
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:26,600
the ginger family. And is it, why
do they call it Olana? Is that up?

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,240
That's just the Hawaiian name. I mean, the
Indians probably have another, you know,

9
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:34,260
in India it's probably one of
the most use, uh, you know,

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,290
are our route. They, it's in every era.
All Indian foods. It's full of it. Yeah.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,200
Yeah. It's really healthy for you. Right?
It's great for inflammation. At what?

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,850
Gut Health too. So you,
uh, gave me this layer,

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,540
superfoods coffee machine,
and I'm addicted to this now.

14
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,180
This coffee with turmeric.
I've never had it before. Well,

15
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:56,100
there's some other minerals
and stuff in there too.

16
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:59,190
So if you're addicted to it is because
there's things that are good for you.

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,790
Yeah. Like I crave it. Like it seems like
something that was your body wants it.

18
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:07,380
Yeah. I, you know, I think
sometimes people think
cravings are based on negative.

19
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,490
Like, oh I just, it's bad cause I crave
it. But I think cravings are natural.

20
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:15,120
I think it went, but it's, you know,
we abuse it when we use garbage,

21
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:19,020
but when you craving something like
that, I mean there's, you know,

22
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:22,530
a bunch of minerals in and a bunch of
good fats and there's a bunch of good

23
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:24,780
stuff in there. Yeah. It's
hard to tell though, right?

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,310
Like sometimes you crave sugar,
sometimes you crave ice cream. Yes.

25
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,560
There's some cravings that are not
good. Exactly. Other ones are exactly.

26
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:34,860
But the system of craving,
I believe,

27
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,180
what is part of a natural human thing
that we have that was meant to crave good

28
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:45,000
things, but we abuse it with cause
sugar and nature is meant to be safe.

29
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,920
That means it's safe to eat. Right, right,
right. So, so yeah. So then we, so that,

30
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:54,420
but then we abuse it by disguising a bunch
of garbage with sugar and then people

31
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:57,180
think, oh, that's great to
eat. That makes sense. Yeah.

32
00:01:57,181 --> 00:01:59,970
Cause whenever I lift weights,
I crave protein. Yeah.

33
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:03,350
Crave like fish or chicken or steak
or something. Yeah. Well you're,

34
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,490
you're beating up muscles.
You want protein. Yeah.

35
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:08,880
But it's an instantaneous craving.
Yeah. It's like right away I'm like, Oh,

36
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:11,160
I've got to eat something. Yeah. Um,

37
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,720
so you've got me crank in the sauna up.
Uh,

38
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,420
your wife told me that you crank
years up to 220 degrees. Is that real?

39
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,660
That's real. God Damn Man. I get
to two 10. I'm like, this is,

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,450
how long do you do at two
20? Well, it depends on how,

41
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,710
how cold you go into it. Oh,
oh. So if your, if your body,

42
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:33,010
if your core temperature is weighed
down, you can, you know it, if you,

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,210
if you've got off the stationary bike
and your core was nice and hot and you

44
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:40,740
went in there, you know, you'd be lucky
to get 10 or 10 or 15 minutes out.

45
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:45,060
If you come out of a ice tub or you've
been outside with minimal clothing,

46
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,890
you could go in there and for 20
minutes at two 20 so it just depends on,

47
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,820
you know, where your, what your core
team, you know, where your core is.

48
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,950
Is that how you do it?
You do from an ice bath.

49
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,160
I will do it from a nice path that
just, you know, I, you just break it up.

50
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:02,650
It's just like anything,
any kind of training,

51
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:05,320
you just want to constantly
stress the system.

52
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:08,740
And if you're used to a certain
pattern, you know, go into it hot.

53
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,390
Like if you go into a sauna hot coming
off of some cardio that it's twice as hot.

54
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:17,260
If you go in cold then you can
go for a longer period of time.

55
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:21,520
And same with the ice. I mean, if you go
into the ice cold, the ice, we'll tap you.

56
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:23,500
If you go in hot,
you can be there.

57
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,800
So they're doing some studies
now on hot yoga at a Harvard.

58
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:30,760
They're trying to figure out if hot yoga
mimics the positive health effects of

59
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:35,170
Sauna. And so the idea is that, you know,
because you're straining and resisting,

60
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,630
it's,
it feels much hotter than 104 degrees.

61
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,990
You have a journal that was 104 hundred
five degrees would be nothing for sure.

62
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,220
But Yoga at 105 degrees, it's pretty
rough. Rough. Well, because again,

63
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:49,960
core temperatures spot. So
we do some stationary bikes
in the sauna. Wow. And that,

64
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,140
I mean, that's just a, it's like you
can always up the ante, you know,

65
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:57,850
it's like a weight stack. You just
slap more led on there. And we'll do,

66
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:00,700
we'll do,
we'll go in this with an assault bike.

67
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,850
I have an assault bike and one of the
Saunas and we'll crank that thing up.

68
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:07,540
And you know, I mean, you're lucky if he
might be five or 10 minutes and you're,

69
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,160
you're, but I think, you know, we're
such good adapters or our, you,

70
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,720
our adaptation is amazing and
you do some stuff for a while.

71
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:19,570
I think you did it pretty soon. You're
like, oh, I can handle, uh, you know,

72
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:24,460
an assault bike and at, at a survivable
pace, you know? Yeah. Survive.

73
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,020
That's a rough machine. Rough machines.
I have the rogue versions of echo bike.

74
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,580
Yeah. That thing is fantastic. I love
it. For sure. That's all four limbs,

75
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,050
all four limbs. It's one of my all time
fee to two Bottas Tabata sprints on it.

76
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,200
An all time favorite method of
Cardio for sure. For sure. Well,

77
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,840
low impact on the system. You're not
beating every, the joints. Um, every,

78
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,330
all four things are working and you could
throw in some nose breathing in there

79
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:52,310
or something and breath holding
intervals or something just to, you know,

80
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,680
we're seeing in suffering. You were
explaining nose breathing to me out there.

81
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,630
Yeah. How nose breathing is better. Better
for you because of, well, first of all,

82
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:06,100
you were designed to breathe your
sinuses and your nose were designed for

83
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:10,030
breathing. And so you actually
admit a gas in your sinuses.

84
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:15,150
From my understanding, a gas called
nitric oxide, which is a vasodilators,

85
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,770
helps you absorb oxygen.
So by breathing through your nose,

86
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,890
plus you reduce the amount of intake
that you have and that gets you CO2

87
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,200
tolerance. So all of a sudden you're,
you're breathing less volume. I mean,

88
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,710
you know, from the fight game, we, as
soon as the guy goes to mouth breathing,

89
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:33,280
you're like, he's toast. You know that,
right? That's your first giveaway.

90
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,510
So your ability to deal with stress
and breathe through nose, I mean,

91
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:42,040
everybody should be breathing
through their nose in their sleep,

92
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,420
walking around.
I mean,

93
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,160
we somehow we became mouth breathers in
the last 200 years and they're not sure

94
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:53,140
why. There's a great book
called the Oxygen Advantage,
uh, by Patrick Mcgill that,

95
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,770
uh, he actually is on our board
of XPT but he, he, you know,

96
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:02,300
kind of realized that our issues really
stem from mouth breathing, chronic, uh,

97
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,081
mouth breathing,

98
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:07,160
which is scrubbing our CEO to and
keeping our co two levels down,

99
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,660
which is the market of absorb oxygen.
So when your co two levels are down,

100
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,170
you don't absorb the oxygen from your
bloodstream. The cells don't take it.

101
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:17,270
As soon as this co two goes up,
then the,

102
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,000
then the body starts to pull it
out of the blood. Interesting.

103
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:24,380
So smaller amounts by breathing through
the nose actually makes you absorb more

104
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:27,060
oxygen while keeps your
tolerance and tolerance.

105
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,660
But definitely get your
CEO too tolerant up.

106
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:33,470
But the smaller volume helps your body
become more tolerant of higher levels of

107
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,990
co two.
But the nose,

108
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,010
the sinuses themselves emit a gas that
helps the lung absorb the oxygen is,

109
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,530
and that's, you know, that's
what I've been led to understand.

110
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,070
I had a broken nose until I was 40.
My nose was useless.

111
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:48,620
I couldn't get anything out of it.
It had been broken,

112
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:50,510
like who knows how many times.
Yeah.

113
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,380
And it was all the inside was all caked
up with scar tissue and calcified.

114
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,970
And when I got it fixed, it was like
the world change. It was like, ah,

115
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,070
I couldn't do that.
I just couldn't breathe out of my nose.

116
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,410
I would go to yoga class. They tell me
to breathe at. All I know is I'm like,

117
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:06,050
I don't have one. Yeah, I could
smell farts. Yeah, that's it.

118
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:10,670
I could smell gas and gasoline. Like
it has to be rough for me to smell it.

119
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:13,910
But now I have a real nose.
Yeah. I always encourage people,

120
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,760
if you have a broken nose, please get that
deviated septum fixed. Well, you know,

121
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,030
it's surprising if you
start to nose breathe,

122
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:22,670
even if you have struggle because of the,

123
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,000
that gas is helps you open
up a lot of people. I mean,

124
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,950
I'm not saying that you have that,

125
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:32,120
but a lot of people actually will gain
volume after a few weeks of forcing

126
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:35,420
themselves to nose breathe. They'll
actually start to open up all of that,

127
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,580
that system. Does that make sense? So
your body would just adapt and try.

128
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,630
It forces it to, to open. But yeah,
no it's all about nose breathing.

129
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,500
I didn't think,
I just thought it was just more difficult.

130
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,170
So it's probably a good thing to
do for discipline. Absolutely.

131
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:56,130
And if you can do your cardio
and retain a nose breath, you're,

132
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,870
you have another gear because then when
you go to mouth it's like you gotta it's

133
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:03,760
like having a blower on your car or
something. You open up the, you know,

134
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,350
you open up the air and
it's a whole new game.

135
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:10,820
So by being able to sustain a
high output nose breathing then,

136
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,470
and like I said,
it's all about the tolerance for CO2.

137
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,790
It's how much co two you can
handle in your system. You know,

138
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,970
like that's why altitude screws people
up cause the CEO two jacks up and they

139
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:24,290
don't have a tolerance and then you get
all wonky and you feel like crap. Yeah.

140
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,770
And it's interesting that you're talking
about cravings because one of the

141
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:30,640
things that I've noticed since I've
been, I cranked up the, to the,

142
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:33,680
the temperature in the sauna for the
first week to 200 degrees that I've been

143
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,300
doing to 10 for the last few days.
And uh, you crave it now. I crave it.

144
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:39,470
Like when I'm at home,
I'm like,

145
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:41,860
I can't wait to get back to that
God damn song again. Meanwhile,

146
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,390
when I'm in there, I can't wait to get
out. It's weird. They're within lies.

147
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:50,810
The struggle. I mean ice is the same way.
Like I have an addiction to ice and I,

148
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:51,770
you know,
uh,

149
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,470
recently I've been just came back from
Hawaii and I'm like dealing with ice

150
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:57,480
machine's broken down.
I've been waiting for the new one.

151
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:59,520
I keep calling the guy and go, hey,
when are you gonna put the thing in?

152
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,570
And He's thinking it's like
a luxury. Like, yeah, you're,
you know, you've got it.

153
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,410
What do you need an ice
machine at your house for him?

154
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,730
Cause I have to like restaurant
size ones. Yeah. And,

155
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,660
well I have a lot of friends, but
he's like, what do you need that for?

156
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:16,740
And I'm like, I like just just get, you
know, he's got the tubs. I'm like, I need,

157
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,320
my body craves. You get it. Listen,

158
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:24,410
your body is just craving the things
that are bringing the hormones and do it.

159
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:26,190
I mean it's like why you crave exercise.
You know?

160
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:30,720
I have a theory that the reason why
people are hooked to cardio activity is

161
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:32,970
because it's forced breathing that people,

162
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,660
because you wouldn't willingly just sit
on your floor and breathe heavy for an

163
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,930
hour. So your body's like, okay, let's go
for a run. Like let's go. You need to run,

164
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,890
you better run,
you better run,

165
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:44,490
and then you go run and then the
body gets that absorption of, oh,

166
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,460
it gets at a oxygen.
Then it really wants to feel.

167
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:51,270
I feel like there's probably several
factors cause also I feel like when I'm

168
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,220
really consistent with my workouts,

169
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:57,360
I know that I'm gaining momentum and I
know like, ah, you know, I'm consistent,

170
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:59,340
everything's going great,
I'm in great shape right now.

171
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:02,720
I've got to keep pushing this. Yeah.
That feels like it's, it feels like a,

172
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,550
like just,

173
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,900
just positive results are being achieved
and you can sort of get addicted to

174
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:10,740
success. Well and, and it, but
also to the body, the adaptation,

175
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:14,910
if you ever put yourself under some
real severe stress in multiple days,

176
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,460
the first day you feel like you're
not gonna be able to make it.

177
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:20,490
The second day you're feeling, you know,
like you can't really can't make it.

178
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,830
The third, pretty soon, the
fourth day the body is like, oh,

179
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,100
this is the new house we're living
in. Like this is where we're at. Okay,

180
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:27,990
well we're going to adapt and modify.

181
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:30,960
And then pretty soon you're doing even
more your than you were doing the first

182
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:34,140
couple of days and you're not even
feeling it. And so it's like we're,

183
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:39,000
that we're an amazing, an
amazing machine. You know,

184
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:43,410
we're an amazing creature. Just the
way we can handle the load and the,

185
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:46,330
and especially in this, in our
new world where we, you know,

186
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,680
don't have to do much unless we want to.
Um,

187
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,290
do you know Eddie Izzard is, yeah.
The comedian. Yeah, yeah. He,

188
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,590
he ran a series of marathons all around
the UK and we did one in South Africa

189
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,330
and he was on two weeks ago.

190
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:02,970
And he was telling me that when
you first started doing it,

191
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:06,630
like the first few were really hard,
but then your body's like,

192
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:09,900
well this is what we do.
We run marathons and then like day three,

193
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:13,740
day four things started picking up day
five and by the time day 10 came along,

194
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,690
he's just running for
sure. Yeah, for sure.

195
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:20,691
I've got a friend ran 125 in a row and
then he ran the Boston after that and

196
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:24,660
then he had a fight in Vegas and he ran
a marathon in the morning and then he

197
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:27,240
like knocked the guy out in
the third round and after,

198
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:30,810
I mean he says he met his marathon in
the morning and then fought that day.

199
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,800
Holy Shit. That's a cause.
This Tom Jones. Yeah.

200
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:39,780
Moitai seven time white Thai
world champion. Jesus zone.
Yeah. Yeah. The fuck man.

201
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:44,330
You run a marathon a day,
you fight it magic put dude,
knock two out. I'd be like,

202
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,610
I'm done. This is not me. Yeah, I'm
going to learn how to play golf. Yeah.

203
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,670
Fuck this. Moitai fuck this
Tom Jones. What I would say,

204
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,300
that's crazy.
So he got 125 marathons in a row,

205
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,500
so 125 days of marathons, two
Boston, and then he ran the Boston.

206
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,900
When he got there,
he ran across the country.

207
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,770
What he ran across the country.
So that's how he got there.

208
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,980
So he did run America, took a nap, ate
some food, ran a marathon, took a nap.

209
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:19,780
It's like, what the fuck
buddy? But just shows you that,

210
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:24,280
you know, that ability to adapt and
what we can, you know what we can do?

211
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:27,730
It's amazing how the body will just,
when you push it and you keep,

212
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,170
it'll just be like, it'll ramp. I
mean, and I think for us in this,

213
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,550
in our new world that we live in,
that seemed so crazy,

214
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:38,650
but probably in the past you were like,
oh yeah,

215
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:41,470
well we went all the way down to South
America and we did some hunting down

216
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:43,350
there. And then we, you know,

217
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,320
trek marathon or two per day and we came
all the way back to Alaska, you know,

218
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:51,730
like right. You know, like that
was just our life a lot. Yeah.

219
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,730
Well especially when they used
to persistence hunt, you know,

220
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,780
when they would just run an animal down.
Yeah,

221
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,610
the animals are great for sprints but
for especially like gazelles and things

222
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:02,270
along those lines. But you know
what though? You know what though,

223
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,460
the real technique really is
based on is that our breathing,

224
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,290
that breathing is what gives us,

225
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:13,060
we have an ability to adjust our breath
so we can actually adjust how many times

226
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:17,320
we breathe PIR motion where a lot of
these animals are breathing for a Rep.

227
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,330
Every rep is a breath.
So every step is,

228
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,030
and we can do multiple steps in
one breath and so that why are,

229
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,670
that's why we can outrun a horse.
At the end of the day,

230
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:29,160
you always see the in the cowboy movies,

231
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:32,920
a horses laying dead in the desert
and the guy still going along.

232
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,090
But because the,

233
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,100
those mammals are breathing every breath
as a rep and you imagine how tiring

234
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:39,371
that is.

235
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:42,990
Like you're a horse ride [inaudible]
right there breathing every and where are

236
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:44,110
we running full speed,

237
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:49,111
but we can just do a breath and then do
five or six or eight reps and that gives

238
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:50,430
us that endurance.

239
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,970
That's why we can run those gazelles
down because those guys are just breathed

240
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,360
there. Their breath out.
That's interesting. Well I'm,

241
00:13:57,361 --> 00:14:02,361
I'm always very appreciative of guys
like you that are in my age range.

242
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,070
I'm just speed limit.
Yeah, speed limit. You're,

243
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,740
but you're also very fit and
very active and you keep going.

244
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:16,180
Whereas a lot of guys around 55
like it's a wrap turn off the car.

245
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,150
Yeah,
it's,

246
00:14:17,151 --> 00:14:21,400
there's not much in the tank and so
I like to see guys that are in my age

247
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:24,290
bracket or a little bit ahead
of me like, oh, he's going go,

248
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,040
I can keep going to full spin.

249
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,160
I think a lot of that is just
thinking and knowing that you can,

250
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:34,210
because I think so many people feel like,
Hey, I'm 45, it's time to settle down.

251
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:38,850
It's time to relax and wind down this
exercise. You know? I bet you know, I,

252
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,210
I think, but I think that people use
that as a disclaimer and not do the work.

253
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,290
It's like, now I'm 45, so now I
don't, now I don't, I'm too old.

254
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,740
For me, I think that's a way
out. Right? That's a way to go.

255
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,790
Hey, I don't want to do the work anymore.
And you know, I have, uh, my, uh,

256
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,360
one of my best friends just passed this
last year and he was 85 when he passed.

257
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,990
And uh, and he was crazy. I mean,
he did the iron man 10 times.

258
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:05,470
The first time was when he was 50.
Um,

259
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,630
and then he's done the race across
America three times and he does just,

260
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,910
he was just an animal bang iron every day,

261
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,850
ride the bike to just a 85.

262
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:17,540
He was doing all that stuff and
animal an animal till the day he died.

263
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,370
I was like, wow. And His name was,

264
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:22,280
and this is the irony was
his name was don wild man.

265
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,630
And so like that's his given name.
No, I'm serious. That's, it's amazing.

266
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,350
His given name. I go, anybody named the
wild man. Got to keep it up. But he was,

267
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:34,220
you know, like you're talking about,
uh, when you can see it right. When you,

268
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,440
what does it look like when
I see, I mean, you look at,

269
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,450
it's interesting to see
in sports right now.

270
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:41,660
We have a lot of athletes right now
that are operating as though they're the

271
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:44,630
oldest that, you know,
that they, that we've seen.

272
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,880
And I believe a lot of it has to do
with the fact that that, uh, you know,

273
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:54,530
that they've have some examples, but
they're also not take accepting that, hey,

274
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:57,820
now you're too old like that. Just
because that's a decision like, Hey, oh,

275
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,010
now you're too old. Oh yeah.
You know, you're going to
keep doing that. It's like,

276
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,310
yeah, you're going to do it all the way
until they throw the dirt on the box.

277
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,550
You know, like we're going all the
way full speed. Until we're not.

278
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:12,020
And then when we're not, we're not,
what did Mr Wildman die of? Uh,

279
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:16,730
it was eventually it was a cancer that
he couldn't get a fight through chemo.

280
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,780
And so, but, but, but it was within like
couple of weeks, like he just was like,

281
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:24,270
shut it down. Um, he was at
one point, he was like the,

282
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,680
he was a little bit like the everready
bunny and, and Humpty dumpty,

283
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:31,520
like he would just like double
knee surgery, like within,

284
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:35,480
like we hit a broken leg and he'd be on
a stationary bike with a crush on one of

285
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:39,770
the pedals and he'd be peddling and
crutching well on the other leg, I mean,

286
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:44,250
he was just absolutely
out of his mind and,

287
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,550
and the doctors would be like, oh,
you're healing faster than a 30 year old.

288
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:50,300
And I'm like, yeah, well he's,
cause he's just a cardio monster.

289
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,290
And so he's getting that blood
flow. And, uh, and he, uh,

290
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,520
we were helicopters snowboarding in Chile,
the s uh, last summer, not this one,

291
00:16:58,521 --> 00:17:03,080
but the one before. And I was with the
run with the guide and the guy goes, hey,

292
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:05,180
you know, I'll hold your
buddy. And I'm like, oh,

293
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,470
he's 84 and he looked at me and he's like,
yeah, no, no, I mean, but how old is he?

294
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:13,880
And I'm like, he's 84 and he's
like, yeah, he's 84. Like,

295
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:17,960
check it out buddy. He's
going fakey. And like, I mean,

296
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:23,360
you know, he was, but he was our, he
was our poster child. He's our guy.

297
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:27,590
We looked at, we go, I mean, and I've
had a few of those. I think it, you know,

298
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:30,800
that I've been exposed to in my
life where there's guys that just,

299
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,900
those are the guys that I always admired.

300
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:37,730
I always admired the guys that just
were always going full speed and never,

301
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,750
never sir can, you know, they
didn't sir come to all that,

302
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,980
all that pressure from society. Like,
Hey, you're old now. We can still do that.

303
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,860
What do you think you were a kid? Just
all the bullshit that you can feed into,

304
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,310
uh, and, and be a victim of. Yeah.

305
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:57,210
We have these preconceived notions of
what it's like to be 30 what it's like to

306
00:17:57,211 --> 00:18:01,440
be 50 what it's like to be 85
and some people like, yeah,

307
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,900
you could fuck that. I'm
not interested. Yeah.

308
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,790
Because they're never looking at ages.

309
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,650
Some as some like feeling
like they're like,

310
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,360
they're never going all 35 you feel like
this at 40 all you're slowing down now,

311
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:17,250
I'll da Da da. You know, and not get any,
just you lay down. It's like, you know,

312
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:20,490
I always say if people stop doing
something, like they go, oh,

313
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:23,040
I'm going to retire now, man,
I'm getting old in the sport.

314
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,960
It's really not that they're getting old,

315
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:27,000
it's just that they've made a decision
that they would want to do anymore.

316
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:30,660
And they just used the age as a, like
a disclaimer. Like, Hey, I'm, I'm good.

317
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:35,120
You know? Yeah. It was. For some folks,
I think it's a mental tiredness for sure.

318
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,150
Keeping up their enthusiasm is probably
the difficult thing and that's why I

319
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,580
think a lot of people look
forward to retirement, right?

320
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,510
They look forward to those golden
years where they just holding hands and

321
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:49,420
walking towards the sunset. Just
jump on a sword. I mean, no, I'm sad.

322
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,390
I mean it's like at that point you're
just so then you're just alive, dead.

323
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,600
You know, you're, you're, you're,
you're dead, but you're alive. Like,

324
00:18:57,601 --> 00:19:02,040
but I think some people look forward
to some day where they don't have to

325
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:06,480
struggle then they can't be on
earth. Yeah, you can't be, you can't,

326
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,720
well you can, I mean like, I'm sorry,

327
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:12,600
the system is a little
bit designed to struggle.

328
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:16,020
Everything that we do that's good for us
has a, has a certain amount of stress.

329
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,970
Just like you want to get that sauna,
you want to get on that salt bike,

330
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,340
you want to jump in that ring,
you want to hike that mountain.

331
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:24,120
It's all stress driven.
And the fact is that's our universe.

332
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:28,770
That's the universe we live in. And, and
so if you got some other, and you know,

333
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:29,730
and I appreciate,

334
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,110
let's hack our way through it and I think
there's waste that hacking supports us.

335
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,560
We can hack our way to, but only
support the things that we're doing,

336
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,160
but thinking that you can just hack your
way through and not actually suffer,

337
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,490
it's impossible. You
just, you got to suffer.

338
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,200
I also think you don't appreciate the
good times unless you suffer absolute

339
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,330
outside. I think I appreciate
food more when I work out.

340
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:59,520
I appreciate life more. I like doing
things more at when I struggle.

341
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,290
Absolutely. I can tell you, I know
sitting down is an incredible thing.

342
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:08,010
Like when you go, wow, this feels
so good, I just sit down. Yeah,

343
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:11,550
because you're streaming. Yeah, for sure.

344
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,040
But a lot of people don't
recognize that that's a lesson.

345
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,730
I think people really need to get drilled
in their head. It's not that tricky,

346
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,570
right. No. I'm going to say this isn't
rocket science. This isn't like elaborate.

347
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:25,650
It's available for everybody. Just
move. Yeah. Key move. Just keep going.

348
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:30,480
Drive it hard and I can promise you
you'll, you'll, you'll sleep better.

349
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:34,650
Like everybody, we have a lot of sleeping
issues right now and I'm just like,

350
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:38,160
well, people aren't tired
enough. Yeah. Like my daughter
was like, oh yeah, you know,

351
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:39,240
having a hard time sleeping.

352
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:42,430
And now she's been banging tennis balls
seven hours a day and I'll tell you,

353
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:45,240
she and I have a problem sleeping now.
Right. She had been real well. I'm like,

354
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:48,820
yeah, it and I, you know,
I think there's a lot of,

355
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:52,270
it's just a lack of movement or
this, we just stopped moving. Yeah.

356
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:56,080
And then your brain races because
your body's not getting exhausted.

357
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,290
So you've develop all this
anxiety and all this weirdness.

358
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,490
Hunter gatherers did not have the
need for Ambien. I guarantee it. Yeah.

359
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,980
There was the other day,
there was no Melatonin. They
were showing me. Yeah, yeah,

360
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,120
yeah. The melatonin was, was, you know,

361
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,830
created in their retina from staring
at the sun and the early morning light.

362
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,950
I mean that's,
they were up,

363
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,220
they were moving and they were up
early and they were, and they were,

364
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:20,320
and they were going
until dark and that dark,

365
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:24,700
it was time to lay down and then you just
did that and you were not sleep issues.

366
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,740
We're in a problem back
then. It's, it's interesting.

367
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:30,880
I'm learning from my dog because my dog
is up first thing in the morning when

368
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:35,200
you start things up and
then when it starts getting
dark out, once he eats, man,

369
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,100
he's just laying down. He was like,
what's up? Chilling over here. Oh yeah.

370
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,880
Well and I, I'm a constantly studying
my dog. I would have brought him,

371
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:47,780
but he's getting his nails done
today. This is really, yeah. Yeah.

372
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:51,100
Well cause he's just ripping up the floor.
He's got some hooks but uh,

373
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,210
but I watch him never leaves his bed
without stretching first in the morning.

374
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:57,790
First thing dumped up dog down,
done full up,

375
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:01,780
down dog and then he full speed
80 miles an hour, like a rocket.

376
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,880
And then just write to the couch and
lay down and then just be totally asleep

377
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,010
and then just up full speed back to
the couch and lay down. I've got, I go,

378
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:12,040
there's something to be said about that
thing. A little stretch, full speed.

379
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,880
Lay down. We'll speed laid out like, but
no warmup, no warm up. That's no warm up.

380
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,740
But people need warm up. Do you agree?
I don't know if I had, I don't know.

381
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:24,640
I don't know about, I don't know about
warm up. I think warm up is being alive.

382
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:29,560
I think you know, I mean, I
mean never warmed up. I mean,

383
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,230
what's that? What about if you're
going to lift something heavy?

384
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,560
Do you think that you should
warm the muscles up first? Well,

385
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:39,340
I think if you set the thing up and you
put everything on and you set it all up,

386
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:42,250
you're already starting to warm up and
if you're psyching up and getting your

387
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:46,270
brain ready to do something aggressive,
I think that you've already,

388
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:49,600
the adrenaline's already going and
you've got a lot of stuff. I mean,

389
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:54,220
I know if you just get up off the chair
and walk over and try to grab a giant

390
00:22:54,221 --> 00:22:57,280
bar with a bunch of weight on it and
lift it, that might be a problem.

391
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,420
But that wouldn't be,

392
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,770
you would never do that in nature when
you were going to lift something heavy.

393
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:05,020
It usually,
there'd be some lead up to it,

394
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:07,780
whether you walk to the place that you
were gunning when you've got the thing.

395
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:11,920
And, you know, I mean, you know, I
don't know. I don't know about about,

396
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,430
cause I think there's mixed
opinions about, you know,

397
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,390
people say don't stretch
before you work out.

398
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,300
And that's been the most recent
thing before it used to be all yeah.

399
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:24,250
Loosen up before you work
out. And I'm like, I mean my
dog does down dog, you know,

400
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,120
up dog down dog.

401
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:28,510
And that's only after he's laying down
and then he just goes full speed at,

402
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,130
I mean well I know that if I do Moitai
if I'm hitting the bag or something like

403
00:23:33,131 --> 00:23:36,580
that,
I don't go hard at first to break a sweat.

404
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,660
I do the first two rounds, I'm just
shadowboxing. Yeah. I'm just putting,

405
00:23:40,661 --> 00:23:44,800
I mean I don't fully full blast
the bag until I'm sweaty. Yeah.

406
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,630
But that's just my thoughts.
I mean I just,

407
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:49,280
I feel like that's the
way you're supposed to do.

408
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:52,730
That's what I've always been told.
Yeah. When, I mean I think the,

409
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,390
I think I would connect that more did
part of it is because of what we are now.

410
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,920
[inaudible] cause I sedentary
and cause, yeah, we're not,

411
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,160
we're not what we, you know,
we are not fully in our,

412
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:08,570
in our nature essence, we're
not, we're not wild. You know,

413
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:12,770
if we were wild, I think we would need
as much any warmup up. When you're wild,

414
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:13,610
you don't need a warm up.

415
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,940
But I think because we're not moving as
much because if you're moving all the

416
00:24:18,981 --> 00:24:20,630
time,
you'd already be warmed up there.

417
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,930
Would like to see a human
from like 5,000 years ago.

418
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:27,290
I'd love to be around like a hunter
gatherer and see what they looked like.

419
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:31,370
Their pain threshold was crazy. First
of all, they are what they could endure.

420
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:31,941
You know,

421
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:35,890
their pain threshold was just [inaudible]
of the cycle of pro bono arm and be

422
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,830
like, we'd still be operating with broken
stuff. No problem. What did they do?

423
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:41,980
They just kind of like tied
it up or something. I mean,

424
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:45,540
I don't know what that was. That was
when they advanced into medical, right?

425
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:50,330
Yeah. A lot of them probably just
hobbled around until it didn't hurt.

426
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,440
That's where inflammation came
in. Everything got inflamed.
So they would hold it,

427
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,870
you know, naturally the body would
hold it in position so that you,

428
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,700
I mean inflammation is designed to kind
of immobilize a cast. It, it would,

429
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,500
you know,
if it was your ankle,

430
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,350
it just gets so swollen I couldn't
move but they'd still be on it.

431
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,940
They'd still be role and it just,

432
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:12,941
they wouldn't be moving it around because
the body would naturally do down the

433
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:16,910
future of humans is not look so rosy
when you really think about how we're

434
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:21,911
slowly deteriorating becoming
these gelatinous balls of
meat and what issue and

435
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:24,140
the bodies are connected to the brains.

436
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:28,460
And so that's why we have some mind
issues too because at the end of the day,

437
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:31,400
the bodies aren't functioning correctly
so that it's not feeding the brain

438
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:33,380
correctly. And so the
brain, that's why we,

439
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:38,381
I mean I think that when you're really
physically well then your thoughts are

440
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:41,960
physically well. I think it's
definitely, it definitely helps.

441
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,910
But people do not like to hear that. Do
you notice that you noticed that? Yeah,

442
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,330
absolutely. If you don't, I didn't even
like you, like you seem like a happy guy,

443
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:52,050
you know,
I don't care if you're on any medication,

444
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,990
but some people who are want
to think like, no, no, no,

445
00:25:56,991 --> 00:26:01,640
I have a medical problem and I need this.
Even if they don't exercise, they go, no,

446
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:05,420
no, no. You don't understand. And then
if I say, okay, but do you ever exercise,

447
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,690
they get mad at you. Absolutely. They
get mad. Like, absolutely you're,

448
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:10,400
you're suggesting I'm lazy,

449
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,990
but you're suggesting I brought this
upon myself because of my behavior.

450
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:16,760
I know I have a disease.
Yeah, no way. Again,

451
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:20,870
I think that's a disclaimer that's a way
out. To not have to take, be accountable,

452
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,460
be accountable. Like, Hey,

453
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,740
that if I was out doing moving and doing
things that it would actually make this

454
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:32,720
go away. You know? I mean, I, I think
that, uh, you know, I think a lot of,

455
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,990
a lot of depression is
connected to, to the, you know,

456
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:40,640
I believe ice icing could
cure a big PR portion of,

457
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:45,500
of depression just because of the
hormonal to the system and the, you know,

458
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,410
I mean normally when people are depressed
is connected to some sort of hormone

459
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:52,680
imbalance and to have a doctor
tried to figure out what that is,

460
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,620
it's pretty elaborate.
That's pretty tricky. Well,

461
00:26:55,621 --> 00:27:00,621
they've shown in studies that regular
exercise is as effective at ssrs or more.

462
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,940
Exactly. Yeah, exactly. I think
also diet because of inflammation,

463
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,690
the inflammation for sure leads to
all sorts of different ailments,

464
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,180
which could lead to a depressed feeling,

465
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,710
feeling of unwellness well just eat a
bunch of garbage for a week and see how

466
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:17,930
you feel. Yeah, I can talk,

467
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,150
I'd be depressed or just drink
some layers to the coffee stuff.

468
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:27,660
That shit, man. So the sauna thing,

469
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,030
what is the benefit of
getting it that hot?

470
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,030
Well [inaudible] I know they
said, honestly, my problem
is, is that, you know, if,

471
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,740
if, if a lot is good, then even
more is better than, you know,

472
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,790
that's a little bad to
my, we're both like, Hey,

473
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,620
no, I'm just saying like, yeah, you know,

474
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:50,310
if ten's good than 20 he's got
to be even better. But you know,

475
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:52,290
I think part of it is
the natural evolution.

476
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:56,550
If you're sitting there doing time
at, you know, 180 degrees and you,

477
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,010
and you can go on there and you're,
you know, you're hanging out

478
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,130
and then just 20 minutes,
it's 30 minutes.

479
00:28:03,131 --> 00:28:05,680
So you might as well just
try to turn it up. And, and,

480
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:09,060
and my understanding is that the
Europeans, I mean, I'd be, you know,

481
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:11,370
you look at a sweat lodge and you,
I mean,

482
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:15,840
it ain't one 80 you know,
if you go into any kind of sweat lodge,

483
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:18,570
if you go to Europe, all the
Saunas are a much hotter. Like,

484
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,900
it's like you go into a rush
and, you know, steam thing.

485
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:24,080
It's not like those
things are, you know, I,

486
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,300
I think that they're pretty
conservative with it. I think.

487
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,860
I think you just listen to your body.

488
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:32,280
If you'd go in there and you start
hallucinating, you might want to step out,

489
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,800
you know, you might be
like, Hey, you know, uh,

490
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,220
maybe I eat something wrong or maybe
I need to just get my body a break.

491
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,960
But I think you just use your, you
know, use your, your, your own feeling,

492
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,580
uh, as a, as your guide and, and
you know, I know that I, if I,

493
00:28:47,581 --> 00:28:50,220
if I'm height properly
hydrated before I go,

494
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:53,400
my tolerance is substantially greater.
Like I can really measure it.

495
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,610
I can be hydrated, go in and
be like, oh yeah, no problem.

496
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:01,230
And I can go and dehydrated and feel wonky
and be like, hmm, yeah, I'm not as good.

497
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,900
So that makes sense. Yeah.
I definitely have adapted.

498
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:06,810
I've definitely adapted to 200
degrees because when I go to yoga now,

499
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:11,130
it does not seem nearly as hot 105
degrees. Even at the end of the class,

500
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:13,500
I'm like, this is interesting. I was
thinking of the last class, I was like,

501
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,230
this doesn't feel that bad. Exactly. Yeah.

502
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,800
Well that shows you right there that
you're adapting and then all of a sudden

503
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,270
your tolerance.
You know,

504
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,740
a thing I really like about the sauna
is I think it really plays into into

505
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:28,530
overheating as an athlete.
It over, you know,

506
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:31,620
you overheat and that's usually
when you have issues, right?

507
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,900
As you overheat and then you and then you,
your performances is encumbered,

508
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:41,500
right? You just see it and so the more
your tolerance is for the heat, the less,

509
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,040
the more

510
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,090
you can handle overheating.

511
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,350
Pretty soon you don't overheat and then
you just don't have that cause that,

512
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:46,640
that,

513
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,040
that's one of the factors that gets an
athlete I think as in any performance as

514
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:54,730
you overheat, if, whether you're fighting
or marathon running or basketball,

515
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:59,110
any sport, when you start to overheat
your, that's usually when you're,

516
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,390
you're toast, you're done, you start
losing your motor skills and you're tall.

517
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,130
If you can build that tolerance up.
And I think, like you said, hey,

518
00:30:07,131 --> 00:30:11,740
if I go into 202 20 and then all of a
sudden you're at Yoga, uh, you know,

519
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:16,420
you're at hot yoga and it's 105 and
you're just like [inaudible]. Yeah,

520
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,910
it really does make a giant difference.

521
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:22,480
I've only been doing it at
200 for a couple months now.
Really in to 10. Look for,

522
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:26,620
like I said, last few days. Yeah. But you
have been doing it this hot for how long?

523
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,870
Well, I've been doing it for
a while, like I've been doing,

524
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,480
it's been over the last couple
of years. You know, I did one,

525
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,810
I did a protocol that, uh, I heard on
a doctor, Rhonda Patrick's a show and,

526
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,300
and it was a holding, uh, a one hour,

527
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,790
a one hour straight at
somewhere between 170 to 180.

528
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:50,110
Whoa. So that's another, and you,
if you do that 10 days in a row,

529
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:52,450
I was doing it twice a
day for 10 days in a row.

530
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,250
And you're supposed to get like
some 1600% hormonal boosts,

531
00:30:57,251 --> 00:31:02,110
like your whole body just goes into this
radical hormone [inaudible] 72 one 80,

532
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:05,530
somewhere in that, right?
Yep. Interesting. One 71
day, one hour straight.

533
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:10,450
I was doing that and I'd get it twice
a day for 10 days in a row. And, and,

534
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,290
and uh, and, and, and at the end of that,

535
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,770
you've got a different gear. It's like
all of a sudden you got o d in your,

536
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,250
in your, in your, in your
gearbox. Interesting. Well,

537
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:25,480
it definitely increases the red blood cell
count. Correct? Absolutely. Yeah. I mean,

538
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:28,450
I don't know all the science. I
just usually go off of, you know,

539
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,890
I usually go off of, uh, of
instinct and then, and then I,

540
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:37,700
and then sometimes it gets validated by,
by science and so at the end, you know,

541
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:42,040
[inaudible] I mean, I, I think and,
and I, and there really isn't any,

542
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,430
any studies on it, but I
truly believe that, that,

543
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,710
that he is better after
performance for recovery than ice.

544
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,910
I mean, I think isis
comfortable. Um, I had my, uh,

545
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,360
I don't have a whole thing about
paying a relationship with pain and,

546
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,860
and I was doing a thing with, uh, I
had a hip hip replacement and, uh,

547
00:32:02,861 --> 00:32:06,480
I was set up to do all
this icing before and,

548
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:11,140
and then I learned that icing
suppress the, the, the, uh,
healing hormone, IGF one,

549
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:15,250
there's a healing hormone that helps
your body heal and pain is kicks that

550
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:18,400
hormone off. That's how the body
knows. So when you suppress pain,

551
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:20,920
you stopped that healing.
So you're going ice,

552
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,040
you suppress that hormonal
release of IGF one,

553
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:27,310
it's the healing hormone and all of a
sudden it's going to slow your healing

554
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:31,030
down. So if you do it cause it makes you
comfortable, like, Hey, if you've been,

555
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:31,750
you know,

556
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,300
running around in your overheating and
you're gonna go on ice tub because it

557
00:32:34,301 --> 00:32:38,980
feels good, that's one thing. But if
you think that it's going to benefit,

558
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,880
I'm not sure.
I don't know yet.

559
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,930
I think he could be the better benefit
because you've got heat shock proteins,

560
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:48,380
which deal with damage cells and all
that stuff. Um, and I'm not listening. I,

561
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:52,330
this is just stuff that I hear that I'm
feeling and then just claim we're both

562
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,790
love dogs. Yeah. Fall. Yeah.
Dennis Miller, this is my opinion.

563
00:32:55,791 --> 00:33:00,630
I could be wrong of course. So you know,
the uh, but uh, you know, so that, that,

564
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,070
that and,
and,

565
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,750
and then they talk about growth hormone
that your body produces growth hormone

566
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:10,430
in the heat, right. As another one of the
side effects. And so, uh, from a, again,

567
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:14,510
from my understanding, and
I'm not a doctor, um, so I, I,
when I hear that, I go, well,

568
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:19,490
and heat should be the thing you do
because after every game, every football,

569
00:33:19,491 --> 00:33:22,440
every basketball player, every athlete
goes right to the ice tub. Yeah.

570
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,340
I think if you're going there for
comfort, okay, cool, that's great.

571
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:29,240
But if you think that that's actually
the thing that's really benefited,

572
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:32,030
you know, really going to bring
you the best recovery, maybe,

573
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,920
maybe heat's going to bring
you the best recovery,

574
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,000
but it's going to be miserable.

575
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:37,430
Because last thing you want to
do after you finish a workout,

576
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:41,650
it's go sit in a hotbox. Just not,
yeah, interest, happy. But these,

577
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,730
but for injuries though,
for injuries,

578
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,410
they say you should
reduce the inflammation.

579
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:49,370
But if what you're saying
that's interesting, right?
Well, the more pain, the more,

580
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,870
you know, you know, the old
saying no pain, no gain, right?
No fruit, no pain, no gain,

581
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:57,170
no pain, no gain. I mean, everything's
painful. Like if you go on the heat,

582
00:33:57,171 --> 00:34:00,350
it's just comfortable. You
going to workout, you get
sore. I mean, no pain, no gain.

583
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,560
So if we go with the old, that
old, you know, no pain, no gain.

584
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,020
I believe that the pain is associated
with the healing because of that hormonal

585
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:11,510
response that pain
brings into you. So, um,

586
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,700
I would attribute like I had
a s a fast recovery, but I,

587
00:34:15,701 --> 00:34:19,670
I attribute some of it is because that
I was not suppressing any of the pain.

588
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:24,170
So if, I think if you take pain meds,
that's suppressing healing. So if you say,

589
00:34:24,171 --> 00:34:27,640
Hey, I'm so uncomfortable,
I gotta pop pain pills to,

590
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:29,600
to endure this because it's so hard,

591
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,470
we'll then just extend the
healing that you're just going to.

592
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,340
And the more you suppress the pain,

593
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:37,700
no matter which way you do it with
its ice pain, pills, whatever it is,

594
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,230
I believe the longer you extend the
healing, the more pain you can take.

595
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,060
I mean inflammation is the marker
for that healing hormones. So again,

596
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:50,270
reduce inflammation.
I don't know if that's,

597
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:54,380
that's again I would like to a a doctor
to and somebody to tell me that really

598
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:58,760
has a study that's that they know that
they've really looked at to tell me that

599
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:01,940
that's really working,
that, that the icing.

600
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,120
I mean if you do it immediately
right when you get, you know,

601
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:09,860
you snap your ankle and you go right in
a nice tub bucket and keep it from fully,

602
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,360
uh, you know, inflaming maybe
in the, in that instantaneous,

603
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:18,110
but doing it over days and
I think that's just paint.

604
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:20,450
I think that's just comfortable
making more comfortable.

605
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,540
That's interesting because you always
see basketball players ice on their

606
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:24,231
shoulders,

607
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:28,640
ice on their knees like right after games
cause they have clay comfortable. Yeah.

608
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:31,520
I was just thinking that they have to
play so many games in a row though. Yeah.

609
00:35:31,521 --> 00:35:34,550
But it's also comfort,
comfort. Like, I mean,

610
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:38,520
I think it's because it feels good if
your shoulders all jacked up and you numb

611
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:41,400
it, you know, just like
a pain pill would do.

612
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,730
And this is just a topical numbing
icing, just creating, uh, the, you know,

613
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:48,120
the guy that, uh, that created
rice, which is like rest,

614
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:52,980
ice compression and elevation. He came
out last year and said I was all wrong.

615
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:57,090
So no, he did. That guy came out and
just here. Well then the last two,

616
00:35:57,091 --> 00:35:59,100
couple of years he felt really bad.
Well,

617
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,400
I'm saying so he came out and said,
you know, that he, he was, you know,

618
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:10,390
that he, he, he takes it all back. So I,
you know, I dunno. I mean, I just think,

619
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:15,270
I think there's no absolutes. I
don't, I, but I, I, I'd be interested,

620
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:18,060
I've been trying to learn
about it. Like, Hey,

621
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:22,080
can you really tell me what really is
the best thing? Or maybe it's heat,

622
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:23,820
Nice Combo, you know, that, that heat,

623
00:36:23,821 --> 00:36:27,310
Nice Combo because that does so much
flushing to the system, you know,

624
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,850
squeeze down the ice,
squeezes everything.

625
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:33,540
And then all of a sudden the heat expand.
So your contraction expansion and that,

626
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,790
I know that that is, uh, you know,

627
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,710
but that takes energy to that tires
you down more than you know, than the,

628
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,660
than the heat. But you do do ice
bath, he ice pass heath back to back.

629
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,150
Yeah, I'll do it. Like sometimes
I'll take, I'll do it on a Sunday,

630
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:51,660
I'll do like seven rounds of that stuff,
you know,

631
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:56,100
nine or you just get tired. You
get, you get, you know, you're well,

632
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,730
that's why we want the intensity.
Right, right. So the colder it is,

633
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,310
the shorter you have to be there
and the hotter it is, a shorter,

634
00:37:02,311 --> 00:37:04,350
you have to be there.
So if you're hanging out,

635
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,740
so if you could get it down
to 15 minutes and you know,

636
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:10,980
three to five minutes and let's say
three minutes in the ice in 15 minutes in

637
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:13,750
the, in the sauna, then
all of a sudden, you know,

638
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,700
let's say 20 minutes around then your
tea, you know, then here you, here you go,

639
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:22,070
you got, you know, two and a
half, three hours, you know,
that's why one seven, two,

640
00:37:22,071 --> 00:37:26,160
one 80 you do a whole hour versus, yeah,
but that's a whole different protocol.

641
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:30,390
That was just a, when I heard about,
and I just try, I tried it. Paul,

642
00:37:30,391 --> 00:37:35,391
part of it is cause hard to stay in
that thing for an hour straight at 170.

643
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,400
I mean it's,
that's not an easy task.

644
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:43,230
Are you listening to anything in there
or are you just the beat in my heart,

645
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,200
not putting anything in the
music or anything. Yeah,

646
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:49,740
I'll listen to music or something like
that or a more a podcast or get somebody

647
00:37:49,741 --> 00:37:54,150
else to suffer with me. Uh, yeah, just
to get some, try to try to set hard,

648
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,300
try to get somebody else and maybe they
come in for half and then they're back

649
00:37:57,301 --> 00:38:00,210
out and then they come in for the other
part of something. When I'm on the road,

650
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,780
I tried to get comedians to come on the
song with me at a hotel and it's only

651
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,690
like 150, 116. They're
like, I'm out. I'm like,

652
00:38:06,691 --> 00:38:11,580
you're out here for 15
minutes, say shit. So it's all,

653
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:15,540
but it's all what year? It's, it's in
your brain. It's in your mind. It's, it's,

654
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,360
we're so, uh, you know,

655
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:23,550
domesticated for so domesticated.
Oh, it's hot. It's cold.

656
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,710
It's this. And you
know, we're just, we're,

657
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:29,590
we're as this something that you,
or is this the,

658
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:34,510
the whole surfing community?
Are they end of this kind of
stuff? Uh, no. I mean, I, I,

659
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,590
I, well, you know what's interesting
is, is because I'm a surfer,

660
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:39,910
obviously everybody thinks, oh, you know,

661
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:41,320
all the surfers and you're
friends with the surfers.

662
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:42,430
I remember actually I had not,

663
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:47,440
I really am kind of outside
of the community itself. I
have sir friends at surf,

664
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:50,530
but I'm so not part of,
you know, and in my career,

665
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:54,820
I haven't been part of the industry
of surfing and, and uh, really,

666
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:56,770
so in a way I'm,
I mean,

667
00:38:56,771 --> 00:38:59,980
I have friends that surf that come
and do it and we've definitely,

668
00:38:59,981 --> 00:39:04,570
there's been some influence into surfers
in general, at least the good ones,

669
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:09,490
or are, you know, training and, and,
and using these ice heat protocols.

670
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:14,140
And so they're, they're, they're, uh,
you know, they're, they're aware and,

671
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:19,150
and motivated. Uh, but the, but
surfing in general is, you know, uh,

672
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:22,700
I mean, I don't even know what
half those guys are doing. Well,

673
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,650
I would think that they would
be looking to you. I mean, if,

674
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,720
if I was a young surfer and say,
man, I fucking love surfing,

675
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:32,950
I'd like to be doing this when I'm
55 was Laird Hamilton doing? Yeah.

676
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:36,730
But I don't know. But I think
sometimes the, you know, I
mean, I think for a lot of,

677
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,840
obviously it's changed now, but
in the past, I mean, you know,

678
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:45,520
and it happens a lot with the younger
people in general. Uh, is just like,

679
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:49,010
don't tell me what to do. I
can eat whatever I want and
do whatever I want. Yeah.

680
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,090
I can go to Taco Bell and Burger King and,
and still,

681
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:56,050
and stay up all night and
still, you know, rip, you know,

682
00:39:56,051 --> 00:40:00,430
or do or do my thing. And it's true
probably in every sport. Um, and then,

683
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,010
and then, you know, I always say
there's a thousand, you know,

684
00:40:03,011 --> 00:40:07,690
20 year olds and then there's 530 years
olds and then there's 250, 40 year olds.

685
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,680
And then there's like, you know, and
then he'd just go as you go and, uh,

686
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,860
there's less and less. And it, you
know, I always loved that, uh, the term,

687
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:17,890
the victory through attrition. You know,
when you just the last guy, if you're,

688
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:20,560
this allows guy and you're standing,
you don't even have to be any good.

689
00:40:20,561 --> 00:40:24,100
You'd just, when you're like the winter,
like you won, you're the only guy left.

690
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:28,600
I kind of things. Yeah.
I like that. Just you,

691
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:32,260
you've been following this just to
improve your physical performance just for

692
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:36,130
life. Absolutely.
Absolutely. And, and, uh,

693
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,530
you know, I, I think I really
cherish, I cherish, uh, feeling good.

694
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,890
I care's feeling good.
Like I really enjoy feeling good.

695
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,030
And so that drives me towards, you
know, wanting, and like I said,

696
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:52,370
either whether I had Paul Chek years ago,
uh,

697
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,440
went and did an assessment with him and
he's an interesting guy. Very, yeah.

698
00:40:56,441 --> 00:41:00,400
And Watson and stuff a lot online.
Yeah. And, and, uh, him and I had a,

699
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:04,450
an instant connection
and, and, but, you know,

700
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:08,800
I love the philosophical approach
to certain things. Like he said,

701
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:13,150
and this had a huge impact on
me, you know, 25 years ago,
or he was like, you know,

702
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:16,930
the three white devils are white flour,
white sugar, and white milk. And I'm like,

703
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,420
okay, like drink. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Just put [inaudible] on it.

704
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:27,340
But if you couldn't rock a cow and raw
milk together, that's a powerful drink.

705
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:32,290
Yeah. That's for real. But if you put
dead milk, homogenized, pasteurized, yeah,

706
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,160
just abused.
And then you,

707
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:38,270
and then you take some really bad cacau
if there's any at all in it with a bunch

708
00:41:38,271 --> 00:41:40,770
of, who knows? You can't pronounce
it, you know, he said, uh,

709
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:44,190
if it wasn't here 10,000
years ago, don't eat it. Uh,

710
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,030
and if you can't pronounce
it, don't eat it. You know?

711
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,680
And then the three white devils,
I mean,

712
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,430
that's a philosophical hard time
with turmeric though. Yeah. Why?

713
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,740
Let's just say the word oh
struggled. Pronounced. Yeah,

714
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,840
but it was your 10,000 years ago,
so you've covered some fun. Yeah.

715
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:04,610
Those are good pieces of advice though.
Yeah. But just to look at food that way,

716
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:08,330
it's like people go, what's
your diet? I go, plants and
animals, plants and animals.

717
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:11,360
Like what? You don't like it don't
make it difficult. Don't be like, well,

718
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:12,420
I eat this and debt.

719
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:17,440
I think that the stress around
that stuff is crazy, but I,

720
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,900
I,
I really believe that to truly be,

721
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,390
to have optimum performance and to be,

722
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:28,450
and to be optimum that you have to have
the whole every spoke in the tire that

723
00:42:29,571 --> 00:42:31,220
you need,
every single spoke,

724
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,740
that you have to have a good
relationship with your family.

725
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,020
You got to have love and you got to have
good things with your kids and you've

726
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:41,450
got to have friends and you got to have
your health and you've got to sleep well

727
00:42:41,451 --> 00:42:43,760
and you've got to be hydrated and
you've got to work out and you've got,

728
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,760
and you've got to have a, you know, your
business thing and you've got to have,

729
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,130
I think you just have to have all
these things to really have balance.

730
00:42:50,131 --> 00:42:51,210
And I think if you,
if,

731
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:55,250
if one of the spokes isn't tight that
there's a bump in the wheel and then

732
00:42:55,251 --> 00:42:58,510
you're just not gonna,
I don't truly believe that that you,

733
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,710
you're performing at your
optimum because you need,

734
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:04,760
your head needs to be clear when
you go into your performance,

735
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:07,340
whatever that looks like.
I think that's excellent advice.

736
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:10,340
I think that makes a lot of sense.
And it definitely keeps your mind clear.

737
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,160
You know, you have your bases
covered, covered. You're not just,

738
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,680
you're not here but there,
but somewhere else. I mean,

739
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:19,400
and I know I've dealt with not being,
having all the spokes good.

740
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:22,910
And I know that the, how that feels,
and I know when it's good, you're,

741
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,910
you're clear, you're good. Yeah.
You're, you're, you're, you're,

742
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:29,960
and it's how we're meant to be. I mean,
we're meant to have that be real clean.

743
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:34,640
We're meant to have that there be
some silence. Balance. Got To have it.

744
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,030
Yeah. That's why, I mean, even overworking
mean people think that, you know,

745
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,510
I think that's a badge of honor. Yeah.
Yeah. Like, Oh yeah, I worked, I think,

746
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,660
and I don't sleep and Dah,
Dah, Dah. I'm like, Oh yeah,

747
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:48,890
well then you're compromising yourself.
I told the Ilan Mustang digital. Yeah,

748
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,440
I was, I went to space x one
time and I pulled him aside.

749
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,450
He was standing out and go, hey, you
know, you got to take care of this,

750
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,820
but my hand on his chest, I just
go, yeah, take care of this.

751
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:59,160
But you've got to take care of you.
What'd he say? He just, she had the,

752
00:43:59,161 --> 00:44:01,220
I don't know if he understood
he's a robot. Yeah. He,

753
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,500
I don't think he understood that he
barely a person. I'm just saying,

754
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:06,870
I don't think he, no, I don't think
it with all due respect and, yeah,

755
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:11,130
but I don't think he understood what I
meant. I, I didn't, I felt like, you know,

756
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,390
someone like that if they were really
taking good care of themselves,

757
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,080
getting the right sleep, getting in
the right food, getting a workout,

758
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,760
all those things. I imagine, imagine
like, if they can do what they're doing,

759
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,830
you know, burning it on both ends. Imagine
what they could do fully balanced. Well,

760
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,080
I don't think he wants to do
any more than what he's doing.

761
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:32,070
I just think he's so with

762
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,700
getting Tesla to run correctly on,

763
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:39,600
he was sleeping on the floor of the
Tesla factory and working 17 hours a day.

764
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,750
I mean that's, that is, that's
an insane person. I mean,

765
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:45,300
he was just there all day long
trying to make it work in it.

766
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:48,770
Obviously it does work. They are amazing
cars. Yeah. Everything's, yeah. It's,

767
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,540
it's beneficial. Yeah.
This drive that he has,

768
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:54,930
but I agree with you like for
overall enjoyment of life,

769
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:58,290
that's not the way to go about it.
You have a blockage there though too.

770
00:44:58,291 --> 00:44:59,250
I think if you don't,

771
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:03,960
can't pull back and look at it from
a distance you and you're in it.

772
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,680
I think you get too detailed
and then you can't, you know,

773
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,360
you can't be, I think you, I think
it could be better because of that.

774
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:16,390
I think maybe, maybe it'd be
profitable. Yeah. It's hard.

775
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,980
It's a hard fucking
business. I mean, you're,

776
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:24,140
you're competing against
the big boys. Yeah. Right.

777
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:29,070
But what's interesting is even though
they are doing that, they've managed to,

778
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,860
he's managed to make something that's
so different than anything else.

779
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:35,250
You have one that now I don't,
fuck man. They're crazy. Yeah.

780
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,170
I was reluctant. I told him I buy
one when he did the podcast. Yeah.

781
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:42,320
But I was like, God damn. And I like
muscle cars. All, I hear an engines.

782
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,110
But I drove that thing. I was like, Oh,
other cars are stupid. They're all stupid.

783
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,200
They are, they're archaic. They are here
to that thing. They are well and healthy.

784
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:52,080
And you see all the companies
going that way. Now you can see,

785
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,900
I mean we were cause uh,
my buddy,

786
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:57,660
while Ben and I were into
electric stuff and uh,

787
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,200
and we went and there was a guy that has
electric dragster and we went down and

788
00:46:01,201 --> 00:46:04,920
with this electric director and it
just smoked any top fuel dragster,

789
00:46:04,921 --> 00:46:09,830
like beyond at, but it didn't make noise,
so no one wanted to watch it. So I mean,

790
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:15,460
and you're like, what? I'm been, no, no,
no smell, no noise, no flames. Right.

791
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:20,070
You know, and tell him no good
still burning gas. No, no,
no pollution, no pollution.

792
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:24,480
So people were like, oh, that's no fun.
So yeah, but when you drive a Tesla,

793
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:28,500
like I've a the model s p
100 d I think it was called,

794
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:31,470
when you drive it, it's
effortless. Like everything,

795
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:34,480
just you just go where you want to go.
Like I like to be over there.

796
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:37,200
It's like a video gal.
Like all of a sudden you're over there.

797
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:40,620
Well you have to get used to it cause
I've been in them and driven, driven him.

798
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:44,610
And it's interesting how the body has
to acclimate to the acceleration because

799
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:49,140
you're used to that jolting shifting, you
know, first gear, second gear, third gear,

800
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:53,850
all that delay like a, it's like ac
versus DC. Normal cars are like Acu,

801
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:58,470
a little gap between the power and when
you get that, you know, it's, it's,

802
00:46:58,471 --> 00:47:00,180
the body has to get used to the,

803
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,740
I'm still not totally okay
with not looking where
you're going and just flip it

804
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:08,490
on auto pilot. But I guess
that's, yeah, the next generation,

805
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,340
well that's fun on the highway,
but yeah,

806
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,210
I look where I'm going to
keep my hand on the wheel,

807
00:47:12,211 --> 00:47:15,930
but it is fun to like shut 10% of your
brain off and just let the car kind of

808
00:47:15,931 --> 00:47:19,900
handle the speed and one it does it well.
Does it well, does it well? Yeah. Well,

809
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,030
I just,
like I said,

810
00:47:21,031 --> 00:47:24,780
I think you need a person who's as
obsessed as Elon Musk is to make something

811
00:47:24,781 --> 00:47:29,310
like that. But I agree with you if, if,
if he wants to enjoy his life, well,

812
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,740
just live longer. They have more ideas,
have more influence, like just be,

813
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:37,300
I am only speaking that way. I've just
been in the way of optimizing him, right?

814
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:42,200
Talk to mizing him for it because of his,
he's so amazing that,

815
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,980
okay,
let's optimize your amazingness by,

816
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,710
by making you like be healthier,

817
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:51,640
like be take care of yourself so you
can be around longer and maybe do more

818
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:55,520
great things. Right? So it's again, I,
you know, I'm just speaking personally,

819
00:47:55,521 --> 00:47:59,020
but when you try to look at
optimization, right? Like you're here,

820
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:01,850
you only get so long, you
know, what are you doing and,

821
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:06,430
and are you really optimizing
it by, by, you know, burn by,

822
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,920
by taxing the system and not,

823
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,980
not getting all of it that
out of it that you, you know,

824
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:14,260
but I guess in a way it's kind
of like unhappiness, you know,

825
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:16,490
people use that as a workout.
So that's a little bit,

826
00:48:16,491 --> 00:48:19,030
it makes you tired and you're
get hungry and you know,

827
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,310
yeah, there's always that. Well,
it's the choices you make, right?

828
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:27,490
Like sometimes you just get stuck in
the momentum of the choice that you made

829
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:30,310
and it's very difficult to like
take that pause and go, okay,

830
00:48:30,311 --> 00:48:32,740
am I doing this the right way?
Maybe I need to reset.

831
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:37,240
We needed to just take some time to
really consider if this is making me happy

832
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:40,840
and how many years I'm going to be
able to do this and sustain it. Yeah.

833
00:48:40,841 --> 00:48:45,640
Well that's a tricky thing, right?
That's a, that's a, that's a self self,

834
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:49,330
uh, you know, analyzing
yourself and putting that up is,

835
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:54,360
I think it's easier just to keep going
the direction you're going to take some

836
00:48:54,581 --> 00:48:56,980
Adderall and keep it in
the can go full speed.

837
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,580
How long have you been living in Hawaii?
Uh,

838
00:49:00,581 --> 00:49:05,020
well my mom took me from San Francisco
and I was six months old. Whoa.

839
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:09,850
Wow. Pretty much. It was only a
technicality that I wasn't born there,

840
00:49:09,851 --> 00:49:13,510
which actually worked against me
because you know, when you're not born,

841
00:49:13,511 --> 00:49:16,920
then when you're not born there, then
you're not from there. So they're low.

842
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,230
You're not born here and they're like,
oh yeah, but I've been here since I was,

843
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,270
you know, since I can remember. So
let's just put it that way. Right.

844
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:24,550
Remember actually worked,

845
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,550
they still hold it against you the six
months that you weren't oh yeah. Oh yeah,

846
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,010
we missed you bro. Oh, it's
months. We're, yeah, yeah.

847
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:34,990
Paying them out of your mother here
in the state. But yeah. But yeah,

848
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:38,260
since I was a little kid,
I mean my mom took me, uh,

849
00:49:38,261 --> 00:49:40,930
I was born in San Francisco and she
took me when I was a few months old.

850
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:42,970
I have a theory about people from Hawaii.

851
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:47,590
There's a groundedness that they
seem to exhibit that is universal.

852
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:51,460
It's almost,
you very rarely find completely frivolous,

853
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,930
dopey people that live in
Hawaii that they're not. Yeah,

854
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:59,270
I'm sure you find some people
that are not that smart, but you,

855
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,000
there's a groundedness.

856
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:05,500
There is so many of them have because
they're on a volcano. Yeah. Ocean.

857
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,461
And you know,

858
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:09,040
it was interesting that you talk about
that because yesterday we were having a

859
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:12,640
conversation about what is that right.
And we have a term, a couple terms.

860
00:50:12,641 --> 00:50:16,600
One of them is Mana, which is the power
from the land. Another one is Aloha,

861
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:20,530
which is our kind of a spirit of
how people act, uh, from Hawaii.

862
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:23,920
But I believe it has a lot to do with
islanders. I think islanders have that.

863
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,010
And I, and it has a lot to do with, uh,

864
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,490
it has a lot to do with the ocean
being around the ocean that the ocean

865
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:34,580
surrounding you and the ocean is the
most conductive substance on earth.

866
00:50:34,581 --> 00:50:39,470
So elect electrically and there's all
this thing. So you get influenced by this,

867
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,850
you know, and I think energetically
the nature is so powerful.

868
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:45,800
I think it puts us into a,

869
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:51,010
there's a certain kind of humility that
you have when you're in that you're next

870
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:54,860
to a volcano that's 14,000 foot and you've
got a 2000 foot waterfall and you got

871
00:50:54,861 --> 00:50:57,650
a giant wave. I mean, this is
stuff that kind of goes, oh yeah,

872
00:50:57,651 --> 00:51:01,760
we're just a little ants. We're this
little specks and we don't, it's humbling,

873
00:51:01,761 --> 00:51:05,960
but it's also inspiring and energizing.
Gives you power.

874
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,740
The Mana,
Mana.

875
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:11,200
I've always wondered why people
that live in peach communities are,

876
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:12,920
they're so chill.
Like I've wondered,

877
00:51:12,921 --> 00:51:16,340
is that because of just the humility
that you get when you just looking at the

878
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:19,940
ocean, the Blue Boomerang, have
you ever seen that book? No.

879
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:21,110
It's called the blue mind.

880
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,610
The guy's pretty interesting and he
does a study of why we gravitate towards

881
00:51:25,611 --> 00:51:29,030
being on the beach, why all the most
expensive real estate is beach front.

882
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,760
And that something about
when we stare at the ocean,

883
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:35,450
they did all these studies where the,
it just totally lights the brain up.

884
00:51:35,451 --> 00:51:39,140
That our whole something about the
horizon and about the ocean itself,

885
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:43,610
that that affects our whole
wellbeing. Uh, and, and part of it,

886
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:47,030
we don't even know why, but we're just
drawn like, why, you know, why is,

887
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:51,740
why are we drawn there? Why do
we, you know, and it has, it has,

888
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,480
uh, you know, an effect on our system.

889
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:58,760
I wonder if that's because we evolved
to be close to the water because that's

890
00:51:58,761 --> 00:52:01,550
where the bounty is,
where you can get fish.

891
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:06,010
And while we evolved from the water
without true, so here we call that the,

892
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:10,910
the whole aquatic ape theory. If you ever,
yeah, no, I haven't really, uh, you know,

893
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:15,920
uh, I haven't, I haven't, I haven't
really studied that. I, I mean,

894
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,380
you know, I, I know that,

895
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:23,420
I know that when you're around dolphins
and when you're around Wales, um, how,

896
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,600
and like, you know, it's interesting
today I was in the ocean and, and I,

897
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,780
and I felt something was
around and I could feel it.

898
00:52:29,781 --> 00:52:33,740
I just knew something was around. And
then it just five, 10 minutes later,

899
00:52:33,741 --> 00:52:38,120
a big sea lion kind of popped its head
up and went. But I could feel before,

900
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:41,810
uh, but, but you know, when you're around
those animals that are in the ocean,

901
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:47,180
you definitely feel a kindred spirit with
them unlike you do with land, animals,

902
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:49,310
you know, you don't really
have that mean. I mean, okay,

903
00:52:49,311 --> 00:52:53,210
maybe a wolf for dogs because we were
connected with them for 30,000 years.

904
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:58,010
We have that relationship. You feel
s something with a dog. But, uh,

905
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:02,210
but with the sea animals, like I say,
when the dolphins come around and you're,

906
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:06,290
you just feel some kind of,
there's just some there, you know,

907
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:08,500
and they say they've done some
studies with, you know, dolphins,

908
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:13,090
how would they effect kids that
have, you know, different, uh, uh,

909
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:16,160
disabilities and stuff and how
it, it totally helps them. And,

910
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:21,460
and so there's some healing ability and
actually dolphins are capable of having

911
00:53:22,071 --> 00:53:25,280
a collective consciousness. And that's
why they, when they get surrounded,

912
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:28,020
the big ones don't just jump out of the
net. They, everybody stays together.

913
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,500
So they, but, but again, you
know, the aquatic eight, but the,

914
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:35,370
that were from the ocean. I mean,
listen, we call it the super life, right?

915
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,670
They ocean is the,
is the reason why this,

916
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,510
why were we were here and why we can
be here? Because if it wasn't for that,

917
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:47,510
we would be, it'd be Mars and
it'd be hard to live there. Yeah.

918
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,970
There's a, this something that
attracts you to it. It's very strange.

919
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,490
It's very true when you stand there,
just so you could,

920
00:53:53,491 --> 00:53:57,210
it's peaceful just to sit down at the
beach and just stare out at the blue.

921
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,000
It is. Yeah. Well the
blue mind is a great book.

922
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:04,720
It's a beautiful book about talks about
that and the science behind that and the

923
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:08,000
effect it has on our system.
But you know,

924
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:11,610
in a way watching the ocean move is
a little bit like watching a fire.

925
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,620
You know how fire is mesmerizing.

926
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:17,160
You have a fireplace and you just watch
the flames move while the ocean has that

927
00:54:17,161 --> 00:54:20,100
movement. Um, and, and, uh, and, uh,

928
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:23,850
I'll sometimes I'll go to the beach and
I'll do a headstand and stand and look

929
00:54:23,851 --> 00:54:24,930
at the ocean upside down,

930
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,200
which is crazy because now it's the
ocean is the sky and the waves are moving

931
00:54:30,841 --> 00:54:34,950
opposite to what your brain is used
to. So it, it, it, it's, you know,

932
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:37,920
it's something when I'm doing,
when I'm bored at the beach.

933
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:41,130
Do you think you could
ever live in a city? Um,

934
00:54:41,131 --> 00:54:43,440
I've stayed in a city for a
little while before. I mean,

935
00:54:43,441 --> 00:54:45,740
I moved to Manhattan at one
point. We lived in, yeah,

936
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,600
I lived in Manhattan when
I was about 17 or 18.

937
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:50,460
I had some friends that
used to come to Hawaii.

938
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,550
They lived in Manhattan and they invited
me back for the summer and I lived

939
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:58,410
there for a summer. Um, and, uh, you
know, it was dangerous for me to be there.

940
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:03,360
That was dangerous because you're
kind of more trying to pull the wild,

941
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,770
you're a little more wild,
you know,

942
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:08,760
you're a little more like an animal and
then you're like, you're in confinement,

943
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,100
you know,
and there's just not enough nature.

944
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:14,910
Like I go to central park and swing off
trees and stuff, but that, you know,

945
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,480
that you only set only didn't so much.
How old were you at the time?

946
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,460
Like 17 or something like that.

947
00:55:20,461 --> 00:55:24,900
You felt like a real urge to
be around nature always. Yeah,

948
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,260
always pulled. Pulled too. I mean, I would
just go to central park all the time.

949
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:33,270
Yeah, no, that's interesting. Yeah, I
was just, I needed that. And you know,

950
00:55:33,271 --> 00:55:35,340
people don't realize when they
lived there, but when you,

951
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:40,110
when you're in a place with giant cement
buildings, you know, they're tall,

952
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:44,730
you're in fight or flight the whole time
because the big, yeah, because you're,

953
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,140
you're threatened by these big masses
that could fall over and hit. Yeah,

954
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,690
absolutely.
And you intuitively,

955
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:56,670
you're living in that and then the noise
and all of the, all the people. Cause I,

956
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,980
you know, I, I grew up sitting in
the back of the class, right. I,

957
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:01,680
I go to a restaurant, I find a
chair against the wall. Like I,

958
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:04,920
I go look for a chair and go, where's,
you know, I'll sit in the corner.

959
00:56:04,921 --> 00:56:08,240
I want to see what's coming. I like to see
what's coming. So, and you go, you know,

960
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:09,960
you go to New York and there's just,

961
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:14,940
you're bombarded from every single
angle and so you're in fight or flight.

962
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:18,660
You're just, you're constantly
on guard too. You know? You
don't know what's gonna.

963
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:23,500
You know, I'll take my
chances in the ocean. Yeah.

964
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:24,430
I love

965
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:29,110
visiting. Yeah. I love visiting.
Yeah. But as far as living there, man,

966
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,510
I just don't in my,

967
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:34,210
my friend Jeff lives there and he's like
the energy of the city who talks about

968
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:38,500
the energy. It's amazing. I'm like,
okay, well it's retail therapy too. Yeah.

969
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,660
Retail pair.
They said,

970
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:42,790
we tell Mecca gets why every
woman in the world moves there.

971
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:46,480
The other along the shop shop,
shop, and then your friend goes,

972
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:50,580
there's a lot of energy here is
all the people. People are moving,

973
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:53,100
they're doing things and makes
me want to do things. Yeah.

974
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,410
But I want to do things anyway.
I don't need that. Yeah. Yeah.

975
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,260
Well we weren't meant to live
stacked on top of each other.

976
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,930
That's not in our nature.
That's done in our biology.

977
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:05,110
Now is there an abundance of everything?
Yeah,

978
00:57:05,111 --> 00:57:09,040
there's a lot of things that
make it attractive right
into the tree. True. I mean,

979
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:10,660
there's beautiful women
that make it attractive.

980
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:13,810
There's don't blow all the food you ever
wanted to make it attractive. You know,

981
00:57:13,811 --> 00:57:16,750
there's all, there's an abundance of
stuff and there's always something you do.

982
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,380
You go to the theater,
you don't have to be self motivated,

983
00:57:20,381 --> 00:57:23,380
you don't have to be self driven, right.
You can just, there's always three,

984
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:23,860
you know,

985
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:28,860
10 parties and a bunch of
things and speakers and Cyan
and just anything you can

986
00:57:29,051 --> 00:57:31,180
think of,
there's every aspect of it.

987
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,390
So I think that's has an
attractiveness about it.

988
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:38,410
But in our essence,
do we belong in these,

989
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,820
these metropolises? Mm. They don't
really have any in nature that we,

990
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:46,360
so we wouldn't actually, that
wouldn't be a place that, you know,

991
00:57:46,361 --> 00:57:49,180
and we can only handle so
many people at once anyway.

992
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:52,660
Like we can only have real intimate
relationships with like a hundred and,

993
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:57,660
I don't know, 130 people or
something. Some crazy. That's
like one fifth yeah, yeah,

994
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:00,430
yeah. I'm, I'm, what I'm
fascinated by though,

995
00:58:00,431 --> 00:58:03,340
is that these things
exist everywhere and it's,

996
00:58:03,341 --> 00:58:06,160
cities exists in almost
every single country.

997
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:10,480
There's a place like a Manhattan or like
in la where everybody is just jammed in

998
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:14,200
together. Like what is it about people
that makes us want to live like this?

999
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,810
That's an interesting thing.
That's an interesting question.

1000
00:58:16,811 --> 00:58:21,490
Why are we attracted to that,
to that? Well, the abundance,
you know, that we're all,

1001
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:25,750
and we're, we're drawn to
go where everybody wants to
go a little bit like sheep,

1002
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:29,410
you know, like we all go where everybody
wants to go. Opportunity. I mean,

1003
00:58:29,411 --> 00:58:32,570
there's all these things that, you
know, why does every, why, why did,

1004
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:37,660
why does every city draw every young
person from the countryside, right?

1005
00:58:37,661 --> 00:58:42,250
Because of opportunity and
excitement and possibility.

1006
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,270
The possibilities.

1007
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,390
My friend Michael Mouse was on the show
yesterday and he was telling me that he

1008
00:58:46,391 --> 00:58:47,030
was choking.

1009
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:50,260
He swallowed a piece of food and he got
it stuck in his throat and he went to a

1010
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:54,370
table in Manhattan. He was in
Manhattan and he was like, I'm choking.

1011
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:56,710
And he said this to this table people,
and he said,

1012
00:58:56,711 --> 00:58:59,350
this woman just stared
at him with no reaction,

1013
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:03,130
like didn't smile on anything and he
coughed in the food, came up, he goes,

1014
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:07,600
I was choking to death. And she said,
well, you should take smaller bites.

1015
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:13,130
Like just the harshness, the harshness
of New York. It's like the, the,

1016
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:17,140
the value of a human being is so,

1017
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:20,950
so much less because there's so
many of them. Yeah, that's true.

1018
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:24,180
That's a problem in the earth.
Yeah. Right now our value for,

1019
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:29,160
and we become such a void where we
become such voyeurs of like, we'll,

1020
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:33,950
I'll just watch you die. I'll just,
I'll get a video of it and put it,

1021
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:38,180
you know, post the stuff that's, I
mean, yeah. Instead of like, wow,

1022
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:42,950
that guy needs help. He's hurting. Let's
let me help him right now. It's like, wow,

1023
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:47,060
let's see. You know what I mean? You
see it's a, it's a strange phenomenon.

1024
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,820
You'll get more help when there's
less people around then you will,

1025
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:52,430
when there's all the people
around. Yeah. They'll,

1026
00:59:52,431 --> 00:59:55,250
Debbie thought a thousand people and
they'll all just sit there and stare at a

1027
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:59,480
guy that's bleeding to death,
where when there's two people there,

1028
00:59:59,481 --> 01:00:02,630
one of the people will tourniquet the
guy's leg. Right, right, right. Look,

1029
01:00:02,631 --> 01:00:03,250
if you've met,

1030
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:06,470
if you saw someone in the woods fall and
break their leg and was just you two,

1031
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,300
you'd feel totally
connected to that person.

1032
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:10,160
Whereas if you saw someone
who's 100 people around,

1033
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,890
the guy falls or gets hit by a car,
you're like, well that ain't my problem.

1034
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,650
That ain't my problem. And everybody
goes, that's not my problem.

1035
01:00:15,651 --> 01:00:18,920
So I mean you the fusion
of responsibility. Yeah.

1036
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:20,470
It happens in large groups of people.

1037
01:00:20,471 --> 01:00:24,140
You feel like somebody is going to handle
this and no one does. Yeah, no one does.

1038
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:28,220
So yeah, there was a video that I watched
recently of this guy. There was a,

1039
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,500
I don't know what was happening,
but it was outside at night,

1040
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,360
some sort of a nightclub,
sort of a situation.

1041
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:35,930
This woman hit this guy and
this guy knocked out this
one woman and then another

1042
01:00:35,931 --> 01:00:38,600
girl came out of me, knocked her
out too. And the guys filming it.

1043
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:41,330
Someone's filming it and then not
doing anything about it. No one's,

1044
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:43,490
no one's tackling this guy.
No one's grabbing.

1045
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,690
The guy runs away successfully and then
the LAPD put a thing out looking for

1046
01:00:47,691 --> 01:00:48,291
this guy.
I'm like,

1047
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:51,080
how the fuck does the guy with
the camera live with themselves?

1048
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:55,460
How did you just exit them? Exact guy
punched to women. Exactly, exactly.

1049
01:00:55,461 --> 01:00:58,070
Unless you're a woman too. And the only
kind of what this guy fucking me up to,

1050
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:01,160
I don't know who all, you just hit him
with a brick then if I mean, you know,

1051
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:03,920
whatever. I mean just saying,
just, you know, drive your car,

1052
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:07,620
you drive your car on them. I'm
just wondering, you know, but it's,

1053
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:11,160
it is strange how we lose
our humanity in these jobs.

1054
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:13,730
We're doing it more to them now.
Just with all of the,

1055
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:18,770
there's a bunch of factors that are
playing in, into, into that right into,

1056
01:01:18,771 --> 01:01:19,730
into us.

1057
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:24,260
Kind of separating ourselves
from the person next door.

1058
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:28,550
They're right there, but we're,
we're over here. We're on our,

1059
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:32,780
on our device looking down, and they're
right next to us and we're like,

1060
01:01:32,781 --> 01:01:36,800
it's almost like we pray. We think
that that's an invisible screen. Yeah.

1061
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:39,830
This is all the thing about Hawaii
that I've always found interesting.

1062
01:01:39,831 --> 01:01:43,040
So you kind of know everybody,
so you can't be an asshole.

1063
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,800
That's a beautiful thing. Yeah.
You accountability, accountability,

1064
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:46,983
you're going to see him at the,

1065
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:48,710
you're going to see him at
the store in five minutes.

1066
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:52,250
So either you work it out and you agree
that you don't like each other and it's

1067
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:56,780
just like an accepted thing and, or you
work it out and you get through it. Yeah.

1068
01:01:56,781 --> 01:01:57,550
I love that.
Well,

1069
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:00,530
I love that about small towns to
small towns have the same thing.

1070
01:02:00,531 --> 01:02:04,370
But the thing about an island, it's a
small town with the notion around it.

1071
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:09,300
So there's really nowhere to go.
And you live on Kauai?

1072
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:13,760
Yeah, I grew up on Cola. How many people
live there? About 60 something now.

1073
01:02:13,761 --> 01:02:17,990
65,000 or so. That's hilarious. Yeah,
that's less than the big island,

1074
01:02:17,991 --> 01:02:19,810
which is pretty,
but it's big

1075
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,550
giant and Chinese like a hundred
something, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

1076
01:02:23,551 --> 01:02:27,420
I lived on Maui for a while, um, as
well, but I grew up on Coleco eyes. My,

1077
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:32,310
the is my, you know, that's my, that's
got my heart. It opens my heart.

1078
01:02:32,311 --> 01:02:35,460
So gorgeous. They're gorgeous.
And then you've got Honolulu,

1079
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:39,840
which might as well be Chicago
or something. Absolutely.
It's like city problem.

1080
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:44,250
Absolutely.
Annual city problems and a heavy military.

1081
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,080
So they have a huge military, you
know, and in the military, uh,

1082
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:52,590
influences a city like any, any, any
city that it has no military next to it.

1083
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:55,940
If there's an effect that the
military has on the city. Sure.

1084
01:02:55,941 --> 01:02:59,420
In Honolulu has that Honolulu is connected
to the military cause you got Pearl

1085
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:03,630
Harbor, all of that stuff. So, and then a
million people, which is insane. Insane.

1086
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:07,050
I'm the only NP gathering pay.
Honolua means the gathering place.

1087
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:09,670
So it's like where everybody goes to,
you know,

1088
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:12,600
and that's where the state capitol
is. That's our whole, that's our,

1089
01:03:12,601 --> 01:03:14,710
that's Waikiki. That's, you know, that,

1090
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:18,410
what does that one place become
so populated? It's, I tend to him,

1091
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:22,140
I don't know why it's, it's, you
know, I think it has to do with,

1092
01:03:22,141 --> 01:03:26,190
if you look at most places
that cities have been created,

1093
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:29,640
it's usually some geographical design,

1094
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:33,930
some shaped like a good harbor
and obviously Honolulu's
and incredible harbor.

1095
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:37,080
So great harbor, great protection. Um,

1096
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:42,090
so that probably has a lot to do with,
with, uh, the fact that it was developed.

1097
01:03:42,091 --> 01:03:45,600
Like it was because of the
nature of, and it was, you know,

1098
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:50,780
I used to say it like if you went to Rio
de Janeiro and no one was there and you

1099
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:54,690
showed up one day with a boat and
there was no one had built anything,

1100
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:59,840
it would be amazing if you showed up in
Manhattan and you went up the Hudson and

1101
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:05,850
you pulled up onto that island, you'd
be like, wow, this place is amazing.

1102
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:07,830
So in most of these places,
you know,

1103
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:11,700
if you're in Paris and you went in the
sand went around it, you'd be like, wow,

1104
01:04:11,701 --> 01:04:12,720
this.
So most,

1105
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:17,430
most of the places where cities have
been developed are amazing geographical

1106
01:04:17,431 --> 01:04:19,770
locations. And then
they, out of necessity,

1107
01:04:19,771 --> 01:04:21,810
they were easy to get through with boat.
You know,

1108
01:04:21,811 --> 01:04:25,500
that that has a big factor to it.
There's always some sort of, you know,

1109
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:30,150
Stra strategic, there's
something to astray, you know,
being a strategic partner,

1110
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:34,080
a location as well. But yeah,
well, I don't know why Honolulu, I,

1111
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:38,550
other than great for moring and harbors
and unprotected, real protected,

1112
01:04:38,551 --> 01:04:40,920
all that Pearl Harbor
stuff is very protected.

1113
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:45,030
And so that made it very easy to develop.

1114
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:49,650
If you didn't live there, what do you
think you'd live in another planet?

1115
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:58,710
I Love Alaska. You know, I, but I
don't think I honestly, you know, uh,

1116
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,620
both Gabby and I had been,
uh, splitting the years for,

1117
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:06,810
since we met and I realized that
I am, I'm nomadic. Like I'm,

1118
01:05:06,811 --> 01:05:09,900
or I'm that I really like,
like the animals.

1119
01:05:09,901 --> 01:05:14,520
I like to move in a season. It feels
more natural actually. And I, we,

1120
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:18,280
I kind of, with my daughters,
we of influence them that way,

1121
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:21,700
but I don't want to be anywhere all the
time. That's what I really realized.

1122
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:24,250
I realized that I'm not
good. Then I just, there's,

1123
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:27,970
well you'll get caught up in a domestic
with your neighbor and you'll just,

1124
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:28,331
they're just,

1125
01:05:28,331 --> 01:05:32,920
there's something about being in one
location all year round and it feels more

1126
01:05:32,921 --> 01:05:36,970
natural to move according to
the seasons. Right? Like, Hey,

1127
01:05:36,971 --> 01:05:40,510
it's summertime energize you go to, you
know, we come to California in the summer,

1128
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:44,470
the surface down in Hawaiian
in the summertime. That's
when the waves are flat.

1129
01:05:44,471 --> 01:05:47,460
So there's, they don't,
I don't have the sea to,

1130
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:50,020
which means I would shifted
to other land stuff.

1131
01:05:50,021 --> 01:05:54,370
It brings a whole set of opportunities.
It's like why would we go north? I mean,

1132
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:58,040
why would we go, uh, you know, in
north, in the summer because the,

1133
01:05:58,050 --> 01:05:59,140
it'd be a more abundant,

1134
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,900
but in the winter you wouldn't
go because he'd be too harsh.

1135
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,110
So it's a little bit like that
mentality where you move more.

1136
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,120
Like if you're hunting and gathering,

1137
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,850
you'd definitely be moving
according to the seasons.

1138
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:13,750
Like you go where the fruit was
when the fruit was, you know, good.

1139
01:06:13,751 --> 01:06:15,790
And you'd go where the hunting was great.

1140
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:17,680
When the hunting was good
and all of those things.

1141
01:06:17,681 --> 01:06:21,430
And that feels natural for me to just
be, you know, to be back and forth,

1142
01:06:21,431 --> 01:06:23,770
but to do like six months in each
places at what you did. Yeah.

1143
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:28,120
So you have Malibu and you could
die. Yeah. Yeah. That's nice. Well,

1144
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:31,600
and then you get to see both things
to both things and to open your mind,

1145
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:34,480
open your mind, open
your mind. And, and, uh,

1146
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,230
energetically Malibu is very
powerful. Like where we are, you know,

1147
01:06:38,231 --> 01:06:41,650
it's like Indian mountains and the
mountains meet the sea. And there's some,

1148
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:44,500
you know, people don't realize
how abundant that see life is too.

1149
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:48,700
They always all Malibu. They have like a
preconceived idea about what Malibu is,

1150
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:53,170
but Malibu's has, has, uh,
you know, Malibu Means Kate
Way to the sea and to Gash.

1151
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:56,260
That's a, that's an Indian
word. Malibu is the gate,

1152
01:06:56,470 --> 01:07:00,340
which is in a way as the valley that
opened from the plains where the buffalo

1153
01:07:00,341 --> 01:07:05,110
were to the fishing and the, and the,
and the ocean. So there's, there's some,

1154
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,950
you know, something to that place
that, that we feel comfortable.

1155
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:12,280
And if you're going to be here for us,
it's a, I can still be in the ocean.

1156
01:07:12,281 --> 01:07:15,640
I can still have that nature part
by then I can run into, you know,

1157
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:20,440
La and try to expand my brain a little
bit. Yeah, it is really a weird spot.

1158
01:07:20,441 --> 01:07:20,951
Right?
Look,

1159
01:07:20,951 --> 01:07:24,520
Malibu's got a weird combination of
really rich people that are completely

1160
01:07:24,521 --> 01:07:29,200
detached and they're on pills and the
PCH is a terrifying place to draw one of

1161
01:07:29,201 --> 01:07:29,920
the most dangerous,

1162
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,120
so many fucking drunk driving and
it's windy and you have the ocean.

1163
01:07:34,121 --> 01:07:39,121
So good them houses on cliff on the other
side of narrow winding and bad drivers

1164
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:45,200
in general. Just all our
drivers in America are terrible.
It's even the one that,

1165
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:47,050
there's something about that range too.

1166
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:52,000
There's so many bars and restaurants where
people drink terrace areas. That's a,

1167
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:55,750
that's a wickedly dangerous road.
But this, this detached people.

1168
01:07:55,751 --> 01:07:58,900
And then I've had friends that had their
kids go to Malibu High and the Lord

1169
01:07:58,901 --> 01:08:01,750
Jesus Christ's, everyone's doing
drugs. It's all fucked up. Yeah.

1170
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:04,930
And the children of these rich
people are often neglected,

1171
01:08:04,931 --> 01:08:07,770
raised by their nannies. Oh
yeah. Parents aren't home.

1172
01:08:07,771 --> 01:08:12,670
And yet they're just so you have that
contracted by some of the coolest people

1173
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:15,980
ever. And so you, and you have some of
the people that don't to live in town,

1174
01:08:15,981 --> 01:08:19,310
that work in the industry, highly
successful, that want this.

1175
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:21,590
They want nature and they want
to be in there and they'll,

1176
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:26,480
they're willing to drive that coast
highway every day and go to work in town

1177
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:30,440
just to have the balance of being in
the sanctuary. So, you know, it's,

1178
01:08:30,441 --> 01:08:34,010
it's what we always say, bright, light,
dark shadow. I mean, it's the nature of,

1179
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:38,930
it's what you get with it, you know, with
the, with the greatness you get is the,

1180
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:43,190
you know, the destruction that
attracts weirdoes. Yeah, it does. Yeah.

1181
01:08:43,191 --> 01:08:48,050
There's so many strange, eclectic people.
ECLECTIC. Yeah. Which kind of makes it,

1182
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:51,920
but it makes it great too. Like if you're
up for the good group, you got guys,

1183
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:56,630
you know, you'd go to the store and you
got guys that are, that are, uh, you know,

1184
01:08:56,631 --> 01:08:59,990
that lived in Malibu for their whole life.
It's their kids. They don't, you know,

1185
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:03,700
they live up up one of the canyons
and they're totally grounded and, and,

1186
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:06,360
and you know, and then you got
right next to him, some, you know,

1187
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:10,070
giant mansion and it with like you said,
you know,

1188
01:09:10,071 --> 01:09:11,910
kids that are neglected and yeah,

1189
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,800
but there's some good ocean there
and there's some good mountains.

1190
01:09:14,801 --> 01:09:19,720
So for like mountain bikes and, and
ocean activities, it's pretty, you know,

1191
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,580
the land stuff's always going to be
tricky with the humans. You know,

1192
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:24,320
you get the humans,
they're on land.

1193
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,220
We rented a place on the water for like
three months when we're getting our

1194
01:09:28,221 --> 01:09:33,050
kitchen done. And it was crazy. Like you
just sit there, wake up, eat breakfast,

1195
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:37,970
you're on the water. Yeah. It's just,
yeah. And the place we were at it was,

1196
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:40,910
the water would literally come
under the edge of the house.

1197
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,030
So it looks like you're
sitting on the lot. Well,

1198
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:47,960
it's like being on a boat and you watch
and do sea otters and all this wildlife

1199
01:09:47,961 --> 01:09:52,160
and birds. Yeah. Amazing. Yeah. You
don't want to own one of those houses,

1200
01:09:52,161 --> 01:09:56,060
but they're nice to stay in. Well if you
own it, you really don't own it for long.

1201
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:59,060
No, not in this day and age.
Especially if we get it.

1202
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:00,650
We never know we're
going to get a big wave.

1203
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:05,330
So I'm always gun shy about being on the
water, you know, living on the water.

1204
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:10,000
I think I, when I was a kid
we had to evacuate and so
I'm assuming something, uh,

1205
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:14,630
for giant surf, huge, huge surf. So we
had to leave our house in our house.

1206
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:19,610
A bunch of houses got push across the
road and Whoa, 1969 which was a surprise.

1207
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:21,200
Yeah.
So I've always been,

1208
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:25,760
I think I've had a thing in the back
of my head like at one besides highly

1209
01:10:25,761 --> 01:10:29,000
expensive, but just living on the beach.
It's like, no, I'll go to the beach,

1210
01:10:29,001 --> 01:10:29,960
I'll be at the beach all day.

1211
01:10:29,961 --> 01:10:34,460
But then I want to be away and like I
want to go home and be away and not have

1212
01:10:34,461 --> 01:10:39,230
sand in my bed and not have salt
on my TV and you know, not have,

1213
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:42,990
like everything gets corroded, corroded.
Well you have to build a boat. Yeah,

1214
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:44,780
you should.
If you build a house there,

1215
01:10:44,781 --> 01:10:49,400
just pretend it's a boat
and that you don't have to
worry about sinking or maybe,

1216
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:53,410
I mean it might say, might say slowly. How
far away do you live from the water? Uh,

1217
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:55,730
I'm about a mile as the crow flies,

1218
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,770
but I'm up a hill so I overlook a,
I overlook the ocean and I could see a,

1219
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:01,940
and then I don't have any neighbors.

1220
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:05,420
I have only one neighbor on the front and
back and that both sides, no neighbors.

1221
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:09,140
So it's, I've always liked
being on hills and being back.

1222
01:11:09,141 --> 01:11:12,500
I just seems that's where I end up.
I just saw some views,

1223
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:16,960
I think views really good for your brain,
good for your brain to be up and, and,

1224
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:21,300
and let everything fall below. Good
for the brain. Soothing on the mind.

1225
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:25,500
What is this a physical training
company that you're doing?

1226
01:11:25,501 --> 01:11:29,700
You're doing something XPT
yeah. What is that? X T is a,

1227
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:33,090
I would describe it as a,
a kind of a,

1228
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:38,000
it's a lifestyle program that
evolved out of what, how I,

1229
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:42,300
we live like what we, what
we do. And so we started a,

1230
01:11:42,301 --> 01:11:45,810
an experiential thing where people can
come for like two and a half days and go

1231
01:11:45,811 --> 01:11:47,130
through this,
you know,

1232
01:11:47,131 --> 01:11:50,640
get exposed to speakers and they do
heat and ice and we do pool training and

1233
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:54,700
breath work and mobility and
conferences and stuff there. Uh,

1234
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:58,320
exposed to speakers. Like, what do
you mean? Well, I'll invite, you know,

1235
01:11:58,321 --> 01:12:01,220
I would invite you to come
and speak for an hour or I'd,

1236
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:05,580
I'd invite a Paul Chek or we'd have
somebody speak on longevity or somebody

1237
01:12:05,581 --> 01:12:09,300
speak on, you know, just have during the,

1238
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:13,880
during the experience we'll have a couple
speakers talk on, you know, nutrition,

1239
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,000
fitness, wellness, career
whenever, just as something as a,

1240
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:22,770
another piece of the, of the element.
And then, uh, and then, and like I said,

1241
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:24,390
we have pool training and then we try,

1242
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:28,650
and we've been certifying trainers now
to kind of help people go through the

1243
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:31,290
process as well. And so
it's, you know, it's,

1244
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:35,370
it's really about rest and recovery
and breathing. It's more based on,

1245
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:39,450
on that part is not just another training
thing of like, hey, how, you know,

1246
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:43,560
how we can hammer you. I mean
it's, I think that's overplayed.

1247
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:47,850
I think the ways we can train and, and
how we're training is really overplayed.

1248
01:12:47,851 --> 01:12:52,760
I think we're, we're not creating enough
things that nurture the system, you know,

1249
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:57,210
and really look at trying to, to
support people in their, in their,

1250
01:12:57,450 --> 01:13:00,270
in their already, you
know, hammering life.

1251
01:13:00,271 --> 01:13:02,190
They're already just beating
themselves down. It's like,

1252
01:13:02,191 --> 01:13:05,010
let's get off the red eye and then
we'll go to the gym and we'll hammer

1253
01:13:05,011 --> 01:13:09,480
ourselves there and then we'll stay up
all day. And, you know, and I think we,

1254
01:13:09,481 --> 01:13:12,960
they need some support. So
breathwork is a big part of it. Um,

1255
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:14,280
knowing how to move correctly,

1256
01:13:14,281 --> 01:13:16,860
I think that's a big part of it because
plenty of people hurt themselves,

1257
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:19,080
especially in the gym,
be without, you know,

1258
01:13:19,081 --> 01:13:21,600
without some knowledge
of movement in form.

1259
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:25,050
And then I have a pool
training system I developed,

1260
01:13:25,051 --> 01:13:27,780
which is the Gabby was telling me
about. That sounds crazy. Yeah.

1261
01:13:27,781 --> 01:13:31,320
That's the most proprietary
thing I think we have is, um,

1262
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:35,430
it's a marriage between the CIM and the
in the pool because I despise swimming.

1263
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:39,780
Um, yeah, I know. I do.

1264
01:13:39,781 --> 01:13:43,230
I just want to you if you
said go do laps in the pool,

1265
01:13:43,231 --> 01:13:47,070
I'd be like Shambhu and I'd get the
floppy fin and all. Yeah, I just,

1266
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,900
it's just crazy out here.
Fucking serve. Know what I'm
saying? But, but if you said,

1267
01:13:51,901 --> 01:13:55,230
hey, we're going to take these masks in
this fins and we're going to swim this

1268
01:13:55,231 --> 01:13:58,380
coastline where the waves are breaking
on the rocks and we're going to go for

1269
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,330
five miles. I man, like
I, but if you said, hey,

1270
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:05,240
go down there and, and, and,

1271
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:09,180
and where some swim goggles where you
can't even see and swimming some murky

1272
01:14:09,181 --> 01:14:12,070
water where you don't know what's in
it and we're going to swim a mile down

1273
01:14:12,071 --> 01:14:13,250
there and you're going
to do that every day.

1274
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:16,960
That I'd rather step on a
rusty nail than do that.

1275
01:14:16,961 --> 01:14:19,960
I mean it's like that's so because of my,

1276
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:25,080
my disdain for swimming, that kind
of swimming, I mean, I, if it's,

1277
01:14:25,081 --> 01:14:28,420
if it's in the surf and the waves, that's
a different, that's a different game.

1278
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:31,750
That's a whole different, they don't want
to do laps in the pool. You'd kill me.

1279
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:35,140
I'm going to die. I just, I
would rather, yeah. I just,

1280
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:36,460
I'd rather hit my hand with a hammer,

1281
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,770
just enjoy moving in the water. But
I do with some dumbbells. Oh, okay.

1282
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,190
So carrying a dumbbell and
jumping with and dumbbells.

1283
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:52,830
And why did you start at x p t like
what was the motivation because you're,

1284
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:57,520
you're obviously into doing
this stuff yourself. Why
create a foundation or, well,

1285
01:14:57,521 --> 01:15:00,310
the reason why we started it was because,
uh,

1286
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:02,920
an opportunity to expose this stuff
and share it with more people.

1287
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,750
We were doing it ourselves naturally.

1288
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:07,660
And then we have friends come and
they were like, this stuff's awesome.

1289
01:15:07,661 --> 01:15:10,090
And then can I invite my friend?
And then we were,

1290
01:15:10,091 --> 01:15:14,550
we realized that that if we really wanted
to expose it to more people and share

1291
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,220
it,
we were going to,

1292
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:18,190
it was going to be a limitation if
everybody had to come to my house.

1293
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:21,880
Do you have like a website and everything?
Yeah. What does the t stand for?

1294
01:15:21,881 --> 01:15:26,620
Xpt Lie, uh, XPT life.com
and XPT stands for,

1295
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:31,510
well, my, my concept is it's an
exploration in performance training.

1296
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:35,080
Ah, there is high performance
fuels, a limitless life.

1297
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,720
Dumbbells in the pool. There is,
oh yeah. So this is all yours.

1298
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:43,260
[inaudible] I need to, yeah, you
have to come. Well, I'm just,

1299
01:15:43,261 --> 01:15:48,070
and it's Kyle Kingsborough. Yeah.
I love that guy. Yeah. The, uh,

1300
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:50,380
while I have some beautiful guys come,
like,

1301
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:54,220
I'll give you a great thing that you
appreciate it as a, I have this whole,

1302
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:57,640
well first of all there's a bunch of
things that happen in the water, right?

1303
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,310
Which one of the things that
happens is when you're underwater,

1304
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:04,150
the compression of the water allows the
blood to flow through your lymphatic

1305
01:16:04,151 --> 01:16:08,410
system, which normally takes about a
24 hour period. It happens in one hour.

1306
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:11,720
So imagine compression tights, like
you know, if you wear compression,

1307
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:15,400
it really helps the blood flow, right?
Well this is the ultimate compression.

1308
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:18,640
The water is right.
So then you deal with the psychology.

1309
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:21,130
So it's good for fighters
like Aye, Aye, Aye,

1310
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:26,140
Aye fighters because of the psychology
of what we can do because you deal a lot

1311
01:16:26,141 --> 01:16:27,670
with stress.

1312
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,470
So we're able to implement stress in a
very controlled environment. Um, and then,

1313
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:35,350
and then, uh, and then
like for example, uh,

1314
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,830
and grant hill at one point in his career,
but I have loved friend joke, Kim Noah,

1315
01:16:38,831 --> 01:16:41,650
who's a basketball player
and we were doing these, uh,

1316
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:45,670
we're doing these in the water. We're
doing these dunking drills last summer.

1317
01:16:45,671 --> 01:16:49,360
So I trained with him and get a bunch of
stuff cause you can do a lot of highly

1318
01:16:49,361 --> 01:16:50,260
explosive,

1319
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:55,440
heavy loaded movement with protection
because now you don't have to worry about

1320
01:16:55,451 --> 01:16:57,460
momentum, which is what you're
going to pull your shoulder out.

1321
01:16:57,461 --> 01:16:59,230
It's gonna throw your hip,
it's going to hurt your knee.

1322
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:02,950
Where I could take a basketball player
and I can run him through thousands of

1323
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:07,000
jumps. Thousands, which at the
end of, if I did that on land,

1324
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:10,460
he would be broken.
He's already jumping much in his season.

1325
01:17:10,461 --> 01:17:13,220
He doesn't need to jump more.
Right? So I could load him up and,

1326
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:17,120
and make him do these dynamic movements.
But now he's protected because he's,

1327
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:21,140
because we've taken gravity out. So we're
at, so it's, it's like, it's like saying,

1328
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:24,830
hey, we get to go trade in outer space,
but it's in my backyard right now.

1329
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:28,110
What kind of results of these
athletes boils parents? Well,

1330
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:32,480
so Joe Kim in his career, and I don't
know how many years he's been in the NBA,

1331
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:37,280
he came back after doing this dunking job,
just using this as an example. And, uh,

1332
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:42,050
it had the most dunks per minute that
he's had in his entire career. Whoa.

1333
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,930
He was like Dunkin on it.
It was slamming on everybody.

1334
01:17:44,931 --> 01:17:48,950
I mean it helps that he's seven feet
tall. But the fact is, is that he, he,

1335
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:51,830
he noticed now, uh, uh, you know,

1336
01:17:51,831 --> 01:17:54,710
grant hill was talking about he gained
three inches in the last year of his

1337
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:56,280
career after playing in
the NBA for 20 years.

1338
01:17:56,281 --> 01:17:58,850
All of sudden he's jumping
three inches higher. Yeah. Yeah.

1339
01:17:58,851 --> 01:18:02,300
So I mean we're getting,
we're, I'm, that's the kind
of tangible stuff that I'm,

1340
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:05,750
that I, that I'm getting just
that there's a lot more things,

1341
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:08,750
a lot of it has to do
with breadth because, uh,

1342
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:10,970
in the water it's all
controlled breathing patterns.

1343
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:14,060
So everything is controlled because you
can't breathe until you get to the top.

1344
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:17,460
So if you're doing a drill where you're
jumping, and in most of the things we do,

1345
01:18:17,461 --> 01:18:20,400
our leg driven swimming is mostly arms.

1346
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:23,810
And part of the reason why people only
use her arms is cause you use five times

1347
01:18:23,811 --> 01:18:26,690
the oxygen with your legs
as you do with your arms.

1348
01:18:26,691 --> 01:18:29,180
So the legs are very
inefficient for swimming,

1349
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:31,310
but yet they create a lot
of load on your heart,

1350
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:36,080
which that can boost your breath holding.
And so there's a bunch of other,

1351
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:38,230
other, uh, things that happened,

1352
01:18:38,231 --> 01:18:41,720
but a lot of it is just that
environment is very protective.

1353
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,580
So for recovery too, for
like what somebody got a hurt
knee, hurt, hip, hurt ankle,

1354
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:50,990
you can go in there and start moving
dynamically early before you would ever do

1355
01:18:50,991 --> 01:18:54,950
it on land and be protected. So
there's a bunch of, you know,

1356
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:58,250
and then we can just ratchet it
up. I can make, you know, if I it,

1357
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:01,370
I truly believe if you
gate, if you said, you know,

1358
01:19:01,371 --> 01:19:04,250
I'll get few Phelps is going to come
to your house and you're going to have

1359
01:19:04,251 --> 01:19:08,480
Phelps for three months. I could
make felts faster. Yeah. This is,

1360
01:19:08,481 --> 01:19:09,950
this is this.
I'm so I'm,

1361
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:12,470
he's doing a dunking drill and
he's using a medicine ball,

1362
01:19:12,471 --> 01:19:14,660
but he's having to jump out
at three feet of water. Right.

1363
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:18,860
So when he gets on land,
when he gets on land,

1364
01:19:18,861 --> 01:19:23,750
it's like he's like a he, it's
like a whole other game. Yeah,

1365
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:27,860
I would imagine a whole nother game.
Now did you invent this protocol?

1366
01:19:27,861 --> 01:19:32,090
This whole thing of yapping and doing it
in the water. What, what motivated you?

1367
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:36,680
Well, I came in the original
concept came out of the a a drill,

1368
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:39,950
not a drill. A thing we used to do
in the summer when we were kids.

1369
01:19:39,951 --> 01:19:44,150
That's a Hawaiian kind of watermen drill
where you run on the bottom with stones.

1370
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:47,030
So seeing that Bj Penn does that
stuff. Yeah. So you get a stone,

1371
01:19:47,031 --> 01:19:48,890
you run along the bottom,
then you put it down,

1372
01:19:48,891 --> 01:19:52,580
then your friends swims along the
surface. And then when he, when you go up,

1373
01:19:52,581 --> 01:19:53,720
he swims down,
grabs it,

1374
01:19:53,721 --> 01:19:57,050
and then he goes along as far as he can
and you swim and you just go back and

1375
01:19:57,051 --> 01:19:58,580
forth until neither one of you can do it.

1376
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:01,970
So it was based kind of on that concept.
And then,

1377
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:04,700
but I wanted to expand that
because that's kind of limiting.

1378
01:20:04,701 --> 01:20:09,701
You just swam and you run and you
can't isolate movements and you're not

1379
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:12,570
working, uh, a like
you can with dumbbells.

1380
01:20:12,571 --> 01:20:16,380
So now I shift dumbbells into the water
and, and I have all different weights. So,

1381
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:18,900
depending on your skill level,
you know, everything we do.

1382
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:20,360
And that's one thing about,
uh,

1383
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:24,810
everything that I'm involved in
is it usually has to have a spa.

1384
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:29,280
It has to be able to be, uh, you
know, for everybody to do it.

1385
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:33,360
It has to be old people and kids too,
in my mind,

1386
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:36,090
that it's not viable unless it's,

1387
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:39,720
if you can appeal to everybody
that you need, you need to,

1388
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:43,830
a kids needs to be able to do it. An old
person to be able to really be valid,

1389
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:47,580
that really have legitimacy.
You know, it's like, okay,
the coffee, it's has to be,

1390
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:50,780
there has to be things that the kids can,
can have that creamer.

1391
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:53,850
The old people can have it. It's gotta
be good. You can't just be specialized.

1392
01:20:53,851 --> 01:20:58,340
I think the specialization of some
of this stuff is, creates, uh,

1393
01:20:58,700 --> 01:20:59,880
the lack of validity.

1394
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:03,650
I don't think that it's valid
if it's specialized and so the,

1395
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:04,620
I can take a little kid,

1396
01:21:04,621 --> 01:21:07,860
like my daughter does a bunch of the pool
training stuff, right? I have an older,

1397
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:10,740
older guys that come and do a bunch
of the pool training stuff. You know,

1398
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:13,680
I got Pat Riley comes in there and he
trained in the summer time with us and

1399
01:21:13,681 --> 01:21:18,390
stuff. Yeah. Yeah. So we get a fairly
broad spectrum of people and that,

1400
01:21:18,391 --> 01:21:22,260
and that confirms to me that
it's really legitimate. Right?

1401
01:21:22,261 --> 01:21:25,320
Because then it's like, no, this
is real. Like the kids can do it.

1402
01:21:25,321 --> 01:21:28,710
The old people can do it. The top guys
can do it. The bottom guys can do it.

1403
01:21:28,711 --> 01:21:33,380
Everybody can do it. Then you know
that that's something that's, that's I,

1404
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:37,950
I just think that that's, you
know, what, what, what is real?

1405
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:42,150
So how many years have you been
doing this? Um, XPT well, I mean,

1406
01:21:42,151 --> 01:21:46,620
the pool training I've been, I developed
over the last probably 10 to 12 years.

1407
01:21:46,621 --> 01:21:49,700
About 12 years now in the pool
with any of you have evolved it.

1408
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:52,270
So you start off with a couple ideas.
I avail.

1409
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:56,810
I had like a velcro wait jacket where you
felt crowed. Like, Oh yeah, wait, yeah.

1410
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:57,750
Jumping into the deep end.

1411
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,900
It was a little scary to get the
jacket off and how can you get up?

1412
01:22:00,901 --> 01:22:04,830
So that wasn't, that wasn't,
that wasn't viable. So that was,

1413
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:09,540
so then we moved to have dumbbells where
you can drop them. But, but we, you know,

1414
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:13,410
there's probably 20 exercises that
we watch. Are you using, it depends.

1415
01:22:13,411 --> 01:22:16,410
Sometimes we're doing, we have a move
called the gorilla where we're using,

1416
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:20,520
you know, 60 to 70 70 pound dumbbells
where you're doing a curl, press jump.

1417
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:25,740
So you g and you're jumping on the slope.
So your curl pressing and jumping with,

1418
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:29,850
with uh, with, you know, 60, 70 pound
dumbbells, depending on your size.

1419
01:22:29,851 --> 01:22:32,430
We're swimming with 50 pounds,
60 pound dumbbells.

1420
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:35,160
We're jumping off the bottom
with 15 pound dumbbells.

1421
01:22:35,161 --> 01:22:39,420
That depends on the exercise.
So it's all depends on the person's skill,

1422
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:43,230
what the drill is. But we, I have a whole,
I have all the weights next to the pool,

1423
01:22:43,231 --> 01:22:47,030
so we have everything from seventies
to to five pound dumbbells.

1424
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,860
I love that idea of the jump press,

1425
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:54,990
like doing some sort of a, Oh yeah,
it's all, you'd love it. It's crazy.

1426
01:22:54,991 --> 01:22:58,800
I call it the gorilla curl.
So it's a squat curl,

1427
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:01,920
press jump. And then you, when
you come out of the water,

1428
01:23:01,921 --> 01:23:04,480
you just let the weights drop
and then the water catches him.

1429
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:07,630
You could never that Atlanta d rip
your shoulder out. Right? Right.

1430
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:11,170
How deep you do this in the water while
you very on your height. So I have,

1431
01:23:11,171 --> 01:23:15,760
I have, uh, about, uh, 11 foot
deep end, and then I have a slope.

1432
01:23:15,761 --> 01:23:17,500
So you can choose every depth all the way.

1433
01:23:17,501 --> 01:23:20,530
And then I have what you
saw in that last video.

1434
01:23:20,531 --> 01:23:24,130
It's about a three and a half foot
shallow end. So this is the first pool.

1435
01:23:24,131 --> 01:23:27,220
I'm trying to build a couple. I'm trying
to build one in Hawaii right now. That's,

1436
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:31,450
that's going to evolve from what I
learned from this pool. So this pool,

1437
01:23:31,451 --> 01:23:34,270
I just kind of built it with,
you know,

1438
01:23:34,271 --> 01:23:38,650
with the hopes of designing a program
and then out of it came all they,

1439
01:23:38,651 --> 01:23:41,450
all this stuff. What are
you going to alter? Um,

1440
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:44,260
I'm going to create multiple depths.

1441
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:46,780
So I'm going to do like
an area that has 12 foot.

1442
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:50,590
Then we're going to shift back to feet
and have a 10 foot and then another flat

1443
01:23:50,591 --> 01:23:53,350
area of eight foot.
And then another flat area is six foot.

1444
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:58,680
And then I have the magic width is about
somewhere between 35 to 40 feet wide.

1445
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:01,930
And that's like if you're
trying to swim a heavy Dumbbell,

1446
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:06,880
you know we do a lot of individual limb
stuff so that you isolate each limb.

1447
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:11,590
So we'll do pistol squats and Russian
lunch squats and a bunch of other,

1448
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:14,440
you know,
and and movements that you can,

1449
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:17,630
you'd be very vulnerable if you
did that in the gym. You can,

1450
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,060
chances are you could hurt yourself,

1451
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:23,620
but because you have that stability in
that environment, it totally supports you.

1452
01:24:23,621 --> 01:24:28,270
So you can, you can be a and go into
ranges of motion that you don't have.

1453
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:29,170
Like you,
you know,

1454
01:24:29,171 --> 01:24:33,880
you might not be able to go sink all the
way down into a deep lunge on one leg

1455
01:24:33,881 --> 01:24:38,750
and press out with dumbbells in your hand
on land. But in the water you can and,

1456
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:40,240
and the water actually makes it lighter,

1457
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:41,800
so you have to boost the weight and stuff.

1458
01:24:41,801 --> 01:24:45,550
So there's a bunch of great stuff
that comes out of it that sounds very

1459
01:24:45,551 --> 01:24:50,350
attractive to people that
have had injuries. Beautiful.
And what, but the irony is,

1460
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:51,340
is it kind of,

1461
01:24:51,730 --> 01:24:55,930
it's a little bit like what comes out
of Rehab where you actually get better

1462
01:24:55,931 --> 01:24:58,300
performance to like, like, you know,

1463
01:24:58,301 --> 01:25:03,301
a lot of a lot of rehab exercises
become performance driving exercises,

1464
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:06,580
you know, it's like, Hey, don't do
that shit. Only when you get hurt,

1465
01:25:06,830 --> 01:25:10,750
start doing that and get strong that way.
So then you'd maybe won't get her. Yes.

1466
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,200
Yeah. You know, so it comes that
way too. It goes both directions.

1467
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:18,760
And do you have workouts that people
can follow online if someone goes to the

1468
01:25:18,761 --> 01:25:23,440
XPT life is XPT life. Yes. And help me
to life website. Yeah. And we actually,

1469
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:25,630
the thing that we have, the,
the thing we have right now,

1470
01:25:25,631 --> 01:25:28,750
there's probably the
most, uh, the most, uh,

1471
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,530
kind of prevalent one thing
that's happening as soon as,

1472
01:25:31,531 --> 01:25:32,980
as we have a breathing APP coming out.

1473
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:37,820
So we have a breathing app that has
almost every different modality of breath

1474
01:25:37,821 --> 01:25:41,230
work. And so there's some
pretty cool stuff in there
where you can go choose, hey,

1475
01:25:41,231 --> 01:25:44,740
before I go to sleep or before my
workout, after my workout, you know,

1476
01:25:44,741 --> 01:25:49,030
during my thing. So we have a bunch of,
we have a pretty cool breathing app, uh,

1477
01:25:49,031 --> 01:25:53,050
that, that we're working on as well.
So you ever talked to Wim Hoff? I know.

1478
01:25:53,051 --> 01:25:55,930
When do you know him? Oh, absolutely.
Yeah. Oh yeah. I'm doesn't,

1479
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,810
he doesn't give a fuck if you breathe
out of your nose, your mouth. I was like,

1480
01:25:58,990 --> 01:26:03,830
just, I know, I know.
He doesn't get so crazy.

1481
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:06,980
I love that guy. He's comedy.
No, I have, I've had a few,

1482
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:10,910
I've him women. I've had a few,
we've had a few experiences,

1483
01:26:10,911 --> 01:26:12,470
let's just put it that way.
But we've had him at it.

1484
01:26:12,650 --> 01:26:15,830
We've had them at a couple of experiences
and I've done some stuff with whim.

1485
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:20,570
I've known him for like four or five
years now. Maybe, maybe a little longer.

1486
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,730
So he'll keep,
comes usually when he was in town,

1487
01:26:22,731 --> 01:26:26,420
I think the last time maybe when
you, when you saw him, he, he came,

1488
01:26:26,421 --> 01:26:30,310
he comes to visit. So I get, um, I,
if I, usually when I go with whim,

1489
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,500
I usually translate for him.
When he goes to one of his classes,

1490
01:26:33,501 --> 01:26:38,090
I'm usually like trying to, oh, in case
people don't understand all I know,

1491
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:40,700
but I'm just saying sometimes I'll
be with somebody, they'll be like,

1492
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:45,380
what'd he say? I'll be like, what he
means is take a deep breath. Yeah.

1493
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:48,350
He's such a character.
He is a character guy.

1494
01:26:48,351 --> 01:26:51,950
Went to fucking the top of Everest
barefoot. Oh yeah. Like, well, yeah.

1495
01:26:51,951 --> 01:26:56,690
Almost lost his toes to, yeah, yeah,
yeah. No, he goes, yeah. Well, he's,

1496
01:26:56,750 --> 01:27:00,610
he's his art actually, uh, is, uh,

1497
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:03,560
two ml is, is a, is a derivative of to,

1498
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:07,790
and I'm not sure if you know what to mow
is, but to moe is a Himalayan breathing,

1499
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:10,970
uh, technique that the, that the, uh,

1500
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:14,360
the monks have that they were, they, uh,

1501
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:18,440
they have this one thing where they
dry sheets. So they have this thing,

1502
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:22,980
the ceremony where they go at night
in the Himalayas when it's frozen,

1503
01:27:22,981 --> 01:27:27,410
it's snow and the guy sits there and they
put wet sheets, wet blankets on them,

1504
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:31,670
and they breathe and get their bodies
so hot that they dry the blankets.

1505
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:31,861
And then,

1506
01:27:31,861 --> 01:27:35,200
then the guide that can drive the most
blankets at the end of the night is the,

1507
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:38,660
is like the guy, you know,
but it's, yeah, yeah.

1508
01:27:38,710 --> 01:27:42,110
It's called [inaudible] and it's a,
you can go online and look it up. Uh,

1509
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:43,430
to moe is a,
is a,

1510
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:48,520
is a Himalayan breathing technique that
that was never exposed to westerners

1511
01:27:48,521 --> 01:27:50,840
big, um, until just as of recently.

1512
01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:55,750
But the whims whims a work
is a derivative of, of tumo.

1513
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,980
But nose breathe,
it's all about nose breathing.

1514
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:00,620
It's all about nose breathing and
when you understand the science of it,

1515
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:04,700
but he's right about getting people
to just breathe because people are not

1516
01:28:04,701 --> 01:28:09,680
breathing. And um, we just had, in
fact we had another, uh, Bill. Lissa,

1517
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:15,080
what's your, I want to save,
uh, it's a Russian name but,
but she has a great book.

1518
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:20,000
She trains fire, fire and
police and military, um,

1519
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:23,840
breathing. We just had her at, we
did an XPT in Miami about a week,

1520
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:27,810
two weeks ago and uh,
and she came as a guest speaker and we,

1521
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:32,450
and was working on really trying to
create more volume and then are a lot of

1522
01:28:32,451 --> 01:28:36,290
people's rib cages aren't moving
and so they have a whole, you know,

1523
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:39,740
there's ways to try to increase your
movement of your rib cage, your rib cage.

1524
01:28:39,741 --> 01:28:41,930
You'd actually open,
like you,

1525
01:28:41,931 --> 01:28:45,440
you could take a tape and measure your
rib cage when you are fully exhaled.

1526
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:49,220
And then when you inhale it
should expand like, you know,

1527
01:28:49,221 --> 01:28:53,570
three inches or more for you to
be really optimally breathing.

1528
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:55,040
And a lot of people,
I mean,

1529
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:58,520
part of it has to do with the whole
six pack abs and what's aesthetically

1530
01:28:58,521 --> 01:29:02,850
pleasing. But meanwhile, when you have
a real nice six set of six pack abs,

1531
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:05,730
you don't, you're not able
to diaphragmatically breathe.

1532
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:07,200
You're not able to use your diaphragm.

1533
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:10,920
You're not using your diaphragm when you
have that. Yeah. Because you're, you're,

1534
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:15,120
the tightness isn't allowing the diaphragm
to push down the diaphragm and the

1535
01:29:15,121 --> 01:29:19,920
pell and the pelvic floor actually
squeeze your organs together. And,

1536
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:23,130
and that is actually massaging the organs,

1537
01:29:23,131 --> 01:29:25,380
which influences your
digestion and everything.

1538
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:29,010
And the deals with a bunch of acid
reflex and a bunch of others things.

1539
01:29:29,011 --> 01:29:33,900
But when the, when the, when the,
the ABS are so tight that, that the,

1540
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:38,220
that the stomach can expand,
the organs can't push this belly out,

1541
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:41,370
then you then, then you have
a limitation in your, in your,

1542
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:43,020
and then the ribs aren't moving.
I mean,

1543
01:29:43,021 --> 01:29:45,660
it's just the guys are gonna hear this
and go, good, I'm going to stay fat.

1544
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:50,350
I don't need a six pack.
Well, but, but no, but,

1545
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:53,970
but I actually, if you're really using
your lungs, you, you can, you'll,

1546
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:58,020
you'll strengthen your core
in a way that you'll get core.

1547
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:02,080
You could have six pack abs
and not have core stability.
Like, so, you know, I mean,

1548
01:30:02,081 --> 01:30:03,540
and, and you know this, I mean,

1549
01:30:03,541 --> 01:30:08,400
when you look at a lot of not every
single great fighter is just ripped.

1550
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,970
No, some of them biggest ones ever
not ripped it all at Fedora. Exactly.

1551
01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:16,770
So let's talk about that for,
for uh, an example of, you know,

1552
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,740
the aesthetic isn't always
function right and, oh,

1553
01:30:19,741 --> 01:30:23,460
and of course we know the mind
is always ahead of everything.

1554
01:30:23,461 --> 01:30:26,760
I don't care what the car looks like. If
the God no motor, it doesn't do anything.

1555
01:30:26,761 --> 01:30:29,880
So it's, the body only goes where
the brain tells it. But the fact is,

1556
01:30:29,881 --> 01:30:34,110
is that that you see some of
the best athletes when you
look at certain athletes,

1557
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:37,620
you're not like, they're not the
physical specimens that you've ever seen.

1558
01:30:37,621 --> 01:30:39,600
You're like that,
that guy's the most ripped and shredded.

1559
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,070
A lot times those guys get knocked out.
You,

1560
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:45,720
you see the guy come in and you just call,
this guy's going to kill this guy.

1561
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,410
And then he just gets,
you know,

1562
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:51,790
annihilated by the guy that looks
maybe not quite as hard. Right.

1563
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:55,290
Part of it is genetics. Max Holloway's
perfect example. Hawaiian guy. Yeah.

1564
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:59,160
He's not like shredded.
I mean he's strong obviously,

1565
01:30:59,161 --> 01:31:02,300
but he looks more like a swimmer.
Yeah, yeah. Well, and you,

1566
01:31:02,301 --> 01:31:05,070
you might find that his breathing,
he might,

1567
01:31:05,071 --> 01:31:08,100
he might have better air volume
because at the end of the day,

1568
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:13,440
a lot of it's about oxygen cardio and
Max is cardio is off the chart. Exactly.

1569
01:31:13,441 --> 01:31:16,260
So he's getting more movement out
of there. I mean, you know, again,

1570
01:31:16,261 --> 01:31:20,640
we've created these, you know, aesthetic
things in, in our culture like,

1571
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:22,980
oh six pack abs a sign of
this and Dah, Dah, Dah.

1572
01:31:22,981 --> 01:31:27,810
But when you look at real breathwork
and how the diaphragm works and how the

1573
01:31:27,811 --> 01:31:32,520
ribs expand, you realize this, like we're,
none of us are really doing it. Right.

1574
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:35,790
You know, and you can actually
create more volume. You know,

1575
01:31:35,791 --> 01:31:37,890
you said you like cordyceps
mushrooms. Yes. Well,

1576
01:31:37,891 --> 01:31:41,280
those are actually a vessel dilate.
Those helps help you absorb oxygen.

1577
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:43,440
You those can up your vo two Max,
right?

1578
01:31:43,441 --> 01:31:46,470
There's only a couple of things that you
can, how to increase your vo two Max.

1579
01:31:46,471 --> 01:31:49,630
But cordyceps is one of them.
Beaches, beaches, another one. Um,

1580
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:52,230
you can create more volume
by expanding your lungs.

1581
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:57,150
So by opening the rib cage and
creating more room that can create, um,

1582
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:58,770
promote your vo two Max.

1583
01:31:58,771 --> 01:32:02,050
And what people are hearing this and
hearing breathwork folks who have never

1584
01:32:02,051 --> 01:32:03,280
done anything like that,
they don't,

1585
01:32:03,281 --> 01:32:04,960
they really don't understand
what you're saying. Like,

1586
01:32:04,961 --> 01:32:08,440
what do you mean by breath
work? Like, give us an example
of like a protocol. Well,

1587
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:12,640
I mean, a real simple, I mean, they do
it in Pranayama, they have it in apnea.

1588
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:15,400
There's a thing called
holotropic breathwork. Really is,

1589
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:19,900
is when you isolate the
breathing system in and you know,

1590
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:22,240
the simplest way. And
that's why Wim says, Hey,

1591
01:32:22,241 --> 01:32:26,560
I don't give a shit how you breathe,
just breathe. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1592
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,730
So you know,

1593
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:30,940
like we'll do a breadth routine and
we'll sit somebody down and we'll say,

1594
01:32:30,941 --> 01:32:35,020
okay breed like you're running where you
think you're running and you will tell

1595
01:32:35,021 --> 01:32:39,430
the guy breed like he's running and
they'll go, I go, that's a slow run buddy.

1596
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:44,820
Like breed like you're running
right. You know, like, like any time,

1597
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:49,830
any, any movement in any air in and out
is going to, is a form of breath work.

1598
01:32:49,831 --> 01:32:50,280
Right?

1599
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:53,640
And especially when you isolate the system
and you're not doing it because of an

1600
01:32:53,641 --> 01:32:54,474
activity.

1601
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:58,680
The fact is that when you use that
system and you work it and you're not

1602
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,980
detracting from it by doing an exercise,

1603
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:04,980
if you're doing the assault bike
while your arms are working in,

1604
01:33:04,981 --> 01:33:05,820
your legs are working.

1605
01:33:05,821 --> 01:33:09,840
So all the oxygen that you're absorbing
is going into your arms and legs.

1606
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:13,080
When you're isolating,
you just do the breathing alone.

1607
01:33:13,470 --> 01:33:17,220
Now the oxygen's going into that system
and that system is going to develop and

1608
01:33:17,221 --> 01:33:21,330
get better. Then when you do your assault
bike after you developed that system.

1609
01:33:21,450 --> 01:33:25,680
So we'll isolate breathwork and we'll just
do it alone. Well, whether we're doing,

1610
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:27,390
you know,
whether we're doing breath holds,

1611
01:33:27,391 --> 01:33:30,990
we're doing some kind of apnea
breath work, which is w you know,

1612
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:36,360
we can do a pattern where you're doing
like you hold for 30 seconds and then you

1613
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:41,160
breathe in for 15 and then you breathe
out for 15 then you hold the yet,

1614
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,940
then you go in and out and hold in
and out and hold. That's one pattern.

1615
01:33:44,941 --> 01:33:49,350
Another pattern is in hold out,
hold in,

1616
01:33:49,351 --> 01:33:53,940
hold out, hold in, hold out. All like,
you know, again, those are, there's,

1617
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:54,421
you know,

1618
01:33:54,421 --> 01:33:59,421
and then there's Pranayama
apnea holotropic there's
just somewhere your oxygen

1619
01:33:59,461 --> 01:34:01,590
in the system where you know,
like wimps,

1620
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:05,860
hi,
how are you?

1621
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:09,380
Just get that rhythm going and do that
for five minutes and people know by feel

1622
01:34:09,381 --> 01:34:12,140
light in and I go, yeah, because you
haven't had oxygen like that in your head.

1623
01:34:12,590 --> 01:34:16,580
You haven't had oxygen in your
system like that. Right. So again,

1624
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:20,420
a conscious co bringing
consciousness to your breath.

1625
01:34:20,570 --> 01:34:24,620
We're not just walking along in life,
like not thinking about breathing.

1626
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:30,280
That's the beginning of breath work.
Just awareness of, hey, I need to,

1627
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:33,243
yeah.

1628
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:36,610
You know, I need to breathe in
and out. Stay conscious. Yeah.

1629
01:34:36,611 --> 01:34:41,260
And that's a big one with martial arts.
You see in Jujitsu with beginners,

1630
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:43,900
when they first start
sparring for the first time,

1631
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:48,130
they panic and they have shallow breath
and you've gotta tell him us. Okay,

1632
01:34:48,190 --> 01:34:52,300
stop right now and just breathe. Oh
yeah. Oh yeah. We'll fight or flight.

1633
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:57,160
Fight or flight. But it's interesting how
they can't get a deep breath. Yeah. They,

1634
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:59,070
they, they hyperventilate.
Yeah. We'll you,

1635
01:34:59,071 --> 01:35:01,790
we'll put somebody in the ice for the
first time that hasn't done it. Yeah.

1636
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:06,550
That's the craziest. Want to see it?
That's an incident Caney though. Oh yeah.

1637
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:10,340
He can't breathe. Oh yeah. But
you eventually learn the system.

1638
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:16,130
The system turned. That's actually a, uh,
an involuntary response to get out. Right.

1639
01:35:16,131 --> 01:35:19,360
Strike you. You have the option. So
you should exercise that option. Well,

1640
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:22,400
that's an involuntary response. That's
your, that's your subconscious mind.

1641
01:35:22,401 --> 01:35:24,740
Protecting the organ organism. Like, Hey,

1642
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:29,600
this in your body intuitively knows
this is dangerous environment. Get Out.

1643
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:32,210
And so that reaction is to
get you to get out. When you,

1644
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:35,360
when you make a conscious effort
to not lead that environment,

1645
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:38,060
then the body goes, oh, okay,
you're not going to get out. Okay,

1646
01:35:38,061 --> 01:35:41,540
well now I'll organize.
I'll bring the blood to the
organs, all adjust everything.

1647
01:35:41,541 --> 01:35:43,850
I'll boost your hormones.
And so,

1648
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,490
and then pretty soon you don't
get that response anymore.

1649
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:49,580
Once you do it on a regular
basis, the body just goes,
oh, we're here we are again,

1650
01:35:49,581 --> 01:35:52,640
back to that ice thing. Bring the
Ba, you know, boost the hormones,

1651
01:35:52,641 --> 01:35:55,940
bring all the blood. No, Oregon's,
you know, that so, but that, that's,

1652
01:35:56,210 --> 01:36:00,740
that's a similar thing to what you're
talking about in Jujitsu where people are

1653
01:36:00,741 --> 01:36:05,150
the stress on the system. They're
stressed and so they're involuntary Italy,

1654
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:08,450
you know, and that's fight or flight.
One thing you can really do to calm,

1655
01:36:08,451 --> 01:36:12,680
like calm a kid down. This is the way
you get yourself into parasympathetic.

1656
01:36:12,681 --> 01:36:16,700
Where you bring your thing down is when
you extend your breath for seven seconds

1657
01:36:16,701 --> 01:36:20,450
on the inhale and the exhale that reduced,
that'll bring everything down. Like,

1658
01:36:20,451 --> 01:36:23,390
if you want to calm down in your or
your kids straight, your little kid,

1659
01:36:23,391 --> 01:36:27,800
just all and you get them to just
breathe in for seven seconds. You know,

1660
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:30,170
and I tell people,
think about Osi,

1661
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:35,840
my youngest daughter, when she would
get upset, she would do that too.

1662
01:36:36,370 --> 01:36:39,850
And I try to like, you gotta breathe,
you gotta breathe, calm down,

1663
01:36:39,851 --> 01:36:41,960
but seven seconds is a magic number.
If they,

1664
01:36:41,961 --> 01:36:45,110
if you can extend the breath for
seven seconds and the body goes into

1665
01:36:45,111 --> 01:36:48,740
parasympathetic and totally like that's
what you do to like go to sleep at night.

1666
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:49,820
Like if you're having a hard time.

1667
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:54,110
So there's a bunch of stuff to learn
about the breadth, which is amazing.

1668
01:36:54,111 --> 01:36:57,530
I think the reason why the, the breadth
has always been so important to,

1669
01:36:57,890 --> 01:37:01,370
to me is this because of the ocean.
Because you know,

1670
01:37:01,371 --> 01:37:04,730
growing up when you almost drowned, you
know, a thousand times you, you, you,

1671
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:07,030
what is important you,
you get to know,

1672
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:11,180
you just get to appreciate like there's
none down there and it's all up there

1673
01:37:11,181 --> 01:37:15,740
and so be cooled down there. So when
you see you can get back up. Well,

1674
01:37:15,741 --> 01:37:20,030
I've learned I'm breathwork because
of Hicks and Gracie are watching Hixon

1675
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:23,940
Gracie practice yoga. He's a friend. Yeah.
You know he does that. What does that,

1676
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:28,160
yeah. What does that stumble?
That's, that's the uh, Pontiac. Yes.

1677
01:37:28,210 --> 01:37:32,840
But there's a name for it. Yeah. Where
you twist the, yeah. He really sucks.

1678
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:37,520
Is Oregon's. Yeah. In his son can do it.
Amazingly crone can do it amazingly. Yeah.

1679
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,420
Yeah. It's super good for you.
Well that for the organs. Yeah.

1680
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,810
And that the ability to
control your breath like that
is so critical when you're

1681
01:37:44,811 --> 01:37:48,230
sparring. So critical to, to get oxygen.

1682
01:37:48,231 --> 01:37:51,500
These long training sessions will
for your life, for your life.

1683
01:37:51,501 --> 01:37:53,750
Anytime you're in this stress,
if you can control your breath,

1684
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:58,110
that controls your heart. Yeah. Do you
ever do 30 seconds in, 30 seconds out?

1685
01:37:58,111 --> 01:38:02,520
Do you ever do that? Yeah. Just
slow, deep breaths in. Slow,

1686
01:38:02,521 --> 01:38:03,180
deep breaths out.

1687
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:07,350
That's an amazing exercise cause well
that's the extension of that. Yeah.

1688
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:11,220
That certain parasympathetic
that's bringing in seven.
Just the minimum amount.

1689
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:15,390
Like whenever you go into any of those
long extended stuff. And then the,

1690
01:38:15,391 --> 01:38:17,490
and then those breath holds.
Anytime you hold the breath,

1691
01:38:17,550 --> 01:38:22,120
then you get that co two level and that's
what gives you the anx to, you know, uh,

1692
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,520
what's interesting cause you know,

1693
01:38:23,521 --> 01:38:26,970
whims done like some record breaking
stuff and you have that free diving stuff

1694
01:38:26,971 --> 01:38:28,620
where,
where they scrub oxygen,

1695
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:32,040
you know where they hyperventilate and
scrub the CEO too and get that real low.

1696
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,420
But you have to be careful
about shallow water blackout.

1697
01:38:34,421 --> 01:38:39,030
So we don't really practice any of that
stuff. We do more like assault bike,

1698
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:43,420
jump in the pool and see how long you
can hold your breath and then it's,

1699
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:47,550
and then, and then you know, five, 10,
10 seconds is like, that's big time.

1700
01:38:47,551 --> 01:38:50,550
15 seconds. You're like, wow, that
was amazing. At maximum heart rate.

1701
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:52,560
How long can you hold your heart?
I mean,

1702
01:38:52,561 --> 01:38:55,170
how long can you hold your breath
at some that's a challenge.

1703
01:38:55,171 --> 01:38:59,420
So I keep an assault bike right next to
the pool. Yeah. Oh yeah, just punishment.

1704
01:39:00,430 --> 01:39:04,830
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh
yeah. Wow. Yeah. Wow. God,

1705
01:39:05,010 --> 01:39:09,060
there's always another twist to the
pretzel. Now, what are the, I mean,

1706
01:39:09,061 --> 01:39:09,900
because of your hip,

1707
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:14,430
do you have any limitations on other
kinds of stuff that you can do? I'm not,

1708
01:39:14,431 --> 01:39:18,240
I'm not just running would be a
real cool. Yeah, no, I, I like deep,

1709
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:23,510
deep texture running so soft sand because
of the foot and the articulation of

1710
01:39:24,001 --> 01:39:28,290
the feet and not chew and non not
wearing shoes. Um, so I'll do beach,

1711
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:31,170
I'll do sand running and
like if I'm in the snow,

1712
01:39:31,171 --> 01:39:34,650
like Alaska or something like that.
But I love barefoot and deep stuff.

1713
01:39:34,651 --> 01:39:37,770
I don't like running on hard ground. I
just, first of all, we, as soon as you're,

1714
01:39:37,771 --> 01:39:41,400
you know, if your two 15 or two, you
know, whatever, anything over 200 pounds.

1715
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:41,731
I mean,

1716
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:44,640
you shouldn't be running more than a
couple of miles a week if you're over a

1717
01:39:44,641 --> 01:39:48,510
buck 20. I mean, it's
just, it's a, Oh yeah,

1718
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:52,020
it's so hard on your sis on
the hard ground. Absolutely.

1719
01:39:52,021 --> 01:39:55,230
That's stuff is just
pounding you. You, I mean,

1720
01:39:55,260 --> 01:40:00,120
it's one thing to go in a soft t,
something that as absorption, you know,

1721
01:40:00,121 --> 01:40:03,570
like if you're running in the sand or
you're running or you're running in the

1722
01:40:03,571 --> 01:40:07,440
snow or you're running into some deep
thick grass or something that's got

1723
01:40:07,441 --> 01:40:10,200
absorption. But yeah, you
go run your, you know,

1724
01:40:10,201 --> 01:40:14,730
your 180 200 pounds and your run and you
just pound, everything's just, you know,

1725
01:40:14,731 --> 01:40:17,670
seven times your body weight on the
download and then you're wearing a shoe

1726
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:21,990
that's, you know, that's kind of deceiving
you. It's a little bit like a Sunglass,

1727
01:40:21,991 --> 01:40:25,080
you know, you think it's blocking the
light but it's letting old bad light in,

1728
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:28,980
you know, you think it's
blocking the absorption but
you're just getting pounded.

1729
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:33,810
I mean your and your feet or you know, I
mean barefoot is so important. Grounding,

1730
01:40:33,811 --> 01:40:38,610
so important. I mean these are, these
are things, but uh, I have a new, uh,

1731
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:39,870
I have a cool bike that I just,

1732
01:40:39,871 --> 01:40:42,060
somebody just gave me recently
called a standup bike,

1733
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:46,800
which the company called elliptic go.
But it's a standing bike, its position,

1734
01:40:46,801 --> 01:40:50,190
so for standing alone. And so
the postures, unbelievable.

1735
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:52,260
And you want to grind on a hill.
I mean,

1736
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:56,470
you don't need running and then you have
zero impact. It's like, you know, it's so,

1737
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:00,570
I think running is hard. I mean, I
understand that high of running and uh,

1738
01:41:00,910 --> 01:41:03,040
but you know, if you
want to, you want a real,

1739
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:06,490
for me real running is
barefoot and some soft sand.

1740
01:41:06,670 --> 01:41:08,710
I had this one beach in
Hawaii that I run on that,

1741
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:12,400
that that's a little bit like quicksand
and probably you'll sink in like mid,

1742
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:15,730
lower, lower, lower calf.

1743
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:20,230
Like you'll sink in a foot into it.
You don't need to go far,

1744
01:41:20,430 --> 01:41:24,660
but you don't need to go. And you know
what a Taro Patches. No. So I grew up, uh,

1745
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:26,560
we got grew up farming.

1746
01:41:26,561 --> 01:41:30,610
I like around on a pig farm and
then with Taro Patches and fishing.

1747
01:41:30,611 --> 01:41:34,680
And so I kind of grew up in a, but there's
a terror, a Taro Patches, uh, as a,

1748
01:41:34,681 --> 01:41:38,280
as a rice patty, pretty
much mud. Right? And so you,

1749
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:42,190
we grew up working in that stuff and
walk in and carrying buckets and being in

1750
01:41:42,191 --> 01:41:46,710
that mud. Slushing the mud, like a
foot deep. My, but what I'm saying,

1751
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:50,440
an environment like that where you have
to pull your foot out and then sink in

1752
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:54,520
where it's absorbing the impact. I
mean that's where work, you know,

1753
01:41:54,521 --> 01:41:57,730
I always question the damage
versus the work, right?

1754
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:01,900
Like the pounding that you
and most, I mean, you know,

1755
01:42:01,901 --> 01:42:04,960
once you're a certain size, the
war, the pounding that you get,

1756
01:42:04,961 --> 01:42:07,420
I think you can get all the cardio.
You want to jump rope.

1757
01:42:07,421 --> 01:42:08,890
Trump rode straight landed on your toe,

1758
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:10,830
you're doing the thing about
when you're running every in,

1759
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:12,820
inevitably people go to heel striking.

1760
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:15,040
They're landing on their heels
because they have a shoe that they,

1761
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:16,720
so they think they're getting,
you know,

1762
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:19,090
they think they're getting protected
because they're landing on something kind

1763
01:42:19,091 --> 01:42:20,980
of soft. But it's still
sending the, you know,

1764
01:42:20,981 --> 01:42:24,670
that impact up your spine and
inevitably anything you do and you,

1765
01:42:24,671 --> 01:42:28,780
and you come back and your back hurts. I
have to question like, is that optimum?

1766
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:33,430
You know, and that wasn't dead lift
either. It was, you know. Yeah.

1767
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:37,720
But what about your friend, the Moyie
Thai fighter? Well he, but he runs,

1768
01:42:37,810 --> 01:42:41,200
he runs like on the very shipper short,

1769
01:42:41,470 --> 01:42:45,910
short step balls of his feet like,
like, and I would, I wouldn't even,

1770
01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:49,150
I would call it more like a, I don't
even know how to describe the pace,

1771
01:42:49,151 --> 01:42:50,740
but it's a slow,
a slow,

1772
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,710
a slow pace that you're landing
on the toes the whole time.

1773
01:42:53,770 --> 01:42:58,060
So it's not like a run, you know, a
hard run where you're pounding. So,

1774
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,640
so he's probably only doing like 10
minute miles or something like that.

1775
01:43:00,641 --> 01:43:02,810
I don't know.
I don't even know what is his ranges?

1776
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:07,450
You'd have to ask Mr Tom
Jones? Well I think, I think
running off your toes. Great.

1777
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:10,630
Yeah. I mean there's some as the who
does those, the running, who does it?

1778
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:14,140
Who Does it? I do. I run
with minimal issues. Yeah.

1779
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:17,770
But if fortunately standing bike,
that is ridiculous.

1780
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:22,330
I wouldn't be caught dead in that then.
Well back for me that, that there,

1781
01:43:22,331 --> 01:43:26,110
that's the elliptic go. They have the
new, a new one that's just a pedal.

1782
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:28,060
I'm just kidding. Yeah,
it looks awesome. No.

1783
01:43:28,090 --> 01:43:31,750
But you know why the guy made that silly
cause the guy was a runner and couldn't

1784
01:43:31,751 --> 01:43:33,830
run anymore. Got Injured. Uh, and then he,

1785
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:36,670
and he started the bike and
he said biking's not running.

1786
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:41,230
And so then he developed that thing
because it's simulates running without the

1787
01:43:41,231 --> 01:43:45,220
impact. So that's, I'm like I said,
that's why I liked the pool. That's why.

1788
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:48,940
And I think too, it's like if you
think about doing things forever,

1789
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:52,410
we're talking about doing things
forever. Yeah. Right? Yes.

1790
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:54,020
So we're talking about
doing things forever.

1791
01:43:54,021 --> 01:43:57,610
So how are we going to do them so we
can do them forever? No impact. Well,

1792
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:02,330
so reducing impact. And if you
actually started doing that initially,

1793
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:06,800
then you might not have to worry about
trying to recover from all that stuff

1794
01:44:06,801 --> 01:44:07,310
that you,

1795
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:11,450
so it's like we don't want to train in
a way that we're going to have to change

1796
01:44:11,451 --> 01:44:14,720
our training to try to make up
because all the damage we've done,

1797
01:44:14,721 --> 01:44:16,950
let's try to avoid the damage
from the beginning. I'm a,

1798
01:44:16,970 --> 01:44:20,660
it's already too late for me. I got
seven, you know, I got six broken ankles,

1799
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:25,280
got broken, arches broke again. What
the hell did you just do your ankle?

1800
01:44:25,281 --> 01:44:28,670
I like what's been broke six,
six or seven times broke the arch,

1801
01:44:28,671 --> 01:44:32,270
broke all the messages from surfing
all different motorbikes, surfing,

1802
01:44:32,271 --> 01:44:35,540
snowboarding because you mess up your hip.
Uh,

1803
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:38,500
probably cause my broke walking
on a broken ankle for uh,

1804
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:42,530
all those years that cause each time I
broke it I have five or six different

1805
01:44:42,531 --> 01:44:46,370
breaks and then I would keep going.
So I would keep walking on it and,

1806
01:44:46,371 --> 01:44:49,310
but I'd means I had to carry
the load on my right hip.

1807
01:44:49,311 --> 01:44:54,080
So I think I just wore the cartilage out
from offsetting and carrying the load

1808
01:44:54,081 --> 01:44:58,610
of the broken Lake Jesus. So
that was, but so I mean it's so,

1809
01:44:58,611 --> 01:45:01,790
it wasn't like one injury where you
hurt your hip. It was just slung.

1810
01:45:01,791 --> 01:45:03,050
I just wore it out.
I just,

1811
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:06,440
I said I lived a couple of lives with
[inaudible] is that that was only on one

1812
01:45:06,441 --> 01:45:08,140
life hip and I had three lives in,
uh,

1813
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:14,180
what is it like having a fake
hip, insane, incredible bionic.

1814
01:45:14,270 --> 01:45:17,390
That thing's not even in
my, in my, in my brain.

1815
01:45:17,390 --> 01:45:20,760
Not even how so it does.
I just,

1816
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:25,700
I don't ever even bring it into
consciousness. It's in, it's slicker.

1817
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:30,800
It's like a Mercedes Benz ball joint.
I mean it's absolutely perfect. Wow.

1818
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:33,980
And you know,
I mean I've had ACL,

1819
01:45:33,981 --> 01:45:36,860
had some knee stuff before that was
harder to recover from than the hip.

1820
01:45:36,861 --> 01:45:37,694
The hip was.

1821
01:45:37,730 --> 01:45:41,330
I just felt like I got kicked by a horse
for a couple months and then after that

1822
01:45:41,331 --> 01:45:45,200
it was like no brainer. Jump off
a cliff, go stand up, paddle, run.

1823
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:49,850
I mean I tell you to not do
certain things. Nope. Really? Nope.

1824
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:51,590
You could like,
you could just start,

1825
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:55,360
he don't do anything you should
do with your real one. Really.

1826
01:45:55,580 --> 01:45:58,790
That's don't do anything you shouldn't
do with your real one. Yeah, absolutely.

1827
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:03,440
That was the only thing. I mean the guy,
the doctor Penn Nunberg who did mine,

1828
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:04,531
he,

1829
01:46:04,531 --> 01:46:09,531
he did it to a contortionist I guess some
contortion has had some blown hips and

1830
01:46:09,621 --> 01:46:13,690
he'd get it to the girl is still
performing and stuff. So I don't,

1831
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:18,170
I think it's, I mean this stuff
is, the technology is amazing.

1832
01:46:18,290 --> 01:46:19,670
And the thing that I,

1833
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:24,230
the thing that I would consider if I ever
had to do it again is that the atrophy

1834
01:46:24,470 --> 01:46:27,240
from the, the, the,

1835
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:32,320
the initial problem is harder to recover
from then you just go in and getting

1836
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:35,090
the new one. And I think when
people push it, you know,

1837
01:46:35,091 --> 01:46:38,060
they used to prior to push that stuff
because they wanted to wait for the

1838
01:46:38,061 --> 01:46:41,550
technology got better and they only
last 15 years and all that stuff. Um,

1839
01:46:41,990 --> 01:46:44,810
but the atrophy that
you try to recover from,

1840
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:49,500
it was harder to recover from than if
you would've gone in and gotten it done

1841
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:52,920
when you need, when, as soon as you
needed to have. So the one you have now,

1842
01:46:52,921 --> 01:46:56,370
you have to get it swapped out
every 15 years. No, no, no, no. But,

1843
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,400
but in the back in the early
days, well, they, they,

1844
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:01,140
they don't know how long this
new stuff last. They had some,

1845
01:47:01,410 --> 01:47:05,720
they had some material that that wore out
after. Like they, cause there's a, uh,

1846
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:10,260
like a, uh, some kind of poly urethane,
some kind of psych outer layer.

1847
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:11,520
Well like a cart lit like a,

1848
01:47:11,521 --> 01:47:15,480
like a manmade Cartlidge between
the ball joint in the socket.

1849
01:47:15,810 --> 01:47:19,100
And so that stuff wore out in the past.
But yeah,

1850
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:21,240
and they had this new stuff that,

1851
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:25,320
that has been in for 10 years and a lot
of people are already and they've seen

1852
01:47:25,321 --> 01:47:30,180
zero where on it. So you don't
know. It could be 30, could
be, you know, could be 10.

1853
01:47:30,181 --> 01:47:34,440
I mean I was actually, uh,
I stayed conscious in, in,

1854
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:37,860
I was able to stay awake
for my hip surgery that uh,

1855
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:41,930
cause I didn't want to have to recover
from the, from the uh, yeah. Yeah.

1856
01:47:41,931 --> 01:47:45,510
It takes people a month to get the
anesthesia their system really. Oh yeah.

1857
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:48,360
To try to get the anesthesia.
I mean anaesthetise controlled death.

1858
01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:51,030
They're just put you right to the
edge of dying and keep you alive.

1859
01:47:51,031 --> 01:47:52,110
I mean anesthesia,

1860
01:47:52,111 --> 01:47:55,320
some hard stuff on your system to
get that stuff out of your organs.

1861
01:47:55,500 --> 01:48:00,000
You've got to do like a
full detox cleanse. It's not
dislike. Oh yeah. Anesthesia.

1862
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:02,940
I've never heard that before. I
didn't, I didn't know that. Oh yeah.

1863
01:48:02,970 --> 01:48:05,360
I thought you feel like shit for a
day or two, but I didn't know it.

1864
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:07,920
That's shit's in your organs and stuff.

1865
01:48:07,921 --> 01:48:09,990
There's no way that stuff
to go that they can't,

1866
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:14,940
they can't Doshi out and knock you out
like that without that stuff lingering.

1867
01:48:14,941 --> 01:48:17,770
I mean, you know, how long does it take
to when you've got a hangover? I mean,

1868
01:48:17,830 --> 01:48:21,310
so that they do like an epidural
block on your epidural block. Yeah.

1869
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:24,900
And they had it so good that
they could just isolate the left,

1870
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:27,210
the left hip.

1871
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:31,860
They did that to me when I had my first
ACL surgery yet I wanted to see it. Yeah.

1872
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:33,780
Cause I was like, yeah, I want to watch.

1873
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:36,600
I felt like I'm only going to do this
once in my life. I want to see this.

1874
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:40,860
Turns out I had three of them. Yeah.
Three knee surgeries. But yeah.

1875
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:44,280
But I wanted to see it. I
wanted to, I wanted to be
there if it was pretty freaky.

1876
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:49,310
Yeah, I was ACL. I had ACL to had
ACL. The right light on. Yeah. Yeah.

1877
01:48:49,470 --> 01:48:53,760
And a cadaver. I had a cadaver on my
right leg. Left leg, had a patella tendon.

1878
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:58,020
Oh yeah. Yeah. So now your hip
doesn't even, you don't feel it.

1879
01:48:58,050 --> 01:49:01,440
You don't feel anything. Not even in
the wheel. Not even a thought. Wow.

1880
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:06,480
Not even like amazing. And it was, I was,
it was debilitating. I could barely walk.

1881
01:49:06,481 --> 01:49:10,590
I mean, I could still surf, but I'd get
to land and I was hobbling around like,

1882
01:49:11,070 --> 01:49:15,560
you know, move and, uh, Maynard from tool,
you know the band tool. Uh, Maynard is a,

1883
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:18,880
he's a Jujitsu enthusiast and
he had to get his hip done. Uh,

1884
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:22,140
and he fucked his hip up from
stomping on stage. You know,

1885
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:25,410
cause he's always like stomping with one
leg. Yeah. He blew his hip out. Yeah.

1886
01:49:25,470 --> 01:49:29,190
Well I think mine's attributed a
lot to my back leg and surfing. Uh,

1887
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:33,150
so I'm on that back leg and
that leg is loaded, loaded.

1888
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:37,440
So I think that, but,
but I know the brakes,

1889
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:40,410
the brakes and the other in
the left ankle and left foot.

1890
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:44,590
And how many I had and that I was always
on it. I know that attributed to a lot,

1891
01:49:44,591 --> 01:49:45,600
cause this,
this,

1892
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:50,320
this right leg carried the load for that
thing for it to get your left leg fixed.

1893
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:53,710
My ankle. Ankle. Yeah. I just let it,

1894
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:57,430
so every time I went I went to my knee,
uh,

1895
01:49:57,460 --> 01:50:00,880
to get my knee worked on in the guy goes,
he saw my ankle and he goes,

1896
01:50:01,150 --> 01:50:01,751
and then he saw the,

1897
01:50:01,751 --> 01:50:05,620
about how much mobility I had and he
called in some foot specialists and they

1898
01:50:05,621 --> 01:50:08,290
had to take x Ray. They just wanted to
see, cause I have no metal in there.

1899
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:11,480
There's no screws, there's no
nothing. I just let it, you know,

1900
01:50:11,481 --> 01:50:15,870
and just so every time you just
let it sort of heal itself up. Yep.

1901
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:20,710
So it snapped and you just walk
around on it? Yeah, pretty much. Cut.

1902
01:50:20,711 --> 01:50:23,200
The cast off.
The first time was I was 16,

1903
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:25,900
so I cut the cast off and you know,

1904
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:29,110
and I went at rebroke it
the first time and then, uh,

1905
01:50:29,170 --> 01:50:32,890
and then I had broke it other ways had
got a little smarter after we broke him.

1906
01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:35,350
But yeah, that's, and then arch the arch.

1907
01:50:35,351 --> 01:50:37,270
I broke the arch because
the ankle was so cows,

1908
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:41,980
so a bonded that when I broke it,
I actually broke my arch.

1909
01:50:41,981 --> 01:50:45,690
That was probably the most painful.
That was the most painful, uh,

1910
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:50,770
break down in that area. When I talked
to Kelly Slater, he broke his foot.

1911
01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:54,970
Yeah. Yeah. The same sort of his
was just recently. Yeah. And his,

1912
01:50:54,971 --> 01:50:56,680
his was fucked up for a long time.

1913
01:50:56,681 --> 01:51:01,040
He said that's a painful thing to snap
your toes. Like you're the middle.

1914
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:03,190
The metatarsal a crazy. Well, yeah.

1915
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:07,180
You have a 75% of the bones in
your body or blow your ankles.

1916
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:09,700
What really?

1917
01:51:10,570 --> 01:51:14,890
75% like times of numbers.
Yeah. Numbers of both.

1918
01:51:14,891 --> 01:51:19,360
But your feet, your feet have like
half the bones of your entire body.

1919
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:23,390
God, I never thought of that.
That's crazy. But it made,

1920
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:27,250
there's a lot of shit down there. A lot
going on. A lot. Little, little ones,

1921
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:32,380
little nubs and weird little ankle.
See that's why kickboxing so stupid.

1922
01:51:32,381 --> 01:51:35,200
You throw in those things at people
and slamming him in the elbows,

1923
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:39,730
knees and stuff. I
fucked the clods big. Oh,

1924
01:51:39,731 --> 01:51:43,420
guaranteed. I've broken my,
that didn't like kicking
something. Breaking your feet.

1925
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:48,880
It's a little embarrassing if it's a
wall though. Is that what you kicked?

1926
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:52,660
No, I'm just saying no. Mine was,
I, like I said, I broke my bro.

1927
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:57,340
Mostly sports related motor,
Mike. Uh, wind surfing,

1928
01:51:58,330 --> 01:52:00,730
you know, towing. Yeah. Yeah.

1929
01:52:00,970 --> 01:52:04,390
Well I guess with as many
injuries as you had though,

1930
01:52:04,391 --> 01:52:08,200
you do understand like what's good
and what's bad for you. For sure.

1931
01:52:08,830 --> 01:52:10,700
You hope. But you know, it's interesting.

1932
01:52:10,701 --> 01:52:13,780
It's a little bit like in karate where
you know you, when you know how to heal,

1933
01:52:13,781 --> 01:52:17,860
you know how to wound. Hmm.
Interesting. You know that the more,

1934
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:22,720
the more you understand, it's like I
think, I think my injuries, first of all,

1935
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:25,030
it's a form of failure.
I think that is taught.

1936
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:28,300
I've learned a few things
from them. And, and,

1937
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:30,940
and you learn how also how
to recover and how to heal.

1938
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:35,920
And so I think that feeds into how to
train and perform like a thing that's all

1939
01:52:35,921 --> 01:52:38,920
interrelated because you start to have
a more intimate relationship with your

1940
01:52:38,921 --> 01:52:42,280
body and know how it responds. So
I think there's something, I mean,

1941
01:52:42,281 --> 01:52:44,010
you don't learn a lot from winning,
you know,

1942
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:48,520
and succeeding that doesn't teach you
anything compared to losing, you know,

1943
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:50,840
losing teaches you in any way.

1944
01:52:50,841 --> 01:52:54,950
Injuries are f forms of
loss there, there, you know,

1945
01:52:55,010 --> 01:52:58,580
on unsuccessful endeavors.
Yeah. Yeah. When you lose your,

1946
01:52:58,610 --> 01:53:02,600
and then you lose your ability to do
stuff and then you wonder why you're doing

1947
01:53:02,601 --> 01:53:05,120
it and if you're going to be able to
do it again. Yeah. All that stuff.

1948
01:53:05,540 --> 01:53:09,920
Do you float at all? Uh, no. But I saw
your float tank. You've never done it?

1949
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:13,670
I haven't. Oh Man. I've thought
that'd be right up your alley. I know.

1950
01:53:13,671 --> 01:53:17,300
I just haven't, I just, I've been invited
by a friend who has one in Malibu.

1951
01:53:17,301 --> 01:53:19,940
I just haven't ever, you could use
this word anytime you want. Yeah,

1952
01:53:19,941 --> 01:53:23,130
I should try to come up on the float and
then come on down and they tell you one.

1953
01:53:23,131 --> 01:53:25,220
It's like I can tell they're
salt in there. By the way,

1954
01:53:25,221 --> 01:53:29,290
the everything's crusting up
in the back. Guaranteed. Yes.

1955
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:33,350
Thousand pounds of Epson Salts. Oh
yeah. Tank. Yeah. Yeah. If you're,

1956
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:37,670
anytime I have a notion, so I float
there and there's a lot of noise in the,

1957
01:53:37,671 --> 01:53:39,200
oh no, it's true. It's just for,

1958
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:42,050
but that's what you love about the
pool because you're floating already.

1959
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:46,340
As soon as you go under actually has
speakers underwater. So cool. Really? Oh,

1960
01:53:46,341 --> 01:53:50,960
you play music. Oh Wow. So you can
get Dan, you can get lost over there.

1961
01:53:50,961 --> 01:53:54,290
It's pretty cool. So what other
things do you do besides the,

1962
01:53:54,291 --> 01:53:56,990
a curl pressed jump thing?

1963
01:53:57,050 --> 01:54:00,070
Like what other or the types of
exercises are you doing in the pool? Um,

1964
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:04,820
we're doing, we're doing, you know,
like single dumbbell cleans, clean,

1965
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:09,860
single arm dumbbell, and then
stroke, get a breath free fall.

1966
01:54:09,861 --> 01:54:12,260
So you're doing single arm jumping.
Okay.

1967
01:54:12,350 --> 01:54:16,310
And then we're doing single arm
swimming. Ah, single alarm, swimming,

1968
01:54:16,311 --> 01:54:19,490
carrying dumbbell. I call that ammo box.
How much weight are you doing that with?

1969
01:54:19,690 --> 01:54:23,120
We can do like 50, 60 pounds. Wow.
Do an APP. It's called an ammo box.

1970
01:54:23,121 --> 01:54:25,400
It'd be like if he had an ammo box.
Again, you swim across the river,

1971
01:54:25,530 --> 01:54:29,270
like that's kind of the concept. We
have cell phone, we have the Yuki,

1972
01:54:29,271 --> 01:54:30,290
we have a phone.

1973
01:54:30,291 --> 01:54:34,820
Do you keep wanting to out of the water
polo and swim with your handout? Oh Wow.

1974
01:54:34,850 --> 01:54:38,500
And then, uh, and then a budget, like
I said, single leg stuff. So a lot of,

1975
01:54:38,501 --> 01:54:43,130
a lot of like a Russian
pistol squat, jump, lunges.

1976
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:46,820
Uh, uh, what else? A bunch of,

1977
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:51,140
a bunch of old fast breaks where we're
doing this one where we dropped down.

1978
01:54:51,410 --> 01:54:54,620
You run along the bottom with
two dumbbells to the other side.

1979
01:54:54,621 --> 01:54:58,160
You set one dumbbell up, you jump up, you
bring one dumbbell out, you go back down,

1980
01:54:58,161 --> 01:54:58,970
grab the other one,

1981
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:02,360
bring that one out and then pull both
of them out and drop back down and run

1982
01:55:02,361 --> 01:55:02,751
back out.

1983
01:55:02,751 --> 01:55:05,660
We call that one fast break kind of
mimicking like if was basketball court,

1984
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:09,510
you'd run down, you jump up twice
and run back. Jump up twice. Um,

1985
01:55:09,860 --> 01:55:12,260
and then we have spider
man. We have, I mean we,

1986
01:55:12,261 --> 01:55:14,480
they just spider mans one where you swim,

1987
01:55:14,810 --> 01:55:19,250
you carry a dumbbell and you descend
into one end, you jump up, you grab,

1988
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:21,860
you get a breath, you just send
it into the other end. And then,

1989
01:55:22,130 --> 01:55:27,110
and then all these exercises were able to,
we to make them harder.

1990
01:55:27,111 --> 01:55:31,700
We'll do them on an exhale so you can do,
so we ramp up,

1991
01:55:31,870 --> 01:55:33,530
you know,
we can either increase weight,

1992
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:38,420
we can create increase distance or
we can do an egg, do it on an exhale.

1993
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:40,340
So when you developed all this stuff,

1994
01:55:40,341 --> 01:55:44,310
did you run all this down from your
own practice? From all trial and error?

1995
01:55:44,311 --> 01:55:48,600
Like how did you develop this? Well, some
of them came from failure. So you know,

1996
01:55:48,601 --> 01:55:50,790
you try to do one move
and then you'd fail.

1997
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:55,010
Some of them came from friends that I
was working out with. It would hold,

1998
01:55:55,011 --> 01:55:57,900
well let's try this. And
then we'd modify it. Some,

1999
01:55:57,930 --> 01:56:00,150
some of them came from my daughter.
I watched my daughter,

2000
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:03,810
my one daughter swim down one day and
grab a weight and then try to swim up with

2001
01:56:03,811 --> 01:56:07,540
it. I'm like, oh, that's a great
move. And we, you know, so we, we, we,

2002
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:10,200
some of it came out of
necessity for movement,

2003
01:56:10,201 --> 01:56:14,070
like certain dynamic movements
that the basketball guy, you know,

2004
01:56:14,071 --> 01:56:16,590
one of my friends needed or a,

2005
01:56:16,591 --> 01:56:21,591
and then it naturally all the
movements kind of naturally evolved.

2006
01:56:21,661 --> 01:56:26,460
I think that's why they're also great.
And there's an isolation to each limb.

2007
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:31,620
So we have an isolation so you can really
see if the dexterity of your right arm

2008
01:56:31,621 --> 01:56:34,710
versus your left arm and how
strong it is versus the other one,

2009
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:38,130
how strong one leg is next to
the other one to have the Mo,

2010
01:56:38,230 --> 01:56:41,220
the ranges of motion and the
mobility we're, we're doing,

2011
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:44,910
we can do a front back flips
and front flips multiple.

2012
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:49,730
So you jump up and get a breath and
then do multiple flips and, and uh,

2013
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:54,390
and extend work time so that your extend
breathwork where you'll do, you know,

2014
01:56:54,391 --> 01:56:58,810
like three or four moves in one on one
breath. So we have a bunch of ways to,

2015
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,260
to ramp it up as we evolve.
Because you know how it is.

2016
01:57:01,261 --> 01:57:04,200
It's like in any exercise you get
proficient and then you're like,

2017
01:57:04,201 --> 01:57:07,080
well how do I make it harder? While
you make it longer, you make it faster.

2018
01:57:07,081 --> 01:57:10,170
You make it heavier. I mean these,
but because you're in the water,

2019
01:57:10,171 --> 01:57:13,140
we always have the breath holding element.
Uh,

2020
01:57:13,141 --> 01:57:17,130
and then we had the distance element and
then we have the weight because we have

2021
01:57:17,131 --> 01:57:18,450
weights so we have the weight elements.

2022
01:57:18,451 --> 01:57:22,740
So those are different ways that we
can ramp it, you know, ramp it up.

2023
01:57:22,890 --> 01:57:26,130
So when you're developing this program,
are you writing on this stuff down?

2024
01:57:26,130 --> 01:57:28,530
Are you doing these workouts
yourself and saying, okay,

2025
01:57:28,531 --> 01:57:31,890
I really started to fatigue after
30 of these, so we'll try to,

2026
01:57:31,950 --> 01:57:33,040
well I have a group of friends,

2027
01:57:33,041 --> 01:57:36,600
I have a group of guys that train that
come to my house to train six days a week.

2028
01:57:36,630 --> 01:57:40,530
So there's like days a week?
Yeah. In Malibu? Yeah. Malibu. Oh.

2029
01:57:40,650 --> 01:57:43,720
So because now the pieces show
Malibu's is summertime, right?

2030
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,680
Summertime is when it's really like a,

2031
01:57:46,681 --> 01:57:49,320
the season for training because
there's no surf in the winter time,

2032
01:57:49,321 --> 01:57:52,110
you're not going to train and then
have a giant swell and be tired.

2033
01:57:52,111 --> 01:57:53,430
That would be just stupid.

2034
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:57,240
So you never want to let the problem
with it is that you get, you know, I,

2035
01:57:57,241 --> 01:57:59,700
I tell people, I go, listen
in probably in any sport,

2036
01:57:59,850 --> 01:58:03,030
you get the most out of
shape during the season.

2037
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:06,000
You're in a certain kind
of shaped game shape,

2038
01:58:06,001 --> 01:58:07,740
but you're really not in
shade because you can't,

2039
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:13,310
you can't have a regimented workout
routine if you're competing now and so and

2040
01:58:13,771 --> 01:58:15,990
so. And in my case, uh,

2041
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,430
the oceans dictating the performance,
right? So you can be, oh,

2042
01:58:20,431 --> 01:58:23,310
there's going to be 20 feet to
next, you know, in three days.

2043
01:58:23,311 --> 01:58:27,130
And then all of a sudden you show that
there's not, there's no surf said,

2044
01:58:27,140 --> 01:58:29,340
only half the size or the wind
screws it up or something.

2045
01:58:29,550 --> 01:58:30,660
So you get all that build up.

2046
01:58:30,661 --> 01:58:33,300
So we have to do things to
kind of exhaust the energy.

2047
01:58:33,301 --> 01:58:35,970
But you can't be in a nice Monday,
Wednesday,

2048
01:58:35,970 --> 01:58:39,300
Friday pool training with Tuesday,
Thursday, Saturday, you know, um,

2049
01:58:39,390 --> 01:58:42,640
lifting mobility in yoga and whether,
you know,

2050
01:58:42,641 --> 01:58:45,550
it's like you can't get into
that kind of a rhythm and a,

2051
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:50,590
and Hawaii not conducive for that. Anyway.
It's part of the beauty of it is like,

2052
01:58:50,591 --> 01:58:51,670
I always so beautiful,

2053
01:58:51,671 --> 01:58:54,070
let's go to the thing or we're going to
go down the coast cause it's a nice day.

2054
01:58:54,071 --> 01:58:55,630
It's a good day for fishing,
go to the mountain.

2055
01:58:55,810 --> 01:58:59,740
There's just so much other activities
to be done. We're in this environment,

2056
01:58:59,830 --> 01:59:03,670
you're in the desert and it's kind of
like, okay, it's a June gloom, no problem.

2057
01:59:03,671 --> 01:59:07,660
This bang iron or you know, ride the
mountain or do whatever you're gonna do.

2058
01:59:07,661 --> 01:59:12,400
So that's, uh, the end. But
in that summertime routine,

2059
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:16,450
uh, I have a group of guys in that we
bounce everything off of each other.

2060
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:20,500
So I'll do the, we'll do 10 and he'll do
10 and he'll do 10. I'll be like, yeah,

2061
01:59:20,501 --> 01:59:22,420
that was good. Okay. Up the way. Okay. Oh,

2062
01:59:22,430 --> 01:59:25,420
twenty's too many or that weights
too much or that way. It's enough.

2063
01:59:25,421 --> 01:59:29,260
And so we just kind of, it's evolved
naturally that way. And then, uh,

2064
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:33,790
and then I got some other friends that
are a little bit more professional.

2065
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:37,910
We have a, uh, my friend of mine, PJ,
who's been involved with all of the, uh,

2066
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:42,550
stuff around XPT to write programming
and do that kind of stuff that changed.

2067
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:46,660
He trains a lot of fighters and
great and mobility and, and, and uh,

2068
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:50,430
and to other training stuff. So
he, he'll come in and they go,

2069
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:54,670
they start to really break it down
and make it into a real program.

2070
01:59:54,790 --> 01:59:58,750
But we have routines that we do.
We have circuits that we do that we know,

2071
01:59:59,110 --> 02:00:03,160
you know, how, you know, when
we're taxed. And you know,

2072
02:00:03,161 --> 02:00:06,880
it's an interesting thing about what
the pool really teaches you is that,

2073
02:00:07,150 --> 02:00:10,840
you know, you have a volume of energy
available. We go, okay, well, you know,

2074
02:00:10,841 --> 02:00:15,841
you got a 50 gallon tank and I can
do three or four drills in fifth,

2075
02:00:16,570 --> 02:00:19,480
10 or 15 minutes that does,
you just, there's none left.

2076
02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:21,520
You just blew all 50 gallons.
You do.

2077
02:00:21,521 --> 02:00:26,080
Extended breath holds with super hard
work where I can, you know, make the,

2078
02:00:26,110 --> 02:00:28,930
give you some things that are a little
lighter and now we can take that 50

2079
02:00:28,931 --> 02:00:33,010
gallon tank, we can drag it out and
make it, make it last two hours. Right?

2080
02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:37,780
Cause we do these, we're
doing higher volume, less
weight and so we're, you know,

2081
02:00:37,990 --> 02:00:40,750
breathing more often,
we can expand that thing.

2082
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:45,430
So everything in between just
blowing that whole tank up at once.

2083
02:00:46,210 --> 02:00:49,990
Right. Through real intense breadth
hole with maximum weight as you know,

2084
02:00:49,991 --> 02:00:54,640
Max breath hold Max weight, uh,
Max Rep. Okay. We're good. We're,

2085
02:00:54,641 --> 02:00:57,010
I mean it's, and I think
liftings the same way. You know,

2086
02:00:57,011 --> 02:01:01,960
it's like how many Max lifts do you have
in a certain day and how many per week

2087
02:01:01,961 --> 02:01:06,520
do you have though? It's real tangible in
the pool. The pools reel, you know, the,

2088
02:01:06,521 --> 02:01:08,800
the, the interesting thing about
the pose that it doesn't get,

2089
02:01:08,830 --> 02:01:11,530
you don't get muscle soreness
because of that compression.

2090
02:01:11,890 --> 02:01:14,260
So you don't get that like wow,
I'm sorry. You get, you go.

2091
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:19,000
Almost every single person that comes.
And it's one of the A, I always say,

2092
02:01:19,001 --> 02:01:21,460
you know, you got to call me and
tell me if you fell asleep at lunch.

2093
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:26,440
And every guy, every, every,
every person, you know,

2094
02:01:26,441 --> 02:01:29,320
I was in the thing and just in
their desk at the work or whatever,

2095
02:01:29,321 --> 02:01:32,680
just fall asleep, like guaranteed
at some guys, you know.

2096
02:01:32,690 --> 02:01:36,400
Oh I fell asleep for an hour.
I saw 20 minutes, 10 minutes,
you know, but everybody,

2097
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:39,380
why is nighty night?
I don't know.

2098
02:01:39,381 --> 02:01:43,280
I think it has a lot to do with
the oxygen and that and, and the,

2099
02:01:43,281 --> 02:01:47,780
and the taxation of that environment.
But it exhausts you in a, in a,

2100
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:52,970
in a, in like a terminal way. Like
it's, it's, it's a complete exhaustion.

2101
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:57,590
And I, and I don't know why, part of
it is the threat of being underwater.

2102
02:01:57,980 --> 02:02:01,970
Part of it is though that the water is
sucking the, the calories out of you,

2103
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:04,910
you know, because it's
like, uh, when they, uh,

2104
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:09,290
when they were talking to a Phelps
about burning all those calories, while,

2105
02:02:09,590 --> 02:02:10,990
you know,
three quarters of the calories,

2106
02:02:10,991 --> 02:02:14,440
he was burning his cause he was in a
70 degree pool and people go, well,

2107
02:02:14,510 --> 02:02:18,380
our 75 degree pool, and I go,
yeah, but the by the body is 98.6.

2108
02:02:18,710 --> 02:02:23,630
So for the body to keep itself warm
over in three hours, it's at 75.

2109
02:02:23,631 --> 02:02:25,190
That's 20 degree differentiation.

2110
02:02:25,191 --> 02:02:29,240
You've got to keep the bodies just working
to keep itself warm and that and that.

2111
02:02:29,241 --> 02:02:33,410
And because the water affects you more
than the air, it's, you know, it's,

2112
02:02:33,411 --> 02:02:37,130
it's more intense on your system.
They just, you just get tapped.

2113
02:02:37,131 --> 02:02:41,930
So that the water temperature, the,
uh, the, the, the oxygen load, the,

2114
02:02:41,931 --> 02:02:45,320
the psychology of being
underwater with weights, you know,

2115
02:02:45,321 --> 02:02:49,430
the workload that it's taking,
all those things play into just full,

2116
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:53,270
thorough exhaustion and
nothing, nothing. I do, uh,

2117
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:58,300
exhaust me more thoroughly and yet
more kind of comfortably than that.

2118
02:03:00,790 --> 02:03:03,120
You know not, you don't have to
expel. You don't still want moving.

2119
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:06,020
Well you're not wounded. You don't come
and see if I train that hard in the gym,

2120
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:08,810
I'll feel hurt after I'll be,
I'll be wounded.

2121
02:03:08,810 --> 02:03:12,800
I'll be a little like and if I move wrong
or something I'll be like, oh you know,

2122
02:03:12,801 --> 02:03:14,780
you feel like something,
you tweak something.

2123
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:18,700
So this allows you to do this six days
a week. That's one of the reasons why.

2124
02:03:18,770 --> 02:03:21,980
Well it actually helps flush the other
days when you're doing other land

2125
02:03:21,981 --> 02:03:26,540
training. So actually helps support
your, but no, I mean we're not doing,

2126
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:29,270
we're doing pool training probably
every other day and it just,

2127
02:03:29,271 --> 02:03:33,650
I ended up turning the kind of, I love
being in the pool so much that we have,

2128
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:35,860
we do a thing called surf and turf,
so,

2129
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:39,890
so we have surf and turf where you're
doing like some sort of some sort of

2130
02:03:39,891 --> 02:03:41,000
burpee press,

2131
02:03:41,210 --> 02:03:44,960
some kind of lifting on the deck into
the water and then a routine in the water

2132
02:03:44,961 --> 02:03:47,840
and then back on the deck and back
in the water. You might be doing a,

2133
02:03:48,650 --> 02:03:52,910
we have one of a move called a sea horse
where you hold a dumbbell between your

2134
02:03:52,911 --> 02:03:56,960
legs and then you hold your feet up in
front of you and you swim like this with

2135
02:03:56,961 --> 02:04:00,410
a dumbbell in your lap. And then when you
get to their side than you do pushups.

2136
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:04,250
So you do pushups on that side. You, you
see horse over, you do push up that side,

2137
02:04:04,251 --> 02:04:09,010
see horseback, you do that. I mean
you just blow up. Right. So we, I,

2138
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:14,840
I think I, I enjoy that, that part
of it, just, just being creative,

2139
02:04:14,841 --> 02:04:18,800
making it fun, making it interesting.
That's the part that really is enticing.

2140
02:04:18,980 --> 02:04:22,910
Just the dredgery and the
monotony. Like when you said,
Oh yes, swimming laps, I go,

2141
02:04:22,911 --> 02:04:27,290
that's just like dredgery just, ah,
like, which there's a mentality for that.

2142
02:04:27,291 --> 02:04:30,500
I'm good. I can be good at
that. Like I can get on a,

2143
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:34,670
I can get on my board and you know,
I've, I've done some endurance stuff.

2144
02:04:34,671 --> 02:04:39,000
I palled 22 hours one time. Um,
I've done some much two hours. Yeah.

2145
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:42,090
Oh yeah. So I've done, I did actually,

2146
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:44,430
I actually did a thing on
Hawaii called the Hawaii five,

2147
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:47,880
we call it the life 500 we started
on the south point, a big island,

2148
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:52,560
and we biked across the big island,
so 125 miles. Then we paddled to Maui,

2149
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:54,600
uh,
38 miles,

2150
02:04:54,601 --> 02:04:57,720
and then we biked across the valley and
then we paddled to Molokai and then we

2151
02:04:57,721 --> 02:04:59,870
biked across Molokai that
we palliate to a Wahoo.

2152
02:04:59,910 --> 02:05:03,120
Then we biked across the wall who then
we paddled to Hawaii that we biked across

2153
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:08,010
the Hawaiian. We did that in five
days. So that's what's day six.

2154
02:05:08,011 --> 02:05:10,770
Like that's when you start coming.
Good.

2155
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:16,380
It's the end. But you're, but you're good.
No, explain. It's what you said about,

2156
02:05:16,650 --> 02:05:20,090
you know, about running. Yep.
On Eddie, Eddie, when you know,

2157
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:24,600
all of a sudden you're, the body's
like, oh, is this our new house?

2158
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:28,770
Is this, is this what we do? What
we just, what we do? Yeah. Once we,

2159
02:05:28,890 --> 02:05:33,090
once the body makes that
decision, all of a sudden you're
good. Like, okay, I'm, I'm,

2160
02:05:33,150 --> 02:05:37,670
I'm, I'm good. I mean the hands
had blisters everywhere, but the,

2161
02:05:37,900 --> 02:05:41,940
the body felt like, oh,
this is where we, you know,

2162
02:05:41,941 --> 02:05:46,260
I did a race across America with done
with wild man. He talked me into it.

2163
02:05:46,261 --> 02:05:51,120
I didn't want to do it. And he suckered
me into, into it. And uh, he said,

2164
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:53,490
cause I was like, he
had other plans. He was,

2165
02:05:53,491 --> 02:05:57,390
cause he was an operator and he's like,
he wanted me to go in this race.

2166
02:05:57,390 --> 02:05:59,240
And there's four, it's a
four man team, you know,

2167
02:05:59,260 --> 02:06:03,480
ram is now called the race across America.
It's a bicycle race across America.

2168
02:06:03,481 --> 02:06:05,550
You start in Oceanside
and in and Delaware.

2169
02:06:06,050 --> 02:06:10,860
And so you bike across and each
guy just goes like 45, 45, 45, 45.

2170
02:06:10,861 --> 02:06:13,340
And then you chase the other guy
when he's riding and you get out,

2171
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:16,680
then you just go full bore as hard as
you can for 45 minutes to the next guy

2172
02:06:16,681 --> 02:06:17,580
gets on.
He goes,

2173
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:20,100
but you're riding in the car chase and
the other guy and you do this day and

2174
02:06:20,101 --> 02:06:24,750
night, right? All you're doing it
day and night. And He, uh, you know,

2175
02:06:24,930 --> 02:06:28,470
we, the first couple of days we felt
pretty sick. Like you felt you don't even,

2176
02:06:28,740 --> 02:06:31,740
you don't even want water, like water.
You look at water and you're like,

2177
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:36,150
that's when I really learned to
appreciate Kombucha, but, uh,

2178
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:40,340
but we don't even want water. And then
day two, day three, all of a sudden,

2179
02:06:40,350 --> 02:06:45,000
day three, you're like, wow, I stomach
thing goes away. I'm ready to go.

2180
02:06:45,001 --> 02:06:47,550
I feel good, let's go. And uh,

2181
02:06:48,090 --> 02:06:52,020
but it was that thing about the
body being comfortable with that,

2182
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:55,950
that kind of dredgery but I,
I don't mind the monotony of that,

2183
02:06:56,010 --> 02:06:57,060
of that kind of like,
Hey,

2184
02:06:57,061 --> 02:07:01,260
I'm going to go that on and just you're
gonna Paddle for. But if I do it in my,

2185
02:07:01,410 --> 02:07:02,460
in a routine,

2186
02:07:02,850 --> 02:07:07,470
like something that's a little
more not out of a mission.

2187
02:07:07,850 --> 02:07:10,280
Right. And then I'm like,
then you're just, you know,

2188
02:07:10,290 --> 02:07:14,580
I don't want to go in and do the same
lifting routine did day in and day out.

2189
02:07:14,581 --> 02:07:15,570
It's just not,
Eh,

2190
02:07:15,700 --> 02:07:20,520
I'd prefer creating new stuff and making
it interesting and, and having that,

2191
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:22,650
that the distraction of the,

2192
02:07:22,651 --> 02:07:27,090
of the challenge of something
new and keep me interested in,

2193
02:07:27,180 --> 02:07:32,070
or did it make sense? Do you, what about
massage? Yeah. Love it. Live for it.

2194
02:07:32,130 --> 02:07:34,290
We'll kind of get,
uh,

2195
02:07:34,410 --> 02:07:39,410
only good ones get a
like deep tissues going.

2196
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:45,910
I've done to kind of almost every single
modality you can think it's usually

2197
02:07:45,911 --> 02:07:50,300
about the person. It's usually about
the person that gives it and, and,

2198
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:54,490
and how, if they're healers or
not. So I just try to find healers.

2199
02:07:54,491 --> 02:07:57,350
And when you say healers, what
do you mean? That people, that,

2200
02:07:57,370 --> 02:08:00,370
that do it because they're
into taking care of people.

2201
02:08:00,450 --> 02:08:03,820
Then they not doing it as a profession.
Like they don't do it to make money.

2202
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,030
They make money as a side product,
but they're healers. They, that they,

2203
02:08:07,170 --> 02:08:10,780
that they just have a gift that
there you go, you, you know, you can,

2204
02:08:10,930 --> 02:08:14,770
you can get 10 massages, right. And,
and, and they're all can be good,

2205
02:08:14,980 --> 02:08:18,430
but there's just one of the people
that they just have a skill.

2206
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:20,140
They know how to touch.
They know what it is.

2207
02:08:20,141 --> 02:08:22,480
They know where they know how to feel it.
They know how to,

2208
02:08:22,850 --> 02:08:27,460
they know how to use the
system. Um, you know, I've done,

2209
02:08:27,490 --> 02:08:28,950
uh,
that my,

2210
02:08:28,951 --> 02:08:33,240
the thing that I'm crazy about right
now is I'm crazy about dry needling. Um,

2211
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:37,720
that's the thing that has been the most
profound, uh, I mean, I've done, uh,

2212
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:40,030
you know, I've done, uh, oh,

2213
02:08:40,340 --> 02:08:44,410
she ought to and acupuncture and that
thing and just, I mean, I, you know,

2214
02:08:44,490 --> 02:08:49,490
and Rolfing and I've done the 10
series three times and I mean,

2215
02:08:50,050 --> 02:08:53,080
I've had all those different modalities,
but dry needling has been, you know,

2216
02:08:53,081 --> 02:08:55,750
and then I have another person
that, that, that just does,

2217
02:08:56,120 --> 02:08:59,620
and I don't even know what art it
is. It's just massage. And she just,

2218
02:08:59,860 --> 02:09:04,770
she just is able to understand the
tissue, no loud, and she's relentless and,

2219
02:09:04,790 --> 02:09:07,480
and, and, uh, and, and won't,

2220
02:09:07,630 --> 02:09:11,140
won't leave and won't leave
it until everything releases.

2221
02:09:11,140 --> 02:09:15,130
And she knows how to release it.
In Dry needling to people. Uh,

2222
02:09:15,131 --> 02:09:17,080
dry needling is,
uh,

2223
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:22,210
a technique where they use acupuncture
needles on soft tissue and they,

2224
02:09:22,211 --> 02:09:26,110
um, touch the trigger
point and get the system,

2225
02:09:26,170 --> 02:09:30,970
the stuff to release. Like it's, uh,
it's not acupuncture. It's, it's a,

2226
02:09:30,971 --> 02:09:34,270
it's a different modality that, that, um,

2227
02:09:35,170 --> 02:09:37,660
that I'm not sure if it's,
uh,

2228
02:09:38,410 --> 02:09:42,490
what states it's legal or not in,
I know most of the athletes that I know,

2229
02:09:42,491 --> 02:09:45,430
they used to do it a lot in
Australia. They do it in Europe. Um,

2230
02:09:45,610 --> 02:09:50,410
emotional in some places. Some places
it's not legal. Yeah. Why? I have no idea.

2231
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:54,300
It probably because it works and
somebody threatened by it. I mean,

2232
02:09:54,460 --> 02:09:56,360
isn't that usually the case?
Well,

2233
02:09:56,640 --> 02:10:00,250
gas or someone doesn't understand it
and they think someone's a quack and get

2234
02:10:00,251 --> 02:10:02,070
those needles. All of these people,
you don't know what you're doing.

2235
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:06,730
There's no science here. Yeah.
Well there's some science
behind it and uh, and it,

2236
02:10:06,731 --> 02:10:11,710
but it absolutely is the
most, uh, functional.

2237
02:10:11,711 --> 02:10:11,921
I mean,

2238
02:10:11,921 --> 02:10:15,910
I've got friends with giant knots in
their traps in the one session that then

2239
02:10:15,911 --> 02:10:19,990
goes away. Extremely
intense. Yeah. Intense,

2240
02:10:20,590 --> 02:10:24,280
intense. But it, but dry
needling is, you know,

2241
02:10:24,281 --> 02:10:28,510
if I ever have my friend who's really
good at it, comes through, I'll, I'll,

2242
02:10:28,740 --> 02:10:32,710
I'll steer her your way. Cause it's,
it's, it's, it's, it's the most effective.

2243
02:10:32,711 --> 02:10:36,680
I mean, I, I, you know, uh,
I think, uh, as someone, uh,

2244
02:10:37,130 --> 02:10:40,850
that you are always looking right, we're
always looking like, what, what, you know,

2245
02:10:40,940 --> 02:10:43,430
hey, we need the heat, we need the ice,
we need the thing. We need the food.

2246
02:10:43,431 --> 02:10:47,150
We need the thing. Where's
the tumor? Where's the, you
know, we always are looking.

2247
02:10:47,151 --> 02:10:50,890
And so when I run into things
that are affective, I'm,

2248
02:10:50,900 --> 02:10:54,600
I cherish him because I
know that you know it.

2249
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:58,580
And the problem is you have a high bar
because when you've experienced great

2250
02:10:58,581 --> 02:11:00,980
work, you just, you can't,

2251
02:11:01,010 --> 02:11:04,680
you go get somebody who does
a little mushy mushy and
you're just like, ah, don't,

2252
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:07,010
I don't have time for
that. I'll, I'll, I'll lay,

2253
02:11:07,220 --> 02:11:10,580
I'll lay still for three hours if I
know somebody knows what they're doing.

2254
02:11:10,700 --> 02:11:13,190
Right. But I won't be there
for 20 minutes if somebody,

2255
02:11:13,191 --> 02:11:17,450
if I feel like it's like half ass.
Yeah. Which is a lot of it, you know,

2256
02:11:17,451 --> 02:11:20,480
a lot of that stuff's out there
and PR and no fault to the people.

2257
02:11:20,481 --> 02:11:23,690
I think part of it is just, they probably
just don't know. And their intentions,

2258
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:26,580
it's gotta be your intentions.
Why, why do you do it? You know,

2259
02:11:26,590 --> 02:11:30,860
it's interesting how some people can just
find those problem areas. They just, Oh,

2260
02:11:30,861 --> 02:11:34,400
it's right here. I don't even
know. They know. And they,

2261
02:11:34,410 --> 02:11:35,930
and they feel it with their hands.

2262
02:11:35,931 --> 02:11:39,350
They see with their hands and they know
right where it's like connecting where

2263
02:11:39,351 --> 02:11:43,610
to dig in and, and how to release it.
Yeah. That's an art. That's what I said,

2264
02:11:43,890 --> 02:11:45,890
which will release. It's real. It's real.

2265
02:11:45,980 --> 02:11:48,770
When you're good and you and somebody
really knows what they're doing.

2266
02:11:48,771 --> 02:11:53,300
That's why I say more about the people
than the technique because there's, I can,

2267
02:11:53,301 --> 02:11:57,500
yeah, yeah, yeah. But, but give me the
person and, but that dry needling is,

2268
02:11:57,530 --> 02:12:02,120
is it's the most effective of any of the,
uh,

2269
02:12:02,121 --> 02:12:05,790
of the stuff that I've used it in. This
person is in California that you use, uh,

2270
02:12:05,791 --> 02:12:09,370
the girl that helps me as in
Hawaii. And then, uh, they,

2271
02:12:09,540 --> 02:12:11,750
they teach in Colorado.
It's actually a,

2272
02:12:11,780 --> 02:12:14,270
it's actually a technique
that they developed. Uh,

2273
02:12:14,360 --> 02:12:17,420
some guys that were studying
pain is from my understanding,

2274
02:12:17,421 --> 02:12:18,500
they were studying pain.

2275
02:12:18,890 --> 02:12:21,890
And so what they did is they had all
these people that were injured and

2276
02:12:21,891 --> 02:12:25,790
different areas and then they injected
them with different solutions and they

2277
02:12:25,791 --> 02:12:30,380
injected them with like a placebo and
like Celine and Novacane and all kinds of

2278
02:12:30,381 --> 02:12:32,510
different things.
And everybody got better.

2279
02:12:32,660 --> 02:12:36,260
And what they realized is that it was
the needle and the acuteness of the

2280
02:12:36,261 --> 02:12:40,400
needles themselves in the areas that
were painful, that were causing,

2281
02:12:40,401 --> 02:12:41,930
that was causing this release.

2282
02:12:42,170 --> 02:12:45,680
And so they develop the whole
pain referral chart and a,

2283
02:12:45,681 --> 02:12:49,880
and then they die and they developed
this, this technique. And uh, it's,

2284
02:12:49,881 --> 02:12:52,150
it's cause everybody always
confuse miss confused, you know,

2285
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:55,430
confuses it with acupuncture. They owe
Yaki book drag. No, it's not acupuncture.

2286
02:12:55,431 --> 02:12:59,390
This is in the soft tissue acupuncture's
on the Meridians and on the electrical

2287
02:12:59,391 --> 02:13:01,850
system. Right. This is
soft tissue. This is,

2288
02:13:02,150 --> 02:13:04,310
this is to get the soft tissue to release,

2289
02:13:04,311 --> 02:13:09,311
but they'll take stuff that you've had
that cyst like a cable somewhere or not

2290
02:13:09,651 --> 02:13:13,430
or something that just won't
release and, but it's, you know,

2291
02:13:13,650 --> 02:13:18,110
it's back to that no pain,
no gain. Oh yeah. For sure.

2292
02:13:18,111 --> 02:13:18,944
There's always that.

2293
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:22,160
I've got a lady that does trigger point
massage and it's the most painful shit

2294
02:13:22,161 --> 02:13:26,090
I've ever experienced in my life. It's
like you just want to quit. Absolutely.

2295
02:13:26,150 --> 02:13:30,310
When I get out of there the next day,
everything's like loose and pliable and,

2296
02:13:30,330 --> 02:13:32,000
and I've had things that are like,

2297
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,790
well, I've really injured myself. And she
fixed it. Yeah. And then like a day later,

2298
02:13:35,791 --> 02:13:38,240
like it doesn't hurt anymore.
I'm like, this is strange for,

2299
02:13:38,250 --> 02:13:40,230
and it's been hurt like for months.
Yes.

2300
02:13:40,290 --> 02:13:42,750
So there was something in
there that was not enough.

2301
02:13:43,170 --> 02:13:47,330
And I always assume that that's an
injury and sometimes it's not an age.

2302
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:52,470
It's not, yeah. It's just the tissue. It's
just not really set up. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

2303
02:13:52,471 --> 02:13:55,440
and they've tested it up to them to deal
with the Fascia and some other stuff

2304
02:13:55,441 --> 02:13:58,740
going on that did that,
that they have to know how to release it.

2305
02:13:59,130 --> 02:14:02,340
And saunas seems to help
that quite a bit too crazy.

2306
02:14:02,341 --> 02:14:04,560
The combination of those two are,
I mean that's,

2307
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:10,280
that's what I found is that sauna and
ice kind of eliminate the need really to

2308
02:14:11,041 --> 02:14:15,750
get worked on enlisted super cute.
Like if it's not, if it's super cute,

2309
02:14:16,050 --> 02:14:20,520
then there you, you, you know, you need,
you need somebody to go in there and,

2310
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:24,810
you know, put the Jack Hammer on it.
But, but if it's not a cute like that,

2311
02:14:24,811 --> 02:14:26,800
just the normal maintenance and,
and,

2312
02:14:27,020 --> 02:14:30,810
and actually preventing the stuff from
getting to a point where you really need

2313
02:14:30,811 --> 02:14:35,490
to get the work, the sauna ends
magic. That stuff is crazy good.

2314
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:39,270
And it seems to me that when I've
been ramping up the temperature,

2315
02:14:39,271 --> 02:14:42,660
like in the two hundreds and now in
the two to it seems more effective,

2316
02:14:42,661 --> 02:14:47,250
more effective, more effective. It's
more intense. More torture. Yeah.

2317
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:50,430
More towards her, more results. But I'm
a little bit, you know, and I don't know,

2318
02:14:50,431 --> 02:14:53,550
maybe it's something you can find out,
but I this thing with,

2319
02:14:53,820 --> 02:14:56,430
I'm a little rocky right now with the,

2320
02:14:56,431 --> 02:14:59,430
with the infrared was going to ask you
that I'm a little rocky with the infrared

2321
02:14:59,431 --> 02:15:01,690
right now only because, uh,
of just some of the, uh,

2322
02:15:01,790 --> 02:15:05,520
something that happened to me with
my skin and then, and then met,

2323
02:15:05,580 --> 02:15:10,140
I met a dermatologist that was pretty
educated and he was saying that, you know,

2324
02:15:10,141 --> 02:15:11,220
that that,
uh,

2325
02:15:11,610 --> 02:15:16,280
that he says is that it damages the
Collagen and then it does, yeah. Yeah.

2326
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:19,890
Damages the Collagen in
your body. He's way, hey,

2327
02:15:19,891 --> 02:15:22,860
affects the structure of the skin
because of the penetration of it.

2328
02:15:23,370 --> 02:15:27,530
And that the most you should ever do is,
this is, and these are my words, but the,

2329
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:31,230
uh, the most you should ever
do is, is, is, you know,

2330
02:15:31,231 --> 02:15:35,330
three times a week for 15 minutes
at the most for infrared. Yeah.

2331
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:37,530
And Andy was saying that,
uh,

2332
02:15:37,740 --> 02:15:41,250
and you should never look at it as well.
Jesus,

2333
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:45,330
like it's harmful to the eyes. Yeah. So,

2334
02:15:45,331 --> 02:15:49,350
so I got a regular sauna just because
the protocol that the doctor Rhonda

2335
02:15:49,350 --> 02:15:53,520
Patrick was talked about for
those, I guess it was uh,
was it Norway? Yeah. Yeah.

2336
02:15:53,910 --> 02:15:56,160
That was all regular songs.
Yeah. So I'm like look,

2337
02:15:56,161 --> 02:15:57,890
if they're getting into this
results from regular sauna,

2338
02:15:57,891 --> 02:15:58,950
I'll just do a regular sauna.

2339
02:15:59,010 --> 02:16:01,890
Well I like regular anyway cause
it just seems like it's natural.

2340
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:05,040
It's kind of like ice. Like people go and
Cryo, hey you want to go cry? I'll go.

2341
02:16:05,270 --> 02:16:08,360
I have a nice tub. I don't eat
crow. And by the way if you,

2342
02:16:08,550 --> 02:16:11,670
if you want to do a real
ice going on ice tub,

2343
02:16:11,690 --> 02:16:14,200
cause Cryo is cake walk
compared to a real iced up.

2344
02:16:15,500 --> 02:16:17,350
You can only do Cryo for
a couple of minutes to,

2345
02:16:17,580 --> 02:16:18,960
and you don't have heat next to it.

2346
02:16:18,961 --> 02:16:22,180
And I mean you can not only do ice for
a couple minutes till it's like think

2347
02:16:22,210 --> 02:16:25,610
about cryo though is you can do
cryo and then work out. Yeah,

2348
02:16:26,150 --> 02:16:29,980
you can do Iceland workout too and know,
yeah I do that all the

2349
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,140
time. In fact, we incorporate
ice into training.

2350
02:16:32,470 --> 02:16:36,550
And so one of the things that we do is
we'll three quarters into the training,

2351
02:16:36,730 --> 02:16:37,600
we'll just pull out,

2352
02:16:37,601 --> 02:16:40,720
right when you start to kind of lose
some of your juice and you'll go do like

2353
02:16:40,721 --> 02:16:43,150
three minutes and come out and
then try and you have another gear.

2354
02:16:43,330 --> 02:16:47,650
So that's another little thing
to incorporate ice within
that within that system.

2355
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:52,150
Or we'll do ice as we,
as we train as one of the stations,

2356
02:16:52,151 --> 02:16:56,210
imagine doing a circuit. And
one of the stations is, you
know, we are doing, uh, uh,

2357
02:16:56,500 --> 02:17:00,100
we're doing a horse a couple of
months ago on the last season maybe,

2358
02:17:00,101 --> 02:17:01,520
but we were doing a, uh, like a,

2359
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:05,290
an iron horse free standing in a horse
position with your arms and we'd stand in

2360
02:17:05,291 --> 02:17:08,290
that position for 10 or 15 minutes
of course, position with your,

2361
02:17:08,291 --> 02:17:11,350
on your musical horse stance.
Yeah. Horse car. Yes. Yeah. Okay.

2362
02:17:11,360 --> 02:17:14,860
So we're in a horse stance with where
the arms are straight out. Okay.

2363
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:18,430
You're holding, so call it the iron horse
or whatever, just standing in the horse.

2364
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:22,420
So He's standing in the horse position,
10 minutes, go on the ice, three minutes.

2365
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:24,970
Oh, come back out San,
they'll send another thing,

2366
02:17:24,990 --> 02:17:27,940
go on the back of the ice in the thing.
Blow you up,

2367
02:17:28,270 --> 02:17:32,440
explode you like crazy. So I
mean there's always, like I said,

2368
02:17:32,441 --> 02:17:36,490
there's always a little, you
know, a little hook to give it.

2369
02:17:36,491 --> 02:17:40,560
But the ice to incorporate it within
your training I think is phenomenal.

2370
02:17:40,570 --> 02:17:44,320
Like people, that's why I questioned
warming up because people go warm up.

2371
02:17:44,321 --> 02:17:47,260
How about do three to five minutes ice
and then go start all your cardio and

2372
02:17:47,261 --> 02:17:50,500
start to train. Right now your body
will just be freaked out, freaked out.

2373
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:54,970
But it's, the ice makes you stimulate
it. Like when you feel the system, it's,

2374
02:17:55,300 --> 02:17:58,660
it's cold but you're not cold.
Like it's trying to heat up,

2375
02:17:58,661 --> 02:18:03,220
heat up Michael Phelps in the pool,
heat up. It's revving. Interesting.

2376
02:18:03,310 --> 02:18:07,950
So there's all of that.
That's like the science of the
fun, you know, the, uh, the,

2377
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:10,390
for me,
I look at it like a laboratory.

2378
02:18:10,391 --> 02:18:14,860
It's a little bit like being an artist
and playing all that stuff that brings,

2379
02:18:15,070 --> 02:18:19,900
makes that keeps me interested. It keeps
me excited about about learning. Uh,

2380
02:18:19,910 --> 02:18:22,600
learning. Cause I think it's about
learning. It's all about learning. Yeah.

2381
02:18:22,601 --> 02:18:25,690
Learning about your body and learning
about what to affective. Yeah.

2382
02:18:25,950 --> 02:18:30,130
Well that's why I'm glad there's guys
like you out there. The Guinea pigs. Yeah.

2383
02:18:30,131 --> 02:18:34,870
Well the Guinea pigs, Guinea pigs. That
again are in my age group. Yeah. So like,

2384
02:18:34,871 --> 02:18:39,670
I know that it's possible because they're
in this 55 absolutely long after that.

2385
02:18:40,150 --> 02:18:42,700
Well, listen man, thank you. Thanks
for coming here. Thanks for doing that.

2386
02:18:42,701 --> 02:18:45,850
I want to do your workout too. Yeah.
Well you're, you have an open invitation.

2387
02:18:46,340 --> 02:18:50,830
I happen. I gotta I gotta I'm still a
after the fires, I'm still cleaning,

2388
02:18:50,831 --> 02:18:53,500
so I got this weekend. I
should, we are doing a cert,

2389
02:18:53,501 --> 02:18:56,410
so we're training some people this
weekend, but after this weekend,
