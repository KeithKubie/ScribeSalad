00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.500
Choreographing for me is organizing movements
in time and space.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.720
You can call it moving architecture, you could
define it as celebrating your humanity.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.560
The human body is your instrument when you
dance.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.360
You use it in its mechanical way, in an emotional
way, in a social way.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.480
And in a spiritual way.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.800
And in a sensuous way.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.780
It's so much a part of my life, and of my
way of relating to the world.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.620
The choreography 'Vortex Temporum', which is
based on the music of the French spectralist

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.120
composer Gérard Grisey, was originally made
for black box.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.880
It's a sextet for three strings, two winds,
and a piano.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.380
Work/Travail/Arbeid is the rewriting of that
black box version, for the totally different

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.100
space and time of a museum.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.340
The original version that lasts one hour is
now expanded to a longer cycle of nine hours.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.860
Things are much more liquid in time, it's
liquid movement and liquid space.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.640
And the spectators are somehow part of that.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.480
This is not easy music.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.320
This music 
is very layered, there is no common beat

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.120
you know, the beat is totally exploded, it
becomes liquid.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
The harmonies are extremely dissonant.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.680
To choreograph to this kind of music, which
is of such a complexity, I considered it really

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.680
as a challenge.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.560
You know, how do you dance to that?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.680
To match the complexity of that music I took
the decision of linking

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.040
one dancer to one instrument.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.840
And to work layer by layer.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.960
To put those layers
on top of each other, you see different combinations

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.640
of people linked to different instruments.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.400
This whirling spiral, this vortex, is the
basic form that generated the vocabulary

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.600
and it organized the space.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.840
Here in MoMA, it's extremely noisy.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.200
There is an activity of the people which is
quite vibrant, quite New York-ish.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.800
But what is crucially different is we go away
from the frontality.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.080
Normally when I work I will sit in the middle
at the front, and I choreograph from that

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.160
frontal position.

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:26.069
Because of this vortex, stemmed from the spiral,
I was constantly walking around trying out

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.830
different perspectives.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.920
You can come close, you have access to detail,
you can eventually go in the middle of the space.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.760
You can sit yourself in a corner.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.160
You are not in this fixed relationship between a spectator

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.320
and the performer.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.840
In the last ten years I also started to question
the very nature of movement.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:32.720
Without laws and rules, what helps me to create
that counterpoint, to get complexity and readability,

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:38.080
and its still anchored immediately to the
music.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:15.040
What I like so much about dance is that you
can embody the most abstract ideas.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.600
Layer by layer, you can rethink the very nature
of movement.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:39.040
That slow work process of constructing the
building, is somehow deconstructed in Work/Travail/Arbeid.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.120
And it's a lot of work.
