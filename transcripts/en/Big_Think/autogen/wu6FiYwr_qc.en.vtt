00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.760
Just about every time that I get involved
in a discussion or a conversation about technological

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.690
progress and how it can take away jobs from
people and how it can automate away things

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.009
that people used to do, one of the first things
that people talk about this irreplaceable

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.710
human skill is creativity, is coming up with
some kind of eureka.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.230
And I think that is simultaneously correct
and not correct at all.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.130
And let me talk first about the way that it's
not correct at all.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.280
There are lots of different definitions of
creativity out there.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.950
One of them that I walk around with is the
ability to come up with a powerful or a useful

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.700
legitimately novel idea.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.750
I think that's what creative people, whether
they are innovators or entrepreneurs or investors

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.620
or musicians or painters, a lot of what I
think of as creativity is this eureka, this

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.220
coming up with something that's valuable or
valued and also pretty novel.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.190
Machines can do that now by any definition
they can do that in lots of different domains.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.240
There's a rapidly growing field called generative
design and what that means is if you feed

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.049
into a modern piece of technology the specifications
that you want this building to be able to

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.569
handle or this heat exchanger or the frame
of a car or some kind of part out there in

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:34.329
the physical world that has to meet some performance
specifications or fit inside some performance

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.719
envelope we've got software that will generate
a part that will do that admirably.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.670
And what's interesting is when you couple
that software to a 3-D printer you print out

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.069
these arbitrarily complex shapes that do exactly
what you want them to do.

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.149
They're typically very, very high performing,
they're typically very efficient.

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.689
They very often look different than what a
human designer would come up with.

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.929
When I look at the parts that get churned
out by generative design software they look

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.950
skulls or skeletons or exoskeletons that you
see in nature and I was initially surprised

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.950
by that.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.510
I don't think I should be surprised by that,
the forms that nature produces are by definition

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.690
really, really useful and really efficient
because they've survived all the evolutionary

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.989
challenges in history so far and arrived at
this point so they're really beautiful objects.

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.930
Generative design software can turn out objects
like that now that remind me a lot of things

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.489
that we see in the natural world.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.760
They look different than what human designers
come up with.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.099
They perform better in many cases than what
human designers come up with.

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.040
I would call the work of design a very creative
endeavor.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.720
We have technology that's now good at that.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.019
There's also technology that can compose music
in almost any style that you suggest.

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:01.450
And there's an interesting phenomenon going
on there: when people know in advance that

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.610
they're going to be listening to computer
generated music they very often dismiss it

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.970
as shallow or trivial or obviously not coming
from a human composer's mind and heart.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.430
When listeners don't know in advance that
they're listening to computer generated music

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.450
they very often find it as evocative, as beautiful,
as moving as anything a human being would

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.829
come up with.

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.769
I guess we shouldn't be so surprised by that.

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.010
Human taste in music is not this great unknown.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.670
We know some of the rules about what western
listeners, for example, find appealing in

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.670
music.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.080
You can bake those rules into software, hit
go and generate a lot of music.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.110
So again, that's an endeavor where I would've
thought of it as creative and computers are

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.909
clearly doing at least an adequate job, possibly
a really, really good job.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:57.359
However, what we haven't seen yet are computers
that can turn out lyrics on top of that music

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:03.819
that sound anything except either really,
really silly or flat out nonsensical and ridiculous.

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.120
And if you look at longer form prose that
computers generate, they can generate an arbitrarily

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.930
long novel short story set of pros, whatever,
it's gibberish, it's nonsense, it kind of

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.240
makes your head hurt in not a good way to
have to plow through this stuff.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.500
And my explanation for why that is is that
computers they just don't know anything about

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.639
the human condition.

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:30.960
They're not human.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.370
They haven't evolved in this world.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.580
They don't live with other people in this
world.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.150
They're beautiful mimics of a lot of things,
but when I think about what truly creative

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.750
writers and lyricists do is they understand
the human condition, they illuminate it and

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.160
they kind of reflect it back to us in a way
that we responded to.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.560
I still haven't seen any piece of technology
do that.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.440
There's a concept from linguistics that I
find it really helpful for understanding computer

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.740
creativity and the concept from linguistics
is called the intuition of the native speaker.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.250
And what they mean by that is because I'm
a native speaker of English I can immediately

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.080
look at an English sentence and even before
my brain has processed its meaning I know

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.780
if it's grammatically correct or not.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.280
I can scan that way before I even know what
I'm doing and I can know if that's a properly

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.550
constructed English sentence or not.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.930
I can't do that for any other language and
people who come to English as a later language

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.169
can't do it nearly as reliably, nearly as
quickly as I can.

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.890
So we native speakers build up this intuition
about the languages that we speak.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:47.479
The way I apply that to this notion about
digital creativity, we humans have the native

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.860
speaker's intuition about the human condition,
about the human world, about the social environment

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.740
that we all create.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.620
I'm skeptical, I'm a huge optimist about technology.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.629
Based on what I've seen so far I am really
skeptical that we're going to be able to successfully

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:10.490
convey that intuition, even to a really, really
big really sophisticated piece of technology

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.960
or machine learning system.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.600
I just think if that day ever comes it is
a long, long way away.
