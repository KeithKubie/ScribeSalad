You fought all year,
beat out scandal after scandal,

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.305
got your husband
to keep his dick in his pants--

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.341
though, that was probably
largely because of his age--

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:09.409
and finally
reached the big night

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:10.978
where you're officially
nominated

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.113
as the Democratic
presidential candidate.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:16.450
What better way to celebrate
than with a kick-ass video?

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:18.252
Jack, roll the kick-assness!

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:20.420

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:26.627
-(laughter)
-Oh, God.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.029
(laughter)

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:34.535
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:37.104
Rise to the top
and destroy all of your haters!

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:38.572
(laughter)

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:41.475
As with most videos released on
the Internet, this got a remix.

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:43.010
Comedians,
what was the video mashed-up

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.279
with Stone Cold Steve Austin's
theme song,

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:48.815
-or the Imperial March from...?
Yes, Matt Mira. -It's...

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:51.185
I mean, it's got to be
Stone Cold. The glass shatters.

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:55.255
-You're thinking Hillary 3:16.
-All right, let's find out.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.924
(glass shatters)

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:59.960
-♪
-OTHERS: Yeah!

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:01.929
HAHN:
Yes!

Hillary 3:16 says

00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:12.973
I don't understand e-mail!

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.942
(laughter)

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.478
How awesome, though.
She smashed the ceiling

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:20.147
but cracked a smile.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.247
-(laughter)
-She did.
