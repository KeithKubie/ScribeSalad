00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:08.052
What would you say

00:00:08.052 --> 00:00:09.579
is the most important discovery

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:11.581
made in the past few centuries?

00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:12.614
Is it the computer?

00:00:12.614 --> 00:00:13.263
The car?

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:14.168
Electricity?

00:00:14.168 --> 00:00:16.145
Or maybe the discovery of the atom?

00:00:16.145 --> 00:00:19.592
I would argue that it is this chemical reaction:

00:00:19.592 --> 00:00:21.213
a nitrogen gas molecule

00:00:21.213 --> 00:00:23.297
plus three hydrogen gas molecules

00:00:23.297 --> 00:00:26.739
gets you two ammonia gas molecules.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.343
This is the Haber process

00:00:28.343 --> 00:00:30.925
of binding nitrogen molecules in the air

00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:32.431
to hydrogen molecules,

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:35.564
or turning air into fertilizer.

00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:36.806
Without this reaction,

00:00:36.806 --> 00:00:39.482
farmers would be capable of producing enough food

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:41.348
for only 4 billion people;

00:00:41.348 --> 00:00:44.880
our current population is just over 7 billion people.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.881
So, without the Haber process,

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:51.306
over 3 billion people would be without food.

00:00:51.306 --> 00:00:55.025
You see, nitrogen in the form of nitrate, NO3,

00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:58.205
is an essential nutrient for plants to survive.

00:00:58.205 --> 00:01:00.706
As crops grow, they consume the nitrogen,

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:02.425
removing it from the soil.

00:01:02.425 --> 00:01:03.923
The nitrogen can be replenished

00:01:03.923 --> 00:01:06.346
through long, natural fertilization processes

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:07.845
like decaying animals,

00:01:07.845 --> 00:01:09.679
but humans want to grow food

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:11.680
much faster than that.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.591
Now, here's the frustrating part:

00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:16.594
78% of the air is composed of nitrogen,

00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:19.396
but crops can't just take nitrogen from the air

00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:22.511
because it contains very strong triple bonds,

00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:24.643
which crops cannot break.

00:01:24.643 --> 00:01:26.643
What Haber did basically

00:01:26.643 --> 00:01:27.762
was figure out a way

00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:29.529
to take this nitrogen in the air

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:31.281
and put it into the ground.

00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:34.864
In 1908, the German chemist Fritz Haber

00:01:34.864 --> 00:01:36.176
developed a chemical method

00:01:36.176 --> 00:01:39.020
for utilizing the vast supply of nitrogen in the air.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.890
Haber found a method

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.594
which took the nitrogen in the air

00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:43.046
and bonded it to hydrogen

00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:45.242
to form ammonia.

00:01:45.242 --> 00:01:47.797
Ammonia can then be injected into the soil,

00:01:47.797 --> 00:01:50.506
where it is quickly converted into nitrate.

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:53.100
But if Haber's process was going to be used

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.950
to feed the world,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.213
he would need to find a way

00:01:55.213 --> 00:01:58.415
to create a lot of this ammonia quickly and easily.

00:01:58.415 --> 00:01:59.381
In order to understand

00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:01.900
how Haber accomplished this feat,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.179
we need to know something

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.397
about chemical equilibrium.

00:02:04.397 --> 00:02:06.346
Chemical equilibrium can be achieved

00:02:06.346 --> 00:02:09.514
when you have a reaction in a closed container.

00:02:09.514 --> 00:02:11.233
For example, let's say you put

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:14.346
hydrogen and nitrogen into a closed container

00:02:14.346 --> 00:02:16.158
and allow them to react.

00:02:16.158 --> 00:02:17.757
In the beginning of the experiment,

00:02:17.757 --> 00:02:20.370
we have a lot of nitrogen and hydrogen,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.006
so the formation of ammonia

00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:24.098
proceeds at a high speed.

00:02:24.098 --> 00:02:26.680
But as the hydrogen and nitrogen react

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.261
and get used up,

00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:29.883
the reaction slows down

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:31.842
because there is less nitrogen and hydrogen

00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:33.625
in the container.

00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:36.347
Eventually, the ammonia molecules reach a point

00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:38.058
where they start to decompose

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:41.339
back into the nitrogen and hydrogen.

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:43.063
After a while, the two reactions,

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:45.588
creating and breaking down ammonia,

00:02:45.588 --> 00:02:47.634
will reach the same speed.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:49.341
When these speeds are equal,

00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:52.147
we say the reaction has reached equilibrium.

00:02:53.146 --> 00:02:55.280
This might sound good, but it's not

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.511
when what you want

00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:58.817
is to just create a ton of ammonia.

00:02:58.817 --> 00:03:00.336
Haber doesn't want the ammonia

00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:01.855
to break down at all,

00:03:01.855 --> 00:03:03.374
but if you simply leave the reaction

00:03:03.374 --> 00:03:04.865
in a closed container,

00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:06.487
that's what will happen.

00:03:06.487 --> 00:03:08.794
Here's where Henry Le Chatelier,

00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:09.981
a French chemist,

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:11.271
can help.

00:03:11.271 --> 00:03:12.705
What he found was

00:03:12.705 --> 00:03:14.590
that if you take a system in equilibrium

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.296
and you add something to it,

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:17.723
like, say, nitrogen,

00:03:17.723 --> 00:03:18.715
the system will work

00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:20.921
to get back to equilibrium again.

00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:22.296
Le Chatelier also found

00:03:22.296 --> 00:03:23.469
that if you increase

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.596
the amount of pressure on a system,

00:03:25.596 --> 00:03:26.761
the system tries to work

00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:28.978
to return to the pressure it had.

00:03:28.978 --> 00:03:30.675
It's like being in a crowded room.

00:03:30.675 --> 00:03:32.182
The more molecules there are,

00:03:32.182 --> 00:03:33.773
the more pressure there is.

00:03:33.773 --> 00:03:35.529
If we look back at our equation,

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:37.532
we see that on the left-hand side,

00:03:37.532 --> 00:03:39.681
there are four molecules on the left

00:03:39.681 --> 00:03:41.776
and just two on the right.

00:03:41.776 --> 00:03:44.278
So, if we want the room to be less crowded,

00:03:44.278 --> 00:03:45.872
and therefore have less pressure,

00:03:45.872 --> 00:03:46.779
the system will start

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:48.670
combining nitrogen and hydrogen

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.804
to make the more compact ammonia molecules.

00:03:51.804 --> 00:03:53.821
Haber realized that in order to make

00:03:53.821 --> 00:03:55.100
large amounts of ammonia,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.604
he would have to create a machine

00:03:56.604 --> 00:03:59.600
that would continually add nitrogen and hydrogen

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.438
while also increasing the pressure

00:04:01.438 --> 00:04:03.314
on the equilibrium system,

00:04:03.314 --> 00:04:05.480
which is exactly what he did.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.030
Today, ammonia is one of the most produced

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.313
chemical compounds in the world.

00:04:10.313 --> 00:04:14.891
Roughly 131 million metric tons are produced a year,

00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:18.314
which is about 290 billion pounds of ammonia.

00:04:18.314 --> 00:04:19.363
That's about the mass

00:04:19.363 --> 00:04:21.447
of 30 million African elephants,

00:04:21.447 --> 00:04:24.314
weighing roughly 10,000 pounds each.

00:04:24.314 --> 00:04:28.087
80% of this ammonia is used in fertilizer production,

00:04:28.087 --> 00:04:29.041
while the rest is used

00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:30.937
in industrial and household cleaners

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:33.314
and to produce other nitrogen compounds,

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:35.265
such as nitric acid.

00:04:35.265 --> 00:04:36.345
Recent studies have found

00:04:36.345 --> 00:04:38.837
that half of the nitrogen from these fertilizers

00:04:38.837 --> 00:04:41.147
is not assimilated by plants.

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:42.977
Consequently, the nitrogen is found

00:04:42.977 --> 00:04:44.642
as a volatile chemical compound

00:04:44.642 --> 00:04:47.695
in the Earth's water supplies and atmosphere,

00:04:47.695 --> 00:04:49.646
severely damaging our environment.

00:04:49.646 --> 00:04:51.475
Of course, Haber did not foresee this problem

00:04:51.475 --> 00:04:53.095
when he introduced his invention.

00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:54.773
Following his pioneering vision,

00:04:54.773 --> 00:04:56.388
scientists today are looking

00:04:56.388 --> 00:04:59.054
for a new Haber process of the 21st century,

00:04:59.054 --> 00:05:01.029
which will reach the same level of aid

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:03.359
without the dangerous consequences.
