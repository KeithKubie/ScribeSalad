00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:03.405
- [Voiceover] We're working
on the mesh current method,

00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:05.728
a method of analyzing circuits.

00:00:05.728 --> 00:00:08.773
And in the previous video
we set up our circuit,

00:00:08.773 --> 00:00:12.940
we set up our mesh currents
flowing around these loops

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:18.024
within the circuit, and we
solved for the easy currents.

00:00:18.024 --> 00:00:20.589
That was the current on this side,

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.257
this current source constrains
i3 to be a fixed value,

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:25.859
so we already know i3.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.110
And then we created two equations

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.767
from the two independent
variables, the two currents here,

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:34.699
to describe how the circuit works.

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.866
And in this video we're going
to solve these two equations.

00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:41.572
One thing to remind ourselves,

00:00:41.572 --> 00:00:43.731
when we defined these mesh currents

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:45.984
all of them went in the same direction.

00:00:45.984 --> 00:00:48.188
It helps to make them all
go in the same direction,

00:00:48.188 --> 00:00:50.255
but all clockwise in this case.

00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:51.696
And that's so that when you have

00:00:51.696 --> 00:00:53.111
this little pattern down here

00:00:53.111 --> 00:00:55.694
of i1 minus i2, or i2 minus i3,

00:00:56.711 --> 00:00:58.591
that it becomes a familiar pattern,

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.586
and it helps to get the signs right.

00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:03.026
The other thing to point out is

00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:06.093
the reason we're using
meshes and not any other loop

00:01:06.093 --> 00:01:08.181
in this circuit, not overlapping loops

00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:09.551
like we could have gone all the way

00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:11.557
around the outside in a loop.

00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:12.979
The reason that meshes,

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.023
in particular the open
areas of the circuit,

00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:18.270
are a good way to do this method

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.406
is because it produces exactly

00:01:20.406 --> 00:01:23.402
the right number of equations
to solve the circuit.

00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:24.888
You don't have too few equations,

00:01:24.888 --> 00:01:28.070
and you don't have too many equations.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.229
So let me move the screen up

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.562
and we'll go to work on these equations.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.982
So now we begin step four,

00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:41.745
which is to solve the equations.

00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:42.860
And what I want to do first is,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.184
just to tidy up a little bit,

00:01:44.184 --> 00:01:45.903
I'm gonna take the constants

00:01:45.903 --> 00:01:47.875
and I'm gonna put them
on the right hand side,

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:50.755
and I'm gonna gather
together the terms for i1

00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:53.958
and the terms for i2 in separate places.

00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.279
So if we go at the first
equation and we look for i1,

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:59.832
it's mentioned here twice,

00:01:59.832 --> 00:02:01.082
so we get minus

00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:05.648
and it's a combination of r1

00:02:07.273 --> 00:02:09.023
and plus r2 times i1.

00:02:15.437 --> 00:02:19.020
And for the i2 term,
let's see if i2 shows up,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.522
i2 just shows up once here.

00:02:21.522 --> 00:02:23.855
So it's gonna be plus r2 i2.

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:31.343
And that's gonna be equal to,

00:02:31.343 --> 00:02:33.665
let's move V over to the other side,

00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:36.248
so V becomes minus V over here.

00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:40.050
So that's our first equation.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.583
So now let's tidy up the second equation.

00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:46.250
The i1 terms, this is
the only i1 term here.

00:02:47.086 --> 00:02:49.169
So it's plus r2 i2, oops,

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.460
plus r2 i1, that's the only i1 term.

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.607
Now if we do i2 terms,

00:03:05.607 --> 00:03:09.774
we're gonna have minus r2 i2,
minus r3 i2, and minus r4, i2.

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:17.700
So let's do that this way,

00:03:22.457 --> 00:03:23.290
r2 plus r3

00:03:28.731 --> 00:03:29.564
plus r4

00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:35.031
times i2.

00:03:38.781 --> 00:03:40.942
Now we have an i3 term in here,

00:03:40.942 --> 00:03:45.215
but we know what i3 is,
i3 we know from this.

00:03:45.215 --> 00:03:49.139
So I'm gonna write that down right here,

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.387
that equals minus I, there's
lots of minus signs here,

00:03:53.387 --> 00:03:55.732
so let's see if we can get this right.

00:03:55.732 --> 00:03:59.232
Minus r4 times minus i3 is positive r4 i3,

00:04:02.906 --> 00:04:04.739
or it's negative r4 I,

00:04:07.692 --> 00:04:11.859
and when we take it to the
other side it'll be plus r4 I.

00:04:19.045 --> 00:04:20.345
Let me check that again.

00:04:20.345 --> 00:04:23.928
Minus r4 times minus
i3 is a positive sign,

00:04:26.336 --> 00:04:28.566
I gives it a negative
sign, and when we take it

00:04:28.566 --> 00:04:31.128
to the other side it gets a positive sign.

00:04:31.128 --> 00:04:32.685
Good.

00:04:32.685 --> 00:04:33.684
Alright?

00:04:33.684 --> 00:04:37.932
So this is what our
equations look like now.

00:04:37.932 --> 00:04:39.349
Let's keep going.

00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:43.528
I can continue using symbols
for the resistor values,

00:04:43.528 --> 00:04:45.572
but it's gonna get kind of complicated

00:04:45.572 --> 00:04:48.148
and it doesn't help
with our understanding,

00:04:48.148 --> 00:04:52.065
so I'm gonna switch over
to a specific circuit.

00:04:59.402 --> 00:05:02.119
So what I did was I filled
in some resistor values here

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:04.278
and I put five volts
on the voltage source,

00:05:04.278 --> 00:05:07.028
one k ohms for r1, 2k ohms is r2,

00:05:07.878 --> 00:05:10.295
3k ohms is r3, 3k ohms is r4,

00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:15.563
and there's two milliamps over here.

00:05:15.563 --> 00:05:17.118
So I'm just gonna write these values

00:05:17.118 --> 00:05:20.277
onto the equation here so I don't mess up.

00:05:20.277 --> 00:05:23.527
One k, two k, two k, that's five volts.

00:05:27.432 --> 00:05:31.099
That's two k ohms, two
k ohms, three k ohms,

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.416
and r4 was also three, is three,

00:05:39.127 --> 00:05:41.044
and I is two milliamps.

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.576
I'm gonna move the circuit down
out of the way a little bit.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.212
Now we have room for our equation.

00:05:56.212 --> 00:05:58.975
Let's fill it out again
with the real values.

00:05:58.975 --> 00:06:02.975
So it's gonna be minus
one plus two is three i1,

00:06:06.058 --> 00:06:06.975
plus two i2

00:06:12.541 --> 00:06:14.041
equals minus five.

00:06:18.624 --> 00:06:20.807
We know all the resistors are k ohms

00:06:20.807 --> 00:06:23.662
and so we can actually
scale our equations down

00:06:23.662 --> 00:06:26.393
by a factor of 1,000 and just use

00:06:26.393 --> 00:06:28.704
the simple numbers without the ks.

00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:31.371
So our second equation is two i1

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:39.436
minus two plus three
plus three is eight i2,

00:06:43.886 --> 00:06:47.886
and that equals three k
ohms times two milliamps,

00:06:47.886 --> 00:06:48.886
is plus six.

00:06:55.241 --> 00:06:59.408
So this is getting close
to something we can solve.

00:07:02.512 --> 00:07:04.321
So I think the way I want to solve this

00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:08.083
is I'm going to take this equation here

00:07:08.083 --> 00:07:10.083
and multiply it by four,

00:07:11.311 --> 00:07:14.478
and then add it to this equation here.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.065
And let's see what we get.

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:23.232
So four times minus three is minus 12,

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:27.844
and we add it and we're gonna get.

00:07:31.024 --> 00:07:35.191
Four times two is eight,
minus eight, and i2 drops out.

00:07:37.224 --> 00:07:39.547
That was the purpose of the four.

00:07:39.547 --> 00:07:43.714
And that equals four times
minus five is minus 20,

00:07:44.794 --> 00:07:46.544
plus six is minus 14.

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:53.099
So i1 equals minus 14 over 10,

00:07:57.762 --> 00:08:00.012
or i1 equals 1.4 milliamps,

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:08.185
and that's cool.

00:08:08.185 --> 00:08:10.852
We get to put a box around that.

00:08:13.515 --> 00:08:16.602
So as a reminder, we defined
i1 to be the mesh current

00:08:16.602 --> 00:08:19.185
flowing around like this in i1.

00:08:21.527 --> 00:08:22.694
1.4 milliamps.

00:08:25.687 --> 00:08:29.232
That's one of our independent variables.

00:08:29.232 --> 00:08:31.299
Now that we know i1, let's just choose one

00:08:31.299 --> 00:08:35.990
of our original equations here
and figure out what i2 is.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.157
We'll plug in two times
i1, which is 1.4 milliamps,

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.727
minus eight i2 equals six.

00:08:50.083 --> 00:08:52.987
And now we have to figure out i2.

00:08:52.987 --> 00:08:55.030
So let's solve this.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.113
Minus eight i2 equals six

00:09:00.555 --> 00:09:02.805
minus two times 1.4 is 2.8.

00:09:06.824 --> 00:09:09.907
i2 equals 3.2 divided by minus eight,

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:19.907
or i2 equals minus 0.4 milliamps.

00:09:27.777 --> 00:09:31.214
And we can draw a box around that too.

00:09:31.214 --> 00:09:33.095
So let's put that mesh current in.

00:09:33.095 --> 00:09:35.178
And our mesh current was.

00:09:38.886 --> 00:09:42.969
That was i2, and that
equals minus 0.4 milliamps.

00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:52.161
And what that means is
that the current is flowing

00:09:52.161 --> 00:09:53.915
in the negative direction,

00:09:53.915 --> 00:09:57.622
so it's actually flowing this
way through these resistors.

00:09:57.622 --> 00:10:00.501
It's actually flowing in the
counterclockwise direction

00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:02.311
is the positive current.

00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:05.228
And from before we already knew i3.

00:10:09.038 --> 00:10:11.538
i3 equals minus two milliamps.

00:10:16.142 --> 00:10:17.583
So let's do one last thing here,

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:19.996
let's figure out the
currents in the elements.

00:10:19.996 --> 00:10:22.032
Let's just figure out a couple of them,

00:10:22.032 --> 00:10:23.865
that one and that one.

00:10:24.723 --> 00:10:27.640
So that is ir2 and this one is ir4.

00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:34.542
ir2 equals i2 minus,

00:10:42.591 --> 00:10:43.424
oops,

00:10:46.876 --> 00:10:48.459
i1 minus i2 equals,

00:10:52.984 --> 00:10:55.317
i1 is 1.4 minus negative .4,

00:11:04.325 --> 00:11:07.742
and so that current equals 1.8 milliamps.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.207
And we'll do one last one,
we'll do ir4, this is r4 here.

00:11:27.044 --> 00:11:28.961
And ir4 is i2 minus i3.

00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:41.188
So that equals, i2 is minus .4, minus i3.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.627
i3 is minus two milliamps.

00:11:50.705 --> 00:11:51.788
So ir4 equals

00:11:58.216 --> 00:12:00.799
two minus .4, or 1.6 milliamps.

00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:08.828
And there you have it,

00:12:08.828 --> 00:12:11.796
we used the mesh current
method to solve our circuit.
