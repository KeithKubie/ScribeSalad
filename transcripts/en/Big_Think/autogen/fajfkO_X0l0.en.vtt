discussing consciousness scientifically
 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.019
discussing consciousness scientifically
is that consciousness is irreducibly

about consciousness I agree with them on
 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.900
about consciousness I agree with them on
this point that consciousness is what

at this moment you bring someone to the

can scan their brains with fMRI and see

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899
can scan their brains with fMRI and see
 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.810
can scan their brains with fMRI and see
that there are big d'leh response is

that there are big d'leh response is
 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.120
that there are big d'leh response is
heightened you can you can measure the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
heightened you can you can measure the
 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.710
heightened you can you can measure the
sweat on their palms and see that see

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
sweat on their palms and see that see
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.450

that there's a increased galvanic skin

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460

that there's a increased galvanic skin
response you can you can check their

so these these now are considered
