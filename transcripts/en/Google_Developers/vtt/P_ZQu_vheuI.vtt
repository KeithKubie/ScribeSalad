00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.320
&gt;&gt; COLE: I’m Chris Cole. I'm with the MySpace
developer platform. I’m a software architect

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.330
that works on the OpenSocial project and the
underlying technologies on that.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.620
&gt;&gt; MALE: Could you give me a little bit more
information?

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.700
&gt;&gt; COLE: So OpenSocial is an open standard
for writing apps and accessing social data

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:32.140
from the various social networks. And we have
implemented a platform for third parties to

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.610
come in and build apps, and leverage the information
in MySpace to create new compelling content

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:48.570
that we haven’t created on our own.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Could you tell me a little bit more

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.739
about that little session that you made to
[INDISTINCT]?

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.550
&gt;&gt; COLE: Well, for us it was really a question
of, the competitors had some great platforms,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.200
and we saw a lot of the great apps that were
being written and how much excitement there

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.750
was about it. But we knew that we couldn’t
come up with our proprietary solution and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.689
get the kind of traction we needed. So in
various conversations, we decided that the

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:24.110
way to go was to come on board with the OpenSocial
platform and start leveraging what is going

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.459
to be done with the help of Google and hi5
and some of the other participants in OpenSocial.

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:36.359
And I think that’s really been a great decision
for us, because we’ve gotten so much buy-in

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:42.539
from the community, and people are excited
about the idea of being able to build compelling

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.159
content and then distribute it across multiple
networks.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.740
&gt;&gt; MALE: So have you encountered any difficulty
to come up with OpenSocial? Or had there been

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.289
any war stories about OpenSocial?
&gt;&gt; COLE: It’s always a challenge. I think

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:05.619
the first challenge in MySpace that we always
encounter is how to scale things, and OpenSocial

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.220
was certainly no exception to that. So as
soon as we turned on within a couple of days,

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.269
we had servers tipping over and running the
firefights to try and keep the proxy servers

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.760
up. And it’s always a question of what’s
going to be the feature that’s actually

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.349
used--and you never know that out of the gate.
You only know that after people start using

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.890
your platform.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Do you have any tips and tricks that

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.540
you’d like to share with us and offers what
you do to use the OpenSocial...?

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:40.750
&gt;&gt; COLE: I would say make use of the apps
that are out there to understand what they’re

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.989
doing. And you know, just like back when we
all were learning HTML, you’ve used source

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:54.980
on them. You see how they function under the
hood. I would say if you are writing big apps,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.659
your cache layer needs to be extremely important.
You need to local cache things, be that in

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:08.329
update or cookies and push information out
to the nodes so that there’s not the network

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.569
latency that’s, that happens when your pinging
back and forth between your app and the client

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.560
experience and the server.
&gt;&gt; MALE: So, what’s your favorite open social

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.620
not quite nice...?
&gt;&gt; COLE: I’d say my favorite has to be OSML

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.380
and a lot of that is because I’m writing
it. It’s a fantastic tag language and it

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.440
really speeds development up, some of the
demos I prepared, like taken app that’s

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.700
3,000 lines of code and turn it into 250 lines
of code, so it’s pretty incredible, some

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.590
of the cost savings in terms of development
and complexity you can have when you start

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.379
moving to OSML.
&gt;&gt; MALE: So, what’s the favorite app that’s

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.260
on the site?
&gt;&gt; COLE: Well, I have to admit, I probably

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:01.220
play Dragon Wars more than anything else but
I bounce around, you know, I’ve worked on

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.049
a Tic Tac Toe app for a book that we have
coming out. And, I don’t know, there’s

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.340
all kinds of them but those are probably the
top two for me.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.290
&gt;&gt; MALE: Can you say that app [INDISTINCT]
or writing application for platform as, you

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.220
know, help the MySpace?
&gt;&gt; COLE: I think providing their application

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.690
platforms helped us tremendously. It’s really
driven some deep user engagement and now we

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.440
have yet another great feature for people
to come on the site and spend, you know, half

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.940
hour and hour, two hours engage with our content
and working with their friends, and that's

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.260
something that you don’t get when you’re
just to social network and people are simply

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.790
doing messaging and checking to update their
status.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:58.447
&gt;&gt; MALE: So, I guess that’s kind of rebated
to the social but what are your thoughts on

00:04:58.447 --> 00:04:59.447
the open web, like that there was a new feature
that that came out today, what was your line

00:04:59.447 --> 00:05:00.447
to be?
&gt;&gt; COLE: I’d say, the big features that

00:05:00.447 --> 00:05:07.970
we end up needing our security related it’s
kind of interesting to open the web and the

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:15.720
whole open-source movement in general is about
bringing things open and allowing more, but

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:23.880
the problem that we encounter is how to rein
in problems and keep the spam and keep the

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.950
attacks under control. So there’s a big
need for a little bit more sandboxing and

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:37.840
maybe some metadata controls, and to couple
that with say you cross site XHR request are

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:44.250
just a huge need in development, but it has
to be done in a way the balances security

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.880
and tighter sandboxing in the JavaScript models
so that we can disallow a lot of things, it’s

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.840
really important to us.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Is there anything that you need from

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.190
AJAX or OSML?
&gt;&gt; COLE: I think the cross domain stuff is

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:03.990
going to be really important. One of the early
failure points in our platform was the proxy

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.530
servers, they just were hit so hard, they
were tipping over, and you know, the farm

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:16.210
of 20 or 30 servers and you start dropping
10 percent of them and then it’s like dominos.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.139
So having, having cross domain AJAX, it would
alleviate a lot of that.

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.400
&gt;&gt; MALE: Is there anything else you like to
add?

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.120
&gt;&gt; COLE: No, just go out, have fun, build
lots of apps and drive some great content

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.964
for our site.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Great. Thank you for joining us at

00:06:32.964 --> 00:06:32.980
the Google App.
&gt;&gt; COLE: Thank you.
