00:00:20.513 --> 00:00:23.763
(airy, pleasant music)

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.070
- Welcome to A Conversation with History.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.610
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.230
of International Studies.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.340
Our guest is Paul Goldberger,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.880
who is a contributing
editor of Vanity Fair.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.980
From 1997 to 2011,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.580
he served as the architecture
critic for The New Yorker,

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.960
where he wrote the magazine's
celebrated Sky Line column.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.890
He also holds the Joseph Urban Chair

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.720
in Design and Architecture

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.320
at the New School in New York City.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.630
He was formerly dean of the
Parsons School of Design,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.250
a division of The New School.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.320
He began his career at the New York Times,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.180
where he was architecture editor,

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.770
and he won the Pulitzer Prize
for distinguished criticism.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.720
He's the author of several books,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.800
most recently, Why Architecture Matters,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.500
and Building up and Tearing Down:

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.660
Reflections on the Age of Architecture.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.660
He is the 2015 Hitchcock
Lecturer at Berkeley.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.013
Paul, welcome to our program.

00:01:48.013 --> 00:01:49.660
- Thank you, nice to be here.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.724
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:54.683
- In New Jersey, actually.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.250
In suburban New Jersey, which
is sort of a little odd,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.640
when you think that I'm
such a devoted urban person,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.723
such a city person.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.540
I grew up in Passaic, New Jersey,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.080
and grew up in a nearby town
called Nutley, New Jersey,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.860
which is these days, I think, best known

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.700
as the hometown also of Martha Stewart.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.920
- Ah-ha! (laughs)

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.280
- Who I did not know growing up.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.510
We went to the same high school,

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.810
but I think I was in the third grade

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.037
when she was in high school, so.

00:02:24.037 --> 00:02:27.040
- I see, and looking back,
how do you think your parents

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.620
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.060
- My father was trained as a teacher,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.493
and then became an editor and publisher,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.120
and my mother was a teacher
and speech therapist,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.930
so I grew up in a family that,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.730
I guess you could say
was certainly literate

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.363
and cared about the written word.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.895
I've never figured out where
my architecture side came from

00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:55.950
(laughs) because they were
not people with any background

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.350
or unusual degree of
interest in that world,

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.190
but they were very much
people who were interested

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.930
in writing and literature and journalism,

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:04.763
and things like that.

00:03:04.763 --> 00:03:06.950
So the side of me that
went in that direction

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.603
very much came from them, and certainly,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.740
clear communication was
something I got from my father,

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.740
very much, who was a
relentlessly sharp, smart editor.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.310
In fact, I remember, (laughs)

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.690
when he died a few years ago,

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.267
giving a eulogy in which I said,

00:03:30.267 --> 00:03:33.337
"It's a shame that he's not here to edit

00:03:33.337 --> 00:03:34.347
"all of the comments today

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:37.507
"because I'm sure all of
us would end up 30% shorter

00:03:37.507 --> 00:03:39.403
"if he were editing all this stuff."

00:03:39.403 --> 00:03:40.236
(laughing)

00:03:40.236 --> 00:03:42.400
He was great at sort of
taking out unnecessary things

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.580
and teaching me that often,

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.558
you communicate most
clearly in the simplest way.

00:03:49.558 --> 00:03:54.270
- [Harry] And writing
architecture criticism

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.544
is very complicated
- Yes, it is.

00:03:57.544 --> 00:03:58.660
- [Harry] 'Cause you want to be clear,

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.745
- Right.

00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:01.532
- But at the same time, I noticed

00:04:01.532 --> 00:04:04.230
in some of your pieces that I've read,

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.590
that you really have to get

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.490
into the complexity of the structure,

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.441
- Right, right.

00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:12.660
- [Harry] And describe it
so people can visualize it,

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.690
if you don't--

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.443
- Absolutely, absolutely, yes.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.540
- You write in one of your
books about the importance

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.913
of memory, and both of these
towns that you mention,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
you believe really shaped
your maturation, in a way,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.993
- [Paul] Sure.

00:04:29.993 --> 00:04:33.280
- As you saw the, sort
of the contradictions

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.830
between city and village, and
talk a little bit about that.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.340
- Sure, I was very lucky in so many ways

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.810
'cause the town I grew up in,

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.870
this little town called
Nutley, New Jersey,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.140
was not that far from New York City,

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.537
so I was exposed to the city,

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:50.920
and that whole world was 10 miles away,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.550
but it was not just a bedroom suburb.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.690
Some people did commute.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.330
My father was a commuter into New York,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.720
but there were other people
who worked in factories

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.430
and stores and were very local,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.440
and for all it mattered to them,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.470
New York coulda been
a thousand miles away,

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.920
not 10 miles away.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.620
So I had some of the experience

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.030
of a kind of self-contained small town

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.520
and some of the experience
of a metropolitan area,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.330
and I thought I grew up in both,

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.870
and it was a very mixed, interestingly,

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.327
heterogeneous kind of town.

00:05:24.327 --> 00:05:26.170
There were kids who graduated
from the public high school

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.720
who went to Harvard, and
kids who went to the Army.

00:05:30.908 --> 00:05:32.700
So there were all kinds of people there,

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.130
which was really great experience.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.820
It also, maybe most importantly,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.070
taught me a lot about
physical fabric of a place.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.440
What made it really
unusual is the fact that,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.840
at the main intersection

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.700
of the two main streets in this town,

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.340
was the high school football stadium,

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.130
and across the street from
it was the high school.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.260
The other side was the junior high school.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.190
The other side was the library,

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.990
the bank, the town hall, the fire station.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.900
All these things were kind of arranged

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.990
in this little civic center,

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.150
and it looked almost like what you would,

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.120
the little plastic
buildings you might put up

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.550
if you had a train set or
something, thinking of it.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.540
- Or something from a movie.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.340
- Or something from a movie, exactly.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.650
And so it taught me a lot
about symbols and towns

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.840
and the fact that you could walk

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.180
to and from all these places.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.330
I walked to school my entire career,

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.580
even through high school.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.340
And then there was also a main
street with all the shopping,

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.890
and it really kind of worked.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.050
And I think it still sort of works.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.930
It's not changed all that
much in all these years.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.930
- So this gave you that
sense of the civic center,

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.993
even though you're writing
a lot about big cities.

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:50.970
- [Paul] Yes, definitely.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.120
- But the life of the streets,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.150
even though this is a small-town version.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.920
- Well, that's absolutely
right, and in fact,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.250
whether it gave me a
taste for bigger cities

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.420
or made me realize the
importance also of neighborhood

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.721
and breaking things down in scale.

00:07:07.721 --> 00:07:08.554
- And community, yeah.

00:07:08.554 --> 00:07:09.780
- And community, absolutely.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.960
I mean, we knew all our neighbors.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.640
I remember, you know, I can still picture

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.650
the people who lived in the
house on each side of us,

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.010
and across the street, and so
forth, and the walk to school.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:28.010
- You also describe in your
book on Why Architecture Matters

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.763
your living situation.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.870
When you grew up, your
grandparents were upstairs.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.980
- In the very first house
I was growing up in,

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.710
in Passaic, New Jersey, yes,
we lived in a two-family house.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.710
They'd call in Chicago, I
guess, a duplex or something.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.270
And my grandparents owned the house.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.420
They lived on the upper story.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.900
We lived on the lower story.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.500
And not only was there that closeness

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.720
of family and community, but
I remember as a little kid

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.500
being very struck by the fact that

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.160
the rooms looked the same
because the configuration

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.980
was identical above and below,

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.800
but they also looked and
felt completely different.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.210
'Cause my parents had
very modern furniture,

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.260
and things were painted light colors,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.150
and my grandparents
had this sort of heavy,

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.920
old European furniture,
and the walls were dark,

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.880
and there were heavy, damask draperies,

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.100
and all that stuff.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.950
And I don't know quite
why and how I saw it

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.077
because there obviously
was some instinct in me

00:08:29.077 --> 00:08:32.750
that made me receptive to
this kind of observation,

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.470
but I saw that these places were the same,

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.303
and yet, different.

00:08:36.303 --> 00:08:38.290
And I began to think about what it meant.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.050
I don't know how conscious I
was of it at the time, either,

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:47.060
but as I thought back, it
became a very important memory.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.160
Just as when we moved to our own house,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.910
in this nearby town called
Nutley, it was sort of a bigger,

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.460
single-family sort of
a vaguely Queen Anne,

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.933
Victorian sort of house.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.000
And it did have a certain
kind of, you know, presence,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.430
that the other house hadn't.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.750
And I began to feel that.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.230
The other thing I really took
from that town I grew up in

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:16.230
was a sense that public space
was a big part of the place,

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.870
that you didn't feel, if
you lived in a private,

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.180
single-family house, that
you were in an enclave,

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.460
separated from the world, the
way people often do today,

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.607
behind gates, behind hedges, behind.

00:09:29.607 --> 00:09:32.200
You know, every house was open.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.770
Nobody had a front yard that
wasn't sort of open and visible

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.180
as you walked down the street.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.270
Two blocks away was a park,
which led to another park,

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.880
which led eventually
to the center of town,

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.010
with all the stuff I was describing.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.810
And so the public realm, you could say,

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:55.640
played a huge role in the way
that little town was shaped,

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.810
which is very different from most suburbs,

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.870
which are really much
more about private space.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.550
- Where were you educated, then, at?

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.660
- Well, I went to the public high school

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.170
in Nutley, New Jersey,
and then went to Yale.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.070
So I went to New Haven, Connecticut,

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.260
which was the farthest away

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.640
I'd ever lived at that
time, actually. (laughs)

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.750
- And at Yale, both in
your studies, I gather,

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.300
and in the setting,

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.133
- [Paul] Right.

00:10:24.133 --> 00:10:27.180
- You move further along in this direction

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.110
of doing architecture.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.943
- [Paul] Absolutely, yes, yeah.

00:10:28.943 --> 00:10:30.674
- Talk a little about that.
- [Paul] Sure, sure.

00:10:30.674 --> 00:10:31.720
- So first the setting.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.370
- I had begun through high school

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.510
to become quite interested
in architecture.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.950
And I wasn't sure I wanted
to become an architect,

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.100
but I knew it was gonna play
a role in my life somehow

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.270
'cause I just cared about
it and responded to it,

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.010
and I had seen in magazines
these very interesting

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.610
new, modern buildings at Yale,

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.610
which they'd built in the '50s and '60s,

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:55.030
quite a lot of unusually
important buildings.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.793
Those first got me interested
in going there, actually.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.860
And when I was lucky
enough to be, in fact,

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.453
to get in and be able to go,

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.890
I arrived and had a
very strange experience,

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.610
which is that I saw these buildings

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.660
that I'd been reading about
and seeing in magazines,

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.280
and I actually liked them
and found some of them

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.710
quite exciting, but then there
was all this other stuff,

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:24.230
this old-fashioned, sort of
pseudo-Gothic architecture,

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:29.160
much of it from the 1920s,
and I really liked that too.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.130
And of course, if you were
serious about architecture,

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.250
you weren't supposed to like that stuff,

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.210
because it was fake.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.450
Let's put that in quotes,
it was "fake," quote.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:40.860
And the really serious, authentic stuff

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.390
were the modern buildings.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.720
So how come these buildings
were so pleasurable?

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.210
How come they felt so good?

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.380
How come I liked them so much?

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.240
And so a lot of my time
there was sort of a quest

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.483
to try to reconcile these two things.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.580
Maybe it's a quest I'm
still working on (laughs)

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.540
because I still like both traditional

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.640
and modern architecture,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.760
and I've never felt
comfortable putting myself

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.910
totally on one side or
the other of that line.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.910
- This must've sensitized you
to this historical dimension,

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.870
which is very important in your writing,

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.150
that part of the context of a building

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.060
is the history of the building

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.820
and then the history of the surroundings.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.570
- Absolutely, you know, a building,

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.660
a building is almost
never an isolated object.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.990
It's not a piece of sculpture.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.810
It's not like this water
bottle, where you know,

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.253
only the shape matters.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.630
Sculptural shape is part
of what architecture is,

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.070
but it's only a part,

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.620
and every building is
shaped also by its context.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.490
It has to respond to its context.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:53.320
We, in turn, understand it
through the context in part,

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.240
and at Yale, again,

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.190
I learned all kinds of lessons about that.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.050
I mean, I saw how some buildings

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.140
responded very much to their context.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.800
Others did not and really were

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.450
more assertively purely sculptural,

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:10.920
and also how those old buildings
kind of formed a context.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.940
They made an urban fabric.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.190
They made a larger place

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.120
than any individual building can make.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.090
You know, the fundamental
architectural idea of a city

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:27.150
is that the whole is more
than the sum of the parts,

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.240
and I think I began,
through all these places,

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.000
to sort of figure that
out viscerally for myself,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.940
that the whole is more
than the sum of the parts.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:39.300
- In retrospect, do you
think a place like Yale

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.460
would be different than
a place like Berkeley

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.550
because of the private
funding, the private endowment

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.610
that makes it what it is?

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.920
Private money making possible a setting.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.140
- Right, right, right, right.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.550
That's an interesting question.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.050
I mean, Yale is certainly
different from Berkeley,

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.040
whether private money is the factor,

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.673
or whether it's East versus West,

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.333
public institution, in terms
of management, not just money,

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.170
and private institution which
also has more freedom, to.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:16.380
- To layer upon layer.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.710
- Right, right, there are
many, many differences.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.290
All that said, you know, I mean,

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:24.820
they're both truly great
universities with enormous reach

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.990
and scope to them, and
depth and complexity,

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.530
as institutions, and none of them are ones

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.690
that you can easily characterize.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.333
Probably the most important
difference, though, is scale.

00:14:39.534 --> 00:14:41.370
Yale, while it's big,

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.780
compared to a small, liberal arts college,

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.320
is small compared to
a place like Berkeley.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.320
And so that, I think, scale was
one of the things that help.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:56.150
Just as, in fact, growing
up in a not-so-big city,

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.723
in a sort of small-town type city,

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.590
helped me understand certain things

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:05.500
that might've been harder to
see in a huge place initially,

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.000
and then I could apply what
I learned in a huge place.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.490
Similarly, Yale was big
enough to have all this stuff

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.510
that taught me all these lessons.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:19.310
And yet, not so gargantuan
that, as a freshman coming in,

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.450
you're kind of overwhelmed by it.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.760
- At Yale, who were your
intellectual mentors?

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.800
- My most important intellectual
mentor was Vincent Scully,

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.350
the great architectural history professor,

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.790
who is actually still alive.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.120
He's 94, living in
retirement in Virginia now,

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.873
but still around.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.913
He was an especially meaningful
mentor to me, I think,

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.850
but there were others as well.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.300
I had a wonderful city planning professor

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.040
named Alex Garvin, who
is also still around,

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.060
who is a planner in New York

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.700
who had gone to Yale and
taught part-time there,

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.330
and has done so, well,
for more than 40 years

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.020
because I was his student 40 years ago,

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:13.040
and he continues to do
that, in fact, yeah.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.820
- So under these, and probably others,

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:20.820
how did your thinking
about architecture mature

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.200
as a kind of of a stepping stone

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.160
to becoming an architectural critic?

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.503
I mean, did you,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.790
from one of your lectures that I read,

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:36.430
you really learned that you
could have both passion and,

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.583
but also be critical at the same time.

00:16:38.583 --> 00:16:39.950
- I think that was one thing

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.543
I very much attributed to Vincent Scully,

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.430
who was a particularly passionate

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.900
and emotive and emotional scholar.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.603
And learning that, in fact,

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:58.770
feeling and intellectual perception

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.590
are not mutually exclusive.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:02.593
And that, in fact,

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:08.900
one must try to integrate
those two things,

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.880
rather than deny one side or the other.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.670
And that, in fact, we can have, I think,

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.030
his term at one point was,

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.970
we can have both empathetic

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.520
and associative
relationships with buildings.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.970
Associative meaning through ideas

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.110
and other kinds of
intellectual connections,

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:27.640
empathetic through feelings.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.330
And that was absolutely true.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.853
The other thing I took from
my education in those days,

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.840
that I, was important
because it is something

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.543
that every young person
has to learn, I think.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:49.140
Is that there are no ideologies

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.973
that really answer all
questions, that in fact,

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.980
none of them are really right.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.790
And when you're young, you
tend to sort of fall prey often

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:02.790
to belief systems and
total thought systems

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.663
that provide answers.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.900
I learned, as a student, to
be suspicious of all of them.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.550
Which is not to say that
they're all nonsense,

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.960
but it's to say that,
at the end of the day,

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.030
you will do far better if you don't

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:24.210
count on one to give
you everything you know,

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.470
but take the best from various things,

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.193
and try to synthesize.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:34.260
That Jane Jacobs, to cite an
important influence for me,

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.710
and so many other people in those days,

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.520
is mostly right, but not 100% right

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.370
and doesn't explain everything.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:46.260
That her opponents may have been wrong

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.990
about many, many things,
and wrong about her,

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.500
but not wrong about everything else.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:55.500
And that sometimes, to stay
on Jane Jacobs for a moment,

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:01.913
you know, she was famous as
an opponent of Robert Moses,

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.570
and most of the time correct
in her opposition of Moses.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:10.540
That didn't mean that every, single thing

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.023
Moses ever did was wrong.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:17.930
Similarly, Lewis Mumford, the
great architectural critic,

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.833
who was another important
influence for me,

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:29.350
was also a very eloquent and
longstanding opponent of Moses,

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:31.970
but he and Jacobs didn't
agree at all, and in fact,

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.820
they disagreed about what
was wrong with Robert Moses,

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.530
even though they were his two most famous

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.093
and articulate opponents.

00:19:39.069 --> 00:19:41.330
And so you realize it's not a simple

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.749
black-and-white situation.

00:19:42.749 --> 00:19:45.251
You know, it's, everybody's
a various shade of gray.

00:19:45.251 --> 00:19:46.800
(laughs) And you try to
navigate through them

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.970
and learn what you can from both of them,

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.510
and then figure out what
you believe in yourself.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.750
- In your book, and I'm
reminded of it right now,

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:59.750
you talk about buildings as
being, serving a function,

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:03.865
but also having the potential to be art,

00:20:03.865 --> 00:20:08.750
and so in a way, this recognition

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.560
of the importance of function grounds you

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:15.600
in a kind of practicality that
makes what you just said--

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.010
- Yes, but it's never only that.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.170
- [Harry] No, right, right, I was just.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.660
- Right, but that's exactly the point.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:25.250
For me, it's never a matter
of either/or, it's both/and.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:29.690
That, in fact, architecture is not art

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.430
or function and practicality.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.700
That whole argument, that whole dialectic

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.350
is fundamentally wrong because in fact,

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.920
the most important thing
to know about architecture

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.400
is that it's both of those
things connected, and it's,

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.400
that any successful work
of architecture has both

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.320
a functional and an aesthetic component,

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.870
and we have to sort of
understand and respect both

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:56.703
and judge both.

00:20:56.703 --> 00:20:59.680
I mean, it may succeed on one
level and fail on another.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.790
It might fail on both levels.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.560
It might succeed on both levels. (laughs)

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.530
But it has some degree, it's both.

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.480
- I like to ask my guests
what are the skills

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.810
and temperament required for
the career that they've chosen,

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:15.950
as advice for students,

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:19.160
and one of the senses I'm getting from you

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:24.160
is that doing architecture
criticism involves complexity.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.100
- Yes, I think it does.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:31.100
It involves complexity and a
willingness to see the world

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.860
in this way that I've
described, as both/and,

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.413
rather than either/or.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.160
Definitely it does that.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.280
I think it involves a
desire to communicate

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.203
and an ability to communicate clearly,

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.090
but if we can take a step back from that,

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:51.770
it's about sharing your
passions in certain ways,

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:55.260
and I mean, I love architecture.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:59.423
I love sharing with other
people what it means to me,

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.830
and I love fighting for
better architecture,

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:09.163
which is what criticism is,
at least partly, trying to do.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.980
- So it's about ideas,

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:12.813
- [Paul] Yes, mm-hm.

00:22:12.813 --> 00:22:15.740
- Passion about ideas
and about structures,

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:20.740
but also a mission of being an educator.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:22.203
- I think it is.

00:22:22.203 --> 00:22:24.930
It's interesting you say that
'cause I've always felt that,

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:30.240
and I see the two different
parts of my career,

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.770
'cause I also spend part
of my life as an academic,

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.233
and part of my life as a journalist,

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:42.310
as reinforcing each other,
not as entirely separate.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:48.650
- And as a critic,

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.320
you're not primarily a theoretician.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.243
- [Paul] That's right.

00:22:53.243 --> 00:22:54.250
- Although you know the theory.

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.083
- [Paul] Yes.

00:22:55.083 --> 00:22:57.210
- And I think at some point you wrote that

00:22:58.353 --> 00:23:01.940
a theorist wouldn't
necessarily make a good critic,

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.610
although he could be.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.930
- I think that's
absolutely right, and yes,

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.810
I appreciate you noticing
that little sentence

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.920
buried down there somewhere
because it's absolutely right.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:15.030
I think, in fact, sometimes
a theorist is a poorer critic

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.790
because, if a theorist really
believes in his or her theory,

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.990
then they believe in a much narrower

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.230
realm of possibility, let's say,

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:28.550
and would be inclined to discount

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.880
what fell outside of their theory.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.530
Well, an awful lot of
the world is inevitably

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.520
gonna fall outside of any theory,

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.500
and does that mean you reject
all of it and ignore it

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.900
as a critic because it doesn't fit within,

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.720
or you criticize it only for
not conforming to your theory?

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.410
Well, at that point, criticism
becomes pretty meaningless

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.450
because all it is is an
evaluation of whether or not

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:57.360
a particular work falls
under this relatively narrow

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.160
umbrella or whatever.

00:24:01.594 --> 00:24:04.680
I don't think that's a viable
way to write criticism.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.870
- And what about temperament as a critic?

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:11.850
One thing that I'm hearing you
say is you have to maintain

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:16.850
your sensibility to the wow
moment, gee whiz, you know,

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:21.330
so there's a childlike quality there,

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.760
of seeing something for
the first time with awe.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.940
- I hope so, I mean, I hope.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:31.393
I think I've always been
a critic with enthusiasm.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:38.010
I don't want my enthusiasm
ever to cloud my judgment.

00:24:39.262 --> 00:24:40.500
(laughs) I mean, I don't.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.400
I hope I'm sophisticated enough
not to say, "Wow," to junk,

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.320
but nevertheless, I
think if you don't bring

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.600
some degree of enthusiasm
and love to the subject,

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.573
you can't be a good critic.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.360
Doesn't mean again that you love

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.990
individual things you're writing about.

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:02.470
I should hope you're critical enough

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.650
not to love most of them,
but that you love the field

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:08.090
in general and the ideas behind it

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:12.720
and the greatest experiences
that you might get from it,

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.610
and that you have curiosity.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:19.610
You know, I think to
continue to be curious

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:24.760
is the most important way
not to become old and stale,

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.880
really, actually. (laughs)

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.100
And as you get older,
that's harder in some ways,

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.323
because there's always a sense that,

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.130
you don't realize it 'til you get older,

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.200
but you are very stamped by,

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.810
something in your brain is very stamped

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:44.300
by everything that was going
on when your career began.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.630
I mean, I remember thinking
that, when I was a young critic

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.520
and observing how

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.450
much interest Ada Louise Huxtable,

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.630
the first architecture
critic at The New York Times,

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:02.020
and a woman who was an
extraordinary writer and journalist

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.883
and critic and the mentor to
so many of us, myself included,

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.040
Ada Louise still seemed
very much in thrall

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.250
to I.M. Pei, and Edward Larrabee Barnes,

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.670
and a lot of modern architects

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.730
who came of age in the 1950s, as she did.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:22.730
And you sort of often
continue to dance to the music

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.470
that was playing when you first arrived,

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:28.244
even as you do evolve and see new things

00:26:28.244 --> 00:26:30.680
and understand them.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.810
My point is only that
one has to make a greater

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.020
and greater effort to stay connected

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.840
and be curious, really too.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:45.840
- Help us understand how you do your work,

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.880
even as you're changing over time.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:53.780
So in other words, when you're
looking at a new building,

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:57.040
you obviously know the other buildings

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.152
that architect has done

00:26:58.152 --> 00:26:58.985
- [Paul] Sure, sure.

00:26:58.985 --> 00:27:00.930
- But you're trying to relate it

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.860
to the history of
architecture, in a way, yeah.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.010
- Right, right, right, right, right.

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:08.280
Well, I've just written,
just the other day,

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.740
I had occasion to write something about

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.960
the new Whitney Museum by Renzo Piano

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.190
that is opening next week in New York.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:21.190
It was an interesting case study in a way

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.850
because it required knowing

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:28.450
something about museums in general,

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:32.173
something about the specific
history of the Whitney Museum,

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.210
particularly its Marcel Breuer building

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:37.830
on the Upper East Side of New York,

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.343
which it was vacating to
go to this new building.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:47.220
It required knowing about
Renzo Piano's other work,

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.920
which was entirely relevant,

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.360
and it required knowing something about

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.340
the physical setting of this museum,

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.480
which is next to the High Line,

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.210
the new elevated park in the
Chelsea section of Manhattan,

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:00.520
near the Hudson River.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.526
It's a very important and changing context

00:28:03.526 --> 00:28:05.640
in a different part of the city.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.350
So I was in a lucky situation there

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.380
because all those things
were things I knew

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.630
and had been thinking
about for a long time,

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:16.670
but if I hadn't been,

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.430
I would've had to have gotten up to speed

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:21.870
on all of those things to
evaluate that building properly,

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:25.520
and to really get all the
issues that appropriately

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.680
should be raised in a discussion of it.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.988
I mean, it has to be
evaluated again in terms of,

00:28:31.988 --> 00:28:33.500
you know, how does it work
for the display of art?

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.340
How does it feel as you are
a visitor going through it?

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.680
How does it feel if you're just walking by

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.033
and not going into it?

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.510
What does it say on all these levels?

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:50.220
- And in addition, because
a building is being built

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.325
at a particular time,

00:28:52.325 --> 00:28:53.200
- [Paul] Right, mm-hmm.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.745
- With political constraints,
financial constraints,

00:28:56.745 --> 00:28:58.000
- [Paul] Yes.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
- A whole array of
problems that essentially

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:07.666
have to be integrated in your analysis,

00:29:07.666 --> 00:29:08.499
- Yes.

00:29:08.499 --> 00:29:09.420
- [Harry] Even if you
don't write about them.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.770
- Absolutely, you have
to know all that stuff

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:14.940
and understand it to evaluate
the building properly,

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.000
which does not mean that you have to

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.180
forgive certain things because of it.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.710
It just means you have to know.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:26.270
I mean, if a building
took a particular shape

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:30.270
for a political reason,
because it was forced,

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:33.590
the architect was forced
to by the city planners,

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.330
or by the zoning laws,

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.090
that's one thing that you need to know.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:39.330
That doesn't mean, as I
said, therefore it's okay,

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.500
but you need to know that it was not just

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.020
an arbitrary and whimsical decision.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.560
However, maybe something else

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.830
was an arbitrary and whimsical decision,

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:51.700
and you can't evaluate it
properly without knowing.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.590
On the other hand, it's
also important to remember,

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:58.170
that an explanation is
not an excuse. (laughs)

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:01.530
And so to be able to explain something

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:04.217
is not necessarily to
say, "Therefore it's okay

00:30:04.217 --> 00:30:07.709
"because I know why and
how it happened that way."

00:30:07.709 --> 00:30:12.709
- And so, as you write a review,

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.200
how long does it take you to do that?

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:20.013
I mean, do you, and also do
you go to the building twice,

00:30:20.013 --> 00:30:23.400
several times, to reinforce

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.080
whatever impressions
you're getting, and so on?

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.033
- Sure, I try to go to a
building multiple times.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:34.620
I try to spend, I almost
always will walk through it

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.170
with the architect or the client,

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:39.680
depending on who's available, or both,

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.050
to hear what they asked for,

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:44.250
what they thought they were getting.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:46.390
Again, it doesn't mean I
necessarily agree with it,

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.090
but I want to hear what they
believed they were doing.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.050
And not necessarily to, you know,

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:58.730
use their good efforts as an excuse

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:02.340
for accepting things that
I don't feel are adequate,

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.570
but nevertheless, it's important to know

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.430
what they thought they were
doing, what they wanted to do,

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:06.853
what they set out to do.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:11.500
If it's a building like a museum,

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:16.010
where I can put myself in
the experience of the user

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:17.160
because I go to museums,

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.903
I know what it's like to
look at art, and so forth,

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.610
that makes it a little bit easier.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.430
There are other kinds of buildings

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:28.680
where it's important to talk
to the people who use them

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.410
because they may see things
that I don't see necessarily.

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:34.360
- So a consumer of sports, yeah.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.460
- Right, right, exactly.

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.610
I actually am interested
in sports, and so,

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:44.810
but nevertheless, you know,
I've never, I sit in the stands,

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.850
I've never been on the field

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:49.780
playing baseball in a baseball park.

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.390
It's important to sort of know
how it works at all levels.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:54.223
A hospital.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.630
It's important to see it
from a patient's perspective,

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.270
most of all, but also from the perspective

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:03.163
of those people who
work with it every day.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.970
And sometimes those things take research.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:10.310
Now, it's also true that
all buildings evolve

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:13.733
and change over time, as
do our perceptions of them.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.200
I've often thought it
would actually be very good

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.620
if architecture critics could make a habit

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.550
of revisiting buildings, let's say,

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:24.260
five years after they were finished,

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.793
and reevaluate them, reevaluating them.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.510
I think we would sometimes find

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:32.107
that our original views were right,

00:32:32.107 --> 00:32:34.780
and we would sometimes find
that our original views

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.990
were off-base, that we missed something,

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:41.990
that five years of human
life have changed things

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:45.510
in a certain way, and maybe
made some things work better,

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:48.233
maybe shown that other
things were a mistake.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:52.460
So I wish we could do
more of that, actually.

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:57.030
We don't, not because there's
any policy against it.

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:59.510
It's just, journalism is hard these days.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:01.690
It's under greater pressure than ever.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:05.330
It's hard to do much
architecture criticism at all.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:09.720
And it's harder still to
take time to do things

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.230
that are not viewed as
essential, and of course,

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:15.460
the public is understandably,

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:18.840
wants to know about new
things because they're new,

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.260
and then it gets hard to go
back and look at older ones,

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.410
but we absolutely should.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:24.040
Ideally, we would be doing that.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.390
- An example of that, you
talk about in your book,

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:32.030
which is the modern
addition to The Louvre,

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.570
which you didn't like.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:36.450
What was it that changed your thinking,

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:38.280
going back to it again and again?

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.970
- Sure, I.M. Pei's glass pyramid, that is,

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:42.570
it's the entrance to The Louvre,

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.820
I thought was an
inappropriate intervention

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:52.360
of modern architecture into
this very traditional precinct,

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:57.010
and a degree of change that
was not appropriate for it.

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:58.410
And I was wrong.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.940
I am very happy to admit
that I was wrong on that one.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.060
It was built.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.380
The world did not collapse.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.703
The Louvre actually got somewhat better.

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:13.300
It, in fact, respected the
classical order of The Louvre

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.840
better than I had given
it credit for being.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:21.200
And I've also become much more
sympathetic in recent years

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.200
to really good modern additions
to historic buildings.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.200
I've just finished working on a book

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.340
with the architect Norman Foster,

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.570
who has made something of a specialty

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.430
of doing works of that type,

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:37.970
that is called Building with History,

00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:42.970
that is about very sort of
assertively modern buildings

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:47.480
that are juxtaposed next to,

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:51.580
or are often additions
to historic buildings

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:55.450
that respect the historic building,

00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:59.600
but not in the obvious way
of mimicking it in any way,

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.620
but by being modern, but by taking cues

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.550
and doing certain, subtle things

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.680
that show that great
attention was being paid,

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.950
and great respect was being
shown to the older building,

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:13.540
but just in a way different

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.570
from imitating its architectural style.

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:21.570
And certainly the I.M.
Pei pyramid at The Louvre

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:23.240
was a good example of that.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.050
He understood that original building

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:27.630
and respected it totally.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:31.200
He just didn't follow
its architectural style

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.580
in any literal way, and as time went on,

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:38.220
it became very clear that he was right,

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.460
and the critics who had doubted
whether it was a good idea,

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:43.470
like me, were wrong.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.680
In fact, I'm always very
willing to admit when I'm wrong.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.410
I hope it isn't too often that it happens,

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.800
but when it does, I think it's,

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.923
one is honor-bound to say so.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:36:00.860
- You make the point that, as a critic,

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:04.144
you have a set of values and principles,

00:36:04.144 --> 00:36:04.977
- [Paul] Mm-hm.

00:36:04.977 --> 00:36:07.960
- On the one hand, but you distinguish

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.272
how you have to approach the
architect and his intentions

00:36:12.272 --> 00:36:13.105
- [Paul] Right.

00:36:13.105 --> 00:36:15.357
- And at that point, you have to,

00:36:15.357 --> 00:36:20.357
"Well, what were his
problems, and how reasonable,

00:36:20.967 --> 00:36:24.680
"and how, yeah, how
reasonable is his solution

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.513
- Exactly.

00:36:25.513 --> 00:36:26.346
- "To those problems?"

00:36:26.346 --> 00:36:29.390
Which is essentially drawing on

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:32.160
all this complexity that
we've been talking about.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.400
Talk a little about that because

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:39.990
my guess is that you
are, in your own values,

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:41.970
politically and socially,

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:45.530
are on the liberal side of the equation,

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:50.530
but you're really willing
to respect the architect

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:54.960
for responding to the situation
he was presented with,

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.800
and the problems.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.020
- An architect has no
choice but to respond

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.350
to a situation he's presented with.

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:03.820
If the situation he's
presented with is unacceptable,

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:06.040
then the architect should resign.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.340
I mean, if it cannot yield a building

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:12.310
that he or she feels
they can stand behind,

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:15.390
rather than producing a bad building,

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:16.990
the architect should step aside.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.260
But, and I think it's important
to understand intentions

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.220
when we're in the realm
of much more normal,

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:26.700
conventional buildings, not buildings

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.530
that raise some ethical
issue, but just regular,

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:33.720
everyday buildings, but to understand

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.963
is not necessarily to accept.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:40.580
I think if I've made
any mistake as a critic

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:43.440
or had any weakness as
a critic over the years,

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.520
it's that I've sometimes given

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.963
too much credit to good
intentions, actually.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:51.820
Because most architects
have good intentions.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.817
Very few architects
approach a problem and say,

00:37:54.817 --> 00:37:57.577
"Okay, how can design a
really horrible building

00:37:57.577 --> 00:38:01.467
"that is going to offend the
client, offend the public,

00:38:01.467 --> 00:38:03.080
"and fail to function?"

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.790
You know, not terribly often
do they start out that way.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.100
So the intentions are usually good.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:13.100
And it's the critic's job
to understand the intentions

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.940
but also to go beyond them.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:19.100
Because if the critic is limited

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.160
by the architect's intentions,

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.990
then he or she is not
bringing anything really smart

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:28.503
and meaningful into the discourse.

00:38:30.511 --> 00:38:35.477
- You say, at one point,
"Architecture can never be

00:38:35.477 --> 00:38:39.020
"wholly divorced from politics."

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.560
We've been talking a little about that,

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:45.560
but this is really especially
true when the building

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.124
is of symbolic importance,

00:38:48.124 --> 00:38:48.957
- [Paul] Sure.

00:38:48.957 --> 00:38:52.390
- Where politics is
raised to a higher level.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.840
We're thinking here of
the Vietnam Memorial,

00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.840
the 9/11 Memorial, recent debate

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.483
about an Eisenhower Memorial.

00:39:02.483 --> 00:39:03.316
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:39:03.316 --> 00:39:08.316
- Talk a little about that
because what in the end,

00:39:08.951 --> 00:39:12.767
is the end result always,

00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:15.017
"Well, did people wind up liking it,

00:39:15.017 --> 00:39:18.557
"even in the process that
there was much opposition

00:39:18.557 --> 00:39:20.090
"of putting the design on the table?"

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:21.140
- Right, right, right, right.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:25.180
Well, you raise three really important

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.220
and compelling examples.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.630
They're a little bit different.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:33.630
The Vietnam Memorial is
an extraordinary work,

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:38.623
and I think one of the great
works of the late 20th Century.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:44.370
It was attacked at the beginning

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:50.320
by some people who felt that
it was excessively abstract

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:54.780
and would not be able
to adequately represent

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:58.930
the feelings and the
anguish of the families

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:00.713
who had lost people in the war.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.890
We have seen, in fact,
that the opposite was true.

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:08.850
That it, in fact, spoke
powerfully to people,

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:13.530
and that the representational
statue of soldiers

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:17.680
that was placed on the grounds
as part of the memorial,

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.510
as a way of placating the opposition,

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:23.950
that's what actually seems
now to be superfluous

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:28.730
and mawkish and not very
communicative at all.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:32.480
Thankfully, under pressure
from Maya Lin, the designer,

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:37.450
who was not able to prevent
its inclusion totally,

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.740
nevertheless it was pushed
somewhat to the side

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.790
so it doesn't directly interfere with the

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.750
experience of being at the wall itself

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:47.850
that is the central part of that memorial.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:55.340
The 9/11 Memorial, I think
is also quite successful

00:40:55.730 --> 00:41:00.480
actually, and both of them
together are reminders

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:05.480
that it is possible to
create a somewhat abstract

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:10.840
simple form that is not
directly representational,

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.850
that in fact does communicate
to a lot of people,

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:17.670
and that speaks to everyone in a profound

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:19.170
and moving and beautiful way,

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:21.303
and is appropriate to its particular site.

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:23.945
Each of these are.

00:41:23.945 --> 00:41:25.340
You know, the Vietnam Memorial,

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.990
it's not just that V-shaped wall.

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:32.990
It's the subtlety of how the wall points

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:37.990
to the Lincoln Memorial with
one point, one direction,

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:40.240
and toward the Washington Monument

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.090
and the Capitol in the other.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:46.120
And how it subtly goes down,

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.350
and you sort of move away from the Earth,

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:53.110
and then you return and have
this sense of resurrection

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.093
almost, as you come back up to that,

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.513
is extraordinarily powerful.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.650
Similarly, at the 9/11 Memorial,

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:07.650
because those squares are
the footprints of the towers,

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:11.860
the power of the place, the
power of that specific design,

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.423
and that specific place,

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:18.260
joins with the power of the abstract form

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.920
to be very, very important.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.253
Eisenhower, now, is
another story altogether.

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:24.883
That's a design by Frank Gehry,

00:42:26.598 --> 00:42:29.310
a great architect in
my view, not one noted

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:33.793
for memorials or public
buildings in Washington.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.173
It's been very controversial,

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:42.090
partly because the family of Eisenhower,

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:45.090
many members of the family of
Eisenhower are not fond of it.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:48.410
They have found common cause

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:53.410
with a group of very conservative
architects and activists

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:57.170
who are fighting the memorial
because it is not classical,

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:58.300
it's not traditional,

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.223
it doesn't look like the Lincoln
Memorial, or what have you.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:03.960
I think they're wrong.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.170
I think the memorial is a strong design,

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:07.473
and I hope it gets built.

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:13.750
And it's very, very honest
in its tribute to Eisenhower.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.540
I mean, they're saying
crazy things about Gehry

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.890
trying to destroy Eisenhower's reputation

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:23.610
and suggesting that all is chaos

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:27.520
because the stones don't
line up right, and so it.

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.715
I mean, that's just
philistine, basically I think.

00:43:30.715 --> 00:43:31.590
- And politics.

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:33.390
- And politics, exactly, yeah.

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:36.683
Cultural politics as much
as political politics.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.600
Politically, Frank Gehry
has said to me that he,

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.620
in fact, one of the reasons
he's wanted to do this

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:47.210
is because the more he
learns about Eisenhower,

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:49.440
the more he admires him,

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.860
the more impressed he is at
what Eisenhower stood for.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.980
And frankly, this country
could benefit I think

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:59.260
a little bit from a
little more Eisenhower,

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.480
which I never thought I would be saying,

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.873
but you know, Eisenhower actually said,

00:44:06.027 --> 00:44:10.867
"We have to recognize
that every war plane,

00:44:10.867 --> 00:44:13.057
"every bomber we build,

00:44:13.057 --> 00:44:16.087
"is that many more children going hungry,

00:44:16.087 --> 00:44:18.247
"that many more people
going without clothing,

00:44:18.247 --> 00:44:20.477
"that many more people not being educated,

00:44:20.477 --> 00:44:22.827
"that many more people not being housed."

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:24.850
Can you imagine,

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:26.910
a Democrat wouldn't dare say that today,

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:28.530
let alone a Republican,

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:30.550
and the fact that a Republican President

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:34.143
of the United States said that
in a speech to the nation,

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:35.890
amazing to think.

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:39.320
So in fact, it's a very good
moment to honor Eisenhower,

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:44.240
and I think the political
argument against the memorial

00:44:46.281 --> 00:44:50.490
is cultural politics, it's
about Frank Gehry's aesthetic,

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:54.550
and about how some people believe that

00:44:56.210 --> 00:45:01.210
you can only use a classical
architectural language

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:06.770
to memorialize somebody and
honor the dead, and so forth.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:09.470
And I don't believe that's
true, and I think, in fact,

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:13.910
the Vietnam Memorial and the 9/11 Memorial

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:15.653
both show us otherwise.

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.860
- In your writings on architecture,

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:24.820
the notion of history and
of time are very important,

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:27.107
and I don't just mean the
history of architecture.

00:45:27.107 --> 00:45:27.940
- [Paul] Right, right.

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:31.610
- I mean what time does to a building,

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:35.400
what time does to our
appreciation of a building.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.760
Talk a little about that

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.580
because how do we get a handle on that?

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:43.383
Do we just wait and see what time brings?

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.510
- I think maybe we do just wait

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:47.730
and see what time brings. (laughs)

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:50.090
Except knowing that
everything always changes,

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:55.090
that the relationship
is always a dynamic one,

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:57.140
it's not a static one.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.870
And multiple things are changing

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:04.720
because all of us individuals
are changing and growing,

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:08.363
and our perceptions
evolve somewhat over time.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.420
Culture at large is changing and growing.

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:15.763
History is moving on, and
that changes attitudes often.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.420
And then buildings themselves of course

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:22.610
are not static, and they change.

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:24.750
They change even if we
don't try to change them

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:29.653
because if we leave them
alone, they will deteriorate.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.150
They need tending to be kept the same,

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:34.990
and sometimes we change them anyway,

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:36.980
we overtly intervene and change them.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.793
So everything is changing all the time.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.920
That's why, in the book,
Why Architecture Matters,

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.920
I try to separate out what I
called architecture and memory,

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.010
which is much more about
our own personal histories,

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:57.160
and how they relate to buildings.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.520
And then buildings and
time, which is much more

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.370
a kind of broader sense
of how architecture itself

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:07.940
changes over time, and how the culture

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.513
views it differently at different times.

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.100
To go back to the beginning
of our conversation,

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.963
when I talked about coming to Yale,

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:22.610
in part because I loved the
new, modern buildings there,

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:25.460
and then discovering that
the more traditional ones

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:30.330
also appealed to me, that was
an almost radical position

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:34.090
for a student interested in architecture

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:35.343
to have at that time.

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:37.400
Now, it wouldn't be anymore.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.500
Now, I think it's widely understood

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:44.330
how good those buildings
were, and in fact,

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:47.990
Yale is expanding with two
new residential colleges

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:50.990
that are being done in
a traditional mode now,

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:55.670
following the lead of those
ones from 90 years ago.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:48:00.333
So the culture has
evolved in a certain way.

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:03.270
Some might say it has
not evolved positively,

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:04.890
and that it might've been better

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:07.680
if Yale had commissioned someone

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.913
who was more at the
cutting edge to do that.

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:14.780
I sort of felt that, myself,
somewhat, but we'll see.

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:16.250
Maybe these will turn out okay.

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:21.250
I don't want to judge them
yet, until they exist.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:25.800
- Time also brings a
change in the materials

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.800
that are available

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.203
- [Paul] Sure, technology always, always.

00:48:28.203 --> 00:48:29.973
- The technology, always the technology.

00:48:29.973 --> 00:48:32.470
- I mean, from, go back
to Gothic cathedrals

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:33.400
and flying buttresses.

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:36.380
Architecture has always
used the latest technology

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:41.030
and demonstrated it and that
in turn, has determined,

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:44.770
you know, what we can build, sure.

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:47.890
And it all evolves over time,

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:52.380
and our perceptions are
evolving at the same time.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:55.440
And the other thing that
I think evolves over time,

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.240
that makes architecture
different from other things,

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:03.240
is our, let's just say our
tolerance, of architecture

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:07.545
because architecture's always there.

00:49:07.545 --> 00:49:09.700
It doesn't go away.

00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:12.513
It's always there to be seen, you know.

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:16.700
We have a tendency to kind
of accommodate ourselves

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.860
to it a little bit, which
I think we have to do

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:19.930
as a gesture of protection.

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:21.700
You know, if there's music you don't like,

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:22.780
you don't listen to it.

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:25.973
If there's literature you
don't like, you don't read it.

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.300
But if there's architecture
you don't like,

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.460
you don't have the luxury of not seeing it

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:33.330
if it happens to be on your route to work,

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:35.210
or what have you.

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:40.210
So we learn, I think, to have
a degree of tolerance for it,

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:44.810
which is both good and bad.

00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:47.450
It saves us from being
crazy and angry all the time

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:48.690
about how horrible everything is,

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:51.120
which would make it hard to live.

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:51.953
On the other hand,

00:49:51.953 --> 00:49:54.840
sometimes it could also
encourage complacency,

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.950
which makes it harder to
push to make things better.

00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:02.320
- And as history sweeps
forward, shall we say,

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.843
over these buildings,

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.851
buildings can change and
adopt to new values, really.

00:50:09.851 --> 00:50:11.614
- Sure they can, absolutely.

00:50:11.614 --> 00:50:12.700
- So that in preserving them,

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:15.170
we're seeing a lot of that
in Oakland, for example,

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:17.190
where a lot of the older buildings

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:20.010
in downtown are becoming
restaurants, and so on.

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:22.070
- Look at all the old industrial buildings

00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:25.140
that have become residential
lofts in San Francisco,

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.973
in Oakland, in New York,
all over the country.

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:33.440
As manufacturing has
departed from central cities,

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:37.600
as they have become more
residential as places,

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.620
as more people have wanted
to live in the city,

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:40.940
which I think is a very good thing

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:43.013
for our society in general,

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:49.410
thousands of industrial
buildings have been repurposed,

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:53.600
most often to residential
use, and very positively so.

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.270
I mean, all that is a very good thing.

00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:59.730
- And the city, going back
to our original discussion,

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:03.540
is where a lot of the
good things are happening,

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:05.600
but some bad things also.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:08.487
And you quote Lewis Mumford as saying,

00:51:08.487 --> 00:51:11.817
"In a city, time becomes visible."

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:14.823
And let's explore--

00:51:15.972 --> 00:51:17.820
- Such a wonderful just,

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.640
talk about saying so much
with so little. (laughs)

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.910
- (laughs) Yeah, right.

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:24.270
And is there anything we can add to that?

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:28.320
I mean, to help people
understand it, if they don't?

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:33.320
I mean, as the history becomes important,

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.998
as does the change in the
history, I guess is what.

00:51:37.998 --> 00:51:39.340
And it's layered, and it's all there.

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:41.490
- It's always layered,
it's always layered.

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:48.110
It's not an argument for
preserving everything, of course.

00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:48.943
- [Harry] Right.

00:51:48.943 --> 00:51:52.030
- In fact, if anything, it's
an argument for making sure

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:56.370
that historic preservation,
important though it is,

00:51:56.370 --> 00:52:00.770
doesn't dictate every,
single decision that's made

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:03.140
about planning and building cities

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:06.270
because of the various,

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:08.410
one of the layers of time
that we have to make sure

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:11.330
is still visible is
the present, of course.

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:14.230
You know, a city is not a theme park.

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:15.980
A city is not a make-believe place,

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:20.980
and beautiful though the
buildings of the past can be,

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:25.760
essential as they are
for our ongoing life,

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:28.740
we don't want a city that
consists only of them, either.

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:32.560
And so layering involves integrating

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:35.830
the present and the past
effectively, I think.

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:38.240
- We went through a period,
and you've written about it,

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.083
in which the cities were deteriorating.

00:52:43.265 --> 00:52:45.850
The suburb was seen as the ideal model.

00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:48.810
Is that direction changing now,

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:51.290
and what are the positive forces

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:55.780
that are making the
city more viable again?

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:58.500
- I think we have a
generation now in their,

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:03.380
let's say 30s and 40s, who
are more attuned to urban life

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.500
than a generation or two before them,

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:09.680
than their parents or
grandparents might have been.

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:10.773
I think we have,

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.260
they're somewhat more sophisticated,

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.450
they're more interested.

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:20.780
The rise of the food culture
is in part, not entirely,

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:24.690
but in large part also closely tied

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:29.690
with a kind of rise in urban
culture in this country.

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:33.680
And there's a sense of sort
of more sophistication.

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.280
I mean, something as
simple as a farmer's market

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.800
is an indication of a different

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.513
set of attitudes about cities.

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.390
All of that is good.

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:45.760
I think the greatest problem is almost,

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.030
is that too much success of this

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:52.250
has raised the market such that

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:55.200
a lot of people are being squeezed out,

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.880
and that's a tough thing.

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.970
I mean, I spoke in the lecture yesterday

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:02.400
about remembering how, at
the beginning of my career,

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.770
you know, a journalist
could buy a big apartment

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:07.240
in New York, and raise a family there.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:11.000
Well, you know, that doesn't
work that way anymore.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.790
And that's a tragic loss
because we are losing

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:22.020
a degree of diversity in
cities that is part and parcel

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.673
of what cities should be about.

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:28.830
So you know, in every, as
I like to say sometimes,

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:32.150
in every silver lining,
there is a cloud. (laughs)

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:35.300
And in fact, the fundamentally good thing

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.660
about the renewal of cities
that we've lived through

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:40.910
in the last generation and
continue to live through,

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:45.910
the revival of Oakland,
the huge improvements

00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:50.837
in so many other cities, and
the desire for downtown living

00:54:50.837 --> 00:54:53.060
on the part of a much broader segment

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:55.373
of the population than before.

00:54:55.373 --> 00:54:59.310
All of that is a fundamentally
good thing for our society,

00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:02.360
but it comes at a price,

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:06.010
and the price is that it's
becoming harder and harder

00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:07.963
to keep those communities diverse.

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:14.270
The creative people who ostensibly

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:16.740
are at the vanguard of
some of these changes,

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:18.810
are themselves being squeezed out.

00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:21.490
I'm gonna talk about that
in the other lecture.

00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:24.850
It's a huge problem in San Francisco.

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:26.320
It's a huge problem in a lot of places,

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.600
but we also have to remember

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:32.600
that much of the revival of Oakland,

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.640
not all of it, but much of it,

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:38.290
has come about because of
people who could not afford

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:40.310
to live in San Francisco or Berkeley,

00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:42.370
who might otherwise have
chosen those places,

00:55:42.370 --> 00:55:44.710
a generation ago would've
chosen those places.

00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:49.560
So within all of this is both a reminder

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:51.340
that cities are living places,

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:54.050
and there is ebb and flow all the time,

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:57.070
and that there is you know,

00:55:57.070 --> 00:55:59.740
to use that word that all
the tech people like so much,

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:04.620
there is disruption that
has both good and bad sides.

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:05.917
- One final question,

00:56:05.917 --> 00:56:06.750
- [Paul] Sure.

00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:08.740
- If students were to
watch this interview,

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:11.340
what advice would you give them

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:16.390
with regard to preparing for the future,

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:21.270
and they see as architectural
criticism an element of that,

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:24.500
but they also are committed to values

00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:29.500
that say, "Let's change the
world, and make it better?"

00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:33.280
- I would like to hope
that an architecture critic

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.820
can change the world.

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:39.820
I'm not so naive as to believe
that it's all that easy,

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.220
or that an architecture critic

00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:42.823
can change the world that much.

00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:49.330
But I'd like to hope that
arguing for better architecture

00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:52.870
is part of what has
brought about let's say,

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:57.230
a more sophisticated, a more
visually literate generation

00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:59.720
because they've been
exposed to more writing

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.550
and more public discourse
about some of these issues,

00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:04.263
and we want that to continue.

00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:10.580
For a student, it's a tough
time because we have a paradox.

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:13.440
We have greater interest in the issues

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:17.220
of architecture planning,
design, preservation, urbanism,

00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:19.943
than ever before, I think,
that's the good side.

00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:25.040
We have journalism and the vehicles

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:27.360
through which this
discourse can take place

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:29.710
in a lot of chaos and disarray

00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:34.590
and dramatically evolving,
and nobody really knows

00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:37.300
how the pieces are gonna fall together.

00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:40.590
There are great opportunities
for a younger critic

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:42.960
to be seen and heard through blogs,

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.420
and that kind of thing.

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:45.970
But one can also disappear

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:47.810
in that world of the internet very easily.

00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:52.660
And so in architecture, as
in almost all of journalism,

00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:54.480
all of that stuff is still shaking out,

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:56.840
and it's gonna be a long time

00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:01.440
before whatever new pattern
it sets is fully there.

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.580
- Paul, on that note thank you very much

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:04.990
for being on our program.
- Thank you.

00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:07.380
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:09.723
for this conversation with history.

00:58:11.009 --> 00:58:14.259
(airy, pleasant music)
