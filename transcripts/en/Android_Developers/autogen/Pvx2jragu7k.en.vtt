with our first question in moderator the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840
with our first question in moderator the
 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.340
with our first question in moderator the
question is what is the base context how

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
question is what is the base context how
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.410
question is what is the base context how
does it differ from an activity context

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420
does it differ from an activity context
 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.720
does it differ from an activity context
or the application context when should I

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
or the application context when should I
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.360
or the application context when should I
use it okay I can actually take this one

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
use it okay I can actually take this one
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.220
use it okay I can actually take this one
so there is a class in the framework

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
so there is a class in the framework
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.610
so there is a class in the framework
called context wrapper that you can pass

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
called context wrapper that you can pass
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.470
called context wrapper that you can pass
a context and what that once you do is

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
a context and what that once you do is
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.049
a context and what that once you do is
access certain methods of one context

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059
access certain methods of one context
 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.290
access certain methods of one context
from from a different one so that the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
from from a different one so that the
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.020
from from a different one so that the
context wrappers method get base context

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
context wrappers method get base context
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.600
context wrappers method get base context
basically lets you just access the data

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
basically lets you just access the data
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.330
basically lets you just access the data
for another context so as opposed to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340
for another context so as opposed to
 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.719
for another context so as opposed to
your application context or you know is

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729
your application context or you know is
 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.310
your application context or you know is
to get context felt which would get the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
to get context felt which would get the
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.719
to get context felt which would get the
current context that you're that you're

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
current context that you're that you're
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.350

good let's move on to the next question

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
good let's move on to the next question
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.890
good let's move on to the next question
the gallery widget hasn't gotten much

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
the gallery widget hasn't gotten much
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.319
the gallery widget hasn't gotten much
love in many releases I also noticed the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
love in many releases I also noticed the
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.090
love in many releases I also noticed the
gallery app doesn't even use the gallery

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
gallery app doesn't even use the gallery
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.190
gallery app doesn't even use the gallery
widget if not using the gallery widget

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
widget if not using the gallery widget
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.469
widget if not using the gallery widget
what's the recommended way to display a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
what's the recommended way to display a
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.010
what's the recommended way to display a
gallery of photos all right um well I

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
gallery of photos all right um well I
 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.999
gallery of photos all right um well I
mean you can still use the gallery

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
mean you can still use the gallery
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.580
mean you can still use the gallery
widget of course alternatively you could

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590
widget of course alternatively you could
 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.560
widget of course alternatively you could
use a grid view but I mean really what

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
use a grid view but I mean really what
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.050
use a grid view but I mean really what
this a good world answer though is you

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
this a good world answer though is you
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.980
this a good world answer though is you
know it's up to you how you want to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
know it's up to you how you want to
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.319
know it's up to you how you want to
display photos we don't have you know as

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329
display photos we don't have you know as
 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.300
display photos we don't have you know as
you mentioned we don't have a way to go

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
you mentioned we don't have a way to go
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.620
you mentioned we don't have a way to go
and actually give you the same view used

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
and actually give you the same view used
 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.889
and actually give you the same view used
in the gallery which is the galleria so

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899
in the gallery which is the galleria so
 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.179
in the gallery which is the galleria so
if you are writing an app with the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189
if you are writing an app with the
 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.459
if you are writing an app with the
displays photos you're going to have to

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
displays photos you're going to have to
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.139
displays photos you're going to have to
either use the gallery widget or roll

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
either use the gallery widget or roll
 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.770
either use the gallery widget or roll
your own

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780
your own
 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.680
your own
you want to add to that just one more

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690
you want to add to that just one more
 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.719
you want to add to that just one more
thing I guess so you mentioned gridview

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729
thing I guess so you mentioned gridview
 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.449
thing I guess so you mentioned gridview
and that's that's perfectly fine but

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
and that's that's perfectly fine but
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.800
and that's that's perfectly fine but
there are a couple of issues with grid

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810
there are a couple of issues with grid
 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.380
there are a couple of issues with grid
view basically around spacing and and

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390
view basically around spacing and and
 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.750
view basically around spacing and and
you know having full pixel level control

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760
you know having full pixel level control
 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.270
you know having full pixel level control
over everything so one alternative is

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280
over everything so one alternative is
 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.559
over everything so one alternative is
you know if you are trying to get

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569
you know if you are trying to get
 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.720
you know if you are trying to get
something pixel perfect you could try a

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730
something pixel perfect you could try a
 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.660
something pixel perfect you could try a
listview and basically you just have a

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670
listview and basically you just have a
 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.640
listview and basically you just have a
listview that for every single row

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650
listview that for every single row
 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.770
listview that for every single row
instead of displaying 1 item from an

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780
instead of displaying 1 item from an
 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.090
instead of displaying 1 item from an
adapter you'd have to kind of create

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100
adapter you'd have to kind of create
 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.979
adapter you'd have to kind of create
your own adapter and display maybe a

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989
your own adapter and display maybe a
 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.720
your own adapter and display maybe a
couple of items like two or three items

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730
couple of items like two or three items
 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.970
couple of items like two or three items
whatever you want I think that's how

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980
whatever you want I think that's how
 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.479
whatever you want I think that's how
some of our system apps do things but

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489
some of our system apps do things but
 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.949
some of our system apps do things but
I'm not hundred percent sure so that's

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959
I'm not hundred percent sure so that's
 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.720
I'm not hundred percent sure so that's
kind of another another way to do things

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730
kind of another another way to do things
 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.960
kind of another another way to do things
if you want Vicks level control thank

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970
if you want Vicks level control thank
 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.500
if you want Vicks level control thank
you gentlemen next question what was the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510
you gentlemen next question what was the
 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.300
you gentlemen next question what was the
thought process behind not showing the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310
thought process behind not showing the
 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.640
thought process behind not showing the
overflow icon in an action bar when the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650
overflow icon in an action bar when the
 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.920
overflow icon in an action bar when the
device has a menu button this causes

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930
device has a menu button this causes
 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.259
device has a menu button this causes
confusion as the user will see maybe two

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269
confusion as the user will see maybe two
 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.330
confusion as the user will see maybe two
actions but have no idea that there are

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340
actions but have no idea that there are
 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.660
actions but have no idea that there are
more all right um well so think of the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670
more all right um well so think of the
 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.610
more all right um well so think of the
case where a user is upgrading their

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620
case where a user is upgrading their
 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.699
case where a user is upgrading their
phone from say froyo too or just

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709
phone from say froyo too or just
 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.770
phone from say froyo too or just
gingerbread to ice cream sandwich all

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780
gingerbread to ice cream sandwich all
 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.880
gingerbread to ice cream sandwich all
right they already have a phone with a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890
right they already have a phone with a
 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.890
right they already have a phone with a
menu button they expect that menu button

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900
menu button they expect that menu button
 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.330
menu button they expect that menu button
to continue to work the way it's been

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340
to continue to work the way it's been
 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.400
to continue to work the way it's been
using before they upgraded so for that

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410
using before they upgraded so for that
 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.530
using before they upgraded so for that
reason we can't disable the menu button

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540
reason we can't disable the menu button
 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.390
reason we can't disable the menu button
pressing it still has to go and pop up

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400
pressing it still has to go and pop up
 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.569
pressing it still has to go and pop up
your your overflow menu now then the

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579
your your overflow menu now then the
 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:28.949
your your overflow menu now then the
question is do we provide two ways to

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959
question is do we provide two ways to
 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.560
question is do we provide two ways to
access that menu or one and that's

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570
access that menu or one and that's
 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.410
access that menu or one and that's
debatable but i think the logic here was

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420
debatable but i think the logic here was
 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.120
debatable but i think the logic here was
if we actually have two ways to get into

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130
if we actually have two ways to get into
 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.310
if we actually have two ways to get into
the exact same menu it's rather

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320
the exact same menu it's rather
 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.680
the exact same menu it's rather
confusing on top of that if i remember

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690
confusing on top of that if i remember
 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.330
confusing on top of that if i remember
correctly when you do open the overflow

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340
correctly when you do open the overflow
 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.550
correctly when you do open the overflow
menu from the menu button it pops up

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560
menu from the menu button it pops up
 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.720
menu from the menu button it pops up
from the bottom of the screen like they

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730
from the bottom of the screen like they
 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.280
from the bottom of the screen like they
did on older releases and that's right

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290
did on older releases and that's right
 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.740
did on older releases and that's right
right yeah so it is again trying to

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750
right yeah so it is again trying to
 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.900
right yeah so it is again trying to
maintain the same behavior going forward

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910
maintain the same behavior going forward
 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.690
maintain the same behavior going forward
so if you press the overflow button and

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700
so if you press the overflow button and
 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.360
so if you press the overflow button and
it popped up a screen on the bottom that

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370
it popped up a screen on the bottom that
 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.150
it popped up a screen on the bottom that
would be really confusing so i think

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160
would be really confusing so i think
 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.340
would be really confusing so i think
that's sort of the logic there there's

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350
that's sort of the logic there there's
 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.690
that's sort of the logic there there's
only one other thing I would add is that

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700
only one other thing I would add is that
 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.440
only one other thing I would add is that
the action bar before we even had this

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450
the action bar before we even had this
 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.800
the action bar before we even had this
kind of

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810
kind of
 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.280
kind of
concept of an on screen I guess

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290
concept of an on screen I guess
 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.809
concept of an on screen I guess
on-screen buttons like physical buttons

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819
on-screen buttons like physical buttons
 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.760

buns so before we even had the concept

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209
buns so before we even had the concept

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150
of this overflow you know in Gingerbread
 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.300

and Froyo and before that we still had
 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.220

the action bar and our recommendation

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230
the action bar and our recommendation
 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.140

the next question I'm new to fragments

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530
the next question I'm new to fragments
 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.710
the next question I'm new to fragments
from a performance point of view does it

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720
from a performance point of view does it
 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.480
from a performance point of view does it
make sense to use a fragment on each

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490
make sense to use a fragment on each
 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.700
make sense to use a fragment on each
page of a view pager or viewed page

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710

that the user can add many pages things
 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.110
that the user can add many pages things
so I guess the answer here is it depends

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120
so I guess the answer here is it depends
 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.310
so I guess the answer here is it depends

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:17.949
your app so yeah like Alex said let us
 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:19.080
your app so yeah like Alex said let us
know what you're doing maybe we can give

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.090
know what you're doing maybe we can give
 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.659
know what you're doing maybe we can give
you a better answer it's not common to

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:21.669
you a better answer it's not common to
 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:25.260
you a better answer it's not common to
try and reuse resource hi over to

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.270
try and reuse resource hi over to
 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.839
try and reuse resource hi over to
hard-code resource IDs so it sounds like

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:27.849
hard-code resource IDs so it sounds like
 

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:29.070
hard-code resource IDs so it sounds like
you're doing something a little odd

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.080
you're doing something a little odd
 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.140
you're doing something a little odd
there okay um we're next going to go to

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.150
there okay um we're next going to go to
 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.089
there okay um we're next going to go to
someone who's actually in the Hangout

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:36.099
someone who's actually in the Hangout
 

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:40.649
someone who's actually in the Hangout
mark so go ahead yeah I have a question

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:40.659
mark so go ahead yeah I have a question
 

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:44.369
mark so go ahead yeah I have a question
about the preferences using preferences

00:07:44.369 --> 00:07:44.379
about the preferences using preferences
 

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:46.529
about the preferences using preferences
the honeycomb flavor the preferences

00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:46.539
the honeycomb flavor the preferences
 

00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:50.309
the honeycomb flavor the preferences
fragments and specifically I'm trying to

00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319
fragments and specifically I'm trying to
 

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:53.070
fragments and specifically I'm trying to
reset all the values to their default

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080
reset all the values to their default
 

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.339
reset all the values to their default
settings so what I've done is I

00:07:56.339 --> 00:07:56.349
settings so what I've done is I
 

00:07:56.349 --> 00:07:58.769
settings so what I've done is I
registered a preference that fires an

00:07:58.769 --> 00:07:58.779
registered a preference that fires an
 

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:02.550
registered a preference that fires an
intent which starts a reset my

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560
intent which starts a reset my
 

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.249
intent which starts a reset my
preferences activity I get a hold of the

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:05.259
preferences activity I get a hold of the
 

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:07.200
preferences activity I get a hold of the
preference manager and the editor I

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:07.210
preference manager and the editor I
 

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.200
preference manager and the editor I
clean everything I commit and then it

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.210
clean everything I commit and then it
 

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.779
clean everything I commit and then it
launches the main activity of the

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:12.789
launches the main activity of the
 

00:08:12.789 --> 00:08:15.749
launches the main activity of the
application again just like as if the

00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759
application again just like as if the
 

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:18.139
application again just like as if the
user had launched it for the first time

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:18.149
user had launched it for the first time
 

00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:22.529
user had launched it for the first time
all of this works fine the problem is if

00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:22.539
all of this works fine the problem is if
 

00:08:22.539 --> 00:08:23.700
all of this works fine the problem is if
the user

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:23.710
the user
 

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.850
the user
goes back to the Preferences he sees the

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:26.860
goes back to the Preferences he sees the
 

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.450
goes back to the Preferences he sees the
old values before there were white and

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:30.460
old values before there were white and
 

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.640
old values before there were white and
that is because uncreate isn't called

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:32.650
that is because uncreate isn't called
 

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.910
that is because uncreate isn't called
and I assumed that the on resume just

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:35.920
and I assumed that the on resume just
 

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.670
and I assumed that the on resume just
doesn't know that all the values in the

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:38.680
doesn't know that all the values in the
 

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.560
doesn't know that all the values in the
database have changed from underneath of

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:40.570
database have changed from underneath of
 

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.650
database have changed from underneath of
it I tried to remove the code to on

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:43.660
it I tried to remove the code to on
 

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.430
it I tried to remove the code to on
resume the problem with that is that

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440
resume the problem with that is that
 

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.320
resume the problem with that is that
every time you go back now it literally

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:49.330
every time you go back now it literally
 

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.280
every time you go back now it literally
adds more resources and you end up with

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:53.290
adds more resources and you end up with
 

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.400
adds more resources and you end up with
the same set of preferences you know the

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:56.410
the same set of preferences you know the
 

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.620
the same set of preferences you know the
first time in once the next time in you

00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:58.630
first time in once the next time in you
 

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.870
first time in once the next time in you
have doubled the next time in you have

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880
have doubled the next time in you have
 

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.680
have doubled the next time in you have
three of them so what is the best way to

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:03.690
three of them so what is the best way to
 

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.720
three of them so what is the best way to
reset all the preferences and have the

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:06.730
reset all the preferences and have the
 

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.720
reset all the preferences and have the
Preferences you reflect that everything

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:09.730
Preferences you reflect that everything
 

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.680
Preferences you reflect that everything
is set to default again Roman you look

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:13.690
is set to default again Roman you look
 

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.570
is set to default again Roman you look
like you have a good answer I don't know

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:15.580
like you have a good answer I don't know
 

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.030
like you have a good answer I don't know
if I have a great answer I do have one

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.040
if I have a great answer I do have one
 

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.460
if I have a great answer I do have one
question though so you said that when

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:20.470
question though so you said that when
 

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.010
question though so you said that when
you so the reset preferences item is a

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:23.020
you so the reset preferences item is a
 

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.430
you so the reset preferences item is a
preference itself yeah it's a preference

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:26.440
preference itself yeah it's a preference
 

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.190
preference itself yeah it's a preference
that fires an intent and the implement

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200
that fires an intent and the implement
 

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.220
that fires an intent and the implement
on my own activity to do the work

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:31.230
on my own activity to do the work
 

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.040
on my own activity to do the work
because there's more than just resetting

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:34.050
because there's more than just resetting
 

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.110
because there's more than just resetting
the Preferences themselves we also have

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120
the Preferences themselves we also have
 

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.420
the Preferences themselves we also have
you know license keys on our servers

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:39.430
you know license keys on our servers
 

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.700
you know license keys on our servers
that need to be unhinged because I've

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:41.710
that need to be unhinged because I've

my own activity okay and is the separate

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.160
my own activity okay and is the separate
 

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.870

you really sure that you want to reset

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:18.820
you really sure that you want to reset
 

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.900

goes away always we show a determinate
progress bar for as long as we do other

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720
progress bar for as long as we do other
 

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.840
progress bar for as long as we do other
things on the network and then once that

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:30.850
things on the network and then once that
 

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.850
things on the network and then once that
is done that activity finishes and

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:32.860
is done that activity finishes and
 

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.670
is done that activity finishes and
launches the main activity of the app so

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680
launches the main activity of the app so
 

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.630
launches the main activity of the app so
at which so

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:37.640
at which so
 

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.190
at which so
you basically you go from the

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200
you basically you go from the
 

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.400
you basically you go from the
Preferences to the the resetter and then

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:42.410
Preferences to the the resetter and then
 

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.920
Preferences to the the resetter and then
from there you jump straight back into

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:44.930
from there you jump straight back into
 

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.410
from there you jump straight back into
the home activity correct okay so what

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:47.420
the home activity correct okay so what
 

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.000
the home activity correct okay so what
you should do it seems like you should

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.010
you should do it seems like you should
 

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.430
you should do it seems like you should
actually destroy the Preferences

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440
actually destroy the Preferences
 

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.930
actually destroy the Preferences
activity off the stack you should

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:52.940
activity off the stack you should
 

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.360
activity off the stack you should
basically clear it so what you could

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:55.370
basically clear it so what you could
 

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.220
basically clear it so what you could
potentially do is just reset the task

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:57.230
potentially do is just reset the task
 

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.770
potentially do is just reset the task
and remember all the intent flags that

00:10:59.770 --> 00:10:59.780
and remember all the intent flags that
 

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.680
and remember all the intent flags that
you need but you basically reset the the

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:02.690
you need but you basically reset the the
 

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.840
you need but you basically reset the the
tasks that you kill or finish the

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:04.850
tasks that you kill or finish the
 

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.970
tasks that you kill or finish the
Preferences activity so it's basically

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:06.980
Preferences activity so it's basically
 

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.310
Preferences activity so it's basically
no longer needed that's that's my kind

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.320
no longer needed that's that's my kind
 

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.840
no longer needed that's that's my kind
of naive guess at how you would approach

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:10.850
of naive guess at how you would approach
 

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.790
of naive guess at how you would approach
this without looking at preferences

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800
this without looking at preferences
 

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.120
this without looking at preferences
program details so leave so the intent

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.130
program details so leave so the intent
 

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.210
program details so leave so the intent
is only defined in the XML so you're

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:19.220
is only defined in the XML so you're
 

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.220
is only defined in the XML so you're
saying there is some sort of intent flag

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:21.230
saying there is some sort of intent flag
 

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.920
saying there is some sort of intent flag
that I can set that destroys the calling

so clear you can look at a flat okay so

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:30.080
so clear you can look at a flat okay so
 

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.350
so clear you can look at a flat okay so
under the intent class look at flag

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360
under the intent class look at flag
 

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.000
under the intent class look at flag
activity clear top that'll basically say

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.010
activity clear top that'll basically say

and the Preferences activity and then
 

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.790

the activity that was to be started is

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:49.220
the activity that was to be started is
 

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.580
the activity that was to be started is
already on the task then don't create a

your resetter and jump back to it that's

00:11:59.920 --> 00:11:59.930
your resetter and jump back to it that's
 

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.540
your resetter and jump back to it that's
a very kind of simplistic way of

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:01.550
a very kind of simplistic way of
 

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.330
a very kind of simplistic way of
explaining it but basically using intent

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:04.340
explaining it but basically using intent
 

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.910
explaining it but basically using intent
flags in your you know if you call the

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920
flags in your you know if you call the
 

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.490
flags in your you know if you call the
intent that set flags or add flight all

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:09.500
intent that set flags or add flight all
 

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.380
intent that set flags or add flight all
right using that you can control

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:11.390
right using that you can control
 

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.740
right using that you can control
basically the history or the back stack

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:14.750
basically the history or the back stack
 

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.860
basically the history or the back stack
that you for your task so that's that's

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:17.870
that you for your task so that's that's
 

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.440
that you for your task so that's that's
probably the way to do it okay and that

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:20.450
probably the way to do it okay and that
 

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.740
probably the way to do it okay and that
and that flag needs to go onto the call

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:23.750
and that flag needs to go onto the call
 

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.630
and that flag needs to go onto the call
that's coming from the preferences

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:25.640
that's coming from the preferences
 

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.060
that's coming from the preferences
correct right so well it's no it would

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:28.070
correct right so well it's no it would
 

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.220
correct right so well it's no it would
actually be the call from the reset of

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:30.230
actually be the call from the reset of
 

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:31.720

there you'll set it as the flag there so

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320
there you'll set it as the flag there so
 

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.319
there you'll set it as the flag there so
based once your main activity comes up

00:12:38.319 --> 00:12:38.329

that's a pretty big downside to native

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:25.069
that's a pretty big downside to native
 

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:27.549
that's a pretty big downside to native
code the other thing too tight our thing

00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559
code the other thing too tight our thing
 

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:29.110
code the other thing too tight our thing
to note too is you don't have access to

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120
to note too is you don't have access to
 

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.669
to note too is you don't have access to
all the capabilities of the system at

00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:30.679
all the capabilities of the system at
 

00:17:30.679 --> 00:17:32.380
all the capabilities of the system at
that level so then you wind up having to

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:32.390
that level so then you wind up having to
 

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.880
that level so then you wind up having to
do things like right Jay and I bridges

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:33.890
do things like right Jay and I bridges
 

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.860
do things like right Jay and I bridges
and whenever you go to Jay and I you're

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:35.870
and whenever you go to Jay and I you're
 

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:36.880
and whenever you go to Jay and I you're
going to lose performance that way too

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:36.890
going to lose performance that way too
 

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.070
going to lose performance that way too
so because of that depending on the

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.080
so because of that depending on the
 

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.419
so because of that depending on the
nature of your application it could

00:17:40.419 --> 00:17:40.429
nature of your application it could
 

00:17:40.429 --> 00:17:42.310
nature of your application it could
actually wind up quite a bit slower so

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320
actually wind up quite a bit slower so
 

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.380
actually wind up quite a bit slower so
the short answer here is it really

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:44.390
the short answer here is it really
 

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.770
the short answer here is it really
depends on what you're writing ug ndk is

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:47.780
depends on what you're writing ug ndk is
 

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.110
depends on what you're writing ug ndk is

over a lot of really complicated code

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:52.070
over a lot of really complicated code
 

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.760
over a lot of really complicated code
from another platform usually gains so

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:54.770
from another platform usually gains so
 

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.500
from another platform usually gains so
if you have a cross platform game that's

we have a questioning from the Hangout
then I'll go to first and then we need

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:18.950
then I'll go to first and then we need
 

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.049
then I'll go to first and then we need
to move backwards in the moderator for

00:18:22.049 --> 00:18:22.059
to move backwards in the moderator for
 

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:24.039

question I skip so first from the

00:18:24.039 --> 00:18:24.049
question I skip so first from the
 

00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:26.049
question I skip so first from the
Hangout how can i change the theme

00:18:26.049 --> 00:18:26.059
Hangout how can i change the theme
 

00:18:26.059 --> 00:18:28.780
Hangout how can i change the theme
dynamically to my custom theme each time

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:28.790
dynamically to my custom theme each time
 

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:36.070
dynamically to my custom theme each time
the user starts the app so so basically

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080
the user starts the app so so basically
 

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.870
the user starts the app so so basically
how can you change the theme dynamically

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880
how can you change the theme dynamically
 

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.870
how can you change the theme dynamically
it is definitely possible I think you

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880
it is definitely possible I think you
 

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.360
it is definitely possible I think you
have to do it you're on Chris Oh in your

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:43.370
have to do it you're on Chris Oh in your
 

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:46.030
have to do it you're on Chris Oh in your
activity right right before calling

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:46.040
activity right right before calling
 

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.340
activity right right before calling
super done create or set content of your

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:48.350
super done create or set content of your
 

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.560

forgot which one it is but basically I

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:50.570
forgot which one it is but basically I
 

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:53.500
forgot which one it is but basically I
think you just I forgot the exact call

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:53.510
think you just I forgot the exact call
 

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.390
think you just I forgot the exact call
but there's a way to do it I think it's

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:55.400
but there's a way to do it I think it's
 

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.549
but there's a way to do it I think it's
sexy yes now what would actually be a

00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:57.559
sexy yes now what would actually be a
 

00:18:57.559 --> 00:18:58.350
sexy yes now what would actually be a
good example

00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.360
good example
 

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.930
good example
honeycomb gallery yeah we have examples

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:00.940
honeycomb gallery yeah we have examples
 

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.150
honeycomb gallery yeah we have examples
we wrote for honeycomb displays a very

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:03.160
we wrote for honeycomb displays a very
 

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.880
we wrote for honeycomb displays a very
basic photo gallery and in the menu

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:05.890
basic photo gallery and in the menu
 

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.020
basic photo gallery and in the menu
there's an option to go and pick which

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:07.030
there's an option to go and pick which
 

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.340
there's an option to go and pick which
theme you want so we've already

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:08.350
theme you want so we've already
 

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:09.960
theme you want so we've already
implemented probably exactly what you're

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:09.970
implemented probably exactly what you're
 

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.910
implemented probably exactly what you're
trying to do so take a look in the

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:11.920
trying to do so take a look in the
 

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.290
trying to do so take a look in the
samples directory again it's called

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:13.300
samples directory again it's called
 

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.780
samples directory again it's called
honeycomb gallery if you can find that

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:15.790
honeycomb gallery if you can find that
 

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.400
honeycomb gallery if you can find that
just take a look at how it does it it's

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:17.410
just take a look at how it does it it's
 

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:19.020
just take a look at how it does it it's
actually pretty straightforward and just

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:19.030
actually pretty straightforward and just
 

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.270
actually pretty straightforward and just
copy that code Alex he wrote that I

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280
copy that code Alex he wrote that I
 

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.310
copy that code Alex he wrote that I
think actually yeah I did oh it is

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320
think actually yeah I did oh it is
 

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.420
think actually yeah I did oh it is
pretty straightforward the one thing you

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:24.430
pretty straightforward the one thing you
 

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.880
pretty straightforward the one thing you
have to remember is if the application

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:26.890
have to remember is if the application
 

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.290
have to remember is if the application
is already fully started up and gone

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:28.300
is already fully started up and gone
 

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.940
is already fully started up and gone
through the young create and then you

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:29.950
through the young create and then you
 

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.370
through the young create and then you
change the fame you have to restart the

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:32.380
change the fame you have to restart the
 

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.950
change the fame you have to restart the
activity so there's there's no way

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960
activity so there's there's no way
 

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.070
activity so there's there's no way
around that but if you if you have like

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080
around that but if you if you have like
 

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.390
around that but if you if you have like
in a preference or something which theme

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:39.400
in a preference or something which theme
 

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.130
in a preference or something which theme
you want to start one the applicant when

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:41.140
you want to start one the applicant when
 

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.080
you want to start one the applicant when
that give Utley starts up then you stop

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:43.090
that give Utley starts up then you stop
 

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.690
that give Utley starts up then you stop
to make sure to call septame before set

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:45.700
to make sure to call septame before set
 

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.120
to make sure to call septame before set
content view I want to say and then it

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.130
content view I want to say and then it
 

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:51.060
content view I want to say and then it
should be clear so is it for the

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:51.070
should be clear so is it for the
 

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.900
should be clear so is it for the
activity of that application from your

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:54.910
activity of that application from your
 

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.630
activity of that application from your
children I want the application no

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640
children I want the application no
 

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.990
children I want the application no
actually I wanted for their application

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.000
actually I wanted for their application
 

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.040
actually I wanted for their application
because I'm providing users to wait to

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:05.050
because I'm providing users to wait to
 

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.490
because I'm providing users to wait to
set the theme and I want my application

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:08.500
set the theme and I want my application
 

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.130
set the theme and I want my application
team to change so instead of me having

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:11.140
team to change so instead of me having
 

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.890
team to change so instead of me having
to write it reduce setting in each

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:13.900
to write it reduce setting in each
 

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.380
to write it reduce setting in each
activity you'll have to do it free chat

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:16.390
activity you'll have to do it free chat
 

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.660
activity you'll have to do it free chat
now you do have to call this in each

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:18.670
now you do have to call this in each
 

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.670
now you do have to call this in each
activity you can't have a shared

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:20.680
activity you can't have a shared
 

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.370
activity you can't have a shared
preferences file this chair putting all

your activities and you know and send a

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:25.210
your activities and you know and send a
 

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:26.850
your activities and you know and send a
message to all of them saying you know

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:26.860
message to all of them saying you know
 

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.180
message to all of them saying you know
my my theme is changed please update and

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:30.190
my my theme is changed please update and
 

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:33.720
my my theme is changed please update and
relaunch but again the themes are

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:33.730
relaunch but again the themes are
 

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:35.460
relaunch but again the themes are
actually said on that proactivity level

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:35.470
actually said on that proactivity level
 

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.260
actually said on that proactivity level
so the code to actually go and set this

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:37.270
so the code to actually go and set this
 

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.790
so the code to actually go and set this
does need to be done on a pro activity

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:38.800
does need to be done on a pro activity
 

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.490
does need to be done on a pro activity
basis users don't have to see that but

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:41.500
basis users don't have to see that but
 

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.840
basis users don't have to see that but
as a programmer you do have to deal with

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:42.850
as a programmer you do have to deal with
 

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.960
as a programmer you do have to deal with
that reality and that's a good practice

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:45.970
that reality and that's a good practice
 

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.600
that reality and that's a good practice
is if you have to do this everywhere you

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:48.610
is if you have to do this everywhere you
 

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.420
is if you have to do this everywhere you
know you can you can minimize or

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:51.430
know you can you can minimize or
 

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.190
know you can you can minimize or
maximize code reuse but basically having

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200
maximize code reuse but basically having
 

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.380
maximize code reuse but basically having
a base activity that extends from

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:55.390
a base activity that extends from
 

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.000
a base activity that extends from
fragment activity or whatever

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:57.010
fragment activity or whatever
 

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.060
fragment activity or whatever
activity and in there you have that code

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:00.070
activity and in there you have that code
 

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.370
activity and in there you have that code
in your oncreate and if you have to

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:02.380
in your oncreate and if you have to
 

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.050
in your oncreate and if you have to
extend from my list activity or Matt

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:04.060
extend from my list activity or Matt
 

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.030
extend from my list activity or Matt
back to original in the future you could

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:06.040
back to original in the future you could
 

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.830
back to original in the future you could
potentially have like a helper that has

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840
potentially have like a helper that has
 

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.750
potentially have like a helper that has
this functionality so there's definitely

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760
this functionality so there's definitely
 

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.030
this functionality so there's definitely
ways just like standard programming like

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:12.040
ways just like standard programming like
 

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.620
ways just like standard programming like
I guess they're good design patterns

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:13.630
I guess they're good design patterns
 

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.900
I guess they're good design patterns
around this but yeah he doesn't do it

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:15.910
around this but yeah he doesn't do it
 

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:20.220
around this but yeah he doesn't do it

thank you to go back here we have a
question from moderator last week my

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:25.960
question from moderator last week my
 

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.050
question from moderator last week my
question was answered advising me not to

question was answered advising me not to
 

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.000
question was answered advising me not to
use the graphic you I editor because of

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.010
use the graphic you I editor because of
 

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.970
use the graphic you I editor because of
bugs which made me think how does it

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:32.980
bugs which made me think how does it
 

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.790
bugs which made me think how does it
work for like with a UI designer on the

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:35.800
work for like with a UI designer on the
 

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.340
work for like with a UI designer on the
team I assume that means our team should

team I assume that means our team should
 

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.530

I just ask the designer to draw the UI

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:40.540
I just ask the designer to draw the UI
 

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.320
I just ask the designer to draw the UI
then reproduce it on XML I think that's

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:43.330
then reproduce it on XML I think that's
 

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:45.090
then reproduce it on XML I think that's
actually refer to their team so if they

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:45.100
actually refer to their team so if they
 

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.590
actually refer to their team so if they
have it if they have a UI designer right

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:46.600
have it if they have a UI designer right
 

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.260
have it if they have a UI designer right
who's not a programmer nicely how should

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:49.270

00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:10.490
any app can go and use account manager
to go and get a handle to your google

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:10.500
to go and get a handle to your google
 

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.860

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.490
services on your behalf and that's
pretty powerful right it allows apps

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500
pretty powerful right it allows apps
 

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.230

can do this on the camera object you can
do set display orientation and that

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:46.560
do set display orientation and that
 

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.770
do set display orientation and that
should set the orientation that it's

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:48.780
should set the orientation that it's
 

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:52.010
should set the orientation that it's
recording video in there's also in the

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.020
recording video in there's also in the
 

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.080
recording video in there's also in the
when you there's two different ways to

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:54.090
when you there's two different ways to
 

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.700
when you there's two different ways to
do this there's a camera parameters

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:55.710
do this there's a camera parameters
 

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.670
do this there's a camera parameters
object you can set rotation in that

00:28:58.670 --> 00:28:58.680
object you can set rotation in that
 

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.980
object you can set rotation in that
object before as you when you set it

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:00.990
object before as you when you set it
 

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:02.900
object before as you when you set it
into your camera before you start using

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:02.910
into your camera before you start using
 

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.480
into your camera before you start using
it so it's two different ways to do the

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:05.490
it so it's two different ways to do the
 

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:06.740
it so it's two different ways to do the
same thing and that should that should

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:06.750
same thing and that should that should
 

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:10.930
same thing and that should that should
solve your problem

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:10.940

think we had a similar question like

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:19.490
think we had a similar question like
 

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:21.370
think we had a similar question like
this or I remember a question like this

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:21.380
this or I remember a question like this
 

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.830
this or I remember a question like this
last week I looked into this a little

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840
last week I looked into this a little
 

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.240
last week I looked into this a little
bit and I've seen some apps that

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:25.250
bit and I've seen some apps that
 

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.780
bit and I've seen some apps that
actually claim that they record your

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:27.790
actually claim that they record your
 

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.250
actually claim that they record your
your phone conversation but I believe

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:30.260
your phone conversation but I believe
 

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.220
your phone conversation but I believe
what they're doing actually is taking

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:33.230
what they're doing actually is taking
 

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:34.810
what they're doing actually is taking
input from the microphone right that's

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:34.820
input from the microphone right that's
 

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.330
input from the microphone right that's
on the phone and try to record it

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:37.340
on the phone and try to record it
 

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.040
on the phone and try to record it
there's rain just capture the audio

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:39.050
there's rain just capture the audio
 

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.960
there's rain just capture the audio
through with your APN toys and you

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:40.970
through with your APN toys and you
 

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:42.640

gettin ready for quality recording yeah

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:42.650

so this has been a limitation for a long

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:44.390
so this has been a limitation for a long
 

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:47.200
so this has been a limitation for a long
time I've remembered several years ago

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:47.210
time I've remembered several years ago
 

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.360
time I've remembered several years ago
looking into this and this is not right

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:49.370
looking into this and this is not right
 

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:50.710
looking into this and this is not right
now I believe it's a hardware problem

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720
now I believe it's a hardware problem
 

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.660
now I believe it's a hardware problem
it's not it's not something that we can

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:52.670
it's not it's not something that we can
 

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:55.720
it's not it's not something that we can
intercept and record so and then there's

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:55.730
intercept and record so and then there's
 

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.000
intercept and record so and then there's
all security considerations to if you

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:58.010
all security considerations to if you
 

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:00.910
all security considerations to if you
have an app on your phone that is

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:00.920
have an app on your phone that is

you know this is one of those things
 

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:09.730
you know this is one of those things
that needs to be approached really

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:09.740
that needs to be approached really

soon next moderator question will be

00:33:24.799 --> 00:33:24.809
soon next moderator question will be
 

00:33:24.809 --> 00:33:27.470
soon next moderator question will be
when will it be possible package library

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480
when will it be possible package library
 

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.260
when will it be possible package library

I believe you actually can do that its

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:37.740
I believe you actually can do that its
 

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.260
I believe you actually can do that its
intent well so it depends what you're

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:39.270
intent well so it depends what you're
 

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.090
intent well so it depends what you're
trying to do if you just want to go and

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.100
trying to do if you just want to go and
 

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.270
trying to do if you just want to go and
take just plain source code you can

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:44.280
take just plain source code you can
 

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.520
take just plain source code you can
bundle that up in the jar and include

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:46.530
bundle that up in the jar and include
 

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:47.840
bundle that up in the jar and include
that in your lips directory and that'll

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:47.850
that in your lips directory and that'll
 

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:50.060
that in your lips directory and that'll
work just fine what library projects

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:50.070
work just fine what library projects
 

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.220
work just fine what library projects
gets you is access to the resources

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:52.230
gets you is access to the resources
 

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.200
gets you is access to the resources
folder so there's that question about

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:54.210
folder so there's that question about
 

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.840
folder so there's that question about
resource IDs earlier and that's really

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:56.850
resource IDs earlier and that's really
 

00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:00.049
resource IDs earlier and that's really
where library bundle or library projects

00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:00.059
where library bundle or library projects
 

00:34:00.059 --> 00:34:02.060
where library bundle or library projects
tend to shine right is it makes sure all

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:02.070
tend to shine right is it makes sure all
 

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:04.430
tend to shine right is it makes sure all
the different libraries can go and share

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440
the different libraries can go and share
 

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.049
the different libraries can go and share
their resources and assets amongst one

00:34:06.049 --> 00:34:06.059
their resources and assets amongst one
 

00:34:06.059 --> 00:34:09.530
their resources and assets amongst one
another and if you are doing that I

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:09.540
another and if you are doing that I
 

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.609
another and if you are doing that I
don't think there's any real way you

00:34:10.609 --> 00:34:10.619
don't think there's any real way you
 

00:34:10.619 --> 00:34:11.899
don't think there's any real way you
could actually go and bundle that up

00:34:11.899 --> 00:34:11.909
could actually go and bundle that up
 

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:15.379
could actually go and bundle that up
easily inside of it sure only thing for

00:34:15.379 --> 00:34:15.389
easily inside of it sure only thing for
 

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:16.849
easily inside of it sure only thing for
a second there yeah I don't you couldn't

00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:16.859
a second there yeah I don't you couldn't
 

00:34:16.859 --> 00:34:19.060
a second there yeah I don't you couldn't
do it directly because the problem is

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:19.070
do it directly because the problem is
 

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:21.470
do it directly because the problem is
all of your asset ideas need to match

00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480
all of your asset ideas need to match
 

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.379
all of your asset ideas need to match
now if you want to get creative you

00:34:24.379 --> 00:34:24.389
now if you want to get creative you
 

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:25.940
now if you want to get creative you
could probably find some way to go and

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:25.950
could probably find some way to go and
 

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:27.470
could probably find some way to go and
include your assets inside of the that

00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480
include your assets inside of the that
 

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.419
include your assets inside of the that
jar and extract them manually and then

00:34:29.419 --> 00:34:29.429
jar and extract them manually and then
 

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:33.280
jar and extract them manually and then
load them in but that's a lot of work

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:33.290
load them in but that's a lot of work
 

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:36.409
load them in but that's a lot of work
but if you're not using assets feel free

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:36.419
but if you're not using assets feel free
 

00:34:36.419 --> 00:34:37.520
but if you're not using assets feel free
to just go and put things in jar right

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:37.530
to just go and put things in jar right
 

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.349
to just go and put things in jar right
now it'll work fine there's a number of

00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359
now it'll work fine there's a number of
 

00:34:39.359 --> 00:34:40.909
now it'll work fine there's a number of
libraries there already to disturb you

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919
libraries there already to disturb you
 

00:34:40.919 --> 00:34:43.190
libraries there already to disturb you
that way Google Maps I belief is

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200
that way Google Maps I belief is
 

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.139
that way Google Maps I belief is
distributed as a jar file isn't

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:46.149
distributed as a jar file isn't
 

00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:48.210
distributed as a jar file isn't
it's google maps is a little different

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:48.220
it's google maps is a little different
 

00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:50.369
it's google maps is a little different
yeah because it uses stuff bits on the

00:34:50.369 --> 00:34:50.379
yeah because it uses stuff bits on the
 

00:34:50.379 --> 00:34:52.019
yeah because it uses stuff bits on the
devices no analytics that's why I'm

00:34:52.019 --> 00:34:52.029
devices no analytics that's why I'm
 

00:34:52.029 --> 00:34:54.180
devices no analytics that's why I'm
thinking of analytic sisters me as a jar

00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:54.190
thinking of analytic sisters me as a jar
 

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:58.920
thinking of analytic sisters me as a jar
yes minutes um yeah so I mean it depends

00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:58.930
yes minutes um yeah so I mean it depends
 

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.359
yes minutes um yeah so I mean it depends
on what you're doing but if it's just if

00:35:00.359 --> 00:35:00.369
on what you're doing but if it's just if
 

00:35:00.369 --> 00:35:01.890
on what you're doing but if it's just if
it's just code you can do it just find

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:01.900
it's just code you can do it just find
 

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:05.430
it's just code you can do it just find
this jar file or and if not it's a very

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440
this jar file or and if not it's a very
 

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.710
this jar file or and if not it's a very
complicated question time machine we can

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:07.720
complicated question time machine we can
 

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.289
complicated question time machine we can
tell you when or if but I will say it's

00:35:10.289 --> 00:35:10.299
tell you when or if but I will say it's
 

00:35:10.299 --> 00:35:13.460
tell you when or if but I will say it's
complicated so I would Rathlin thank you

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:13.470
complicated so I would Rathlin thank you
 

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:16.829
complicated so I would Rathlin thank you
all right um we have a question pending

00:35:16.829 --> 00:35:16.839
all right um we have a question pending
 

00:35:16.839 --> 00:35:22.680
all right um we have a question pending
in the Hangout um Davey Doyle going like

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:22.690
in the Hangout um Davey Doyle going like
 

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:28.799
in the Hangout um Davey Doyle going like
a bag Davey thanks it's basically a UI

00:35:28.799 --> 00:35:28.809
a bag Davey thanks it's basically a UI
 

00:35:28.809 --> 00:35:33.960
a bag Davey thanks it's basically a UI
design question anything I'm developing

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:33.970
design question anything I'm developing
 

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.150
design question anything I'm developing
an app which will target both Android

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160
an app which will target both Android
 

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.019
an app which will target both Android
and iOS where I have started a prototype

00:35:40.019 --> 00:35:40.029
and iOS where I have started a prototype
 

00:35:40.029 --> 00:35:42.690
and iOS where I have started a prototype
on iOS and now I would like to convert

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:42.700
on iOS and now I would like to convert
 

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.549
on iOS and now I would like to convert
it into like an Android kinda style now

00:35:46.549 --> 00:35:46.559
it into like an Android kinda style now
 

00:35:46.559 --> 00:35:48.960
it into like an Android kinda style now
with in iOS I don't know if you were

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:48.970
with in iOS I don't know if you were
 

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:50.539
with in iOS I don't know if you were
aware of this there's this grouped

00:35:50.539 --> 00:35:50.549
aware of this there's this grouped
 

00:35:50.549 --> 00:35:54.470
aware of this there's this grouped
tableview component that you can use

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480
tableview component that you can use
 

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.890
tableview component that you can use
yeah I can show it to you look something

00:35:58.890 --> 00:35:58.900
yeah I can show it to you look something
 

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.370
yeah I can show it to you look something
like this I don't know if you can see it

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:02.380
like this I don't know if you can see it
 

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.529
like this I don't know if you can see it
yeah yeah it's see it the microphones

00:36:04.529 --> 00:36:04.539
yeah yeah it's see it the microphones
 

00:36:04.539 --> 00:36:07.140
yeah yeah it's see it the microphones
cropped off by them yeah so which part

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:07.150
cropped off by them yeah so which part
 

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:09.809
cropped off by them yeah so which part
of the UI is that just to be clear it's

00:36:09.809 --> 00:36:09.819
of the UI is that just to be clear it's
 

00:36:09.819 --> 00:36:12.660
of the UI is that just to be clear it's
basically the tree sections on the page

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:12.670
basically the tree sections on the page
 

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:15.120
basically the tree sections on the page
that's referred to as a group table view

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:15.130
that's referred to as a group table view
 

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:19.260
that's referred to as a group table view
ok gotcha ok so in Android there is no

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:19.270
ok gotcha ok so in Android there is no
 

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:21.269
ok gotcha ok so in Android there is no
real out-of-the-box component which

00:36:21.269 --> 00:36:21.279
real out-of-the-box component which
 

00:36:21.279 --> 00:36:26.010
real out-of-the-box component which
allows you to group certain layout

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:26.020
allows you to group certain layout
 

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.490
allows you to group certain layout
components into a separate zone ok so i

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:29.500
components into a separate zone ok so i
 

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.260
components into a separate zone ok so i
ask you just to go in and relate to

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:31.270
ask you just to go in and relate to
 

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:32.549
ask you just to go in and relate to
something which people who aren't

00:36:32.549 --> 00:36:32.559
something which people who aren't
 

00:36:32.559 --> 00:36:33.660
something which people who aren't
familiar with I us to be more familiar

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:33.670
familiar with I us to be more familiar
 

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:38.339
familiar with I us to be more familiar
to sort of let sort of like a most

00:36:38.339 --> 00:36:38.349
to sort of let sort of like a most
 

00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:40.010
to sort of let sort of like a most
called in HD all the fresh that

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:40.020
called in HD all the fresh that
 

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.390
called in HD all the fresh that
something like that yeah I think I get a

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400
something like that yeah I think I get a
 

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.099
something like that yeah I think I get a
salad element or something it's also

00:36:44.099 --> 00:36:44.109
salad element or something it's also
 

00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:47.150
salad element or something it's also
just like a like a fields or a group

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160
just like a like a fields or a group
 

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.070
just like a like a fields or a group
something the group control yeah yeah

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:49.080
something the group control yeah yeah
 

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.400
something the group control yeah yeah
grouping things yeah yeah what would be

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:52.410
grouping things yeah yeah what would be
 

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:55.430
grouping things yeah yeah what would be
the best way to kind of partition an

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440
the best way to kind of partition an
 

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.710
the best way to kind of partition an
android screen and in that type of way

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720
android screen and in that type of way
 

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.220
android screen and in that type of way
where you have like three zones on a

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:01.230
where you have like three zones on a
 

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:03.950
where you have like three zones on a
certain layout is there like a standard

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960
certain layout is there like a standard
 

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.710
certain layout is there like a standard
Android way to do that so the first

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720
Android way to do that so the first
 

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.200
Android way to do that so the first
question asked is each of these zones

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:09.210
question asked is each of these zones
 

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:12.110
question asked is each of these zones
have titles or they completely not

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:12.120
have titles or they completely not
 

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.280
have titles or they completely not
something that you can provide useful

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:13.290
something that you can provide useful
 

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:17.330
something that you can provide useful
titles for not really useful titles nope

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:17.340
titles for not really useful titles nope
 

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.280
titles for not really useful titles nope
okay so let me let me answer the

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:19.290
okay so let me let me answer the
 

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.090
okay so let me let me answer the
question had you said yes there's no art

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:22.100
question had you said yes there's no art
 

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.350
question had you said yes there's no art
I'll get back for parking benefit of our

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:24.360
I'll get back for parking benefit of our
 

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.000
I'll get back for parking benefit of our
viewers Yeah right in front of other

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:26.010
viewers Yeah right in front of other
 

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:28.670
viewers Yeah right in front of other
folks basically the one way in which you

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680
folks basically the one way in which you
 

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.130
folks basically the one way in which you
could do that is to have a like a

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.140
could do that is to have a like a
 

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.830
could do that is to have a like a
listview use a list view and a

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:32.840
listview use a list view and a
 

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.670
listview use a list view and a
potentially use a list view if it's

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680
potentially use a list view if it's
 

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.520
potentially use a list view if it's
dynamic length of content and then use

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:37.530
dynamic length of content and then use
 

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.650
dynamic length of content and then use
list separators and for list separators

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:39.660
list separators and for list separators
 

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.450
list separators and for list separators
the list operators are basically

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:41.460
the list operators are basically
 

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.250
the list operators are basically
indicate the beginning of a new section

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:43.260
indicate the beginning of a new section
 

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.650
indicate the beginning of a new section
and for that there's actually a built in

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:45.660
and for that there's actually a built in
 

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.780
and for that there's actually a built in
style in the framework think it's called

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:47.790
style in the framework think it's called
 

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:49.910
style in the framework think it's called
list separator text view style and it's

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920
list separator text view style and it's
 

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.310
list separator text view style and it's
a it's an attribute so it's Android dot

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320
a it's an attribute so it's Android dot
 

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.720
a it's an attribute so it's Android dot
r dot ATT dr the list separator text new

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:56.730
r dot ATT dr the list separator text new
 

00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:00.760
r dot ATT dr the list separator text new
style so that's and you can use similar

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:00.770
style so that's and you can use similar
 

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:04.910
style so that's and you can use similar
similar kind of visual styling if you're

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920
similar kind of visual styling if you're
 

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.170
similar kind of visual styling if you're
not even using list view if you're just

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.180
not even using list view if you're just
 

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.270
not even using list view if you're just
using kind of like if you're on a tablet

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.280
using kind of like if you're on a tablet
 

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.100
using kind of like if you're on a tablet
let's saying you have three or four

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:10.110
let's saying you have three or four
 

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:11.510
let's saying you have three or four
panes of content and you want to you

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520
panes of content and you want to you
 

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.150
panes of content and you want to you
know indicate what is what I think a

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160
know indicate what is what I think a
 

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.220
know indicate what is what I think a
good example that would be looking the

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:16.230
good example that would be looking the
 

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:18.020
good example that would be looking the
contacts app we put a heading of each

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:18.030
contacts app we put a heading of each
 

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.180
contacts app we put a heading of each
letter like the eight on price exactly

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:20.190
letter like the eight on price exactly
 

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:23.390
letter like the eight on price exactly
max exactly so that's that's if you do

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400
max exactly so that's that's if you do
 

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.560
max exactly so that's that's if you do
have titles if you don't have titles

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:24.570
have titles if you don't have titles
 

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.210
have titles if you don't have titles
there's no I wouldn't say that there's a

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:26.220
there's no I wouldn't say that there's a
 

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.420
there's no I wouldn't say that there's a
an exact kind of perfect way to do this

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:29.430
an exact kind of perfect way to do this
 

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.570
an exact kind of perfect way to do this
or a perfect kind of recommendation it's

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:32.580
or a perfect kind of recommendation it's
 

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.690
or a perfect kind of recommendation it's
really up to you but also at a high

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:35.700
really up to you but also at a high
 

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.880
really up to you but also at a high
level that I mean the the design of ice

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:37.890
level that I mean the the design of ice
 

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:41.210
level that I mean the the design of ice
cream sandwich the FC I guess from from

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220
cream sandwich the FC I guess from from
 

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.650
cream sandwich the FC I guess from from
honeycomb and later this kind of

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:42.660
honeycomb and later this kind of
 

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:45.890
honeycomb and later this kind of
holographic you I some of the core

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:45.900
holographic you I some of the core
 

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.750
holographic you I some of the core
principles are around topography and

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760
principles are around topography and
 

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.960
principles are around topography and
spacing and minimizing line so I mean

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:50.970
spacing and minimizing line so I mean
 

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:52.260
spacing and minimizing line so I mean
partly there

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:52.270
partly there
 

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:55.380
partly there
kind of easy answer to this but you can

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:55.390
kind of easy answer to this but you can
 

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:57.300
kind of easy answer to this but you can
probably achieve what you're trying to

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:57.310
probably achieve what you're trying to
 

00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.330
probably achieve what you're trying to
do using spacing basically you know

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:00.340
do using spacing basically you know
 

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.310
do using spacing basically you know
increasing the spacing between two of

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320
increasing the spacing between two of
 

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.740
increasing the spacing between two of
your zones or three zones to indicate

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:04.750
your zones or three zones to indicate
 

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:06.530
your zones or three zones to indicate
that these are actually proof controls

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:06.540
that these are actually proof controls
 

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.940
that these are actually proof controls
well the other thing you can do to if

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:08.950
well the other thing you can do to if
 

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:10.410
well the other thing you can do to if
you can't do spacing is actually make

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:10.420
you can't do spacing is actually make
 

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.500
you can't do spacing is actually make
them just visually different right so

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:13.510
them just visually different right so
 

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.360
them just visually different right so
you know if you can like put a picture

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:15.370
you know if you can like put a picture
 

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:16.800
you know if you can like put a picture
behind one if that makes sense in your

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:16.810
behind one if that makes sense in your
 

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:19.320
behind one if that makes sense in your
app right you know things actually make

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:19.330
app right you know things actually make
 

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:21.090
app right you know things actually make
them just visually distinct from each

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:21.100
them just visually distinct from each
 

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.440
them just visually distinct from each
other and you know create a grouping

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:22.450
other and you know create a grouping
 

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.720
other and you know create a grouping
that way yeah absolutely so I mean it

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:24.730
that way yeah absolutely so I mean it
 

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.360
that way yeah absolutely so I mean it
there's no basically two to simplify the

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:27.370
there's no basically two to simplify the
 

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:30.330
there's no basically two to simplify the
answer here there's no easy answer but I

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:30.340
answer here there's no easy answer but I
 

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.980
answer here there's no easy answer but I
would look to some of the built-in apps

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:31.990
would look to some of the built-in apps
 

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:34.290
would look to some of the built-in apps
like the People app to see how you can

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:34.300
like the People app to see how you can
 

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.040
like the People app to see how you can
do that and yeah that's that's probably

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:38.050
do that and yeah that's that's probably
 

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:39.570
do that and yeah that's that's probably
the best we can say on them yeah I mean

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:39.580
the best we can say on them yeah I mean
 

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.540
the best we can say on them yeah I mean
I was kind of looking at two approaches

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:41.550
I was kind of looking at two approaches
 

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:44.730
I was kind of looking at two approaches
one was the list view with the section

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:44.740
one was the list view with the section
 

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.290
one was the list view with the section
dividers I think there's like a

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:46.300
dividers I think there's like a
 

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.360
dividers I think there's like a
screenshot on the Android design page

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:48.370
screenshot on the Android design page
 

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:51.510
screenshot on the Android design page
right of course is the link and that

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520
right of course is the link and that
 

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.300
right of course is the link and that
looks like really good on on Ice Cream

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:54.310
looks like really good on on Ice Cream
 

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:55.920
looks like really good on on Ice Cream
Sandwich I think I can do something with

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:55.930
Sandwich I think I can do something with
 

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:58.650
Sandwich I think I can do something with
that because even on iOS it's basically

00:39:58.650 --> 00:39:58.660
that because even on iOS it's basically
 

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.260
that because even on iOS it's basically
a list view without titles I mean I can

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:01.270
a list view without titles I mean I can
 

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:02.760
a list view without titles I mean I can
put titles on there on the Android

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:02.770
put titles on there on the Android
 

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:04.290
put titles on there on the Android
version that's not that's not really an

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:04.300
version that's not that's not really an
 

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.450
version that's not that's not really an
issue so that was one option and in

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:06.460
issue so that was one option and in
 

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.100
issue so that was one option and in
other option i was looking at is that

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:08.110
other option i was looking at is that
 

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:10.320
other option i was looking at is that
there's like this third-party library

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:10.330
there's like this third-party library
 

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:14.250
there's like this third-party library
that simulates the iOS table view on

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:14.260
that simulates the iOS table view on
 

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.590
that simulates the iOS table view on
android so I would advise against doing

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:16.600
android so I would advise against doing
 

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.870
android so I would advise against doing
that I definitely was about to say it's

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880
that I definitely was about to say it's
 

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.300
that I definitely was about to say it's
not the same thing as I must talk um but

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:21.310
not the same thing as I must talk um but
 

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:22.920
not the same thing as I must talk um but
yeah every time I seen have to do that

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:22.930
yeah every time I seen have to do that
 

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:24.690
yeah every time I seen have to do that
because I have seen a number of apps do

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:24.700
because I have seen a number of apps do
 

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.180
because I have seen a number of apps do
exactly that yeah and it's really

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:27.190
exactly that yeah and it's really
 

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:28.950
exactly that yeah and it's really
obvious that it's not an Android app it

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960
obvious that it's not an Android app it
 

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.110
obvious that it's not an Android app it
just it stands out it looks it looks

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:31.120
just it stands out it looks it looks
 

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.420
just it stands out it looks it looks
wrong we are not nothing against that

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:33.430
wrong we are not nothing against that
 

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:37.110
wrong we are not nothing against that
that particular you I paradigm but it's

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:37.120
that particular you I paradigm but it's
 

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.730
that particular you I paradigm but it's
just this out of place on Android right

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:38.740
just this out of place on Android right
 

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.620
just this out of place on Android right
there pleasers have come to expect yeah

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:40.630
there pleasers have come to expect yeah
 

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:43.560
there pleasers have come to expect yeah
in particular the kind of heavily

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:43.570
in particular the kind of heavily

in particular the kind of heavily
rounded corners anytime you see heavily

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:45.370
rounded corners anytime you see heavily
 

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:47.550
rounded corners anytime you see heavily
rounded corners on Android it just just

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:47.560
rounded corners on Android it just just
 

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.250
rounded corners on Android it just just
feels kind of out of place now even with

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:50.260
feels kind of out of place now even with
 

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.140
feels kind of out of place now even with
previous but even with Gingerbread we

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:52.150
previous but even with Gingerbread we
 

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:54.190
previous but even with Gingerbread we
really toned down

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200
really toned down
 

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.510
really toned down
things like that to make it seem a

and like I said it looks pretty good on
 

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.570

Ice Cream Sandwich but I'm a bit worried

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:08.580
Ice Cream Sandwich but I'm a bit worried
 

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.870
Ice Cream Sandwich but I'm a bit worried
that it will not look all that great

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880
that it will not look all that great
 

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.690
that it will not look all that great

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:35.780
Android look and feel but there needs to
be some kind of company branding so it

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:35.790
be some kind of company branding so it
 

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:38.090

is it possible to style the list view
 

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:43.340
is it possible to style the list view
across different android versions so

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:43.350
across different android versions so
 

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:46.910
across different android versions so
that it looks the same and you can

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920
that it looks the same and you can
 

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.530
that it looks the same and you can
totally do that it takes a bit more work

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:48.540
totally do that it takes a bit more work
 

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.000
totally do that it takes a bit more work
but you can customize the way the

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:50.010
but you can customize the way the
 

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.490
but you can customize the way the
ListView works and that that's actually

what I was about to recommend is take a
 

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.900
what I was about to recommend is take a
look and see if you can go in either

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:56.910
look and see if you can go in either
 

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:59.090

then it might look at a place yes there
 

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:19.790
then it might look at a place yes there
certainly there's certainly parts of the

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800
certainly there's certainly parts of the

for example like i'd say like textview

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680
for example like i'd say like textview
 

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.490
for example like i'd say like textview
styling so an edit text box that have

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:28.500
styling so an edit text box that have
 

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:31.580
styling so an edit text box that have
that lets you you know edit text on ICS

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:31.590
that lets you you know edit text on ICS
 

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:33.320
that lets you you know edit text on ICS
and honeycomb that's a very very

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:33.330
and honeycomb that's a very very
 

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:37.130
and honeycomb that's a very very
distinct style and and it it's probably

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:37.140
distinct style and and it it's probably
 

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.680
distinct style and and it it's probably
okay you know to take that style and

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:39.690
okay you know to take that style and
 

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:41.420
okay you know to take that style and
bring it to gingerbread android devices

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:41.430
bring it to gingerbread android devices
 

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.550
bring it to gingerbread android devices
people will still get it people also

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:43.560
people will still get it people also
 

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.140
people will still get it people also
understand it may look a little

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:45.150
understand it may look a little
 

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.480
understand it may look a little
different but people will understand it

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:47.490
different but people will understand it
 

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:50.120
different but people will understand it
also make sense yeah if the question

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:50.130
also make sense yeah if the question
 

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:52.580
also make sense yeah if the question
between using an iOS look and feel and

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:52.590
between using an iOS look and feel and
 

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:53.930
between using an iOS look and feel and
using a hollow look and feel on a

using a hollow look and feel on a
 

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:56.420
using a hollow look and feel on a
priehala device I'd go with the hollow

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:56.430
priehala device I'd go with the hollow
 

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:57.190
priehala device I'd go with the hollow
option

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200
option
 

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.350
option
yes yeah I know but the thing is like

00:42:59.350 --> 00:42:59.360
yes yeah I know but the thing is like
 

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.720
yes yeah I know but the thing is like
for things like the the list separator

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:01.730
for things like the the list separator

looking which it yeah it's not something

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:09.140
looking which it yeah it's not something
 

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.290

that's going to really confuse anybody I

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:11.300
that's going to really confuse anybody I
 

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.270
that's going to really confuse anybody I
mean obviously you have to make sure

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280
mean obviously you have to make sure
 

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.310

which is why usually we see game

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:46.140
which is why usually we see game
 

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.210

developers go and do things like

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220
developers go and do things like
 

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.670
developers go and do things like
implement custom buttons that use

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680

particular to the game I think that's
 

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.690

there yeah I'm so for instance it like a

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:26.700
there yeah I'm so for instance it like a
 

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.250
there yeah I'm so for instance it like a

like that I guess the main the important
 

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:35.000

at least at a high level of how they
 

00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:58.280
at least at a high level of how they
they should be designed and I think this

says a very good question so work as an
UP button is an interesting question

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:34.710
UP button is an interesting question
 

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:37.010
UP button is an interesting question
because the app itself is in charge of

00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.020
because the app itself is in charge of
 

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:38.930
because the app itself is in charge of
implementing the UP button right so if

00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:38.940
implementing the UP button right so if
 

00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:42.290
implementing the UP button right so if

you say go up or something you can

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:47.670
you say go up or something you can
 

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.400
you say go up or something you can
certainly create another affordance

00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:49.410
certainly create another affordance
 

00:56:49.410 --> 00:56:51.650
certainly create another affordance
somewhere in your UI that also calls go

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:51.660
somewhere in your UI that also calls go
 

00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:53.330

up right yeah so whatever your rating

00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:53.340

that up button to do you could just make

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:55.530
that up button to do you could just make
 

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:56.660
that up button to do you could just make
another bun that just the same thing

00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:56.670
another bun that just the same thing
 

00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:59.000
another bun that just the same thing
yeah I mean not that you should do that

00:56:59.000 --> 00:56:59.010
yeah I mean not that you should do that
 

00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:00.800
yeah I mean not that you should do that
because really up is up and you should

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:00.810
because really up is up and you should
 

00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:02.990
because really up is up and you should

have a single in general you want a
single affordance to do you know a

00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:04.470
single affordance to do you know a
 

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:06.830
single affordance to do you know a
single action but I mean if you're

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:06.840
single action but I mean if you're
 

00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:08.150
single action but I mean if you're
trying to create something like your own

00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160
trying to create something like your own
 

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.430

to just use the action bar but if you

00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:11.940
to just use the action bar but if you
 

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:13.580

need to create your own up button really

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:13.590
need to create your own up button really
 

00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:15.770
