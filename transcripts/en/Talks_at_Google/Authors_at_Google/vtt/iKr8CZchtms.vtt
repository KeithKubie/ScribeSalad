[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.538 --> 00:00:08.342
CHRIS HAYES: Hey, everybody.

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.050
TORRENCE BOONE: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.030
I'm Torrence Boone.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.580
I'm a VP in the global
business organization

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.460
looking after our global
business with advertising

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.560
agencies.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.800
And I also lead our global
brand services team.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.780
Thank you all for coming out.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.620
I have the distinct
pleasure and privilege

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.080
of introducing Chris Hayes.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.860
In many ways, he doesn't
need an introduction.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.240
But he is the Emmy award
winning host of "All In

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.420
with Chris Hayes" on MSNBC.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.460
He is a "New York
Times" bestselling

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.780
author of "Twilight
of the Elites"

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.310
and an editor-at-large
at "The Nation."

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.790
His newest book is "A
colony In a Nation."

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.530
And that's what we're
going to spend time

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.720
talking about this afternoon.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.340
So Chris, why don't we just
start with your inspiration.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.909
What inspired you to write
this incredibly important book?

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.700
CHRIS HAYES: I think
there were two things.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.040
One was the time I spent
in Ferguson, where,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.750
after Michael Brown's
death in 2014,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.040
I was reporting from there.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.710
And I'm a city kid.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.250
I grew up here in New York
City in the Bronx in the 1980s.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.630
And the idea of tensions
with police and all of that

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.010
was not foreign to me.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.890
But I think there's a weird kind
of provincialism when you're

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.190
from New York, where you think
everything is just a New York

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.745
thing.

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:32.870
TORRENCE BOONE: The bubble.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.250
CHRIS HAYES: Yeah.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.680
So what was mind-blowing to
me about Ferguson was here

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.520
was this heretofore anonymous
hamlet, 20,000 people,

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.800
municipality that
is largely known

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.800
for being in between places,
or people are coming and going

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.180
in the St. Louis metro area,
in which there was essentially

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.490
a kind of predatory police state
that was systematically preying

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.650
on its citizens, a majority
black municipality in which 53

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.590
of the 55 officers in the
police department were white,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.080
in which all but one
council member was white,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.750
in which the mayor was white,
the city manager was white.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.240
And every single person
there that I talked to,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.990
every person of color
that I put a microphone to

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.920
or my tape recorder
or my notepad,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.492
could tell a story about
harassment and predation,

00:02:20.492 --> 00:02:21.950
everything from a
state senator who

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.050
told the story about
being at a fair when

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.390
she was 16 with a fire
truck that you could go in.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.326
And the firefighter invited
her to go in, and going in,

00:02:30.326 --> 00:02:31.700
and next thing
she knows, there's

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.680
a cop with a gun
drawn on her, saying,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.815
get the fuck out of there.

00:02:34.815 --> 00:02:35.540
Can I say that?

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.849
Is that--

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.390
TORRENCE BOONE: This
is being edited.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.030
CHRIS HAYES: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.240
I like to take advantage
when I'm not on air,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.595
scream the profane inclinations.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.200
And I had this thought
as I was in Ferguson

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.420
of just the degree to
which law enforcement there

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.250
felt like an occupying
force from another entity,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.600
that the basic--

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.890
and I mean this in a kind of
almost phenomenological sense.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.690
I mean it in a kind
of subjective sense,

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.320
that the sensation of
democratic accountability

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.640
was completely absent.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.004
It was obviously
ostensibly democratic.

00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:18.170
There's voting, and there's
elected representatives.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.980
But it felt, to me observing
it, and to the people

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.640
that I was talking to,
like an occupying force,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.924
occupied territory.

00:03:26.924 --> 00:03:28.340
And I was thinking
about that when

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.100
I started to think about
writing a book because I was

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.640
in Baltimore in the wake
of Freddie Gray's death

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.350
and came upon Richard Nixon's
1968 convention speech

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.216
in Miami, which is an
interesting speech.

00:03:42.216 --> 00:03:44.090
It's sort of his famous
law and order speech.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.260
It's given, of course, in one of
the most violent and tumultuous

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.070
years in American history,
basically after the Civil War,

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.654
I would say.

00:03:53.654 --> 00:03:55.070
Martin Luther
King's assassinated.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.170
RFK is assassinated.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.982
Riots, protests, et cetera.

00:03:58.982 --> 00:04:00.440
And he gives this
big law and order

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.410
speech where he basically makes
an argument to restore order.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.870
He says, tonight is
time for some frank talk

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.390
about the problem of order
in the United States.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.459
And there's a throwaway
line in there where he says,

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.500
black Americans want the
same as white Americans.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.990
They don't want to
just have handouts.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.842
They don't want to be
a colony in a nation.

00:04:20.842 --> 00:04:22.550
And there was something
about that phrase

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.280
that seemed both sort of
profound and elemental

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.600
to me precisely because
our inheritance is

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.650
as a former colony that became a
nation and the degree to which,

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.140
when I sort of connected
back to that experience

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.440
that I'd seen firsthand in
Ferguson and in Baltimore,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.070
of a kind of
colonial experience,

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.490
that it sort of
locked into my head

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.430
that we'd sort of created these
two different regimes, which

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.730
is not at all in any
way a novel insight.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.580
And in fact, there's a
lot of, frankly, books

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.800
better than mine on the topic
that I would urge you to read

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.910
and are cited.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.240
But then the question
for me became why?

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.650
What is the origin?

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.020
Why did we democratically
produce this?

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.322
And that's in some ways the
kind of project of the book.

00:05:16.322 --> 00:05:18.780
TORRENCE BOONE: So one of the
really interesting dimensions

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.180
of the book is your linkage
of the early American

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.310
colonialists' set of
motivations to the condition

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.880
of black and brown
people in urban America.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.270
Take us back because there's
some interesting parallels.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.550
There's the little-known
fact of John Hancock

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.929
as a bit of a criminal.

00:05:39.929 --> 00:05:41.220
CHRIS HAYES: He was a smuggler.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.136
TORRENCE BOONE: Right.

00:05:42.136 --> 00:05:44.042
So talk so that linkage.

00:05:44.042 --> 00:05:46.500
CHRIS HAYES: So we all learned
that the American Revolution

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.660
was about taxation, right?

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.840
No taxation without
representation.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.140
And at some level, it was.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.930
But taxation is a
really misleading term

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.757
because we all think of
taxes in the modern sense

00:05:57.757 --> 00:05:59.340
of the bureaucratic
state, in which we

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.540
have payroll taxes deducted.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.110
And we file our taxes
in April 15, et cetera.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.570
All taxes at that
time are essentially

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.310
controlled through tariffs.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.430
And Britain, of course, at this
time is a mercantilist empire.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.810
And the basic kind of
framework for mercantilism,

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.760
precisely the subject of
the critique of Adam Smith's

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.310
"Wealth of Nations,"
published in 1776,

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.280
is that essentially, you
conquer other territories.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.920
And you regulate the
exchange of trade.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.240
And you take a
cut of everything.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.370
And that's how you
fund the government.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.710
And so what this meant
was the colonies,

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.310
it was actually
illegal, essentially,

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.130
to import things from
non-British colonies

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.890
or non-British territory.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.480
And what this meant
was that it was

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.150
an unbelievable black market.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.600
Molasses was largely coming
from French and Dutch colonies.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.820
And molasses was
necessary to make rum.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.360
And the colonies were probably
the world's biggest rum

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.920
producer per capita.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.490
That's, like, the one thing
the colonies made, was rum.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.672
And that rum was actually
central to the slave

00:07:04.672 --> 00:07:05.880
trade and the triangle trade.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.790
The rum was actually, because
it could be stored in barrels

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.370
and could be traded in
the Gold Coast of Africa,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.490
was actually used
to pay for slaves.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.580
That rum was essential to
the entire economic lifeblood

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.577
of the colonies.

00:07:18.577 --> 00:07:20.160
And it was essentially
being built off

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.690
the back of an illegal import.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.880
And so what that
meant was smuggling

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.180
was absolutely essential to
the economy of the colonies

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.220
at the time, not that
different from the way

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.950
that black market economies,
gray market economies, drug

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.280
economies become
essential to neighborhoods

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:41.130
that are outside the bounds of
legitimate and legal markets.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.350
John Hancock was a big smuggler.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.780
The smugglers basically
ran the town of Newport.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.030
They ran much of Boston.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:53.385
And the thing that happens
is that after the French

00:07:53.385 --> 00:07:57.420
and Indian War, the British find
themselves with a huge deficit.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.794
And they decide they're going to
recoup the deficit by beginning

00:08:00.794 --> 00:08:03.210
to enforce all the smuggling
laws that they've essentially

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.272
been ignoring.

00:08:06.272 --> 00:08:07.980
So for all those years,
there's this sort

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.360
of wink and nod approach.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.250
There's barely enough
customs officers.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.477
The customs officers basically
never bring any cases.

00:08:13.477 --> 00:08:15.060
The smugglers go
about their business.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.460
Everyone knows what's happening,
but looks the other way.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.490
And then a crackdown.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:22.626
And the crackdown is
a policing crackdown.

00:08:22.626 --> 00:08:24.000
It is a law
enforcement crackdown

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.190
because the means by
which taxes are collected

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.010
are through customs agents.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.010
It's not accountants.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.090
It's not bureaucrats.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.185
It's actual boats being
pulled over and searched.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.372
Customs enforcement ramps up.

00:08:37.372 --> 00:08:39.580
And they begin what I call
in the book the first stop

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.860
and frisk era.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.160
Ships are being pulled over in
ports, customs agents crawling

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.960
all over these businesses.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.450
And it makes the
colonists furious.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.730
Benjamin Franklin
writes about how insane

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.880
it is to use the Navy to start
searching your own citizens

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.040
and militarizing the police.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.320
There's a famous case
in a courtroom in Boston

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.920
in which lawyers
defend smugglers who

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.160
have been illegally searched.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.590
And John Adams later
in his life would say,

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.170
everyone who watched
that argument in court,

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.470
there and then was a spark
of independence born.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.300
In the Declaration
of Independence,

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.270
Thomas Jefferson
writes in his bill

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:21.050
of particulars about the
king that one of his offenses

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.360
is that he has sent
hither swarms of officers

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.220
to harass our people and
eat out their substance.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.010
He has sent hither swarms of
officers to harass our people

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.030
and eat our substance.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:39.080
That is Jefferson saying, fuck
the police, quite literally.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.740
And officers means officers,
means law enforcement.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.680
And so you have this sort
of remarkable situation

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.130
in which the actual point of
contact, the real sort of spark

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.820
to the flame of the revolution
is a law enforcement problem.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.040
It is stop and frisk.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.940
It is harassment.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.930
It is the feeling of
humiliation that the colonists

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.670
feel at the hands
of law enforcement.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.400
That is the thing that
really gets people amped up.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.500
And it's something that--

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.980
it's our inheritance as a
nation at some level, right?

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.960
The idea that we would
just sit and take it

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.200
while an officer
searches us unlawfully

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.420
was, in almost a
literal sense, what

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.244
we fought the Revolution over.

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:21.410
TORRENCE BOONE: We're gonna
come back to revolution.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:28.020
But connect that to Ferguson
and traffic citations

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.520
and the kind of exploitation
that is parallel,

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.770
but in a contemporary context.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.436
CHRIS HAYES: So one
of the things that's

00:10:34.436 --> 00:10:37.154
so insane about Ferguson and the
way Ferguson operated-- and I

00:10:37.154 --> 00:10:38.570
think it's actually
quite distinct

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.420
from, say, New York, which has
its own policing problems--

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.080
is that in an almost direct
parallel to the customs

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.840
agents and colonial enforcement,
Ferguson law enforcement

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.290
functioned primarily as a
revenue-generating operation.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.270
And this is not
my determination.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.520
It's the determination of
the United States Department

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.730
of Justice, which issued an
unbelievable scathing and

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.170
eye-opening patterns
and practices

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.170
report about the police
department in Ferguson,

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.360
in which they said that,
essentially, revenue

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.210
generation was the
primary objective rather

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:09.020
than public safety.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.603
And there are all
these insane emails.

00:11:10.603 --> 00:11:12.920
Like, the city manager
being like, well,

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.140
have you staffed up
the revenue pipeline

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.185
on this stretch of road?

00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:17.060
And they're like, no.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.976
We're going to get some
more people over there

00:11:18.976 --> 00:11:21.770
so we can prime the pump and
get some more money flowing in.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.930
So rather than raise
property taxes,

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.720
rather than raise taxes, which
is politically difficult,

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.270
the police department in
Ferguson essentially operated

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:33.890
as a means of extracting revenue
and preying upon the mostly

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.100
black residents of the
city and constructed

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.190
all sorts of increasingly
insane, enraging, and Byzantine

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.300
means of doing this, including
municipal court summons.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.550
You get a ticket for $100.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.980
And then you get a
summons to go to court.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.020
But they did this
really crafty thing

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.180
where court would be
open for three hours

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.430
on a Monday and a Wednesday.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.940
And that's it during the week.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.250
And then all the people
with a summons have to go.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.410
Keep in mind, they're
issuing every year

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:05.260
about two traffic citations
per resident of the town.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.377
OK?

00:12:06.377 --> 00:12:08.710
Now, in fairness, there's a
lot of people going through.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:09.910
But you get the idea.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.910
So then you go
with your summons.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.190
You'd have to take
a half day off work.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.240
And oh, you know what?

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.110
The line's too long.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.040
You didn't get in.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.930
You're now in contempt.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.985
They really did this.

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:24.110
And now you're in contempt.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.550
Now you've got a warrant.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.740
So the next time you
get a traffic ticket,

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.090
you get pulled over.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.450
Oh, there's a warrant.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:34.790
Now you're in cuffs
because you're in contempt.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.280
There is a story of
a woman who ended up

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.210
doing three nights in
jail and paying about $600

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:45.014
for an initial $50 traffic
ticket and still owed $500.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:46.430
Because the other
thing they would

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.130
do is sort of attach these
kind of payday lending interest

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:53.300
rates on the fines.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.140
So you couldn't
come up with $150,

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:01.800
or you couldn't get to
court in time to pay it,

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.760
then there would be this massive
penalty fees and late fees.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:12.790
And so they constructed this
incredibly crude, avaricious,

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.640
Rube Goldberg machine
of revenue extraction

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.310
that was entirely
dependent upon the citizens

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:21.040
that, ostensibly, they
were there to protect,

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.590
but who were, essentially,
moving targets

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.170
for this project of
revenue extraction.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.390
And again, to go back
to the colonists,

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.100
this was what the
colonists fought.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.500
To use law enforcement as a
tool of revenue extraction

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.310
is a perversion
of, I think, what

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.610
our sort of communal
intuitions are about what

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.450
we want police to do, right?

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.790
It's keep us safe.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.810
And so it was really
striking to me

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.240
just how perverse Ferguson
was and how directly

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.410
it connected to the kind
of initial conditions

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:55.554
of the colony.

00:13:55.554 --> 00:13:57.470
TORRENCE BOONE: And
obviously, that experience

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.550
of the residents in Ferguson,
the exploitation that you just

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.390
described, was a
key underpinning

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.690
to the response
to Michael Brown.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:12.110
So take us back to that time
where you were covering.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.460
What was it like?

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.430
You spend a lot of time in the
book talking about white fear.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:22.130
And you bring a number of images
of the streets of Ferguson

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:22.870
during that time.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.200
So dimensionalize that for us.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:24.950
CHRIS HAYES: Yeah.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:29.360
I think you could see there
was a tremendous amount of rage

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.950
and humiliation in Ferguson.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.780
But on the other side
of it was this kind

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.110
of terrified
white-knuckle white fear

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.309
that things were going
to get out of control.

00:14:38.309 --> 00:14:40.350
And I'll never forget this
one press conferences.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.780
This was after the--

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.600
Michael Brown was shot
and killed on, I believe,

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.380
a Saturday night.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:52.070
The sort of quick [INAUDIBLE] is
burned in unrest the next night

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.577
on Sunday.

00:14:53.577 --> 00:14:55.160
And then there's
huge police presence,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.050
famously huge, militarized
police presence

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.840
for a small number of protesters
on Monday and Tuesday night.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.260
And the Tuesday night, I think,
was when the reporters were

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.480
arrested in the McDonald's.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.460
There's crazy footage
of tear gas being

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.620
fired into people's front
yard, tear gas being

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.199
fired at an Al Jazeera camera.

00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:12.740
And finally, Jay
Nixon, the governor,

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.850
has a press conference
the next day.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:14.720
And it's crazy.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.980
We're at this press
conference, and there's

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:16.938
two kinds of reporters.

00:15:16.938 --> 00:15:18.650
There's local reporters,
and then there's

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.550
national, international
reporters.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.258
And the national,
international reporters

00:15:22.258 --> 00:15:26.180
are all being like, why do
you have SWAT teams aiming

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.090
long guns at four
dozen protesters

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.740
in the middle of the street?

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.540
And the local
press is all, like,

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.710
are you just going
to let everyone riot?

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.790
Just gonna hand over
the streets to 'em?

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:45.260
And I remember being like, we
are seeing this differently.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.130
And I don't want to disparage
the local press there,

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.787
who by and large did a
great job covering it.

00:15:50.787 --> 00:15:52.120
And we were in from out of town.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.644
And I don't want to sort of
pull rank on them in any way

00:15:56.644 --> 00:15:58.810
because it was their story,
and they did a great job

00:15:58.810 --> 00:15:59.351
reporting it.

00:15:59.351 --> 00:16:00.580
So just to make that clear.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.390
But what I think was happening
was there were concerns

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.250
of a lot of the local
audience there--

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:10.090
and I think particularly
white metro St. Louis--

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:12.850
that was primarily concerned
with things getting out

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.430
of hand.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.527
And I recognized that concern
for things getting out

00:16:17.527 --> 00:16:19.860
of hand because I have a
concern with things getting out

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.250
of hand.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.600
And I grew up in New York
City in the '80s and '90s,

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.450
and this deep, kind
of neurotic fear

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:35.300
of disorder, of broken windows,
of chaos, of unruliness,

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:35.960
I have that.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.690
I was sort of raised with it.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.865
I think there's parts of
it that are universal.

00:16:40.865 --> 00:16:46.022
I don't think anyone loves
huge amounts of unrest.

00:16:46.022 --> 00:16:47.480
But there's also
parts of it that I

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.230
think are very specific
to a particularized kind

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:55.610
of white fear, a fear
that the social order will

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.280
be overturned.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.980
And I think that,
in particular, is

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.670
one of the sort of strands
of the nation's cultural DNA

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.190
that goes all the way
back to the first moment

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.730
the first ship
lands at Jamestown,

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.119
when the captain writes
in his first diary entry,

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:16.940
we were set upon by the savages.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.770
The first moment.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:24.050
And it extends through the
settling and the frontier

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:28.430
and the fear that stalks the
nightmares of the slavers,

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:32.980
that they will be caught in a
rebellion, which, by the way,

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.090
was incredibly prescient fear.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.710
I didn't quite
realize the degree

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:42.685
to which a huge amount of
Southern newspapers that

00:17:42.685 --> 00:17:44.310
were read by the
planter class are just

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.570
accounts of rebellions.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:51.150
This constant kind of,
like, if you're not careful,

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.030
they're coming for you.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.170
And we as a society--

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:59.090
I particularly think white
Americans are real inheritors

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:00.380
of that tradition.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:04.566
And I could feel
the ambient anxiety,

00:18:04.566 --> 00:18:07.190
and particularly when I would go
to the other parts of Ferguson

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:08.450
and talk to the
folks that were sort

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.908
of on the other side of the
protests, which were people who

00:18:10.908 --> 00:18:13.610
were putting out
I-heart-Ferguson lawn signs,

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:16.850
where there was this impromptu
kind of counterprotest that

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.450
had been organized by a
former mayor in a coffee shop.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:21.200
And people were giving
out the yard signs.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.680
And it's a very different
demographic there.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:31.070
It was almost entirely
white, where people were,

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:32.900
this is a good place,
and we need order.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.150
And it's terrible what
happened to that young man,

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:39.080
but we need order.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.255
TORRENCE BOONE: So
if we take white fear

00:18:41.255 --> 00:18:44.090
as a point of
departure, link that

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:50.050
to our gun policies, the
criminal justice system.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.120
You spend a lot of time
talking about how those two

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.780
forces really drive a lot of the
dysfunction that we experience.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.530
CHRIS HAYES: Yeah.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:03.140
So I think that the fear sort
of moves in different directions

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.980
and takes different
objects and is the source

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.920
of the incredibly
punitive criminal justice

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:16.000
system that we've erected, the
largest carceral state that's

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.120
ever been built--

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.500
5% of the world's population,
25% of its prison population.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.110
One out of every four prisoners
in the world is an American,

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.026
which maybe you know
that and maybe you don't.

00:19:26.026 --> 00:19:28.400
But I always try to
picture that in my head.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.090
There's got to be a lot of
prisons in India and China,

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.720
right?

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.511
Don't you guys have
that interview question

00:19:34.511 --> 00:19:36.589
about how many piano
tuners in New York?

00:19:36.589 --> 00:19:37.380
Isn't that a thing?

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.360
Am I right about that?

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.980
Am I recalling that correctly?

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.604
Or was that a myth?

00:19:41.604 --> 00:19:42.520
Yeah, that was a myth.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.560
TORRENCE BOONE: That's
for the engineers.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:44.240
CHRIS HAYES: Oh, OK.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:44.740
Yeah.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.520
All Right.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.960
Just trying to think
about, picture that--

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.960
there's a lot of
prisons in the world.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.200
It's a big world.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.130
And one out of every
four is an American.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:01.180
So in the construction of that,
and particularly in the 1960s,

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.620
its sort of law
and order moment,

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.310
which I write about in the
book, is a particularized way

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:11.020
in a particular historical
context amidst these twin

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.650
phenomena of-- well,
three phenomenon--

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.460
backlash to the civil
rights movement,

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.070
actual rising crime in a--

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.212
incredibly steeply rising crime.

00:20:20.212 --> 00:20:22.420
Country's getting much, much
more dangerous much more

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.090
quickly.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.800
And also, sort of
social disorder--

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:33.810
protests, things like that,
that we sort of attach ourselves

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.200
to this politics
of law and order.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.300
In terms of the
role that guns play,

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.100
the gun has always
been central here.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.090
I mean, to go back to
the Jamestown experience,

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:51.480
it's like, how did
they win that one?

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.416
And the gun is the answer.

00:20:54.416 --> 00:20:55.290
How was the West won?

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.600
The West was won with guns.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:03.630
How was the sheer
numerical force

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.860
of slaves on the
plantation kept subdued?

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.700
Through torture, psychological
torture, repeated violence,

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.330
and the gun.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.190
So the gun is
central at one level

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:19.450
because the gun is the central
implement that is constantly

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:23.530
attached to the
project of conquering

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.380
and of civilizing,
of maintaining order.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.590
And at the same time,
the gun is also this sort

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.670
of looming specter for police.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.460
So think about the
difference between policing

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:41.780
a country like Japan and
policing Los Angeles.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.060
So you show up to a domestic
disturbance in Japan.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.640
People argue in Japan, right?

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.850
They're people.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:49.350
Just

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.780
TORRENCE BOONE: Just softly.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.696
CHRIS HAYES: And people
get mad at each other.

00:21:51.696 --> 00:21:53.190
And someone's mad
at someone else.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:54.770
And you show up.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:56.660
And you got to try
to sort it out.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.760
And maybe someone's
violating some municipal code

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:00.731
or legal provision.

00:22:00.731 --> 00:22:02.480
Or maybe there's
actually been an incident

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.354
of domestic violence.

00:22:03.354 --> 00:22:06.110
But it's just not going to
happen that someone's gonna

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.490
pull out a gun and shoot you.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.640
Statistically, that's
just not gonna happen.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.579
In the US, it could.

00:22:14.579 --> 00:22:17.120
There's one gun for every man,
woman, and child in the United

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.770
States of America.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.450
And the way that
police train is they

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.050
train for that, in some ways
in the way that all workplace

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:27.967
safety training is about
training for the extraordinary.

00:22:27.967 --> 00:22:29.550
If you're working
on an assembly line,

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.799
you can go 20 years without
a huge, terrible accident.

00:22:31.799 --> 00:22:34.320
But when you train, you
train for the accident.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.795
What police train for is
they train for someone

00:22:36.795 --> 00:22:39.170
taking out a gun and shooting
them when they pull someone

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.170
over for a traffic stop.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:41.794
TORRENCE BOONE: And
by the way, there's

00:22:41.794 --> 00:22:43.880
an amazing part of the
book where Chris actually

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.420
goes through a VR experience
as a police trainee.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.170
CHRIS HAYES: Yeah.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.599
They have, sort of, this
300-degree thing, where

00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:52.890
it's this interactive scenario.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:53.580
TORRENCE BOONE: He
didn't do very well.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.746
CHRIS HAYES: I was terrible.

00:22:56.616 --> 00:22:57.740
Which is sort of the point.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.070
It's a little bit
of cop propaganda

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:04.460
because they like bringing
know-it-all pundits

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.290
to walk a mile in our shoes.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.290
And I was like, well, you
just shot nine people.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.330
It was like, oops.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:11.717
Not so easy.

00:23:11.717 --> 00:23:13.550
Like, I pulled my gun
on a guy who was gonna

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:14.675
throw a cinder block at me.

00:23:14.675 --> 00:23:15.784
Like, the first thing.

00:23:15.784 --> 00:23:18.200
And the trainer was like,
should you have pulled your gun?

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.270
I was like, probably not.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.150
Fair point.

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.711
But they have these
virtual-reality training

00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:26.210
sessions.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:29.300
And they're actually the
ones that cops train on.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:37.550
And again, I want to be fair and
honest and sort of empathetic

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.030
here about the
fact that policing

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.290
a country with the
level of gun violence

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:48.410
we have and the ubiquity of guns
really does fundamentally alter

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:49.970
the experience of policing.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.282
And so there's a degree to
which every time we hear,

00:23:53.282 --> 00:23:53.990
went for the gun.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.680
He went for my gun.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.340
He went for a gun.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.715
I thought he was
going for a gun.

00:23:56.715 --> 00:23:59.240
Amadou Diallo was
taking out his wallet

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:04.490
when he was shot and
killed in New York City.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.890
And there's something
maddening, maddening

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:12.450
about that, horrifying,
unjust, but also,

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:17.886
in the psychology of these
cops, I think not crazy.

00:24:17.886 --> 00:24:20.010
TORRENCE BOONE: And we have
a global audience here.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.440
One of the distinctions
that you make as well

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.100
is the difference between
the American criminal justice

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.040
system and the European
criminal justice system

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.030
and how the lack of an
aristocracy in this country

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:36.570
in many ways contributed
to the harsher dynamics

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:37.982
of our criminal justice system.

00:24:37.982 --> 00:24:39.190
Talk a little bit about that.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.940
CHRIS HAYES: Yeah.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:43.724
There's a great book on this
by a Yale professor named

00:24:43.724 --> 00:24:46.140
James Whitman called "Harsh
Justice," which is comparative

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.223
between the US and Europe.

00:24:47.223 --> 00:24:49.410
And the main thrust
of his argument

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.170
is that Europe basically
had twin justice

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.660
systems for commoners
and for aristocrats.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.290
And the aristocratic
system was quite forgiving.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:59.790
And the commoner one was harsh.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:04.350
And the progress of
continental legal traditions

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.200
was to level up the
commoner treatment

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.040
to the aristocratic one.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.880
And you've probably seen
articles or photo essays

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.050
about Danish jails, where
they have two-bedroom suites

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.630
and hot tubs.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:24.180
And it's like a whole genre
of about like how, wow.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:29.187
And in the US, there was
no division, obviously,

00:25:29.187 --> 00:25:31.020
which is not to say
there weren't divisions,

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:36.540
like slaves had a completely
unique set of punishments.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:41.800
But America has this deep
sort of punitive leveling-down

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.272
instinct.

00:25:43.272 --> 00:25:44.980
Obviously, it's the
nation of the stocks,

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:49.330
of the scarlet letter
This is deeply embedded.

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:51.550
But we still have this impulse.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.800
You still see this
impulse, I think, even

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.600
among progressives, people of
the left, social-justice types,

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.630
to level down, that the sort
of way we could get to equality

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:06.640
is to punish more
harshly at the top.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:11.500
And I think sometimes that's
a totally fair impulse.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.840
It's demanded by justice.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:19.464
There's a tremendous amount of
lack of elite accountability.

00:26:19.464 --> 00:26:21.380
I mean, we see it on
display right now in ways

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:25.554
that I find completely
stroke-inducing.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.930
But I also think that
the real tough nut

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:38.210
to crack as a society in
terms of our kind of shared

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.750
socio and political
emotional lives

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:45.260
is finding spaces for
empathy and forgiveness.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.469
And I was just this morning--

00:26:46.469 --> 00:26:47.926
this is my second
event of the day.

00:26:47.926 --> 00:26:49.550
This morning, I
hosted a fundraiser

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:53.630
for an amazing organization
called the Osborne Association

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.240
that works with the currently
incarcerated and the formerly

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:00.770
incarcerated and their
families and their loved ones.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:03.080
And it's an incredible
organization.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.770
I'd urge you all to look
into it and consider

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:08.630
contributing to it.

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.100
But what's so
profound about this

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.490
is that everyone
living around this

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:16.370
is dealing with how to
think about forgiveness

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:23.950
and redemption, including people
who have taken someone's life

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:27.700
and are thinking about how to
do that first for themselves,

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:33.390
to make restitution, to try to
make themselves a whole person,

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.050
but also to reconcile with
the sort of inescapable horror

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:39.570
of what they've done and
the harm they've committed.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.770
And in some strange way,
it's like the conversation

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:48.000
we have about victims
and crime is so removed

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.840
from the amazing emotional
work that those folks, who

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.670
are in the midst of
it, who are dealing

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:58.660
with the perpetrators of genuine
terrible harm, are doing.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.797
And I think one of
the things that we

00:28:00.797 --> 00:28:03.130
take comfort in when we think
about the criminal justice

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.940
system or we say reform is
nonviolent drug offenders.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.560
Right?

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.140
If you let every nonviolent
drug offender out

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.060
of American prisons
today, we would still

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:16.600
be the most incarcerated
country in the world.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.630
OK?

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:23.380
So getting down to Dutch
or Danish or French levels

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:26.110
of incarceration means
letting out violent offenders,

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:28.930
and that means people
who did terrible things--

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:30.970
committed rape,
committed assault,

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.270
committed armed
robbery, shot people.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:38.230
And that means do we need to
keep a 62-year-old in prison

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:42.390
another eight years
who shot someone?

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:43.310
Not innocent.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:44.060
They shot someone.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.530
They did something horrible.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.080
20% of New York prisoners--

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.060
20% of prisoners in New York--

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.110
are over the age of 60.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.450
There are 85-year-olds
on Rikers.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:00.252
Why are we doing that?

00:29:00.252 --> 00:29:01.710
TORRENCE BOONE:
We're going to move

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:05.910
to open Q&amp;A. So if
you guys want to head

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.950
to mics if you have questions.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:10.860
So just staying on that,
because I'm glad you said that.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.470
And it's interesting that you
say that because my question

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:14.880
was around the endgame.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.170
Because in the book, you
quote Frantz Fanon and say,

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:21.480
"colonialism is not
a thinking machine,

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.950
nor a body endowed with
reasoning faculties.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:27.810
It is violence in
its natural state,

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.450
and it will only
yield when confronted

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:32.010
with greater violence."

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:35.040
So my question was, are
we headed to revolution?

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.220
It sounds like you feel that
there is the opportunity

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.630
for reconciliation.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:40.380
CHRIS HAYES: Yeah.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.330
I mean, I'm not--

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:47.370
Fanon was speaking about a
specific context and generally

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:54.210
a revolutionary and
places like Algeria.

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:56.765
I think that the differences
between our situation

00:29:56.765 --> 00:29:58.890
and theirs are sort of more
salient in that respect

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:02.670
than the similarities in
terms of the way forward.

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:07.370
But the streets of
Baltimore felt revolutionary

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.680
after Freddie Gray.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.112
And Ferguson felt revolutionary.

00:30:13.112 --> 00:30:14.320
There's a certain amount of--

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.940
I mean, humiliation is a
particularly potent force

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:23.170
driving human affairs because
the humiliated subject cannot

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:28.060
act on their humiliation as
a definitional truth about

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.480
humiliation.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.800
Being humiliated in the
moment means taking it.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.400
Right?

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.840
The cop calling you a name
when they pull you over.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.860
Got to take that.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:43.772
So humiliation has an
ability to be bottled up,

00:30:43.772 --> 00:30:44.480
and then explode.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:52.960
The Arab Spring started over a
cop harassing a street vendor.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.020
This cop had harassed
this street vendor,

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.410
Mohamed Bouazizi,
time and time again,

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:00.580
who was selling fruit
without a permit.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.540
Eric Garner was selling
cigarettes that were untaxed.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.830
And eventually,
that fruit vendor,

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.680
after being slapped by the
cop one day and yelled at,

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.205
lit himself on fire in Tunisia.

00:31:12.205 --> 00:31:15.410
And that was the start
of the Arab Spring.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:20.570
So there is a kind of
powder keg to the experience

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:25.030
of humiliation
that I worry about.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.790
I also, though, do think
that one of the things that's

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:32.480
been interesting is as
polarizing as Black Lives

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.000
Matter and protests have
been, public opinion

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.440
has moved in their direction
really significantly, actually.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.230
It's interesting.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.320
It shows up in Pew, and
it shows up in Gallup.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:48.190
And this is true
among white Americans.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:52.610
Questions about how often
police mistreat people,

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:56.430
their concern about
whether there's

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:58.830
equal justice in the criminal
justice system, these

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:01.650
have all moved in BLM's
direction in last year.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:05.670
So I think, actually, as brutal
as the backlash has been,

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:08.740
and as much friction
as there is around it,

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.560
it is actually moving public
opinion in the right direction.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.720
It can be hard to
see that at times.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.610
But it is moving in
the right direction.

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:15.484
TORRENCE BOONE: Good.

00:32:15.484 --> 00:32:17.130
Yes, sir.

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.260
AUDIENCE: I have a
semi-serious question

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.320
and a serious question.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.860
My semi-serious-- first of
all, I'm a Bronx guy like you.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.000
So shut out to the Bronx.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.560
But also, I just wanted to
ask about the book cover.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.140
Because for me as
a New York guy,

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:35.340
that cover looks exactly like
the typeface of "The New York

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.579
Daily News," which in my era
was the conservative newspaper.

00:32:39.579 --> 00:32:40.370
CHRIS HAYES: Right.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:41.760
It was the tabloid of the right.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.690
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:44.220
I was just wondering if
that was an accident.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.610
Because just looking at it,
my head started to shake.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:47.850
CHRIS HAYES: No, actually,
I think graphically,

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:52.170
it's actually more inspired
by the "I am a man" signs

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:54.065
from the March on
Washington, which

00:32:54.065 --> 00:32:55.440
if you go back
and look at those,

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.290
it actually sort of looks like.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:57.520
I did not design the cover.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.850
But I wanted something stark.

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:01.830
And I think, actually,
tabloid headlines

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.240
was in my head a little bit.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.024
I wanted something
that was all text.

00:33:05.024 --> 00:33:06.690
AUDIENCE: And the
more serious question,

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:09.409
which I don't think
there's an easy answer to--

00:33:09.409 --> 00:33:10.950
so you did touch on
this a little bit

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:18.030
about the dichotomy
between excessive policing,

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:23.520
but the sort of inchoate feeling
of the general population

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.500
that they want more security.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.050
And so, like you,
growing up in New York--

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:29.050
I'm older than you.

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:32.250
But I remember the '60s
and the '70s in the Bronx.

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:34.564
And even right down the
street here at Chelsea,

00:33:34.564 --> 00:33:35.730
I went to college down here.

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:36.570
And this was--

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:38.430
I say this to younger
Googlers than me,

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.230
and they look at me like I'm
talking about the American

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.830
Civil War.

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:44.312
But in the 1970s, if you
were in this neighborhood

00:33:44.312 --> 00:33:46.020
and you were out past
8 o'clock at night,

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.820
there was probably
a really good chance

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.290
that you were gonna get
mugged or worse down here.

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:54.540
And so after all this research
and thinking about this,

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.970
do you see a place where
that balance exists

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:59.460
between the genuine need
for security and sort

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.100
of overstepping bounds?

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.670
CHRIS HAYES: It's a
really great question.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:06.430
So yeah, I want to
be clear on this,

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:09.090
that what happens
with crime and danger

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.610
in the United States
between 1966 and 1993

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:14.763
isn't some fiction.

00:34:14.763 --> 00:34:17.429
When I started commuting down to
Manhattan from the Bronx, where

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:20.550
I grew up, to go to a magnet
school in the Upper East Side

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.940
in 1992, there was 2,300
murders in New York City.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.739
Last year, there were 350.

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:31.850
I mean, think about if child
poverty dropped by that amount,

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:32.350
right?

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:33.730
Or expanded by that amount.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:37.210
Any sort of social metric that
went up as much as crime did,

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:39.570
and then went down
as much, would

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:42.909
have huge political and
social consequences.

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:44.590
Now, the issue
partly-- and there's

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.381
a chapter in the book
about broken windows.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:50.590
At the core of the
issue is the fact

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:55.000
that crime drops
between '92 and 2014.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.210
And it's one of the great
sociological mysteries

00:34:58.210 --> 00:34:59.710
of our time.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.060
We just don't know.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:02.950
It probably comes
down to a layering

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:04.630
of a variety of factors.

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.300
There's a demographic
component to it.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.730
In the beginning, the
increase in incarceration

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:13.510
probably does part of it, too.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:15.430
If you think of a
thought experiment,

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:20.290
if you took a society, and then
you put every male 18 to 24

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:25.040
in prison, the
crime would go down.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.100
It would.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:30.430
That would obviously be
unjustifiable across any sort

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.230
of moral, political framework.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.610
But as a raw--

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:38.560
and there's neighborhoods
where that basically was done.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.610
So incarceration probably
played some role.

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:46.840
There is the
argument about lead,

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:50.140
that lead played a huge role
in the increase in crime,

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:54.670
and then the unleaded gasoline
and catalytic converters

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:56.126
went down.

00:35:56.126 --> 00:35:58.000
And then there's the
question about policing.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.370
So the reason I'm
laying the groundwork

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:06.670
is because the story, which is
not a crazy story that I think

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:08.200
generations of
politicians, police

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.910
officials, and the
public have learned,

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:14.380
is that the bad old days happen,
and then Bill Bratton came in,

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.710
and they started broken-windows
policing and Rudy Giuliani,

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.480
and that was spread
across the country.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.340
And that caused
the crime decline.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:23.590
And so now you've got this
kind of, it's almost this--

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:26.350
I describe it in the book
as cargo cult thinking.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.616
It's like rain dance.

00:36:28.616 --> 00:36:29.990
There's the cause
and the effect.

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:34.780
So it's like you have to devote
yourself to the crime gods.

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:36.790
Because if you don't,
then the bad old days

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:39.270
are going to come back.

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:43.540
And in some ways,
I understand why

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.790
particularly police
professionals who oversaw

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:47.730
that period think they did it.

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:49.000
i would think I did it, too.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.830
And there's no
question, I think,

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:54.950
that some policing is
better than others.

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:57.790
But I also think we
have to recognize

00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:59.800
that a lot of
nonpolicing factors

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.380
were driving that,
which brings us

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.270
to the great
stop-and-frisk experiment.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:07.627
Because the warning,
when the city settled

00:37:07.627 --> 00:37:10.210
the stop-and-frisk lawsuit, from
people like Ray Kelly and all

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:13.750
sorts of folks was the bad
old days are gonna come back.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:14.590
And they haven't.

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:16.180
So New York City--

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:19.090
and that's an environment in
which a lot of top 25 cities

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:24.070
have seen really worrying
rises in homicide,

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:26.320
seriously upsetting rises--

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:32.380
Chicago, Baltimore, Cleveland,
St. Louis, Milwaukee.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:33.280
New York's gone down.

00:37:35.817 --> 00:37:37.900
But it gets to this really
deep, fundamental point

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.024
because you're seeing the
politics of law and order

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:43.710
in those cities go right back
to the politics of law and order

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:47.290
in the 1970s.

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:48.160
TORRENCE BOONE: Yes.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.493
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
you could talk a little bit

00:37:50.493 --> 00:37:53.300
about the Philadelphia DA
primary that just happened

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.364
and what do you think
the significance of that

00:37:55.364 --> 00:37:57.280
going forward and whether
that's a model for--

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.160
CHRIS HAYES: I'm glad
you brought that up.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.010
I mortifyingly
misspoke this morning

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:01.390
and said it was the election,
not the primary, when

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:02.320
I was speaking at Osborne.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.361
And then someone told me.

00:38:03.361 --> 00:38:06.940
And I wanted to crawl
into a corner and die.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:11.330
So 90% of my cognitive
energy for the last six hours

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:14.350
has gone to that.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:16.180
Why did I make that mistake?

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.400
It's a primary.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.620
Now I can get that back.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:25.720
So I tell people all the time
on book talks, what can I do?

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.516
And the thing I say is, we
focus on the federal government.

00:38:28.516 --> 00:38:29.890
But the criminal
justice system--

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.260
and this is a point
that's really made well--

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.480
It's made well in James
Forman's great book,

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.740
"Locking Up Our Own,"
which I recommend,

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.340
and "Locked In" by John
Pfaff, which is out-- which

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.740
is that there is no single
criminal justice system.

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.890
It's literally thousands of
systems, like county sheriffs,

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:48.070
municipal DA's, all these
different interlocking systems

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:50.290
at the local level, and
a lot of elected leaders

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:54.324
who are elected in super
low-turnout elections, which

00:38:54.324 --> 00:38:55.990
in some ways is the
good news because it

00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:57.940
means you have a lever.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.740
If you devote
yourself to working

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.840
on these issues in
local elections,

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.234
you can have a huge impact.

00:39:03.234 --> 00:39:04.900
And the Philadelphia
primary is probably

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.210
the most stunning
example of that so far.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:11.260
A guy named Larry Krasner, who
is a sort of notorious lefty

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:15.250
lawyer of Philadelphia--
he's the lawyer that is there

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:19.060
when a bunch of protesters
are arrested at a protest

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.610
to bail them out.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:24.940
He has no prosecutorial
experience.

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:29.980
And the police union hates
him and, in the manner

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:34.642
of police unions everywhere,
was not shy about saying that.

00:39:34.642 --> 00:39:36.475
Police unions tend to
speak in one register.

00:39:36.475 --> 00:39:39.058
I don't know if you've noticed
this from official police union

00:39:39.058 --> 00:39:41.260
statements.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:45.890
And Krasner won this
primary explicitly

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:48.770
on a program of reform.

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:51.590
He's not the first sort
of reformer DA to win.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:55.070
There's a woman in Orlando
who won similarly and is now

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:57.170
locked in a battle with
the state Republicans who

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:59.420
want to take her power away
because she said she's not

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.850
going to use the death penalty.

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:03.360
There's a woman in
Cook County, Illinois,

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.240
who grew up in
[INAUDIBLE] who also

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:09.800
won and unseated the
district attorney--

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.050
or I guess in Illinois,
it's the state's attorney--

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:15.484
who had sort of been implicated
in the Laquan McDonald coverup.

00:40:15.484 --> 00:40:17.900
So this is something that's
happening in different places.

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:21.800
Krasner, I would say, is
the most remarkable example.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:27.550
And he's now got a general
election ahead of him,

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.170
a thing I didn't
say this morning.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:33.380
And he's now got a general
election ahead of him.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:37.610
And that's gonna be a
really fascinating fight.

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:42.170
And what's going to be even more
interesting is if he wins, OK.

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:45.950
What does the rubber
hitting the road look like?

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:47.510
Talking about all
this is one thing.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:50.930
But the reason that there's a
lot of hope around prosecutors

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.960
is because a lot of empirical
work that's been done

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:57.020
shows that prosecutors more
than any other single actors

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.200
in the system were the ones
driving mass incarceration.

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.610
It wasn't mandatory minimums.

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.560
It wasn't statutes being passed.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.500
It was prosecutors
using their discretion

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.380
to charge five crimes
for a max of 20

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.175
rather than one crime
for a max of five.

00:41:11.175 --> 00:41:13.300
And when they charged five
crimes with a max of 20,

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.500
and they plea down
to 15 or 12, you've

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.810
got someone who's doing
a 12-year bid as opposed

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:19.520
to a one-year bid.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.332
That's the latitude
that prosecutors have,

00:41:22.332 --> 00:41:24.665
and the latitude they have
in a system in which, again--

00:41:24.665 --> 00:41:26.550
you've got to remind
yourself this all the time,

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:27.950
particularly if you're not
someone who's spending a lot

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:29.630
of time in the criminal
justice system--

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:34.190
the criminal justice system is
a factory for producing pleas.

00:41:36.747 --> 00:41:38.830
Your input are arrests,
and the outputs are pleas.

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:43.730
There are no trials in America.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.580
It's a rounding error, trials.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.620
All the pop culture
representations

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.190
of American criminal justice
are the rounding error.

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:54.850
What it is is it's Lucy
with the chocolates.

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:59.080
That's a night in court
in any major municipality.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:02.070
And so because it's a machine
that produces pleas out

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:05.830
of the input of arrests,
these two main fulcrums

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:08.710
are what you're
pleaing to, which

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:12.010
is the knob that the
prosecutors can turn,

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:13.510
and how many arrests
you're getting,

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:16.000
which is the knob
the police can turn.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
So those are two of the
regulators on that system.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.470
And those are two places--

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.170
what are police
arresting folks for,

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:26.624
and what are prosecutors
charging and accepting pleas?

00:42:26.624 --> 00:42:28.540
TORRENCE BOONE: And those
prosecutors, though,

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.600
are connected to the
political machine.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.300
CHRIS HAYES: I mean,
Europe thinks it's nuts

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.970
that we elect prosecutors.

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:37.900
Right?

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:43.780
I mean, it's literally
in the Bible, right?

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:49.630
The scene where Jesus is killed
is essentially the punishment

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:52.180
being put up to the crowd.

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:55.380
Pontius Plate's like,
what should I do?

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.380
We want Barabbas, right?

00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:01.210
Now The crowd, literally,
it's like the iconic example

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:04.570
of the crowd gone
wild, is in the context

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:08.140
of a crowd selecting a
punishment for Jesus Christ.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:12.220
But that's basically
what DA elections are.

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:15.910
We put people
politically in charge

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:19.390
of making these decisions
that in other systems

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:22.390
are insulated from
democratic input

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:25.030
and are appointed
like a judiciary

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:27.700
and probably produce far
less punitive outcomes

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:28.867
for that reason.

00:43:28.867 --> 00:43:30.700
TORRENCE BOONE: We'll
take another question,

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.970
but I do want to come
back to what can we do?

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:36.400
What advice would you give
us individually and as

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.206
an organization in
terms of addressing

00:43:38.206 --> 00:43:39.080
some of these issues?

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:39.579
Yes.

00:43:39.579 --> 00:43:41.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:45.590
I feel like the
Democrats have not

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:50.390
been particularly good
at making racial justice

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:53.320
or criminal justice
reform a national issue.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.450
I feel like it came up at the
end of Barack Obama's time,

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:58.305
and then it was like
there's other issues.

00:43:58.305 --> 00:43:59.600
This goes back down.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.380
And then even pre-Barack Obama.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:08.990
But what is the
argument for really

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:12.950
making this stuff a national
issue for Democrats,

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:17.900
when it feels like everything
else is on fire right now?

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:18.650
CHRIS HAYES: Yeah.

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:22.520
I think it's hard to
get the oxygen for it

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.520
as a national issue for
Democrats right now, frankly.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.950
There are these stories
that I tell myself on my way

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:36.350
into work everyday,
like we're gonna

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:38.960
get this in the goddamn
show if it kills me.

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.485
And, like, nine times
out of 10, we don't.

00:44:41.485 --> 00:44:42.860
And then I go
home, and I'm like,

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:46.130
I failed again to get
this thing in the show.

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:47.690
And the other day,
I went in with--

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:49.610
Sessions just issued
this sentencing memo.

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:50.943
Are you guys familiar with this?

00:44:50.943 --> 00:44:52.470
Right.

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:53.420
We got it in the show.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:56.250
And I was like--

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:57.930
but that's a testament
to how hard it is

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:00.090
to sort of treat these issues.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:01.600
My answer to that are twofold.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.110
One, the Democratic Party's
been incredibly complicit

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:07.350
in the buildup of
the carceral state.

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:09.690
And James Forman's book
is great about this.

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:13.980
Washington DC, African
American Democratic leaders

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:18.640
were part of building this up.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.930
The upside is that
most of this stuff

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:24.870
is being driven
at a local level.

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:29.230
In a tangible sense,
better funding

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:32.410
for public defenders and better
prosecutors being elected

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:35.350
in major cities
around America would

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:38.470
have a more tangible
effect, most likely,

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:41.107
in some ways than who
the attorney general is.

00:45:41.107 --> 00:45:42.940
Attorney general has a
huge amount of power.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.231
It matters a tremendous amount
that it's Jeff Sessions.

00:45:45.231 --> 00:45:49.090
That's not good for
reform of the system.

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:54.400
But if Democrats focus and
focus in those environments--

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.020
the Krasner case
is so fascinating

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.060
because that's a primary.

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:01.210
So focusing in the
context of places

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:07.650
like Cy Vance in
Manhattan, Brooklyn DA,

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:10.260
focusing on those
offices, there's

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.590
a lot to be done at that level.

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.155
TORRENCE BOONE: Last question.

00:46:17.155 --> 00:46:18.830
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:21.557
Something I wonder--
what you think

00:46:21.557 --> 00:46:23.390
of the prospects of
trying to involve people

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:26.150
around prosecution
or law enforcement,

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:29.450
getting them more onboard
with criminal justice reform?

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:31.700
And I think about this even
when I'm recounting, like,

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:34.760
a local assembly
person who's very

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.560
friendly with local
police, which is great.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.819
But it's easy to
get very pessimistic

00:46:38.819 --> 00:46:41.360
if I'm reading, say, personal
accounts or people in my friend

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.860
circles who work
in law enforcement.

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.470
And their perspective
is so far from where

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:49.129
I can get to in terms of where
they think the problem is.

00:46:49.129 --> 00:46:50.670
CHRIS HAYES: That's
a great question.

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:53.810
So I think there's been
some real progress on this.

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:58.460
And I think that you've seen a
lot of police representatives

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:03.230
come around on things like
decriminalization of marijuana,

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:06.620
stuff like that, that
they used to oppose.

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:09.325
If I'm not mistaken, I think
the professional organization

00:47:09.325 --> 00:47:12.860
of the American
Society of Prosecutors

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.500
put out a critical statement
about the Sessions charging

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:20.030
memo, which also was
amazing to me, which

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:22.520
reflects this idea
that we don't actually

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:24.000
think this is the way to go.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.230
So there's some light
and some space there.

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:31.104
The other side of it is that--

00:47:31.104 --> 00:47:32.520
and again, to sort
of put yourself

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:36.900
in the shoes of the people
that are manning the system--

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:40.200
police particularly- and
this is true of prosecutors,

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.390
particularly true of police--

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.940
they're spending
all day every day

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.540
interacting with people
that are in distress

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:53.860
and are in their
worst situation.

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:58.350
No one calls the cops
to bake them cookies.

00:47:58.350 --> 00:48:00.850
You call the cops when there's
distress and there's disorder

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:03.010
and there's trauma.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:07.300
And there's a real taxing
effect psychologically

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.450
on being introduced
to that all the time.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.700
Now, people will note,
rightly, that they're not

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.194
the only people
that are introduced

00:48:14.194 --> 00:48:15.110
to that kind of thing.

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:17.170
There are social
workers and child

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:19.967
protective services workers
and emergency room doctors

00:48:19.967 --> 00:48:21.550
and all kinds of
people that are going

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:26.600
through jobs in which they're
exposed to this all the time.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.690
But there's a psychological
toll, I think,

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:32.680
it takes on everyone
involved in the system that

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.930
is part of kind of
reproducing that punitiveness.

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:37.600
And I don't know the
solution for that.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:41.890
But I think it is important
to have empathy for that

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:44.110
as a psychological toll.

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:46.480
There's a lot of sort of
trauma through osmosis

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.830
that's happening.

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:55.090
And cops are lied to all
the time, constantly.

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:59.050
And it's easy to think
everyone's a liar.

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:00.670
All of that--

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:03.024
I don't know the solution
and whether that's a training

00:49:03.024 --> 00:49:04.690
solution, whether
that's the sort of way

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:10.096
that we think about the
profession of policing.

00:49:10.096 --> 00:49:11.470
But it's a real
thing what you're

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:13.420
saying, when you talk
about that perspective.

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.750
There's a real thing
about police culture

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:21.770
that is really deeply
viscerally opposed to reform.

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:24.772
And that's something that
has to be dealt with.

00:49:24.772 --> 00:49:26.230
TORRENCE BOONE: So
we're incredibly

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:29.110
action-oriented and passionate
about making a difference.

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:32.300
That's what characterizes
the culture of our company.

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.620
What else can we do,
other than engagement

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:38.805
in the political process,
which you've covered?

00:49:38.805 --> 00:49:40.430
CHRIS HAYES: I mean,
I think, actually,

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:41.763
that's the most important thing.

00:49:41.763 --> 00:49:44.660
I mean, the point
of this book is

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:47.810
there are political
situations in America

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:52.430
that were essentially the
product of special interests.

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:57.620
Like the bankruptcy bill
was not some big democratic

00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:02.880
mobilization to make
bankruptcy harder for debtors.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.592
That was basically written in
a backroom by bank lobbyists.

00:50:06.592 --> 00:50:08.550
That's not true of the
criminal justice system.

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:10.770
That was democratically
brought about in election

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:15.270
after election for assembly,
counsel, state senate, city

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:18.840
council, governor, district
attorney, attorney general,

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.540
senator, Congress,
election after election,

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.250
banging that drum of fear.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:25.170
And it only is
going to be unmade

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:26.730
through democratic means.

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:30.740
It's not going to be unmade
through policy conferences

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:31.820
and think tanks.

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.617
The policy solutions are there.

00:50:34.617 --> 00:50:36.700
What has to change
fundamentally are the politics.

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.199
And people have to
invest themselves

00:50:38.199 --> 00:50:40.010
in changing the politics
of that and decide

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:42.051
this is an issue that
they're going to care about

00:50:42.051 --> 00:50:44.090
and prioritize and get
invested in, again,

00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:45.950
at very local levels.

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:49.010
There are a million fights
about criminal justice happening

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:53.055
in New York City, like cash
bail, the fate of Rikers.

00:50:53.055 --> 00:50:55.430
This is stuff right here,
right now that you can actually

00:50:55.430 --> 00:51:00.120
have a really, really powerful
voice in because there's

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.010
a low quotient of
citizens who are

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:03.260
raising their voices about it.

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.699
And that's a real opportunity.

00:51:04.699 --> 00:51:05.740
TORRENCE BOONE: Terrific.

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:07.475
Chris is going to
be signing books.

00:51:07.475 --> 00:51:08.850
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:10.100
CHRIS HAYES: Thanks, everyone.

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:13.350
Thanks, that was awesome.

00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:14.641
TORRENCE BOONE: All right, man.

00:51:14.641 --> 00:51:15.500
CHRIS HAYES: Thanks.
