LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to the
first edition of Google

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.740
Developers Weekly, our highlight
reel of what's

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.670
happening in the world
of Google Developers

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.350
on the set and off.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.310
I'm Louis Gray from the Google
Developers Live team.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.800
Every month, we broadcast dozens
of shows from Google

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.850
Developer studios all around
the world covering the

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.390
products and APIs that
you care about most.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.490
Our engineers show you the
latest news, tips, and how

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.370
to's to make your code great.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.280
But you're busy, so we
created this show.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.720
Each week, we're going to take
a few minutes to run through

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.920
some of the Google Developers
highlights.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.610
So let's get started.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.030
First, early last week from
Berlin, Martin Gorner sat down

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.830
with SoundCloud to talk about
reactive programming, a new

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.990
design pattern that helps you
build responsive UIs.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.730
From Milan, Italy, Marco Casario
developed Part Three

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.360
of his Responsive Web Design
series focusing on using CSS

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.630
to load resources depending on
what type of browser or device

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.160
you're using.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.580
From Tel Aviv, the GDL Israel
team did a deep dive into the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.230
wow and the how of web RTC.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.540
Back here in Mountain View, we
saw many different product

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.270
teams take their turns behind
the desk to enlighten us on

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.060
what's new.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.390
The Google Drive team
instructed us on how

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.370
collaborator email addresses are
handled for those of you

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.880
who may have started with the
Documents List API and noticed

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.490
how the move to Drive
changed permissions.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.340
Until this show aired,
I had no idea.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.230
It's a good thing Steve Basil
was there to help us out and

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.150
help me finally get it.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.300
We even let the interns
into the studio.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.140
In what some might argue is
the pinnacle of his career

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.860
stay here at the Googleplex,
intern Sam Stern showed us how

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.450
to build Google+ sign in and
add it to applications that

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.010
already integrate with
other social

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.640
networks, such as Facebook.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.970
Thanks for dropping by Sam.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.650
Now that you've left us, don't
forget to show up on time for

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.730
class when the bell rings.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.020
Since every single one of our
Google Developers Live events

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.780
shows up on YouTube, having the
YouTube Developers Live

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.060
team show up in our
studio seems one

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.360
step short of inception.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.180
We must go deeper.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.170
And yet the team shows up
practically every Wednesday,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.539
including the most recent week
with guest Storyful, who calls

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.810
himself the news agency of the
social media age and is

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.040
focused on social media
verification.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.820
Very cool stuff.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.800
Want to know when your studio
has been invaded by Canadians?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.870
Look for the tin foil hats.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.500
Vancouver resident Tim Bray,
alongside Googler Adam Dawes

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.540
brought his tin foil hat into
the studio and railed on for

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.790
some time about identity
providers, federation, and who

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.180
you can trust these days.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.570
You won't want to miss it.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.800
We finally wrapped the week with
a demo that required a 65

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.670
inch, 110-pound television set
to be precariously balanced in

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.580
our studio, violating at least
nine workplace safety rules.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.190
The reason--

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.030
Google Wallet is going web and
mortar, linking online

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.220
commerce to the real world.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.860
We'd be remiss if we didn't give
a big head nod and tip of

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.530
the cap to our Android
Developers Live team, who in

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.730
their own right are consistently
teaching us how

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.360
to make programs beautiful,
taking applications to the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.320
clinic for deep inspection, and
dropping dead bytes on the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.820
Android Developers
YouTube channel.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.400
Don't miss that if you're
a developer

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.980
thinking about mobile.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.950
And let's be honest, right now,

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.810
MobileFirst is the new black.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.510
Meanwhile, outside of our
studios for the rare times we

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.750
leave here, on our Google
Developers blog and Google+

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.760
page, we actually had a few more
announcements last week

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.530
in the world of Google
Developers.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.790
First, the Chrome Web Lab
finished its run in London,

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.350
but the good news is the program
is being open sourced

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.150
and will live on forever.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.960
Forever is a long time.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.030
Meanwhile, Google's security
team continues to be in a

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.960
giving mood in now announcing
that they've given out $2

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.690
million to the Developer
community in security rewards.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.300
Because each installation of
Chrome is free, that comes out

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.970
to about infinity dollars
per copy.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.160
To make sure you never miss a
thing from the world of Google

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.130
Developers, subscribe to Google
Developers on YouTube

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.420

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.520

see you in the studio.
