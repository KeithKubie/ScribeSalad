00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.690
(Coughing.)

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.130
Measles.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.580
Mumps.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.030
Meningitis.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.140
The flu.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.540
When you think of life-changing college experiences,
that’s not what comes to mind, right?

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:29.550
That’s why Emory University takes student
immunization so seriously.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.390
One infected student can impact the whole
community.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.100
In fact, immunization compliance is so important
to Emory, your class registration is tied

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.890
to it.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.399
(UGH!

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:44.910
No!)

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.520
Without up-to-date immunization records on
file with Emory Student Health Services, you

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.670
won’t be able to register for classes.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.730
The good news is, submitting your records
is as easy as logging on to Emory Student

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.989
Health Patient Portal…

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.140
Downloading your school-specific immunization
form to be signed and verified by a doctor…

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.370
Entering your immunization dates…

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.250
And uploading a copy of your verified and
signed immunization form!

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.450
That’s all it takes to be immunization compliant.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.659
Let’s all do our part to keep the Emory
community healthy, and helping every student

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.880
be well and excel.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.530

more information or to access the patient

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.670
