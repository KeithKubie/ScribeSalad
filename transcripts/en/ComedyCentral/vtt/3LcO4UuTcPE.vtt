ANNOUNCER:<i> Ladies and gentlemen,
 the 45th and final president</i>

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:07.673
<i> of the United States!</i>

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:11.811
-(cheering and applause)
-Right. Wow!

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:14.814
Thanks for agreeing to pay
for my border wall.

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:16.749
Yeah, the whole thing?

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:18.818
And free burritos for life?

00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:23.289
Thanks. Thanks,
the president of Mexico.

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:25.758
-Mr. President, Mr. President.
-Mr. President. -What?!

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:27.760
Mr. President, uh,
Robert Mueller has assembled

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:30.096
a grand jury in the Russia
probe. Do you have any comment?

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:35.101
Unfair. I'm supposed to be tried
by a jury of my peers.

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:37.904
Where are they going to find
12 presidents

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:41.641
who are allegedly being
blackmailed by Putin?

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:44.444
Why does your immigration plan
place so much importance

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.045
on the ability to speak English?

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:49.582
If you want to live here, you
need to talk English very good.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:52.585
As a president
who English great,

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:54.587
me know job good.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.256
Is important for job do.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.725
Me stand with good American

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:01.928
like local milk people.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:04.397
So true. So true.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.265
How do you respond to reports
that the White House

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:08.668
-is in chaos?
-No, there's no chaos.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:12.872
And that's why tonight's theme
is chaos.

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:14.740
You just said there's no chaos.

00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:19.078
Right. That's why
tonight's theme is order.

00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:22.415
I have a new chief of staff,
General John Kelly,

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:24.016
a very tough guy.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.618
And I trust the general.

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:29.021
He gets me the best
car insurance rates online.

00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:31.290
Which, as we all know,

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:33.759
saves some time!

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:37.363
Kelly has done such incredible
work with deportation.

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:39.832
This guy tears families apart.

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:43.169
And I can't wait to see
what he'll do to mine.

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:46.506
You want... you want him
to tear your family apart?

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.707
What? No.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.841
Maybe. I don't know.

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:50.243
Some of them?

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.311
Our theme is chaos.

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:53.646
I thought it was order.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:54.780
You're out of order!

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:57.116
I'm the president.
Chaos believe it?!

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.318
Let's roll!
