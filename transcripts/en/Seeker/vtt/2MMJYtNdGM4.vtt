00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.889
Next time you’re caught cheating in school,
just blame hormones.

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:09.210
Hi everyone, Amy here on DNews.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.880
Pretty much everyone has cheated on a test
at some point in their lives.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.250
While it’s generally frowned upon and I’m
trying to condone it, peeking at the names

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.300
of the Great Lakes on a geography test when
you’re six doesn’t mean you’re going

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.519
to grow into a horrible adult.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.650
Some early psychological research into why
kids cheat landed on moral development.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.480
As we age, we become less egotistical and
more moral, drawing us away from doing something

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.860
we know is wrong.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.090
Other studies have suggested cheating is the
result of cost-benefit analysis: if the reward

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.930
for cheating is greater than the outcome of
getting caught, kids will take the risk.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.720
In either case, these rationales point to
cheating as a subconscious decision, but what

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.250
if it’s not a decision at all?

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.580
New research published in the Journal of Experimental
Psychology says that those who cheat on tests

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.510
do so because of hormones.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.780
Extra testosterone gives us the courage to
cheat, and extra cortisol gives us the motivation.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.020
Researchers at the University of Texas at
Austin asked a group of people to take a math

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.350
test and grade it themselves, knowing that
the more questions they answered correctly

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.982
the more money they would earn.

00:01:01.982 --> 00:01:04.850
They also took saliva samples before and after
the test.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.460
The results showed that people with elevated
levels of testosterone and cortisol were more

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.750
likely to lie about the number of questions
they answered correctly.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.110
Testosterone decreases fear of punishment
and increases sensitivity to reward, so that

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.210
would explain why some cheated.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.390
Elevated cortisol, meanwhile, is linked to
a state of chronic stress that can be almost

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.800
debilitating, so that could be a powerful
motivator in deciding to cheat.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.640
Those who cheated also showed lowered levels
of cortisol after the test, consistent with

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.390
a reduction of emotional stress you might
expect from having successfully cheated on

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.390
a test.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.390
So that’s good?

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.390
Not really.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.910
The reduction of stress triggered a powerful
stimulation of the reward centre of the brain,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.120
effectively reinforcing unethical behaviour.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.600
The flip side is that people with lower levels
of both testosterone and cortisol could be

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.229
less prone to this unethical behaviour.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.780
But it’s not like parents could remove testosterone
from their children for the sake of better

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.780
test-taking behavior!

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.409
Instead, there are ways to break that cycle
of hormonal responses reinforcing cheating.

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.870
Research cited in the same study says that
individuals rewarded in a group were less

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.060
susceptible to the effects of testosterone
on performance, and those who engaged in stress-reducing

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.620
activities like yoga were less moved to cheat
due to lower cortisol levels.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.509
So if you want to raise an ethical student,
group yoga might help!

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.670
At least, that’s my own thought, and if
you’re curious to know more of my thoughts
