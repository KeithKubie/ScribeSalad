00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.535
- If you go to a house

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.004
that's a strip club

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.439 align:start size:88% position:13%
in the woods, down a
dirt road with no lights

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:07.774
in Dothan, Alabama,

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:09.542
those bitches are ferocious.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.311

World of Blunder.

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:33.066 line:0%
If you've never been
to the show before,

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.667 align:start size:94% position:6%
it's just a bunch of
comics telling fun stories

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.703
about real shit that happened.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.004
Give it up for my
friend and yours,

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.011
- Yo, yo, yo.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.148
Yeah.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:50.016
Hello, hello, hello.

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:51.484
What's up? What's going on?

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.254 align:start position:0%
I've been traveling, doing
stand-up comedy for a long time.

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:57.123
I started going on
the road back in 1998

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:58.024
and that was...

00:00:58.024 --> 00:00:59.526
(mumbles)

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.727 align:start size:94% position:6%
I started going on the
road because of Dice Clay.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.228 align:start size:84% position:16%
We are at the Comedy
Store one night

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.464 align:start size:84% position:16%
he's like "you
should do the road"

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:05.965
and I was like OK.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.735 align:start size:88% position:13%
If he's willing to
talk to me I'll listen,

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.170
you know.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.772 align:start position:0%
And I started going on the
road both doing stand-up comedy

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:15.341 align:start size:97% position:3%
and working for the Ultimate
Fighting Championship.

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:17.143
Which back then, was

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:18.945
really like doing porn.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.447
(audience laughs)

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:22.115
In 1998, you didn't want
to tell people that you...

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.550 align:start size:84% position:16%
"what are you doing
this weekend?"

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
I'm going to see a cage fighting
event in Dothan, Alabama.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:27.954
I'm working.

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:30.390 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I fly into this place
and I'm hanging out

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.758
with these fighters.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.793
I'm in my 20s and I'm
completely baffled

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:35.028
by the whole situation.

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.329
And like, you ever
see that cartoon

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.831
where there's two dogs.

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.934
There's a little dog that's
hanging out with the big dog.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:41.968
And the little dog is like,

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:43.837
where we going Spike?

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:46.473
The big dog is like, shut up!

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:47.774
I was the little dog.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.443
And I'm just hanging out
with this slew of dudes

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:51.911
who can rape me.

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:54.514
And one of them wants to go out.

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:56.950
And if you're around like
these big giant like..

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.952
This one dude. We'll
just call him Bob.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.053
We'll call him Bob.

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:01.821
It's not his real name, but

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.590
Bob was this giant wrestler dude

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.160
who is like 250 lbs
of American muscle.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.162
And Mexican supplements.

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:11.464
And we're hanging out
in Dothan, Alabama.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:12.732
What does Bob want?

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:15.401
"Bob wants to get some pussy.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.370 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Yeah, there's got to be some
pussy in this town, man."

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.105 align:start size:88% position:13%
I mean literally, that's
all he wants to do.

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:21.407
And we're...we're there
with this other dude

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.642
who is the local DJ.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.277
You know, we have to
do like morning radio

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:25.345
to promote the event,

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:26.813
it's this big event down there.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.516 align:start size:97% position:3%
And morning radio guy talks
like morning radio guy.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:31.217
He's like, "what do
you guys want to do?"

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:33.119
There's a voice that somehow

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.421 align:start size:84% position:16%
another they're
all allowed to use.

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:38.091 align:start size:94% position:6%
And it's not like you
know, you're doing a real

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:39.792
like he's doing Jack Nicholson.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:43.963
No, they're all just doing
the voice they do at work.

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:47.033
It's basically the same thing
as the strip club DJ voice.

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:49.202
It's very interchangeable.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.605
DJ guy's like, "hey, I
know where the girls are.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:53.907 align:start size:84% position:16%
"There's a club just
outside of town.

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:55.842
"Let's head out
there right now."

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.911
So we get in his car.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.846
We hop in DJ guy's car.

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.147
And we start going out of town.

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.916
And we're in homeboy's car.

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.851
And he's playing, you
know, his station.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:06.352
We're talking.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:09.656 align:start size:97% position:3%
And Bob is like, "man gotta
be some pussy around here man.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:10.890
"I'm telling you dude,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.158 align:start size:84% position:16%
"there's gotta be some
pussy around here."

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:13.459
And we start going
down a dirt road.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.761
I notice there's no more lights.

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:15.962
And I'm like, what's going on?

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:17.430
He's like, this is where it is.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.431
So we go down this dirt road.

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:19.666
This is all a true story.

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:21.534
Down this dirt road,
there's no lights.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.369
And we get to a house.

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:25.838
It's a fucking house.

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:28.241
The house has a nylon sign,

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.475
like one of those
signs, you know.

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:31.711
Like you see a temporary sign.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.280
And it just says
Gentlemen's club.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.249
At a fucking house.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.784
And I'm like, oh shit.

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:39.986
This is a mistake man.

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:41.821
I'm awake, I'm sober now.

00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:43.690
I'm not high, again.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.459 align:start position:0%
So I'm thinking this is a
terrible, terrible place to be.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.328 align:start size:97% position:3%
He's like, "man I hope
there's some pussy in there."

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:50.396
So I go out with him
and the DJ guy's like

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.165
"We go there all the time,
don't worry about it buddy.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:53.066
"Come on in.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.601
"Alright."

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:56.102
We walk in the door, it's
a fucking regular door.

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:58.938 align:start size:97% position:3%
There's like bookshelves,
people have their shoes there.

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:00.240
There's a fucking staircase.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.442
Like this is insanity man.

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:03.743
We go in this room,

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:06.279
and if you've ever been to

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:10.383 align:start position:0%
not like an established
beautiful place like Cheetah's.

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:13.553
If you've ever been
to a strip club...

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.090
If you've ever made a mistake

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.191
and gone to a house

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:20.994 align:start size:84% position:16%
with a vinyl
Gentlemen's Club sign

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:23.596
in the middle of
Dothan, Alabama,

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:26.599 align:start size:94% position:6%
you'll notice that there's
a strange thing about

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.402
the food chain when it
comes to strip clubs.

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:32.705
And the less attractive have
to be the most aggressive.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:35.308
It's sort of how nature
balances itself out.

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:37.577
It's like you know hyenas
are desperate as fuck,

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:39.812
they gotta make shit
happen right away.

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.281
Alright.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.582 align:start size:94% position:6%
They're not turtles, where
there's plenty of food

00:04:42.582 --> 00:04:44.317
and they live to be 1000.

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:47.353 align:start size:84% position:16%
No they gotta get
shit done right now.

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:48.588
So.

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:51.424
If you go to a house,
that's a strip club

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:53.393
with a vinyl sign, in the woods

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:55.161
down a dirt road with no lights

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:56.629
in Dothan, Alabama,

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.965
those bitches are ferocious!

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.035
They fucking move on you man.

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.803 align:start size:84% position:16%
You don't get a
chance to sit down.

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.371
They're on you, okay.

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:07.740
And it's a strange scene man.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.008
First of all, there's like,

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:10.677
the only thing that
makes strip clubish

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:12.245
is that there's red light bulbs.

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:13.680
They're using red light bulbs.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.348
Okay. So I sit down,

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:16.549
the trained killer is like

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:18.885 align:start size:88% position:13%
"man, where's the pussy
in this place man?"

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:20.253
And he's looking around.

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:21.554 align:start size:94% position:6%
And this girl immediately
comes up to me.

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:23.723
And there's a thing
that a gal will do

00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:26.225
when she's trying to get you
to do a private dance with her.

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:28.561 align:start size:88% position:13%
And that thing is to
immediately put her knee

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:30.229
where your penis is

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.800
okay and then they move into
you and start talking to you.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.868
This is a sexy pose.

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:39.238 align:start size:81% position:19%
Okay, but not when
you're wearing

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:42.575
sweatpants and wrestling shoes.

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:44.544
Okay and your breath smells

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:47.213
like you ate 150
shit sandwhiches

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:49.982
and had a drunken
Mariachi band fart

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:52.685
in your mouth for a year.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:53.519
This...

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:54.454
(mumbles)

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.388
Steps out.

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:56.689
I'm not bullshitting man.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.524
She's wearing fucking sweatpants

00:05:58.524 --> 00:05:59.992 align:start size:84% position:16%
and she's got
wrestling shoes on.

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:01.227
And she's gangster.

00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:02.495
She's like, "do you wanna dance?

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:03.963
"Do you wanna dance?"

00:06:03.963 --> 00:06:07.667 align:start size:94% position:6%
And it fucking hits me
like a broken fire hydrant

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:09.168
of stink.

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:10.069
It's just...

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:12.972
(vomit sounds)

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:15.041
And I don't know what to do.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.109
I'm a polite person.

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:17.076
I try to be nice.

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:18.311
We're all different.

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:19.512
And I don't know
how she got here.

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:20.813
So I'm sitting there.

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:22.648
And all I could think of.

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:24.183
All I could think of
was I have a girlfriend

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:25.351 align:start size:81% position:19%
and she doesn't
let me get dances.

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.353
So she starts doing all this,

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:31.124 align:start size:88% position:13%
"you don't know what
the fuck you're missing.

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:35.328 align:start size:88% position:13%
"You don't know what
the fuck you're missing.

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:36.996
"I'm a badass bitch.

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:39.866
"I'm a badass bitch.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:42.335 align:start size:88% position:13%
"You don't know what the
fuck you're missing."

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:45.238
And I'm like I'm never gonna
get out of here alive man.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.139
That's all I'm thinking.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.807
Is I have fucked up.

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:49.609
This is like a fucking movie.

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:52.545 align:start size:94% position:6%
You take the wrong turn
and then eight hours later

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:54.614 align:start size:88% position:13%
you're pleading for
your life in a basement.

00:06:54.614 --> 00:06:55.848
This is a fucking disaster.

00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:57.316 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I gotta find
the trained killer.

00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:58.785
So I go over,

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:00.219 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm like man we gotta
get the fuck out of here.

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:01.687
I get up to him

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:04.323 align:start size:97% position:3%
and he has found the only
attractive girl within miles.

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:07.760 align:start size:94% position:6%
And she has gravitated
towards his alpha presence

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.362
and she's sitting in his lap.

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:11.097
And she weighed 90 lbs.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.699
I know this because he told me.

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:16.369
She's in his lap

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:17.837
and he looks over
at me and he goes

00:07:17.837 --> 00:07:20.506
"she only about 90lbs."

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:23.342
(audience laughs)

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:25.878
And now this

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:27.180
it happened exactly this way.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.114
He goes

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.049
"her pussy's gotta be tight"

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:31.551
that's...like...

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:36.055
Could you imagine breaking
a human being down to that?

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:39.325
He was calculating
mass and size and...

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.228
It's a goodin'.

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:44.096
It's a keeper.

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:45.131
It's a fucking keeper man,

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.133
that's a keeper.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.701
So you know he's with this girl

00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:49.969 align:start size:84% position:16%
and you know they're
asking questions.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.437
One of the things
that he did was

00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start size:97% position:3%
the girl would point to
every other man in the room.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.575
She would go like this

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:57.076
"what about him over there,"

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:58.878
"him right there, I'll take
him like this right here"

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:01.647
(laughs loudly)

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.082
He did that like,

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:03.983
he did that like 10 times.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:05.084
With 10 different guys.

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:08.020
(mumbles)

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.589
And then I'm you know

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:10.790
the other girl is still on
the other side of the room.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.260
"You don't know what
the fuck you're missing

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.828
"you don't know"

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.597
so I'm like man I gotta
get the fuck outta here.

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:19.232 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm completely
sober at this point.

00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:20.266
And I'm like hey dude,

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:21.767
why don't you ask your friend

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:23.035
if she wants to get the
fuck outta here, alright.

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:24.470
He's like "hey you wanna
get the fuck outta here"

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.404
and she's like

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:26.739
"I'll go if my friend can go."

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:28.174
"She'll go if her
friend can go."

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.008
Who's her friend?

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:30.276
Shit breath!

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:32.678 align:start size:84% position:16%
Of course her friend
is shit breath.

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:34.881 align:start size:81% position:19%
So we hop in DJ
mister nice's car,

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:37.717 align:start size:81% position:19%
Kiss 107.5 fucking
whatever it is.

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:40.653 align:start size:94% position:6%
He's in, "alright
everybody get in the car."

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:43.289 align:start size:97% position:3%
So the trained killer and
the 90 lber in the back seat

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:46.058 align:start size:84% position:16%
but shit breath wants
to sit on my lap.

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:48.094
"Cause they're ain't no
fucking room back there

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:49.295
"come on, dog,

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:51.264
"what's up, there ain't
no room back there."

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:53.032 align:start size:84% position:16%
There's very few
things less attractive

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:54.367
than when you're on a dirt road

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.435
on a fucking road
with no lights.

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:57.904
You go to a house

00:08:57.904 --> 00:09:00.006
and there's a vinyl sign
that says Gentlemen's club.

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:01.607
And a girl with shit breath

00:09:01.607 --> 00:09:04.477 align:start size:84% position:16%
wearing wrestling
shoes and sweatpants.

00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:05.878
Also talks black.

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:09.549 align:start size:84% position:16%
She's white and
she's got freckles.

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:10.917
and she's like "come on dog

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:14.053
"let me sit in your lap dog"

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:14.887
and I'm like

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:16.389
you can't sit in my lap.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.623
My girlfriend doesn't like
girls sitting in my lap.

00:09:17.623 --> 00:09:21.127 align:start size:88% position:13%
"You don't know what the
fuck you're missing."

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:22.628
And she keeps

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:24.297
she keeps doing this shit
to the back of my head.

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:26.832
She's behind me with the 90
lber and the trained killer.

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:29.835
"You don't know what
the fuck you're missing

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:33.472 align:start size:84% position:16%
"you don't know,
I'm a badass bitch."

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:35.508 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm just thinking, we're
gonna get to the hotel room.

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:36.742
I'm just going to
get the fuck...

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:38.144
This is all going
to be a memory.

00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:39.445 align:start size:97% position:3%
Well apparently the
trained killer had realized

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:41.180
that this is gonna be a problem.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.181 align:start size:84% position:16%
And he's was looking
over and "man,

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:43.416
"she is gonna be a problem man,

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.151
"she's gonna fuck
this up for me."

00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:46.586 align:start size:84% position:16%
So as soon as we
pull in to the hotel

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.420
the hotel is...

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.854
(mumbles)

00:09:48.854 --> 00:09:51.457 align:start position:0%
You know, overpass thing,
little circular roundabout sort

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:53.326 align:start size:88% position:13%
of a thing in the front,
with a roof on it.

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:54.860
We pull in to that thing,

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.363 align:start size:94% position:6%
the fucking trained killer
kicks open the door,

00:09:57.363 --> 00:09:59.031
grabs the 90 lber

00:09:59.031 --> 00:10:00.533
and just starts running.

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:01.734
(audience laughs)

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:03.603
I mean this mother
fucker is clearing...

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:07.840
He's got some fucking ass
and squat legs on him.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.643
He's just making
leaps and bounds

00:10:10.643 --> 00:10:12.178
and there's no way.

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:13.980
She's tied up in the seatbelt

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.181
and she's trying to get to...

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:18.351 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Oh no you don't ditch
me mother fucker."

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:19.852
So shit breath

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:21.921
shit breath is running
after the trained killer.

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:23.990
But this mother fucker
puts logs on his back

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.725
and runs up stadium stairs.

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:28.027 align:start size:84% position:16%
So he's just running
with this girl.

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:29.762
He gets her to the elevator.

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:31.697
The elevator doors open.

00:10:31.697 --> 00:10:33.599 align:start size:81% position:19%
He turns and looks
at shit breath

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:35.635 align:start size:84% position:16%
and boom, just like
a horror movie.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.537
The door shuts just
in the nick of time.

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:41.374
(audience laughs)

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:46.612 align:start size:84% position:16%
And this is 1997,
1998, whatever it was.

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:48.681 align:start size:84% position:16%
There was no
cellphones back then.

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:50.316
You couldn't text your friend

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.218
OMG what room

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:53.052
R U in?

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:58.157
No he was gone, he was a ghost.

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:00.926
That door shut,
she had to think,

00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:04.196
I don't even know
if he was real.

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:05.965
I don't have a photo of him.

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:08.200
I don't have a contact number.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.603
He doesn't have
an email address.

00:11:10.603 --> 00:11:11.737
The door is shut.

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:15.141 align:start size:88% position:13%
He went to many
floors, and many rooms.

00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:16.142
It was over.

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:18.811
It was over.

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:22.081
But shit breath would
not accept defeat.

00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:24.050
So she starts throwing
a fucking hissy fit.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.551
Oh no mother fucker,

00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:28.554
no you ain't doing this
shit to me mother fucker.

00:11:28.554 --> 00:11:30.556
And so she starts yelling
to try and get attention.

00:11:30.556 --> 00:11:32.058
One of the managers
run over to her.

00:11:32.058 --> 00:11:34.860
Ma'am what is the problem,
please can we stop this.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.862 align:start size:84% position:16%
And she goes, I
need to know where,

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:38.097
she says his name

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:41.467 align:start size:84% position:16%
UFC mother fucker
is all with my girl.

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:44.437
We came together,
we leave together.

00:11:44.437 --> 00:11:48.574
So wrestling shoes,
sweatpants, freckles,

00:11:48.574 --> 00:11:50.176
tank top, it's a mess.

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:51.544
This is a disaster.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.045
Okay.

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:55.414
You're the last person you
want screaming in your lobby.

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:57.583 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's a white girl with
wrestling shoes on,

00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:59.985
sweatpants, talking
like a black girl,

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:01.454
obviously shit faced drunk,

00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:03.422
looking for a cage fighter.

00:12:03.422 --> 00:12:06.392
(audience laughs)

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:10.362 align:start size:97% position:3%
Who may or may not have
kidnapped her friend, right?

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:11.664
So the manager comes over,

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:12.865
they're grabbing
her by the arms,

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:14.066 align:start size:84% position:16%
they're trying to
get her out of there.

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:15.334 align:start size:84% position:16%
She's like, I'll
leave mother fucker,

00:12:15.334 --> 00:12:16.268
I'll leave,

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:17.503
I need to use the restroom,

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:18.738
I need to use the
restroom first.

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:21.874
Which is one thing that
drunks will always do.

00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:23.509 align:start size:84% position:16%
When drunks are
kicked out of the bar,

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start size:84% position:16%
they always wanna
get that last victory

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:30.316 align:start size:88% position:13%
they...just let me have
a little something.

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:32.418
Let me use the bathroom.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:33.352
They have this little thing

00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:34.620
you can't just kick 'em out.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.821
No no no, I'll go
out mother fucker

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:37.223
but I'm a human being.

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:40.092 align:start size:88% position:13%
Won't you let me use
the restroom real quick?

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:41.393
Won't you...

00:12:41.393 --> 00:12:42.695 align:start size:84% position:16%
So they won't let
her use the restroom.

00:12:42.695 --> 00:12:43.629
They're like ma'am you cannot

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:45.498
you are rude, you're yelling

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:46.832
you're waking our people

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:48.033
we gotta get the
fuck outta here.

00:12:48.033 --> 00:12:49.368 align:start size:84% position:16%
They push her
outside of the door.

00:12:49.368 --> 00:12:52.138
She doesn't take two
steps from the door

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:54.106 align:start size:81% position:19%
when she pulls her
sweatpants down

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:55.641
pushes them forward,

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:57.309
cause she's done this before,

00:12:57.309 --> 00:13:00.312
alright, she knows not
to piss on her sweatpants

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:03.215
cause she's been
there, done that.

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:04.717 align:start size:81% position:19%
She pushes the
sweatpants forward

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:06.152
and she's yelling
at the hotel going

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:07.720
ya'll got me out here,

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.924
pissing in the streets like I'm
some kind of fucking animal.

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:15.027
(audience laughs)

00:13:15.027 --> 00:13:15.861
And

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:19.198
I'm, I'm sitting in my car.

00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:22.635
Just sitting in my car,
laughing my ass off.

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.336
Thinking, this might
be the best person

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:27.173
I've ever met in my life.

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:29.608
Like out of all the people
that you'll meet in your life

00:13:29.608 --> 00:13:31.377 align:start size:84% position:16%
that will just provide
you with something

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:33.712
you can think about forever,

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:36.649 align:start size:97% position:3%
I've met some inspirational
mother fuckers.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:40.286
But I think about her
more than any of them.

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:42.254
I think about her all the time.

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:44.023
I wonder if she's alive.

00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:46.325
I wonder if she has kids.

00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:49.161
I wonder if she still
works at that house.

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:51.096
(audience applause)

00:13:51.096 --> 00:13:52.565
Thank you very much,
you guys were the shit

00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:55.134

00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
