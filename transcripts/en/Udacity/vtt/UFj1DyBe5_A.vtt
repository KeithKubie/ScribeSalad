00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.770
Okay, I'm going to step you now through
the mechanics of short selling.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.795
Pay attention because it's complicated.

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:09.320
[LAUGH]
Okay,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.810
let's imagine the following scenario.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.919
You want to take a short
position in IBM, and

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.597
IBM is currently selling at $100.

00:00:19.597 --> 00:00:21.200
That's the current market price.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.910
Joe holds 100 shares of IBM.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.540
He likes IBM, he wants to hold onto it.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.817
But he's willing to lend
you those shares of IBM.

00:00:32.817 --> 00:00:37.050
In fact, Joe's broker will
take care of that for him.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.860
He may not even know that
he's lending you the shares.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.710
Let's suppose Lisa thinks that IBM is
going to go up and she wants to buy IBM.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.060
So you want to sell IBM short.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.850
You don't own any shares of it.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.810
Lisa wants to buy IBM.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.600
She thinks it's going to go up.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.340
So here's what happens.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.960
You borrow that 100 shares from Joe.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.440
Now that you have those shares, you
can turn around and sell them to Lisa.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.780
And in exchange for
those 100 shares that you gave Lisa,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.300
she gives you 100 times $100,
or $10,000.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.050
So let me recap that.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.100
You want to sell IBM short.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.490
Joe has 100 shares of IBM.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.040
Lisa wants to buy IBM.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.262
So you borrow those 100 shares from Joe.

00:01:29.262 --> 00:01:34.533
You immediately turn around and
sell them to Lisa, and you get $10,000.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:38.866
The result of this transaction,
after everything settles,

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:44.630
is you have $10,000 in your account but
you owe Joe 100 shares of stock.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.660
And of course,
Lisa has 100 shares of stock and so on.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.880
Now the problem sort of arises here that

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.780
Joe may decide he wants
his 100 shares back.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.802
What you'll have to do is go
buy them from someone and

00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:01.390
then give them back to Joe.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.640
But let's deal with that
a little bit later.
