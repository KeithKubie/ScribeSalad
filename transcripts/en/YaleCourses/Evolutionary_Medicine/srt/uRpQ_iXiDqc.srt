1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:06,300
As infectious disease has declined is
a source of mortality in contemporary

2
00:00:06,371 --> 00:00:07,390
populations.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,780
Chronic diseases have risen in importance
is major causes of mortality and the

4
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:17,740
two leading chronic diseases that kill
people or cardiovascular disease and

5
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:18,574
cancer.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,910
Cardiovascular disease is associated
with cholesterol metabolism,

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,790
environment,
exercise and diet.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,650
And female reproductive cancers are uh,

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,230
something that we do not see so much of
in naturally reproducing populations.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,210
So we will now explore the sense in which
these diseases are mismatched diseases.

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,743
Okay.

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:49,100
The female reproductive cancers are
elicited in part by the use of oral

13
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:53,480
contraceptives, which are a new,
very new cultural innovation.

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,020
Yeah.

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,020
So first heart and cardiovascular disease
come through atherosclerosis mediated

16
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:06,600
by cholesterol metabolism.
In this little diagram here,

17
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:09,270
basically what you can see is a,

18
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,540
an artery and it has in it plaque,

19
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,750
which is building up
here is in cross section.

20
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:19,770
You can see obstructing about half
the diameter of the artery there.

21
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,770
So atherosclerosis is a
thickening of arterial walls.

22
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:28,740
It's caused by the
accumulation of macrophages,

23
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,890
lymphocytes and cholesterol in plaques.

24
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,800
So the key ingredients are
initially inflammation and
then macrophages which are

25
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:45,611
recruited to the inflamed site and the
metabolism of cholesterol at that site.

26
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,920
There are two kinds of lipoproteins,
low density and high density.

27
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,050
The low density lipoproteins,

28
00:01:54,051 --> 00:01:58,550
transport cholesterol from the liver
to other tissues and the high density

29
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:02,000
lipoproteins transport it from
the tissues back to the liver.

30
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,560
Animals and like us cannot
catabolize cholesterol.

31
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,540
So excess cholesterol is converted to
bile acids in the liver and as Excreta id

32
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,530
through the intestine.

33
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,830
Cholesterol is absolutely essential
for our normal metabolism,

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,570
but when it is dysregulated,

35
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,980
when it is out of homeostatic control,
it can produce disease.

36
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,730
Normal cells turn down the LDL,

37
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:38,120
the low density lipoprotein receptors
when they have enough cholesterol.

38
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,060
Inflammation produces oxidized LDLs that
both promote further inflammation and

39
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:49,300
are taken up by scavenger
receptors in macrophages.

40
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,070
So the scavenger receptors
are not downregulated.

41
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,030
When cholesterol concentrations rise and
they continue to take off oxidized LDLs,

42
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,450
this then produces more inflammation.

43
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,590
It increases the recruitment
of macrophages to the uh, in,

44
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,750
in arteries to the arterial intima.

45
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,620
It increases the permeability of blood
vessels and it does increase his access

46
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,510
to low density lipoproteins in the blood.

47
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,770
This is a positive feedback loop and it
can operate at low levels for many years

48
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,120
producing larger and larger
athletic atherosclerotic plaque.

49
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,490
It is a feedback loop
that actually is designed,

50
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,520
is part of our defense
and tissue repair system,

51
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,430
so it is one of the vulnerabilities
of our defense system.

52
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,070
Yeah.

53
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,680
When plaques get large enough,
they produce clotting,

54
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,070
rupture myocardial infarction or stroke.

55
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,360
Yeah.

56
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,200
Now Environment,

57
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:58,610
exercise and diet can all
ameliorate these issues.

58
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,370
Physical inactivity, poor
diet, obesity, drinking,

59
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:06,170
smoking and emotional stress,

60
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,230
increase LDL and lower HDLs in the
blood and thereby increased risk of

61
00:04:11,391 --> 00:04:12,680
cardiovascular disease.

62
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,800
Moderate exercise increases high density
lipoproteins and lowers blood pressure

63
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,240
a diet rich in unsaturated fats also
increases high density lipoproteins too

64
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:31,460
much alcohol and the other hand damages
the livers ability to regulate these

65
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:36,461
levels of lipoproteins and smoking
damages the liver and it also inflames

66
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,240
arterial walls.

67
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,410
Emotional stress increases blood pressure,

68
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,440
it increases adrenaline secretion and
cardiovascular diseases also have a

69
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:51,770
genetic component largely expressed
through environmental interactions of this

70
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:52,604
nature.

71
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,920
So cardiovascular disease is a set of
mismatched diseases caused by sedentary

72
00:05:01,221 --> 00:05:02,031
lifestyles,

73
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:07,031
diets rich in processed fats and sugars
and exposure to alcohol and nicotine.

74
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,700
Yeah.

75
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,620
What about female reproductive cancers?

76
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,050
We can learn something
there by contrasting our
contemporary populations with

77
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:21,710
naturally reproducing populations.
As we've seen,

78
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:26,711
cancers are produced by mutations and
mutations occur when cells divide and

79
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:30,680
cells divide in breasts and ovaries.
During every menstrual cycle.

80
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,740
Hunter gatherer females were pregnant or
lactating for much more of their lives

81
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,290
than our women in post
industrial societies.

82
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,870
As a result,

83
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,190
they could expect about 150
menstrual cycles per lifetime,

84
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:51,191
whereas a postindustrial woman can expect
to have 350 to 400 menstrual cycles

85
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:52,964
per lifetime.

86
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,850
That implies about three times the risk
of reproductive and cells that divide

87
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:00,020
during menstrual cycles.

88
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:01,710
Yeah.

89
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,220
Well, obesity also increases the risk of
reproductive cancers because fat cells

90
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:10,240
release estrogen and in Post
Menopausal American women,

91
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:15,241
obesity increases the risk
of breast cancer 2.5 times
as compared with women who

92
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,384
are not obese.

93
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,410
So female reproductive cancers do have
an association with oral contraceptives,

94
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:25,270
but it's complex and nuanced.

95
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,270
Yeah.

96
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,800
Women who use oral contraceptives to have
more of a menstrual cycles than women

97
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:33,930
who are experiencing natural fertility.

98
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:35,440
Yeah.

99
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,710
However, the impact of oral
contraception is complicated.

100
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,130
Okay.

101
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,090
The use of oral contraceptives does
increase the risk of breast cancer,

102
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,690
but at the same time,
it decreases the risk of ovarian cancer.

103
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,060
The effects roughly cancel out with
little net change in cancer risk.

104
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,980
So to summarize,

105
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,170
the cardiovascular diseases are mismatched
diseases that have multiple causation

106
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,380
mediated by inflammation,
macrophages and cholesterol.

107
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,400
The risk factors are physical inactivity,
poor diet, obesity, drinking, smoking,

108
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:11,510
and emotional stress,

109
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:15,740
all of which contribute to the growth of
arterial plaque who's rupture then can

110
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:18,170
cause myocardial infarct or stroke.

111
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,940
The risk of a female reproductive cancer
is affected both by oral contraception

112
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,140
in by obesity.

113
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,090
Women are now experiencing many more
menstrual cycles per lifetime than they

114
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:35,530
used to, and the fat cells of
obese women also secrete estrogen,

115
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,630
both cause cells in breast and
ovaries to divide. However,

116
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:44,680
oral contraception has opposite effects
on the risks of breast and ovarian

117
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:47,680
cancer effects that roughly
cancel each other out.
