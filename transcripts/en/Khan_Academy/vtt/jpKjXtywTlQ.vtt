00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.460
Find the area of
rhombus ABCD given

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.150
that the radii of the circles
circumscribed about triangles

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.070
ABD and ACD are 12.5
and 25, respectively.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.380
So let's draw
ourselves rhombus ABCD.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.260
So let's draw a rhombus.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.760
So let me draw it.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.600
Here we go.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620
That's a decent rhombus
right over there.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.520
We know that all the sides
of a rhombus are equal.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.800
And let's label the vertices.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.370
So vertex A, B, C, D. So
there we go, rhombus ABCD.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.110
And then they say the
radii of the circle

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.740
circumscribed about
triangles ABD--

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.530
so triangle ABD, that's A,
B, D. That is triangle ABD.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.180
So let's draw out the circle.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.980
Let's draw-- its circumcircled.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.020
It's circumscribed
circle, or the circle

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.170
that passes through the
vertices A, B, and D. So

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.519
let me do my best job at that.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.860
So it would look something--
this is not a trivial thing

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.360
to do.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.460
It's not always easy.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.710
So let's do it like that.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.410
There we go.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.280
That's its circumscribed
circle, or it's

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.000
the circle circumscribed
about ABD right over there.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.260
Now they're telling us
that its diameter is 12.5--

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.510
so they're saying that this
diameter right over here,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.150
so if I were to draw a diameter
of this circle right over here,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.250
it is 12.5.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.730
Now, the other circle-- the
circumcircle for triangle ACD,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.480
so let's draw ACD.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.320
So let's draw a circle that can
go through these three points.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.585
It looks like it would have
to be something like this.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.750
It looks like it would have to
be a somewhat bigger circle,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.250
and that gels with
the information

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.150
that they gave us,
the way I drew it.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.889
So the circle would look
something like that.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.835
I don't want to
spend too much time

00:02:11.835 --> 00:02:12.960
trying to draw that circle.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.651
But they're telling us that
it's-- I should be very

00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:17.150
careful.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.960
They're saying that the radius
is 12.5, not the diameter.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.362
So let me make it very clear.

00:02:21.362 --> 00:02:22.820
Actually, let me
delete that circle

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.682
since it's just so messy.

00:02:24.682 --> 00:02:28.040
And I can delete that 12.5 too.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.750
Let me get-- there you go.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.900
So the 12.5 is the radius,
the radii of the circle.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.710
So this first circle around
ABD-- around triangle ABD--

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.030
this distance right
over here is 12.5.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.310
This distance over
here is also 12.5.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.475
Now, let's focus
on triangle ACD.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.500
Let's focus on that triangle.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:03.630
Its circumcircle will
look something like this.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.500
Let me draw.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.790
There you-- oh, that
doesn't look too good.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.840
There you go.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.186
Something like that.

00:03:10.186 --> 00:03:12.560
The whole point here isn't
trying to draw a circumcircle.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.040
But it's a circle that will
go through those three points.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.980
And it has a radius of 25.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.100
So if you had its center, if I
were to draw a diameter of it,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.610
it is 25.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.610
Fair enough.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.647
Now, we would need to figure out
the area of rhombus ABC and D.

00:03:35.647 --> 00:03:38.230
Now, if you've been seeing the
videos that I've been uploading

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.800
lately, I've actually
been uploading

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.340
a few of the
prerequisites for this.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.420
Because there is a formula,
and we proved the formula

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.520
in the geometry and the
competition math playlist.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.910
We proved the formula that
relates the area of a triangle

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.550
to the radius of
its circumcircle.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.270
And let me just rewrite the
formula right over here.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.170
The formula is the radius
of a triangle's circumcircle

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.805
is equal to the product
of the triangle's sides.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.140
All of that over 4 times
the area of the triangle.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.959
So let's see if we can use this
formula that we have proved

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.490
in a previous video to figure
out areas of triangle ABD--

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.830
or express them somehow--
and triangle ACD and then

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.590
see if we can use
that information

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.950
to figure out the area
of the entire rhombus.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.530
So let me redraw it a
little bit because I

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.286
think my diagram's
gotten kind of messy.

00:04:40.286 --> 00:04:41.410
So I'll redraw the rhombus.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.700
We actually won't even have
to draw the circumcircles,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.180
or the circumscribed
circles, because we

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.710
know this formula
right over here.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.980
So this is A, B, C,
and D. Now, let's

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.970
think first about triangle ABD.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.230
Actually, let me just
draw the diagonals here.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.650
BD is one of the diagonals.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.280
AC is another one
of the diagonals.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.790
We know that the
diagonals of a rhombus

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.270
are perpendicular bisectors.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.760
We know that that's
a right angle.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.470
That's a right angle.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.345
That's a right angle.

00:05:19.345 --> 00:05:20.430
That's a right angle.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.930
And we know that this length
is equal to this length,

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.300
and we also know that that
length is equal to that length.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.920
Now, if we knew this green
length here or this blue length

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.400
here, we would be able to figure
out the area of the rhombus.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.680
Let's label them.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.650
Let's call this lowercase a,
and let's call this length

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.390
over here lowercase
b. a times b times 1/2

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.630
would be the area of this
triangle right over there.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.010
a times b times 1/2
times 2 would give us

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.530
this area and that area.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.970
Or another way to
think about it,

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.000
this triangle is
completely congruent.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.780
It has sides a, b, and
this side over here.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.810
All of these four triangles
have those three sides,

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.570
so all four of these
triangles are congruent.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.460
So you could take the
area of this triangle,

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.620
multiply it by 4-- you have
the area of the rhombus.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.920
Let me write this down.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.480
The rhombus area is
equal to 4 times 1/2ab.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.030
1/2ab gives us just this
triangle right over here.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.780
4 times that, so 4
times 1/2ab is 2ab,

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.550
is going to be the
area of the rhombus.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.590
If we can somehow
figure out a and b,

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.990
we can figure out
the rhombus' area.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.330
So let's focus on this
first piece of information.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.840
Let's focus on
triangle AB and D. Now

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.290
they tell us that its
circumradius is 12.5.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.400
So let's just use this
formula right over here.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.330
We get 12.5.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.260
It's circumradius is 12.5
is equal to the product

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.240
of the length of the sides.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.660
So what's the length
of the sides here?

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.520
So we have this side
right over here, side bd.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.860
That's just going
to be 2a, right?

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.700
That's an a plus
another a, so it's

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.930
going to be 2a, times
this side right over here.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.740
What's this side,
which is just one

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.090
of the sides of the rhombus.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.800
Well, this is the hypotenuse
of this right triangle

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.970
right over here, right?

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.420
This is a right angle.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.890
So it's going to be the
square root of a squared

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.650
plus b squared.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.400
But all of the sides
are going to be that.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.210
It's a rhombus.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.650
All the sides are the same--
a squared plus b squared.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.110
They're all going to have
that exact same length.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.360
So the product of
the sides-- you

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.710
have 2a-- that's the length of
bd-- times the length of ba,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.890
which is going to be the
square root of a squared

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.380
plus b squared, times
the length of ad,

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.350
which is the square root of
a squared plus b squared.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:08.400
All of that over
4 times the area.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.565
4 times the area of ABD.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.520
Now, what's the
area of a, b, and d?

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.150
Well, ABD is just two of these
triangles right over here.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.780
This guy right
over here is 1/2ab.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.110
This guy over here
is also 1/2ab.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.380
So the entire area is going
to be two of these guys,

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.330
so it's just going
to be a times b.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.690
It gives you the area of
both of these triangles.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.230
Each of them are 1/2ab.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:41.697
So instead of writing area
right here, I could write ab.

00:08:41.697 --> 00:08:42.280
Now let's see.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:47.724
This simplifies to
12.5, is equal to.

00:08:47.724 --> 00:08:49.640
Divide the numerator and
the denominator by 2.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.473
So that becomes a 1.

00:08:50.473 --> 00:08:52.090
That becomes a 2, divided by a.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.480
That becomes a 1.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.436
That becomes a 1.

00:08:54.436 --> 00:08:56.310
Square root of a squared
plus b squared times

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.935
square root of a
squared plus b squared

00:08:57.935 --> 00:09:01.710
is just a squared
plus b squared.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.885
And the denominator,
we're just left with a 2b.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.270
So this first piece
of information,

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:13.310
the circumradius
for ABD being 12.5,

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.970
gives us this equation
right over here.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.500
Now, let's do the same
thing for triangle ACD.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.670
It's circumradius is 25.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:34.520
25 is equal to the
length of this side.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.370
This is a b.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.205
This is also a b, so
it's going to be 2b.

00:09:38.205 --> 00:09:40.470
2b times the length
of this side,

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.380
which is just the square root
of a squared plus b squared,

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.900
times the length of this
side, which is, again,

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:52.850
just the square root of
a squared plus b squared.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.930
All of that over
4 times the area.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.750
Now, the area, once
again-- it's this triangle,

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.040
which is 1/2ab, plus
this triangle, which

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.210
is another 1/2ab.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.462
You add them together,
you just get ab.

00:10:05.462 --> 00:10:10.402
You just get ab, 2 divided
by 2, you get a 1 there.

00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:11.110
You get a 2 here.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.940
Divide by b, get a 1.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.600
That just becomes an a.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.770
And so you get 25 is
equal to the numerator,

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.700
square root of a
squared b squared

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.890
times itself is just going
to be a squared plus b

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:29.970
squared over 2a.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.170
So that second triangle,
its circumradius being 25

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.174
gives us this equation
right over here.

00:10:35.174 --> 00:10:36.340
Now we can use both of this.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.130
We have two equations
with two unknowns.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.280
Let's solve for a and b.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.230
If we know a and b, we can then
go back here and figure out

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.930
the rhombus's area.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:50.720
So over here, we get-- let's
multiply both sides by 2b.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:57.420
We get 25b is equal to a
squared plus b squared.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.480
Over here, if we multiply
both sides by 2a,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:06.420
we get 50a is equal to a
squared plus b squared.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.850
So 50a is equal to a
squared plus b squared.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.250
25b is equal to a
squared plus b squared.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.380
So 25b must be the
same thing as 50a.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.610
They're both a squared
plus b squared.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:22.090
So we get 25b must
be equal to 50a.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.800
They're both equal to a
squared plus b squared.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:34.230
Now, divide both sides by
25, you get b is equal to 2a.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.377
b is equal to--
actually I wanted

00:11:36.377 --> 00:11:37.460
to do that in the magenta.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.800
b is equal to 2a.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.080
So we can take this information
and then now substitute back

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.614
into either one of these
equations to solve for b,

00:11:50.614 --> 00:11:51.780
and then we can solve for a.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.380
So let's go back into this one.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.220
So we get 50a-- actually
we'll solve for a first.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.200
50a is equal to a
squared plus b squared.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.350
Instead of writing b squared, we
know b is the same thing as 2a,

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.040
so let's write 2a squared.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:17.650
So we get 50a is equal to
a squared plus 4a squared.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:25.030
Or we get 50a is
equal to 5a squared.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.650
We could divide
both sides by 5a.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:32.210
If we divide this
side by 5a, we get 10.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.300
And if we divide this
side by 5a, we get a.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.469
So a is equal to 10.

00:12:36.469 --> 00:12:38.260
And then we could just
substitute back here

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.050
to figure out b.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.150
2 times a is equal to b.
b is equal to 2 times 10,

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.490
which is equal to 20.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.054
So we know a is 10. b is 20.

00:12:48.054 --> 00:12:49.470
We just have to
go right back here

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.710
to figure out the
area of the rhombus.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.060
The area of the rhombus
is equal to 2 times-- a

00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:00.120
was 10-- 2 times 10 times 20.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.870
This is 20 times 20.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.340
This is equal to 400.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.290
And we're done.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.390
The area of rhombus ABCD is 400.
