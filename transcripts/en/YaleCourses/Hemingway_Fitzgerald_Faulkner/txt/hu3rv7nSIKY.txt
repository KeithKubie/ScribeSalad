Speaker 1:          00:09          So I'm just want to go back very briefly to Hemingway's. Um, leather to dawn does pass. It was just two reminders. Um, what we, um, are up against this claim on Hemingway's pot. Um, and there's this, George Kaufman is here and she claims they want to cut it all out. Indian Cam story because the ENL time chapters, Jesus, I view our sharp to how about it? Of course they can do it because the stuff is so tight and hard and everything hands on everything else. So you know, this is the um, very recognizable, a pasture on the part of Hemingway that everything is tight and hot and everything hangs on everything else. So, but giving the publication history of um, the various chapters and also the stories published separately, um, you know, whether or not there is in fact, um, and organic unity among them. There's the big question.

Speaker 1:          01:08          And last time, um, you know, we try to give him the benefit of the doubt and we read the intro chapters and the stories as they've, they were indeed organically, um, integral, um, to one another. So today will, um, try that. Try a, some other combinations. Uh, but I found this picture of Hemingway and those parcels. Um, so you know, Hemingway is to the far right and there's those parcels to the far left. And, um, I was always loved this. Um, and, and they actually both rolled about war. Those parcels has a novel called three novels, a three soldiers, uh, very, very, uh, great novel about war as well. So, you know, you can sort of see that they have a lot in common. Um, and um, here's another input in a leather, uh, two M and Wilson. Um, this is, um, slightly earlier, um, finish the book of 14 stories with a chapter in our time between each to give the picture of the whole between examining it in detail, like looking with your eyes as something, say a passing coastline and then looking at at it with 15 x binoculars or rather than maybe looking at it and then going in and living in it and then coming out and looking at it again, it has a pretty good unity.

Speaker 1:          02:41          So once again, that all important word for having way, um, pretty good unity. And that's a very strong claims, not really pretty good. It's damn good. Um, but in any case, uh, was all with new about this, um, description, um, is the idea of zooming in, zooming out rate. This is very much the approach that we've been taking. Um, and we've been thinking of it in terms of micro and macro rate. So this, um, the first set of terms that we started out with, um, and today I'd like to add a few more terms. There's also line up, um, in kind of similar way, obviously not the same, um, but they are kind of interrelated. So micro, macro, um, obviously up close from a distance, um, before and after. That's especially important when the soldiers coming back home. Uh, what happened during a war, what happened after the war, um, and going along with that intensity of the experience when you're in the war and as we know from the story.

Speaker 1:          03:48          So it was just home, the staleness of it when you come back. Um, and then another pair of Toms is very important to our class actually is trategy and comedy. Um, since this is all writing class, I also wanted to stop for just one minute and talk about this as a kind of a useful, uh, analytic and organizational structure to use, um, in your papers. Um, so start out with one pair of analytic terms and then try out the various variations of that term, um, in the course of the paper. Um, and that will give you a really tight structure is that there's what, how many weight ones? Um, so I'll explain this more, but just keep this in your mind. Um, you know, thing of your papers, um, as theme and very Asian use, inventing different terms, um, that would allow for that theme and variation structured.

Speaker 1:          04:40          So we talk more about the substance of implication of that. But for now, I think that this is really what Hemingway himself, um, is doing because such a great writers, good example to us. Um, so anyway, um, the for today we'll be looking at for a possible clusters, you know, want to emphasize that these are just conjectural clusters. Um, we can test them. Um, the first one is a chapter seven and soldiers home. Uh, and then we'll be looking at chapter nine and Mr and Mrs. Elliott, hilarious story. Um, chapter 10 and cat in the rain. And then chapter 12, um, and bake two hearted river, part two. Um, so first chapter seven, um, once again, we're back in wartime Europe. The experience of combat, uh, while the bombardment was knocking the tranche two pieces f Asada, he leave very flat and sweated and pray, Oh, Jesus Christ, get me out of here.

Speaker 1:          05:45          Dear Jesus, please get me out. Jesus, please, please, please Christ the shelling. Move further up the line. We went to work on a trend and in the morning the sun came up and the day was hot and muggy and cheerful and quiet. Then that's night back at Maestra. He did not tell to go. He went upstairs with at a villa Rosa about Jesus, and he never told anybody. So this is the suit of the class dynamics of before and after, and the intensity of the experience when you're in the thick of the battle and the sense that you really have lost it all, um, ones that experience is behind you. Um, so what Hemingway is exploring here and that he would, we'll see you also explore in greater length in soldier's home. Um, is that in transitive relation of emotions across time is a terrible thing.

Speaker 1:          06:52          Um, you know, we think so much about the question of sustainability is important for things to be sustainable across time. Um, and it seems that Hemingway is saying they're basically intense emotions are not sustainable across time. And we'll see it as in a big way, Ashley in Faulkner, in the sound, the fury in the Quentin section, whether or not we're even when we're devastated by something, whether or not that sense of devastation, uh, will be with us even a short moment afterwards. Um, so it seems that when he's fearing, you know, in, in this kind of more a fear for his life, um, Jesus, um, and that's really a kind of a name for something. You know, it's not necessarily Jesus, although in this case it actually is Jesus. But Jesus could also be a shorthand for something that we really want just to invoke.

Speaker 1:          07:47          And it's very much a presence for is that moment. And then the meaning of Jesus has completely lost even the next night. Um, so, um, was, was, was interesting and I guess quite bleak about is, um, is that we really can hold on to our own experience. Right? You know, we'd like to think that if we've been through this, that is ours for good is ours for life. Um, and it seemed snap to the case. So, uh, let's move on now to soldiers home. Um, and you know, we, no, um, I'm just realizing that Mike is all the way down. Um, we know that there's crabs was a soldier fighting in basically all the famous battles in world war one. Um, and then he, he comes home too late. So by which time, all the other people have been bad in that Italian stories about war atrocities.

Speaker 1:          08:41          So, you know, there were these listening, um, to him anymore. Um, and his mother's, she was worried that he should find a job. Um, so this is, um, the, the very, um, near the middle, just one line near the middle of the story that having breakfast, a craft is reading the papers and learning about, um, you know, um, his father not wanting to people to be roughed up. Um, and then meanwhile perhaps looked at the bacon fat hardening on his plate. Um, and I think that that is in some sense the most graphic metaphor for the Hemingway has come up with material emblem of our own relation to our own experience. That this is the chemical transformation, you know, is so natural. I mean, last time we talked about the naturalization of pain, right? You know, childbirth is as natural as rain and the pain that we inflict on all of this is also as natural as rain.

Speaker 1:          09:41          Um, and here, um, for fresh experience to go stale, it is as natural as the bacon becoming stale on your plate. Um, so that's just kind of, uh, you know, using a very common object, um, to talk about the fate of emotions across time. Uh, and the fact that to go on living, um, is not accumulative. Um, there's a loss and tell the longer you live mean this is a terrible thing. You know, we like to think that some things can be cumulative, but according to this paradigm, um, it's almost as if the longer you live, the more you lose actually. And we know that Hemingway actually chose to end his own life, right? So this is almost a kind of, um, I mean, he wasn't thinking of suicide at that point at this early point, but it's almost a justification for suicide that you want and it at the moment of greatest intensity and prayers, emotional satisfaction, you don't want to lose that.

Speaker 1:          10:53          Um, so there's that. The Bacon fat hardening on his plate. Um, and then the very, and of the story, well that was all over now anyway, he would go over to the school yard and watch how and plate indoor basketball. Um, no detail is trivial. No detail is random. Well, not always, but quite often, I mean, you know, this is very significant is how, um, in Hemingway, um, and is once, it's almost the kind of, um, uh, kind of a larger, um, slightly larger view of moving away from the bacon fat on the plate to the larger family situation. Um, craps was a very good soldier during World War One. He's not a very efficient player instead of Lillian life, right? Helen is the players just in the early the basketball, basketball player, but she's also a player in a bigger sense. It's just more consequential in life than Krebs ever would be.

Speaker 1:          12:00          Uh, and it's the sadness of being consequential, been Ali consequential, important, very good at what you're doing in one context and being terrible being, you know, not attended to and not listen to, uh, being completely on the side lines once, uh, you put in a different kind of situation. So crabs is on the sidelines, a mere spectator, um, as Helen plays both the indoor basketball and also the game of life that he's probably not going to be very good at. Um, so obviously that these, I think these two stories, um, the connection between them very, very tight. Um, you know, they are in two different settings, but they really are making your sadly the same point. Um, so let's move on now to more interesting, kind of not so quite so clear cut, uh, between chapter nine. Um, and Mr and Mrs. Elliott. Uh, so it's, um, in many ways the kind of Hemingway that we're very familiar with, the Hemingway in the sun also rises to Hemingway who talked about bar fights and he also does it in a death in the afternoon.

Speaker 1:          13:16          Um, so this is, um, the kind of classic Hemingway. Um, the first, except there's a twist here. Um, the first matador got the horn through his sought hand and the crowd who did him, the second matador slip and the ball court in through the belly, he hung onto the horn with one hand and how the other tight against the place and a ball rammed him where am against the wall. And a horn came out and he lay in the sand and then got up like crazy drunk and tried to slug the man carrying him out, carrying him away and yeah, offers, sought the, he fainted. The kit came out and had to kill five balls because you can't have more than three. Matadors. Um, you know, this is the emotion I think that actually is the dominant emotion in, in no time. This isn't exactly tragedy.

Speaker 1:          14:14          It doesn't rise to the level of tragedy, but it's not exactly funny eater. And this is really the combination of the tragedies, lash, comedy, um, that is so important to having way. Um, nobody gets killed except for the ball five of them. Um, but that's supposed to happen. Um, the first would be to completely incompetent and matadors. Um, they're making a fast, really of the ball fight. Um, and meanwhile it's also farcical in a different way that you have to split by the roofs. Even the two first two matadors and a complete mess of everything. Um, you still have to go by the rules. So he can have more than three matadors. And so one single person is to kill five balls because after Roe, um, so, you know, this is the kind of the combination. We don't know whether to laugh or to cry.

Speaker 1:          15:09          Um, and, um, I guess we laugh, uh, because it's not worth crying over, but it really is not that funny. And this is the nature of the kind of very complicated, dark, um, kind of comedy that we get in Hemingway and that will be getting in Fitzgerald and Faulkner as well. So this is really the common ground. Very interesting. Um, compounding of Java is usually, uh, we used to thinking of tragedy and comedy as two discrete John is quite Sanford, right? But in American literature, um, I mean this is really goes back to the 19th century in American literature. Quite often there's the kind of a mixing of John Arras, uh, with tragedy, uh, been energized Ashley by comedy and producing really interesting, a kind of experimental Jara. Um, so, okay, so that, keep that in mind as well. Both fighting, um, and in competent matadors and then the kid having to clean up the mess.

Speaker 1:          16:15          So it's with seem on the face of it, it was seemed that that really couldn't have any relation to Mr and Mrs. Elliott, which has nothing to do with or fighting about a poleward or someone who's trying to be a poet and his wife and stuff. Uh, but this very interesting history behind this story. Um, and Mr Mrs. Elliott with the story was first published in the little review last time. We talked about how um, a lot of the pieces came out in little magazines, right? So this is the little review, um, 19, 24 and 25 edition. Um, and then it came out again in our time, obviously, um, the liver right addition, uh, the American edition 1925. Um, and it turns out the Hemingway actually has written very telling leather to Horace liberal rate. Um, can see it here. I mean, actually I think that if you go to classes for you to look at the image online, you should be able to zoom in and actually look at all the words.

Speaker 1:          17:23          But anyway, this is the transcript of one of the paragraphs. Um, as you will see, I have revised the Mr and Mrs. Elliott Story and entirely eliminated the obscene image. It is a shame. It had to be a change, but as you say, it would be a very silly play to get the entire first book suppressed for the sake of a few funny cracks. In one story, Jamie, he ran it in this original form. This is still a little review editor of a little review. Uh, Jane, he ran it in original form and did not get into any trouble. Okay. So with talking about a libel suit that looks like, um, that, um, legal action could be visited upon Hemingway because of the story. So what could be the cause for this legal action against Hemingway? Um, the title of the story is suggestive, right? You know, Allie, there's a kind of very important name and both American division, British literature, very, very important name.

Speaker 1:          18:36          Um, this is, ts Elliot obviously are known to having way they were, they, they were in the same circles. And um, and um, both in England and also in, uh, in France. Um, and, um, ts Elliot with one of the most important poets, 20th century poets, best known for the pump, the wasteland, uh, would go on in 1948 to win the Nobel prize. So, you know, major poet, um, and uh, he, um, this is a picture of, um, of his first wife, Vivian and hourly this on the far right and Vivian is on the far left. Um, and it was the marriage that ended in divorce and with Vivian having lost the loss of mental problems. So in this kind of very, uh, public, uh, dissolution of the marriage were very painful. Ashley when she was clearly going crazy. Um, so, um, it, the, the Hemingway story isn't really about that, but it's really making fun of something that really didn't end up being all that funny.

Speaker 1:          19:48          I mean, there was a candidate who ran this episode, uh, into this alley is live. Um, but the way that having way is talking about it initially, um, is, um, is this, uh, this is his version and as you will see is actually changed the spelling, right? Ts Elliot, just one hour. Um, and so it was just to remove the threat of legal action from himself. I has changed the spelling of Elliot. Um, and this is the story that he tells. Mrs. Elliott and a girlfriend now slept together in the big, muddy, evil bad. They had many a good cry together in the evening. They all said at dinner together in a garden on the plane tree and the heart evening when drew and Elliot drank white wine and Mrs. Elliott and the girlfriend make and they were all quite happy. Once again, you know, this is the happy ending in quotation mouth in Hemingway.

Speaker 1:          20:56          Um, so, but you can really see why this would, that, that, that Ellie is at least ts Elliot, um, with contemplate legal action, um, against, um, Henry obviously the suggestion of a lesbian relationship. Um, not, um, really, uh, there was nothing actually in the actual life of Vivian. Elijah suggested there was a lesbian relation. Um, she did have an affair very soon after she was married to ts Elliot. Um, but with a man, um, Bertrand Russell actually a famous philosopher. Um, so, um, there was this, this, this is complete fabrication on a par that Hemingway. Um, but I think that this actually possibly something else there's mixed into this story is the less than relationship that starts this from being a tragedy. Right? You know, it really would have been quite tragic. Um, you know, if the girlfriend had not been there, but it's really this re triangle or relation that enables Mr Elliot to drink white wine and to spend all night writing poetry.

Speaker 1:          22:01          He doesn't, especially wanting to be in the same room with his wife, um, and misses alley and the girlfriend have many a good cry together in the Beckman that you've all bear. Um, and they were all quite happy. So, um, Hemingway really, um, is in one sense thinking of the historic, uh, ts Elliot and Vivian Alec. But I think that he was also actually thinking of another couple, very good friends of his, at one point he talks about a great length in the Moodle or fees and other iconic figure in American and the ratio of Gertrude Stein and her companion. Um, lifelong companion, Ashley, uh, Lsb Tacos desk, Gertrude Stein on the right and aloes, um, on the left. Um, and um, Hemingway also makes fun of them in the movie blow fees, but, um, he, if I'm actually, if you guys have seen Willie Allen's midnight in Paris, um, you haven't seen it, try to see it on DVD, but that goes through the, is very, very important there as it's really a mentor, um, to, to have anyway, I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          23:17          Um, you know, where actually thought of, I'm showing this but it's still running. So you know, we don't have it on DVD. You show it. Um, but in any case, if you see that Woody Allen movie, you will see the go to Stan was crucial, um, both to other young writers, but also the Hemingway. Um, and so, uh, very, um, long lasting. This was actually a sustainable relationship, the lesbian relationship FALive really, um, and happy as much as any relationship can be happy. Those were very, very happy. So I think that we'll have in way is as is done actually, um, to produce this, um, tragedies slash comedy, um, is to compound the very unhappy ts Elliot a marriage to Vivian with much happier companionship between Gertrude Stein and Lsb told us. Um, and, um, he really wasn't thinking of, um, live or from Gertrude Stein. She was not mentioned by name, uh, but she could not, not have been on his mind.

Speaker 1:          24:25          So it was just a really interesting, uh, kind of a capsule summary, actually have a lot of American literature, um, in there. Um, so I think that that's really the connection, uh, with, uh, chatter, NY, um, Nelson most of the subject matter and there's no ball filing in the story. Um, but the kind of the tragedy, uh, narrowly averted, uh, turning into a comedy of kind of a farce, uh, halfway between comedy and saw us, um, that is the ultimate outcome of their kind of unusual arrangement. Um, and, but still, you know, it doesn't rise to the level of tragedy. Um, and that's the most important point for him in weight. So, um, less move on now to the next cluster. Um, and I should stop here for a moment. Um, and talk a little bit about, um, the kind of the straw analytic structure that we'll be using for the next, um, next set, uh, of, um, stories and chapters.

Speaker 1:          25:34          Um, but actually beginning with chapter nine and Mr and Mrs. Elliott, we, we're beginning to see a kind of a logic of substitution so that Gertrude Stein Alice be tacos a relationship taking the place, the, there's relatively happy relationship taking the place of the unhappy historical relation between Vivian and hears Elliot so that Hemingway you can get to a place where he wants to be. Um, and so taking the place, um, substitution is a good thing in their chapter and, um, in their story, um, we'll explore the many, the meaning of substitution in the other clusters. Um, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not so good. Um, it's always kind of a mix mixture. Um, but, um, on the whole, I would say that Hemingway's is, is much more interested in comedy than, than tragedy. Um, and I'm sort of going against Aristotle and in fact, the whole tradition, uh, western thinking about Jaras tragedy is the high, a dignified, very dignified are a Greek tragedy.

Speaker 1:          26:57          Um, and that's what really ever sallowed hotspot in the poetics is his attention is really all given to tragedy. Comedy gets about two lines in the poetics. Um, so, you know, I think that, um, tragedy just has the different kind of sensuality to, uh, to the entire western Canon. Umm, but comedy arguably is actually just as interesting and just as complex. So, um, in the rest of the course we'll be thinking about the ways in which comedy Ashley is right next door to Chaz today. Um, you know, we have to rethink the landscape, um, rather than thinking of these two as being on opposite ends of the spectrum, um, to think about kind of, um, almost kind of like emotional proximity between tragedy and comedy. I'm not, because this is a natural trumps dimity but because the riders that we are looking at, um, they tend to have that really kind of interesting kind of thinking and mixing of genres.

Speaker 1:          27:58          Um, so in the next, um, cluster chapter 10 and cat in the rain, uh, well first of all, look at, um, one kind of substitution taking place in chapter 10, um, the horse and pick a door, uh, and then the cat and the cat in the rain. Um, I should mention that, um, there's a difference between the picador and um, matador. Um, this is a distinction that I didn't know about before I started reading about having way, um, is that the matador is the one who actually stinks. You know, who, who actually kills the ball, the ball. Um, the picador his function is to weaken the ball. The picador never actually kills the bull, so it was always a kind of a three step ceremony ball by the time he comes up Bullis weekend already, uh, by very few sticking knives into him. Um, and then they'll pick, the dog tries to do major job of weakening the ball.

Speaker 1:          28:58          Um, and then the matador comes out and actually kills the ball. Um, and the, the picador doesn't actually come out on foot. He's always, um, on a horse. And, um, and we, um, find out how Hemingway feels about that practice, um, about a picador coming out on a horse and fighting with the ball. Um, they web where the white horse on the legs and he kneed himself out. The picador twisted the stirrup straight and Paul and hauled up into the saddle, the horses and trails and down in the blue bunch and swung backward and forward as he began to cantor. The Ma knows whacking him on the back of his legs to Abrazo some terrible thing. Ashley, this has been bad. It's been banned in many Spanish cities, um, because it's just so, um, incredibly cruel. And here are two images, uh, of, um, that kind of substitution, shameless use of the horse as a shield against the ball.

Speaker 1:          30:11          Um, and um, we can see, um, the expressions on the, I mean, you know, they used to it, I mean, this is done all the time. This is not exceptional. Colanders on part of the pig a door. That's the, that's part of the game. Um, and uh, but still it's very hard to take when you're looking at it and, um, to, to see that Andrea was actually coming up right at that moment. Um, and here's another image. There's just countless images. Um, all you have to do is to type in pig the doors, Hawes on Google, and you find all these images. Um, so, um, is, um, Hemingway, even though he's a big, uh, Aficionados, um, of the matador coming out and we'll see his celebration of this one on one battle, the train, the matador and the Horse, um, just finds this practice. Oh, they're despicable.

Speaker 1:          31:06          I mean, this is really substitution at its worst. Um, and so he's talking about, you know, this kind of, um, just just kind of, um, you know, it's, it's hard to wrap our minds around. Um, you know, there's kind of completely ritualized, uh, practice. Um, and so that's what he talks about. Um, in chapter 10 and then in cat, in the rain, once again, there's no thematic continuity, right? Between, uh, the chapter 10 and the cat in the rain about when that young American couple in the hotel completely nonviolent, um, setting. Um, and it doesn't seem very dramatic either. In some sense it seems as if nothing happens in that story. Um, but, uh, there is a kind of interesting, um, way in which we can create that story, um, as a story about substitution as well. Um, in the sense that the young way does have one very emphatic desire.

Speaker 1:          32:11          Anyway, I want a cat. She said, I want a cat, I want a cat. Now if I can have long hair and the fun, I can have a cat. So the cat obviously is a shorthand for something else. Right? And she's actually looking at this kitty in the rain trying to hide from the rain under the table and thinking of the cat, uh, and she says, okay, you know, if I can have anything else, I can know my own silver at a table. I can have new clothes, I want a cat. But even those things, eating at the table with my own silver, even bad, it's probably just a metaphor for something else as well. Um, and so the wanting a ACAT, the fact that it's such an artificial and, um, persuasive substitution for something that she doesn't have in the life, um, suggest that there is something, um, this very peaceful story, um, does have something in common with a very violent episode, uh, in chapter nine, and it really has to do with, um, with, with, with the way, uh, we think about what is adequate, um, to, you know, what we could call a good life or a good marriage or, you know, good.

Speaker 1:          33:44          Anything. I mean, you know, having ways and really thinking, especially if this story is about, you know, what constitutes a good marriage of what is absent that would make for a bad marriage. Um, but it really is, um, thinking generally and abstractly about what counts as a good life or what kangs as being a good a player in a bowl five, um, and coming out and using your horse as a shield that doesn't count as, as, as, as married. Um, for Hemingway. Um, so um, in, in this case, um, is in the, the wives, if we think about the configuration, she goes out in the rain and umbrella opens up behind her and it's a whole hotel made that opens up their umbrella behind her. Um, she says, I want to care, I want a cat. Um, and in fact I'll just read you the ending of that story.

Speaker 1:          34:47          Um, someone not on page 94, someone knock at the door, Avanti George said he looked up from his book in the doorway, stood the made to how the big tortoise shell cat press tight against her and swung down against her body. Excuse me. It's just that the [inaudible] asked me to bring this person in Europe. First of all, there's kind of a very slight substitution going on cause I don't think it's actually the same cat, this big tortoise shell, cat public isn't the same kitty that she saw earlier in the story. So there's one kind of almost comical substitution going on, but the more important stuff diffusion in the story other than just wanting to care for something else to stand for something else is also that instead of the husband being the emotional support for the wife, it is the hotel apparatus that has substituted, has stepped in and fulfilling that function.

Speaker 1:          35:55          The hotel may is the one who opens them rela when she, the wife steps out into rain. She wants a cat is the hotel staff that brings the cat. So it is, this is, this is, uh, for me this is one of the best and most, um, memorable portraits of, uh, of, of what's missing in a marriage that is just done, you know, in a couple of pages, um, and done completely through a third parties. Right? I mean, so this is his story about supposedly about, has been the web as almost tow completely through the parties to the cat through the hotel may, through the petrol money. Um, and so it says something about having ways, um, strategy as well. And this is really something to think about for all of the riders is how to frame the story and how to populate the story.

Speaker 1:          36:57          Um, and the population, uh, of what is in the foreground, um, in the story isn't necessarily, uh, the, the, you know, the center. I mean, the housemate is front and center in this story. This story isn't really about hope, the hotel me. Um, but nonetheless she is in the foreground as is the cat. Uh, so, you know, what is really, what is this story about? Um, this was a good question to ask actually. This is another question that is related to writing papers. Um, start out by thinking, you know, what is this particular paragraph about? I mean, you know, certain things I know for graph, but it could be, there's something much more marginal, could actually be the real subject of that paragraph. So, you know, it's always a good analytic strategy, um, to go out. Um, you guys never thought isn't mine. Is that my right?

Speaker 1:          37:54          Is that, yeah, for some reason I just thought, um, you know, that would be really a big embarrassment. Um, but, um, in any case, um, so, uh, well I mean, here's a little ag with substitute or whatever. Um, but um, so far we've been, um, talking about, um, the clustering of the stories and the chapters, um, you know, really kind of going in and kind of oblique direction. Right. You know, it's not this, the lack of emotional satisfaction seems to be the main point in artist stories. Um, that's really the, um, the, the kind of the tragedy comedy slash comedy, um, is the lack of adequate emotional resolution. There's just no emotional, uh, resolution at the end of the calendar rain. There's no emotional resolution at the end of soldiers home. Um, there's maybe a little bit of emotional resolution at the end of mister and misses alley, but really not, not that great.

Speaker 1:          39:01          Um, so the question is, um, you know, is, is, is this, um, uh, kind of a natural resting place for Hemingway, you know, is, is that the kind of the emotional landscape, um, that he feels most comfortable with and that will be completely okay. You know, I think that is, is a, is a Bible way of writing. Um, and you can have great literature resting on precisely that very precarious state of lack of emotional, lack of full satisfaction, lack of full resolution, a black thing that Hemingway actually is. It's a slightly different kind of writer. Um, so he, he is, um, quite, um, unashamed of, of going, uh, to, um, to kind of, uh, sometimes almost embarrassing, extremely sensitive. You don't want to show that this is really what you believe in. So it's embarrassing in this sense. Um, but he's, he's, he's, he's not especially embarrassed, uh, about, uh, about making it very clear, um, what he believes in and what he finds satisfying.

Speaker 1:          40:09          And I think that's really what makes Hemingway, um, what he is a very, in many ways have very emphatic about believe in about emotional space that he would affirm and celebrate. Um, so let's look at chapter 12. This is the combination that shows, uh, that sigh of Hemingway. Um, and, uh, it's, uh, not surprising as back trouble fighting. Uh, but this time it's not the picador on his horse. When he started to kill it was all in the same rush. The ball looking at him straight in front, heating the ball charge and Vallarta charge. And just for a moment they became one filotto became one with the ball and then it was over falafel, standing straight and a red hill of the sword sticking out deli, betraying the balls, shoulders filotto his hand up at the crowd and the ball rolling blood looking straight at him, looking straight over the lotto and easily legs caving.

Speaker 1:          41:22          Um, so some of us with final glory, you know, I don't think that I work and sing the praises of bullfighting. Um, but I think that just to think in terms of what Hemingway is doing for him, this is truly um, sublime and satisfying moment for both the matador and follow ball because the repeated line is that they became one. Right? So, um, they became one that is the supreme ideal for Hemingway. Um, instead of having this, uh, she'll, um, of the horse showing you from the ball, you are in direct contact with the ball and whatever you do, um, you do it in other lack of distance. So you know, this is the contact close up that the diminishment of distance, um, and the two of them really bonding so tightly that it really becomes a kind of a single unit. Um, and that, that this could be a matter of, of any kind of thing, you know, can be a mannerable, can be a man and a woman can be two women, um, can be you and the project you become fuse with.

Speaker 1:          42:39          Um, but for Hemingway, um, this kind of comes theat lack of emotional insulation. We've talked about, uh, the question of insulation in Indian camp, but the complete lack of emotional, uh, insulation between yourself that and suddenly you feel our way passionate about, um, bad for Hemingway is the, is, is the place that he really wants to get to. And all those times where he doesn't get there, you know, you can see that. Why is the kind of a frustrating, a resting place? And he wants us to be frustrated when we can get beyond those places. Um, so this is, um, kind of, um, uh, a very, um, the kind of the classic Hemingway, a moment of epiphany of achieving this union, uh, where the thing that the ball that you're going to kill and the fact that you're going to kill this creature doesn't cling to him.

Speaker 1:          43:34          It doesn't really matter because you've achieved that union at that critical moment. Um, so, um, this is, um, we are not reading the Sun also rises, but this is a almost completely parallel, um, moment in the sun also rises, uh, Pedro Romero, um, killing the ball, the ball charge as Romero of charge. Romero's left hand draft the letter over the balls and muscle to blind in his left shoulder when forward between the horns and sort of went in and for just an instant he and the ball, we're one, right? So you can see that that was one is of critical importance to Hemingway way two entities becoming one. Um, even though that the moment of death and killing, um, it's still important to achieve that oneness with the world. Um, so, you know, it's, I'm sure it's romanticizing bullfighting um, but it's actually one of the rare public demonstrations of that happening.

Speaker 1:          44:46          You know, it's actually very hard. I mean, if we think about this, it's very hard to see two things becoming one in public. So for fighting is actually one of the rare instances when, uh, when everyone can be there and watch. Um, so, um, Hemingway probably was looking for something like this, um, and it's really more like a band, uh, than, than, than actually the killing of the board. Then you can see why he would want to romanticize something like that. It was really completely, uh, choreograph in such a way so that the violence becomes completely, you ritualize. Um, and we don't almost don't see them plot and there's no blood, um, in, in this moment. Um, so anyway, so for, for Hemingway, uh, completely on desire to get to this state here, we're one. Um, so let's move on now. And I have to say I've actually like the big 200 river, much more that than the bull fighting scenes in Hemingway.

Speaker 1:          45:53          Um, this is a great story. Um, in many ways the kind of a rewrite, two part story, a rewrite of crafts coming home, right? So this is also a soldier's home. Um, he's not a man, his family, um, but uh, he is on this trip, um, you know, through a country that is not really disclosed to us landscape. We don't really know where it is. We don't know where he's going or why he's on that trip, but it's a fishing trip. Um, and this is what happens. Uh, uh, at the moment when, uh, Nate catches and nick this is the same neck that we see growing up, the young nick and Indian Cam and the doctors and the other's way of now he's a full grown man, obviously and haven't been in war. Uh, but coming back and going through, um, what appears to be a healing process, but having great so and soldiers home is about a non healing of perhaps, you know, the trauma of war and the trauma of being completely margin Olympian, sideline of those things.

Speaker 1:          47:03          Um, we'll just keep hurting him. Um, in, uh, the case of big too hard at river is a rewrite of that and it's very different outcome coming out from that story. Um, and it has to do actually with those similar dynamics to the bullfighting. Um, so nick cleaned them, slitting the trout and they cleaned them, slipping them from the vent to the tip of the jaw audit in size and the gills and a tongue came out in one piece. They were both males, long ray, white strips of mill, smooth and clean, all the insides clean and Compaq coming out all together. So this is his, uh, justice, emotionally satisfying as the bull fighting. Not in the sense that we don't have to choreograph moping the quite as dramatic and beautiful as an eyeball five. Um, but to be able to expand, uh, the ritual of dying in one piece to the trial, um, that is, you know, we do have to kill the travel.

Speaker 1:          48:18          I mean, you know, unless we're going to go without any kind of, um, animals routine. Um, so, um, the, um, the, the, the travelers speed kill, uh, but, um, the way the man of killing is everything that there should be no degradation, um, in death that the Ashley, the measure of a good life, um, is first your ability to offer a good death to someone else. Right? Yeah. We do this all the time. Um, it makes all the difference in the world, whether we kill Brulee or whether we kill ceremoniously, uh, with full respect for what we call, um, and, uh, it also makes all the difference in the world. Uh, if you die a good death, um, there's really no other conclusion. So, you know, it has to, it has to be a completely clean and satisfy and, um, both to the person who's going or the art to add the creature was going through it and to the person who's performing that operation.

Speaker 1:          49:30          Um, so there's actually, um, as far as I can see, um, Hemingway is actually a very affirmative, uh, writer, um, at the end of, in our time, um, in the sense that he's also revising his long story. Right. You know, is not, he doesn't get to where he wants to be in crab story in. So just home he comes back and tells the story one more time and there's time kicked gas to where he wants to do so. Well, um, uh, say goodbye to him. Wait now and move on to a Fitzgerald and the grid Gaspe on Tuesday.
