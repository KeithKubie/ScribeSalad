alphanumeric characters okay this is
 

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:09.530
alphanumeric characters okay this is
really old but it's still there so shelf

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540
really old but it's still there so shelf
 

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.449
really old but it's still there so shelf
integration that is something like if

shelves into one menu item you can

00:12:36.049 --> 00:12:36.059
shelves into one menu item you can
 

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:39.019
shelves into one menu item you can
actually put in my intent put extra you

00:12:39.019 --> 00:12:39.029
actually put in my intent put extra you
 

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:41.079
actually put in my intent put extra you
put then the shelf shortcut to it and

00:12:41.079 --> 00:12:41.089
put then the shelf shortcut to it and
 

00:12:41.089 --> 00:12:45.049
put then the shelf shortcut to it and
you take then any kind of string for a

00:12:45.049 --> 00:12:45.059
you take then any kind of string for a
 

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:46.759
you take then any kind of string for a
kind of modifier which you actually know

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:46.769
kind of modifier which you actually know
 

00:12:46.769 --> 00:12:48.530
kind of modifier which you actually know
and you actually then reuse it for all

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540
and you actually then reuse it for all
 

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.970
and you actually then reuse it for all
the items you want to put into the same

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:49.980
the items you want to put into the same
 

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.619
the items you want to put into the same
same episode cuts are coming so this is

00:12:54.619 --> 00:12:54.629
same episode cuts are coming so this is
 

00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:57.499
same episode cuts are coming so this is
something which is coming soon it's

00:12:57.499 --> 00:12:57.509
something which is coming soon it's
 

00:12:57.509 --> 00:13:01.189
something which is coming soon it's
there already since I think n mr1 and we

00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199
there already since I think n mr1 and we
 

00:13:01.199 --> 00:13:02.689
there already since I think n mr1 and we
will support them very soon as well

00:13:02.689 --> 00:13:02.699
will support them very soon as well
 

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:05.659
will support them very soon as well
so essentially you can actually actions

00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:05.669
so essentially you can actually actions
 

00:13:05.669 --> 00:13:08.269
so essentially you can actually actions
and any kind of short things which you

00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279
and any kind of short things which you
 

00:13:08.279 --> 00:13:10.400
and any kind of short things which you
want to do in order to to get the user

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:10.410
want to do in order to to get the user
 

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:14.389
want to do in order to to get the user
faster access to things the back button

see there's more information you can

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240
see there's more information you can
 

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.390
see there's more information you can
actually see more things and they are

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:29.400
actually see more things and they are
 

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.570
actually see more things and they are
revealing more stuff so with that let me

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:32.580
revealing more stuff so with that let me
 

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:38.630

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.759
 
so so there's the application and you

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:43.769
so so there's the application and you
 

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:46.370
so so there's the application and you
can resize it and as you can see while

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:46.380
can resize it and as you can see while
 

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.350

I'm resizing it more and more data as IG

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360
I'm resizing it more and more data as IG
 

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.519
I'm resizing it more and more data as IG
coming into play and see more stuff is

00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:52.529
coming into play and see more stuff is

there you go and you see that more and

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:00.870
there you go and you see that more and
 

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.420
there you go and you see that more and
more data is coming in this is all

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:02.430
more data is coming in this is all
 

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.789
more data is coming in this is all
dynamically happening and it's very

00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799
dynamically happening and it's very
 

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:07.250

it you can test it all yourself it's on
 

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.559
it you can test it all yourself it's on
github and there's also an excellent

00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:24.569
github and there's also an excellent
 

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:27.319
github and there's also an excellent
code lab which is actually even showing

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:27.329
code lab which is actually even showing
 

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:29.600
code lab which is actually even showing
more so you can also doing animations

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:29.610
more so you can also doing animations
 

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:30.980
more so you can also doing animations
while you're transforming from one

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:30.990
while you're transforming from one
 

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.750
while you're transforming from one
layout into another which is then

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760
layout into another which is then
 

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.460
layout into another which is then
looking really cool you should check out

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:34.470
looking really cool you should check out
 

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.270
looking really cool you should check out
the code lab for sure

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280
the code lab for sure
 

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.490
the code lab for sure
so how is it being done well first off

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:40.500
so how is it being done well first off
 

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.140
so how is it being done well first off
you need to have a constrained layout

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:42.150
you need to have a constrained layout
 

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.360
you need to have a constrained layout
state file it's like a blueprint which

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:44.370
state file it's like a blueprint which
 

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:45.710
state file it's like a blueprint which
is essentially getting all the different

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720
is essentially getting all the different
 

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.470
is essentially getting all the different
layouts into into some kind of order

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480
layouts into into some kind of order
 

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.039
layouts into into some kind of order
when to use which one and then comes the

00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:52.049
when to use which one and then comes the
 

00:17:52.049 --> 00:17:54.409
when to use which one and then comes the
tricky part every of these layouts need

00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419
tricky part every of these layouts need
 

00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:57.680
tricky part every of these layouts need
to have all UI elements which you use so

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:57.690
to have all UI elements which you use so
 

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.450
to have all UI elements which you use so
if you don't want to see you if you want

00:17:59.450 --> 00:17:59.460
if you don't want to see you if you want
 

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.280
if you don't want to see you if you want
to show it then you simply hide the

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:01.290
to show it then you simply hide the
 

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.530
to show it then you simply hide the
thing if it's hidden it doesn't show but

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:03.540
thing if it's hidden it doesn't show but
 

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.470
thing if it's hidden it doesn't show but
it's still in the layout itself so one

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480
it's still in the layout itself so one
 

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.210
it's still in the layout itself so one
by doing this and in oncreate you will

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.220
by doing this and in oncreate you will
 

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.680
by doing this and in oncreate you will
actually create then the transition in

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:12.690
actually create then the transition in
 

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.180
actually create then the transition in
which you want to use when you want to

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:14.190
which you want to use when you want to
 

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.430
which you want to use when you want to
transition from one to another and you

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440
transition from one to another and you
 

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.590
transition from one to another and you
set the unconstraint changed layout

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600
set the unconstraint changed layout
 

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.810
set the unconstraint changed layout
handler you will be able to do to attend

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:23.820
handler you will be able to do to attend
 

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.299
handler you will be able to do to attend
the the pre-layout change handler which

00:18:26.299 --> 00:18:26.309
the the pre-layout change handler which
 

00:18:26.309 --> 00:18:28.280
the the pre-layout change handler which
is then essentially like giving the

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:28.290
is then essentially like giving the
 

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:36.470
is then essentially like giving the
control to the to the to the sorry which

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480
control to the to the to the sorry which
 

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.390
control to the to the to the sorry which
is giving the control to our layout and

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400
is giving the control to our layout and
 

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.070
is giving the control to our layout and
which is doing the transition itself so

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.080
which is doing the transition itself so
 

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.480
which is doing the transition itself so
inside your activity what you have to do

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:47.490
inside your activity what you have to do
 

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.860
inside your activity what you have to do
is you have to add the on configuration

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:48.870
is you have to add the on configuration
 

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.330
is you have to add the on configuration
change handler which is usually being

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:50.340
change handler which is usually being
 

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.990
change handler which is usually being
called every time when something changed

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000
called every time when something changed
 

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.980
called every time when something changed
like the virtual keyboard is

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:52.990
like the virtual keyboard is
 

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:54.300
like the virtual keyboard is
disconnected the screen resolution

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:54.310
disconnected the screen resolution
 

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:58.170
disconnected the screen resolution
changes or anything like that and fine

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:58.180
changes or anything like that and fine
 

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.150
changes or anything like that and fine
well and from there you are essentially

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:00.160
well and from there you are essentially
 

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.550
well and from there you are essentially
calling the constraint changed layout

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:02.560
calling the constraint changed layout
 

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.950
calling the constraint changed layout
Handler to actually let him know what

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960
Handler to actually let him know what
 

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.290
Handler to actually let him know what
the size is and that will actually and

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:07.300
the size is and that will actually and
 

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.440
the size is and that will actually and
do all the work for you and finally you

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:10.450
do all the work for you and finally you
 

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.150
do all the work for you and finally you
will actually add inside the Android

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.160
will actually add inside the Android
 

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.790
will actually add inside the Android
manifest file the requests that you want

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:14.800
manifest file the requests that you want
 

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.370
manifest file the requests that you want
to handle all configuration changes for

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:17.380
to handle all configuration changes for
 

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.700
to handle all configuration changes for
size changes and with that you are done

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:20.710
size changes and with that you are done
 

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:23.040
size changes and with that you are done
if you want to try it out again try the

if you want to try it out again try the
 

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.210
if you want to try it out again try the
code lab to actually get this done so

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:27.220
code lab to actually get this done so
 

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.270

well you have possibly had already a pen

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:35.770
well you have possibly had already a pen
 

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.350
well you have possibly had already a pen
you were trying to draw something and

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360
you were trying to draw something and
 

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.420
you were trying to draw something and
you see there is a lag between drawing

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:39.430
you see there is a lag between drawing
 

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.060
you see there is a lag between drawing
something or using the pen and seeing

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:42.070
something or using the pen and seeing
 

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:45.270
something or using the pen and seeing

where is it coming from well first off

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:49.060
where is it coming from well first off
 

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.030
where is it coming from well first off
you have to read the sender you have to

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:51.040
you have to read the sender you have to
 

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.250
you have to read the sender you have to
do the input processing you have to then

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:53.260
do the input processing you have to then
 

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.410
do the input processing you have to then
do the app code whatever the application

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:55.420
do the app code whatever the application
 

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.510
do the app code whatever the application
is doing you have to do some drawing

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520
is doing you have to do some drawing
 

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.340
is doing you have to do some drawing
with OpenGL and you're actually doing

00:19:59.340 --> 00:19:59.350
with OpenGL and you're actually doing
 

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.440
with OpenGL and you're actually doing
multiple buffering because you have to

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:01.450
multiple buffering because you have to
 

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.670
multiple buffering because you have to
actually pass everything to the

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:02.680
actually pass everything to the
 

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.500
actually pass everything to the
compositor which is in compositing

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:04.510
compositor which is in compositing
 

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.940
compositor which is in compositing
actually everything on the Chrome OS

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:05.950
actually everything on the Chrome OS
 

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.520
actually everything on the Chrome OS
side or whatever you're parading system

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:08.530
side or whatever you're parading system
 

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.620
side or whatever you're parading system
you have the compositing side and it's

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:10.630
you have the compositing side and it's
 

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.180
you have the compositing side and it's
going through the entire pipeline which

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:12.190
going through the entire pipeline which
 

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:16.050
going through the entire pipeline which
might be for for images or whatnot so in

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:16.060
might be for for images or whatnot so in
 

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.850
might be for for images or whatnot so in
total you are coming out to a hundred

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:17.860
total you are coming out to a hundred
 

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.730
total you are coming out to a hundred
milliseconds of delay which is very very

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:20.740
milliseconds of delay which is very very
 

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.880
milliseconds of delay which is very very
noticeable so the ideal thing is of

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:23.890
noticeable so the ideal thing is of
 

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.190
noticeable so the ideal thing is of
course you simply remove all the

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.200
course you simply remove all the
 

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.410
course you simply remove all the
compositing so now we are down to well

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:28.420
compositing so now we are down to well
 

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.450
compositing so now we are down to well
of roughly two frames which is less than

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:30.460
of roughly two frames which is less than
 

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.770
of roughly two frames which is less than
sorry two milliseconds right

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:31.780
sorry two milliseconds right
 

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.440
sorry two milliseconds right
so but if we are adding now also the

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:34.450
so but if we are adding now also the
 

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.600
so but if we are adding now also the
prediction logic to it well then we are

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:36.610
prediction logic to it well then we are
 

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:41.730
prediction logic to it well then we are
really at pretty much zero so mission

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:41.740
really at pretty much zero so mission
 

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.860

right so what I like about this app is
 

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.600
right so what I like about this app is
you know you can rotate you can draw at

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:35.610
you know you can rotate you can draw at
 

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.150
you know you can rotate you can draw at
any angle you can also do layers this is

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:38.160
any angle you can also do layers this is
 

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.549
any angle you can also do layers this is
a infinite painter by the way so what

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559
a infinite painter by the way so what
 

00:21:40.559 --> 00:21:43.250

I've done is I've drawn Spidey ahead of

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:43.260

time and I'm going to ink on top of him
 

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:55.820
time and I'm going to ink on top of him
using some of the inking tools oh I

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:55.830
using some of the inking tools oh I
 

00:21:55.830 --> 00:22:12.940
using some of the inking tools oh I
gotta change my color

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:12.950
 
 

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.860
 
I'm from the school of thought where

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:14.870
I'm from the school of thought where
 

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.870
I'm from the school of thought where
spider-man should have expressive eyes

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880
spider-man should have expressive eyes
 

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.050
spider-man should have expressive eyes
and so I'm glad that they did that in

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:20.060
and so I'm glad that they did that in
 

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:43.540
and so I'm glad that they did that in
the movies

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:43.550
 
 

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:45.250
 
some people don't like doing the webbing

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:45.260
some people don't like doing the webbing
 

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.340
some people don't like doing the webbing
but I do it does add a little bit of

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:48.350
but I do it does add a little bit of
 

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:52.960
but I do it does add a little bit of
time to each panel but it's worth it in

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:52.970
time to each panel but it's worth it in
 

00:22:52.970 --> 00:23:11.660
time to each panel but it's worth it in
the end

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:11.670
 
 

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.370
 
and then of course you can add color as

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:13.380
and then of course you can add color as
 

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:20.060
and then of course you can add color as
well I put in a layer already with a red

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:20.070
well I put in a layer already with a red
 

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:26.350
well I put in a layer already with a red
base and I'm gonna add some shadow to it

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.360
 
 

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.549
 
one of the other features I like about

00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559
one of the other features I like about
 

00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:31.940
one of the other features I like about
this so you can double tap to reset it

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:31.950
this so you can double tap to reset it
 

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:33.410
this so you can double tap to reset it
and then if you hold and long press

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:33.420
and then if you hold and long press
 

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.289
and then if you hold and long press
it'll flip it so as a comic book artists

00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:36.299
it'll flip it so as a comic book artists
 

00:23:36.299 --> 00:23:38.810
it'll flip it so as a comic book artists
I'm always flipping things if I can

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:38.820
I'm always flipping things if I can
 

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:44.350
I'm always flipping things if I can
because it gives you a fresh perspective

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:44.360
 
 

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.430
 
of course there's all kinds of drawing

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440
of course there's all kinds of drawing
 

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.510
of course there's all kinds of drawing
tools that you can use some are more

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520
tools that you can use some are more
 

00:23:50.520 --> 00:24:05.940
tools that you can use some are more
painterly than others

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:05.950
 
 

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.580
 
and what I did was I clipped the shadow

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:08.590
and what I did was I clipped the shadow
 

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.350
and what I did was I clipped the shadow
layer to the layer beneath it which

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360
layer to the layer beneath it which
 

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.680
layer to the layer beneath it which
means that everything I do on this layer

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:13.690
means that everything I do on this layer
 

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.540
means that everything I do on this layer
will be bounded by the layer below it

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:17.550
will be bounded by the layer below it
 

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:25.190
will be bounded by the layer below it
one way to save time

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200
 
 

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.900
 
and of course the other nice thing about

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:26.910
and of course the other nice thing about
 

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:30.080
and of course the other nice thing about
the stylus is it has tilt so in this

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:30.090
the stylus is it has tilt so in this
 

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:37.640
the stylus is it has tilt so in this
case I made tilt depending on which way

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:37.650
case I made tilt depending on which way
 

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:41.420
case I made tilt depending on which way
I hold the pen it will give me a thick

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:41.430
I hold the pen it will give me a thick
 

00:24:41.430 --> 00:25:28.840
I hold the pen it will give me a thick
or thin line

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:28.850
 
 

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:41.379

00:25:41.379 --> 00:25:41.389
 
 

00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:48.749
 
I could do this all day I usually do

00:25:48.749 --> 00:25:48.759
 
 

00:25:48.759 --> 00:25:50.979
 
usually this there aren't this many

00:25:50.979 --> 00:25:50.989
usually this there aren't this many
 

00:25:50.989 --> 00:26:00.600
usually this there aren't this many
people watching while I'm drawing

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:00.610
 
 

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:15.860

00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:18.659
and let's finish it off with some spidey
 

00:26:18.659 --> 00:26:27.580

essentially we have well you can see the
 

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:18.600
essentially we have well you can see the
code and it might change a little bit so

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:18.610
code and it might change a little bit so
 

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.420
code and it might change a little bit so
multi display which is another topic so

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:21.430
multi display which is another topic so
 

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:23.100
multi display which is another topic so
it's a very big topic because the thing

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:23.110
it's a very big topic because the thing
 

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.090
it's a very big topic because the thing
is like on the phone you have two

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:24.100
is like on the phone you have two
 

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.440
is like on the phone you have two
screens right you have the internal

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:25.450
screens right you have the internal
 

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:27.240
screens right you have the internal
screen you have an external screen maybe

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:27.250
screen you have an external screen maybe
 

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:30.150
screen you have an external screen maybe
on a well if you're really creative and

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:30.160
on a well if you're really creative and
 

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.410
on a well if you're really creative and
you have a pixel book Pro you might

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:31.420
you have a pixel book Pro you might
 

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.500
you have a pixel book Pro you might
actually get up to seven screens I'm not

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:34.510
actually get up to seven screens I'm not
 

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.210
actually get up to seven screens I'm not
entirely sure I thought that is possible

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:36.220
entirely sure I thought that is possible
 

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.160
entirely sure I thought that is possible
so anyways but the thing is like what

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:38.170
so anyways but the thing is like what
 

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.950
so anyways but the thing is like what
does it mean for you well actually it

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960
does it mean for you well actually it
 

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.720
does it mean for you well actually it
means a lot because the thing is like

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:42.730
means a lot because the thing is like
 

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:44.310
means a lot because the thing is like
many applications are doing stupid

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320
many applications are doing stupid
 

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.120
many applications are doing stupid
things sorry you are not that right but

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:48.130
things sorry you are not that right but
 

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:49.320
things sorry you are not that right but
the thing is like for example simply

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:49.330
the thing is like for example simply
 

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.930
the thing is like for example simply
using hey I want to get to display the

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:51.940
using hey I want to get to display the
 

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.080
using hey I want to get to display the
display information for display id0

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:54.090
display information for display id0
 

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:56.550
display information for display id0
well which is a default display right

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:56.560
well which is a default display right
 

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.470
well which is a default display right
well the thing is like it's not the

00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480
well the thing is like it's not the
 

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.090
well the thing is like it's not the
default display because what is the

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:00.100
default display because what is the
 

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.070
default display because what is the
default display you don't know that

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080
default display you don't know that
 

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.190
default display you don't know that
right so therefore we have actually if

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200
right so therefore we have actually if
 

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.210
right so therefore we have actually if
you are prio then we are thinking that

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:09.220
you are prio then we are thinking that
 

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.090
you are prio then we are thinking that
you are a non multi aware multi display

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:12.100
you are a non multi aware multi display
 

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.040
you are a non multi aware multi display
aware application in this case we have a

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:14.050
aware application in this case we have a
 

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:16.230
aware application in this case we have a
special thing for you to make your life

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240
special thing for you to make your life
 

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.290
special thing for you to make your life
easier essentially zero is like a

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:19.300
easier essentially zero is like a
 

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.940
easier essentially zero is like a
virtual display which is always a

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:20.950
virtual display which is always a
 

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.060
virtual display which is always a
display you are on so and therefore the

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:24.070
display you are on so and therefore the
 

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:26.760
display you are on so and therefore the
entire API is is really clear everything

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:26.770
entire API is is really clear everything
 

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:28.950
entire API is is really clear everything
is exactly as it should be but the thing

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960
is exactly as it should be but the thing
 

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.720
is exactly as it should be but the thing
is like you get this kind of special

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:30.730
is like you get this kind of special
 

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.660
is like you get this kind of special
display so that you're working fine if

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:33.670
display so that you're working fine if
 

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.610
display so that you're working fine if
however on the other hand you are

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:35.620
however on the other hand you are
 

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:39.000
however on the other hand you are
actually something after all or oh then

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.010
actually something after all or oh then
 

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:40.770
actually something after all or oh then
you will actually get a different

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:40.780
you will actually get a different
 

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.990
you will actually get a different
treatment in that case you will get the

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.000
treatment in that case you will get the
 

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.270
treatment in that case you will get the
real IDs the real display IDs so

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:45.280
real IDs the real display IDs so
 

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.920
real IDs the real display IDs so
therefore if you are doing these kind of

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:46.930
therefore if you are doing these kind of
 

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:48.510
therefore if you are doing these kind of
things you should be careful what you

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:48.520
things you should be careful what you
 

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:53.610
things you should be careful what you
are doing so and yes one additional

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:53.620
are doing so and yes one additional
 

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.980
are doing so and yes one additional
thing is if you are actually running an

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:55.990
thing is if you are actually running an
 

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.230
thing is if you are actually running an
NYC application you still have the set

00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240
NYC application you still have the set
 

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.040
NYC application you still have the set
launch display

00:28:59.040 --> 00:28:59.050
launch display
 

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:03.600
launch display
as a function call so what should you do

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:03.610
as a function call so what should you do
 

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:07.320
as a function call so what should you do
well you should definitely use the the

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:07.330
well you should definitely use the the
 

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:09.299
well you should definitely use the the
size of the window so always use your

00:29:09.299 --> 00:29:09.309
size of the window so always use your
 

00:29:09.309 --> 00:29:11.310
size of the window so always use your
context and try to get this as the

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.320
context and try to get this as the
 

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.020
context and try to get this as the
display matrix from that that is

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:13.030
display matrix from that that is
 

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.810
display matrix from that that is
everything perfectly for you so and if

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:15.820
everything perfectly for you so and if
 

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.970
everything perfectly for you so and if
you want to see any kind of changes like

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:17.980
you want to see any kind of changes like
 

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:18.960
you want to see any kind of changes like
for example you were moved to a

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:18.970
for example you were moved to a
 

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:21.030
for example you were moved to a
different display or something like then

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:21.040
different display or something like then
 

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.760
different display or something like then
look at on configuration change to see

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:23.770
look at on configuration change to see
 

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:27.240
look at on configuration change to see
these kind of changes and if you want to

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:27.250
these kind of changes and if you want to
 

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:29.580
these kind of changes and if you want to
actually position yourself think also

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:29.590
actually position yourself think also
 

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.040
actually position yourself think also
about settings the set launch display ID

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:32.050
about settings the set launch display ID
 

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:33.780
about settings the set launch display ID
if you do not want to get to the same

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:33.790
if you do not want to get to the same
 

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:35.580
if you do not want to get to the same
screen where your current application is

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:35.590
screen where your current application is
 

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:38.580
screen where your current application is
on what you shouldn't do is you

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:38.590
on what you shouldn't do is you
 

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:41.090
on what you shouldn't do is you
shouldn't really assume anything well

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.100
shouldn't really assume anything well
 

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.010
shouldn't really assume anything well
without using your context if you're

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:44.020
without using your context if you're
 

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.560
without using your context if you're
using any kind of display ID I mean

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:46.570
using any kind of display ID I mean
 

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.480
using any kind of display ID I mean
trying to get the default display you

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:48.490
trying to get the default display you
 

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:50.220
trying to get the default display you
will get something which is most

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:50.230
will get something which is most
 

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:55.500
will get something which is most
certainly wrong so and also what was

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:55.510
certainly wrong so and also what was
 

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.510
certainly wrong so and also what was
that yeah don't don't make any

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520
that yeah don't don't make any
 

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.830
that yeah don't don't make any
assumptions that you are actually on the

00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:58.840
assumptions that you are actually on the
 

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.090
assumptions that you are actually on the
built-in display because that is

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:00.100
built-in display because that is
 

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:04.590
built-in display because that is
definitely wrong as well and last but

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:04.600
definitely wrong as well and last but
 

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.440
definitely wrong as well and last but
not least don't assume that you're

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:07.450
not least don't assume that you're
 

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:11.820
not least don't assume that you're
always running from the same display so

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:11.830
always running from the same display so
 

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.070
always running from the same display so
presentation API we were being asked to

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080
presentation API we were being asked to
 

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.870
presentation API we were being asked to
actually get this to you we are getting

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:15.880
actually get this to you we are getting
 

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.780
actually get this to you we are getting
that very soon and it is

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:18.790
that very soon and it is
 

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:20.850
that very soon and it is
well actually I think by pretty much by

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:20.860
well actually I think by pretty much by
 

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:21.840
well actually I think by pretty much by
now it should be there

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:21.850
now it should be there
 

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.760
now it should be there
you can alternatively also you set

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:23.770
you can alternatively also you set
 

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.310
you can alternatively also you set
launch display ID and set launch bounds

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320
launch display ID and set launch bounds
 

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.840
launch display ID and set launch bounds
which will actually do pretty much the

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:27.850
which will actually do pretty much the
 

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:31.380
which will actually do pretty much the
same same sweetie and caming so what is

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:31.390
same same sweetie and caming so what is
 

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:34.230
same same sweetie and caming so what is
they up so basically we have Vulcan

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240
they up so basically we have Vulcan
 

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.990
they up so basically we have Vulcan
support for four examples that picks the

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.000
support for four examples that picks the
 

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.840
support for four examples that picks the
book it was actually shipping already

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:39.850
book it was actually shipping already
 

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:41.790
book it was actually shipping already
1.0 was a shipping beginning of this

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:41.800
1.0 was a shipping beginning of this
 

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.919
1.0 was a shipping beginning of this
year one point one should be shipping

00:30:43.919 --> 00:30:43.929
year one point one should be shipping
 

00:30:43.929 --> 00:30:46.680
year one point one should be shipping
around now and older I take just are

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:46.690
around now and older I take just are
 

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.620
around now and older I take just are
also on the way so working as much

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:49.630
also on the way so working as much
 

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.440
also on the way so working as much
faster them and so on so when you are

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:52.450
faster them and so on so when you are
 

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.660
faster them and so on so when you are
building your own game one so there are

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:54.670
building your own game one so there are
 

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:55.710
building your own game one so there are
a few things what you should actually

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:55.720
a few things what you should actually
 

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.570
a few things what you should actually
take care of first off you should always

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:57.580
take care of first off you should always
 

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.220
take care of first off you should always
use the latest version of the framework

00:30:59.220 --> 00:30:59.230
use the latest version of the framework
 

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.470
use the latest version of the framework
if you're using unity and whatnot they

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:01.480
if you're using unity and whatnot they
 

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.240
if you're using unity and whatnot they
are actually fixing their stuff so if

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:03.250
are actually fixing their stuff so if
 

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.160
are actually fixing their stuff so if
for example a windows size changes and

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:05.170
for example a windows size changes and
 

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:06.720
for example a windows size changes and
whatnot and they as the input region

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:06.730
whatnot and they as the input region
 

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.090
whatnot and they as the input region
which is changing a little bit they will

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:09.100
which is changing a little bit they will
 

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.280
which is changing a little bit they will
actually fix that for you so please use

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:11.290
actually fix that for you so please use
 

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:12.880
actually fix that for you so please use
the latest run because otherwise you

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:12.890
the latest run because otherwise you
 

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:14.470
the latest run because otherwise you
vacation will fail when you are trying

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480
vacation will fail when you are trying
 

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.490
vacation will fail when you are trying
to be resized so next thing is also use

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:18.500
to be resized so next thing is also use
 

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.450
to be resized so next thing is also use
int'l either 64-bit or so a 2 bit native

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:22.460
int'l either 64-bit or so a 2 bit native
 

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.570
int'l either 64-bit or so a 2 bit native
code as well don't use only arm because

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:25.580
code as well don't use only arm because
 

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.040
code as well don't use only arm because
arm is of course a little bit slower

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:27.050
arm is of course a little bit slower
 

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:31.390
arm is of course a little bit slower
especially on the high end devices so

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:31.400
especially on the high end devices so
 

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.940
especially on the high end devices so
when you are running a game application

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:33.950
when you are running a game application
 

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:37.120

quality control might actually be bad
 

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:38.860
quality control might actually be bad
for you depending on what you are doing

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.890
control might actually do something
negative to your quality and you get

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:56.900
negative to your quality and you get
 

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.420
negative to your quality and you get
some kind of really weird behavior so

00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:58.430
some kind of really weird behavior so
 

00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:59.740
some kind of really weird behavior so
therefore try it out on Chromebooks

00:31:59.740 --> 00:31:59.750
therefore try it out on Chromebooks
 

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:02.350
therefore try it out on Chromebooks
before you before you release it that

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360
before you before you release it that
 

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:07.210
before you before you release it that
would be really awesome and yeah if

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:07.220
would be really awesome and yeah if
 

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.920
would be really awesome and yeah if
you're using a lot of layers like a lot

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:08.930
you're using a lot of layers like a lot
 

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:10.780
you're using a lot of layers like a lot
of surface use and whatnot you might

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:10.790
of surface use and whatnot you might
 

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.600
of surface use and whatnot you might
also fall out of this and then your

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:13.610
also fall out of this and then your
 

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:15.250
also fall out of this and then your
quality might actually drop so therefore

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:15.260
quality might actually drop so therefore
 

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:16.900
quality might actually drop so therefore
if you can actually do everything in one

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:16.910
if you can actually do everything in one
 

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.880
if you can actually do everything in one
in a single layer and said please try to

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:18.890
in a single layer and said please try to
 

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:22.150
in a single layer and said please try to
do that instead and always be aware that

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:22.160
do that instead and always be aware that
 

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.890

point in time and of course since users
for example minimizing you you might

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:29.630
for example minimizing you you might
 

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.810
for example minimizing you you might
actually lose your state and or if the

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:31.820
actually lose your state and or if the
 

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:35.050
actually lose your state and or if the
window gets being resized the state

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:35.060
window gets being resized the state
 

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.880
window gets being resized the state
might actually be lost so please save

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:36.890
might actually be lost so please save
 

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:40.660
might actually be lost so please save
your state best practices as I said

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:40.670
your state best practices as I said
 

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:42.190
your state best practices as I said
earlier we are trying to work with

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200
earlier we are trying to work with
 

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.130
earlier we are trying to work with
Playstore to actually serve face

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:45.140

applications which are really good for

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:46.940
applications which are really good for
 

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.700
applications which are really good for
the Chrome OS environment so therefore

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:48.710
the Chrome OS environment so therefore
 

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.100
the Chrome OS environment so therefore
if you are doing everything which we are

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:51.110
if you are doing everything which we are
 

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.290
if you are doing everything which we are
asked for you will actually get a better

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:53.300
asked for you will actually get a better
 

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.260
asked for you will actually get a better
rating so therefore target SDK bigger

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:56.270
rating so therefore target SDK bigger
 

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:59.050
rating so therefore target SDK bigger
than 26 that is definitely something

00:32:59.050 --> 00:32:59.060

UI elements when you're resizing they

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:07.010
UI elements when you're resizing they
 

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:09.130
UI elements when you're resizing they
should always be inside the screen so

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:09.140
should always be inside the screen so
 

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.420
should always be inside the screen so
because if you're all tabbing through

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:10.430
because if you're all tabbing through
 

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:12.190
because if you're all tabbing through
something and suddenly your element is

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200
something and suddenly your element is
 

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.710
something and suddenly your element is
outside of the screen that's bad when

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720
outside of the screen that's bad when
 

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.690
