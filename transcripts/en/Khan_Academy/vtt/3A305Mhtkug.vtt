00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.000
Problem 35.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.940
In the figure below, every
angle is a right angle.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.940
So they're just saying that's a
right angle, that's a right

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.330
angle, these are all
right angles.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.610
You get the idea.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.140
What is the area, in square
units, of the figure?

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.850
So the area.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.520
How can we figure this out?

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.670
We can divide this up into a
bunch of rectangles and figure

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.520
out their respective areas.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.390
So if we drew a rectangle right
here, that rectangle,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.880
what's its area?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.770
It's going to be 6 times
8, which is 48.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.190
That's that rectangle right
there, is 48 square units.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.840
Let's see what else we can do.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.390
We can do this rectangle
right here.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.730
That rectangle right there is
also 6 by 8, so this is also

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.620
going to be 48 square
units right there.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.510
And then we have-- we'll
do it in another color.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.640
We have this rectangle-- that
rectangle right there is

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.390
divided right there-- we have
this rectangle right here,

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.960
which is 3 by 4.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.190
So 3 times 4 is 12 units.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.880
And then you have this
rectangle right here,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.320
which is 3 by 4.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.320
So it's also 12 square units.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.190
So the whole area of the entire
thing is 12 plus 48,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.450
which is 60.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.700
Right?

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.980
2 plus 48 is 50, right,
that's 60.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.550
So you have 60 there, and then
you have another 48, gives you

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.120
108, plus 12, which is 120.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.690
So the area in square units
of the figure is 120.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.890
Problem 36.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.550
A rectangular field is 363 feet
long and 240 feet wide.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.380
How many acres is the field?

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.460
So let me draw this field.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.730
I'll do it in green because
we're talking about a field.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:54.940
So it is 363 feet long
and 240 feet wide.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.760
That's the dimensions
of the field.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.430
So if we wanted to do it in
square feet, we would multiply

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.750
these two numbers.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.260
So how many square feet is it?

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.170
Well, I'll do it out here.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.060
I'll do it on the left.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.480
So let me multiply it out.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:12.930
We have 240 times 363.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.060
Actually, I want to do it with
a little bit more space.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.840
So we're going to
do it in blue.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.820
Maybe I should do it here.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.180
I don't think it will
confuse you.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.550
So I have 240 times 363.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.080
3 times 0 is 0.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.120
3 times 4 is 12.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.390
Carry the 1.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.260
3 times 2 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.240
So it's 720.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.750
We can ignore that
for a little bit.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.710
Throw a 0 down here.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.980
6 times 0 is 0.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.020
6 times 4 is 24.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.890
6 times 2 is 12, plus
this 2 is 14.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.520
And then we have our last
row to deal with.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.690
So we're going to add two 0's
because we're dealing with the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.900
hundreds place.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.830
3 times 0 is 0.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.990
3 times 4 is 12.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.000
This was 4, carry the 1.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.240
3 times 2 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.280
And now we can just
add everything up.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.750
0.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.430
2.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.130
7 plus 4 is 11.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.260
Carry the 1.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.140
1 plus 4 is 5.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.610
5 plus 2 is 7.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.280
And then we have
1 plus 7 is 8.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:41.010
So the field is 87,120
square feet.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.540
Now, they want to know how
many acres is the field?

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.280
And they say an acre
is 43,560.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.160
And you see all your choices
are whole numbers.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.540
And you can just eyeball this,
that 87,000 whatever is

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.150
roughly twice 43,560.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.400
Right?

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.550
80,000 is roughly
twice 40,000.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.260
If you wanted to just hand-wave
it, you could just

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.870
say, well, that's just
choice number A, or

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.080
that's just 2, right?

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.020
This looks like 2 times that.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.100
And if you wanted to verify it,
2 times-- let's verify it.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.010
Let me do it in a color that
you can actually see.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.279
So 43,560-- you wouldn't
actually have to do this on

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.750
the test, but I want to
show you that our

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.329
approximation works.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.459
2 times 0 is 0.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.320
2 times 6 is 12.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.270
2 times 5 is 10, plus
the 1 is 11.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.080
2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.810
2 times 4 is 8.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.080
And we've got the exact number
which was the square footage

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.595
of the field.

00:04:35.595 --> 00:04:36.770
So it's 2 acres.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.630
So if you do it like
that, it's 2 acres.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.640
1 acre and 2 acres,
just like that.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.940
37.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.070
The object below is made of 10
rectangular prisms-- that just

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.020
means these three-dimensional
rectangular things-- each with

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:59.540
dimensions of 5 centimeters
by 3 centimeters by 2

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.550
centimeters.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.500
What is the volume, in cubic
centimeters, of the object?

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.390
So it's kind of this
plus sign, or this

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.480
cross looking thing.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.020
And they do this-- I mean, these
things are really just

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.910
to throw you off.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.490
So what is the volume
of each of these

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.260
little cubes right there?

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.950
So its volume is 5
times 2 times 3.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.650
So each cube has a volume
of, what's 5 times 2?

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.220
Is 10, times 3 is 30.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.310
So each has 30 cubic
centimeters.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.630
Do it in a darker color.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.840
Each of these is 30
cubic centimeters.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.670
And how many of these are
there in this structure?

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.390
Well, we have 2 layers.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.990
The top layer has 1 box here,
that's 1, 2-- this is the

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:50.630
second box-- 2, 3,
4, and then 5.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.320
So the top layer has 5
in this plus sign.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.570
I could draw it like this.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.980
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.240
So if we have 5 in the top
layer, and we have 2 layers.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.620
So we have 10 of these
boxes, right?

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.040
So 10 boxes, or rectangular
prisms if you want to call it

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.140
that, times 30 cubic centimeters
per box.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.060
The boxes cancel out, you get 10
times 30 cubic centimeters,

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.370
and you get 300 cubic
centimeters is the volume of

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.150
this entire structure.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.640
And that is choice D.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.140
I literally think they drew
these little diagonals just to

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.845
confuse you, just to maybe make
you think that you have

00:06:35.845 --> 00:06:37.250
to do something with
triangles.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.370
But no, you just have to count
the number of boxes and figure

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.310
out the volume of
each of them.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.940
We had 10 boxes, each of them
has a volume of 30 cubic

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.210
centimeters, so 300 cubic
centimeters total.
