Speaker 1:          00:00          Last time I told you that Sumerian had a massive influence on later today, foreign languages. I spared you the details though, until now. Here's my favorite example of Sumerian. Ization run a muck.

Speaker 2:          00:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15          Sumerian cuneiform built words with two kinds of characters, syllable characters, and these kinds of picture word characters. So scribes could write about a star by drawing the word character star or spelling it with the syllables. Mu and Ooh, Moodle, Sumerian, four star. When the Acadians took over cuneiform, they grabbed that word symbol and also syllables to write. Cock kaaboo their own Acadian word for star. But the Acadians kept around some Samarian baggage. Actually a lot of Samarian baggage, which led them to a bazaar. Third option, spell the word in Samarian, but pronounce it in Acadian. This technique, let them transform Sumerian words into new symbols. Simera grams, Acadian words with Sumerian spellings. The Hittites got sucked into this when they joined the Akkadian Cuneiform party. The native Hittite word for backwards was up reasonably. Hittite scribes wrote it with three characters, but they could also switch in the Sumerian word for back.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Write it this way with the Sumeria ground. It wasn't just Simera grounds though the Hittites turn this around on the Acadians creating a Qaeda grounds. Here's a strange example. Acadian used lots of little prepositions, kind of like English on a meant for as an Ana Lugo for the king. No surprise king is in Samarian there Hittite work differently. It had all of these Indo European case endings. Therefore the king had a root hus Su and an attached ending II date of case or for like in Latin or Greek. Oddly he type describes, could write the Acadian preposition on a next to the Sumerian Lugo even while they read it as the Hittite Noun with the case ending. What a mess. Just imagine if English writers glorified a language of this much. It's like writing the word city in Greek, but insisting that those characters spell this sound city and then in a phrase like for the city, we'll slap a Latin case sending on to the Greek. Good gram. Here's, see, this means money for the city. Obviously actually Somero Keto grams are worse. At least Greek, Latin and English are related. Hittite, Acadian and Samarian are three different beasts. Anyhow, that's one very quirky example of the kind of linguistic influence Sumerian cuneiform had on later. Civilizations stick around throughout 2015 from more about writing and subscribed for language. [inaudible].
