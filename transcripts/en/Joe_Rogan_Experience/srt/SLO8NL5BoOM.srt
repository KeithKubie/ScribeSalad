1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,950
So I love the fact that you're so
open with these ideas too that you're,

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,910
you bring them to people and get their
take on it and then incorporate their

3
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:14,260
take. Is this something you've always
done because of the workshopping?

4
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:19,030
Is it just that this willingness to be
open with your ideas and express them?

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,820
Yeah, really, you know, workshop
was that the crucial thing,

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,750
having that social expectation that you're
going to bring work every week and it

7
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:30,840
was also kind of a party, a reward
for having brought the work.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,250
And it was also a way of testing the
work so that you knew whether it was

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,320
working. You know, you weren't
constantly sort of questioning yourself.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,800
A workshop just provides so many
really important ways of uh,

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,760
keeping, right, keeping you writing

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,670
now and you've done this always seems
like you've done this most of your career.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,870
I have, and this is not the first
workshop I've been bumped out of.

14
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,570
The first workshop I was in was a very,

15
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,660
a lot of very nice ladies and I was
probably 28 and I had written a scene in

16
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:08,640
which, uh, a man,

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,240
a young man has done up
an inflatable sex doll.

18
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:14,760
So it looks exactly like the
woman he's obsessed with.

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,160
And during the, the
seduction of this sex doll,

20
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,120
he accidentally snags the back of
it with the zipper of its dress.

21
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,510
And he realizes during the fornication
that it is gradually losing air.

22
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,150
So he's got to copulate faster and faster
to try to achieve orgasm before this

23
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:38,760
thing completely goes flat.
And at the end of the scene,

24
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,550
he standing there with this completely
deflated sex doll hanging off of his

25
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:48,870
erection like this, the
surrender flag. And of course,

26
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:53,550
his mother walks into the room.
And after I wrote that scene,

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,840
the leader of the workshop,
I was in my first workshop,

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,770
she took me aside
afterwards and she said, uh,

29
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,970
the other writers in the workshop
no longer feel safe around you.

30
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,050
She really did. She, she said,

31
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:12,930
you've written something that
really frightens them, uh,

32
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,170
and they would like you
to, uh, politely, uh,

33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,030
leave the workshop and not come back.
Wow. And so that's when I started with,

34
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,500
uh, Tom Spann Bowers workshop
in which almost anything went.

35
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,990
Um, and so this kind of periodic
implosion of the workshop,

36
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,630
uh, is, is kind of part
of the process? Well,

37
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:36,990
it seems only twice right or more
and more times than that. You know,

38
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,580
it's been twice, uh,

39
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:42,730
but in the past catastrophic
twice catastrophic. Yeah. Yeah.

40
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,080
But a few other flat
tires along the way. Uh,

41
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:48,060
periodically we've kind of had to, uh,

42
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,500
pretend that we were disbanding in order
to get rid of a member who was, uh,

43
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,660
I had just more trouble
than they were worth.

44
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,800
How many people were in this sport
chops? Boy, lately it's been last,

45
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:02,800
it was about eight, but we've been up
to like 16, 17. And now when I teach,

46
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:04,630
I typically have about 25 people.

47
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,880
What does it feel, I mean,

48
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,500
to be in a workshop for that
long and then have such a,

49
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:17,480
a disagreement and to disband like
that or to have you forced out,

50
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,400
what does that feel
like? That's gotta suck.

51
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,890
No, you know, I think in a way we all
need a kind of a respite from each other.

52
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,630
We all had kind of knew what to expect
from one another and I think we were all

53
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:33,310
less, less of a resource for
one another. Uh, you know,

54
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,580
there's always a chance we'll
come back together. So, uh,

55
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,420
so it's not a big tragedy. So
there's a chance that they might,

56
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,720
so did they kick you out
or did they just disband?

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,190
I left the workshop and I understood
that it disbanded wreck after that.

58
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,693
The seams.

59
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,120
I just don't understand how someone who
is a creative writer can't understand

60
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,750
the, the, not just the necessity,

61
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,290
like the need to delve into
the darker possibilities of,

62
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,550
of human reality that this,

63
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,830
the story she wrote about her grandfather
in the bird is a perfect example that,

64
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,160
I mean, although very few people
experience that in their life,

65
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,830
we all can appreciate that
these are possible scenarios.

66
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:23,580
And I think you know, it, it really
comes down to what people, uh,

67
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,290
what purpose reading and writing serves
in people's lives. And most people,

68
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,780
they want reading to be
a comforting activity.

69
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,520
They want to be able to read a book and
fall asleep knowing the detective will

70
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:37,320
apprehend the killer
by the end of the book.

71
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,610
That things will end very well in a way
they want to be bored or lulled by the

72
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:46,440
book. Uh, not so many people really
want to be kind of confronted by books,

73
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,850
but some people do.
Right? I mean, isn't it,

74
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,120
it's kind of like a pretty
much all forms of art,

75
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,190
whether it's music or movies. I mean,

76
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:59,210
there's superhero movies and then there's
movies like no country for old men or

77
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:02,410
the bad guy gets away at the end and
you leave the movie theater and you're

78
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:05,390
like, what the fuck? You know? But those,

79
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,980
those are all satisfying in
different ways to different people.

80
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:14,981
And isn't that sort of the point of
creative expression is that you're getting

81
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,930
surprised, you're getting
taken down a row that is,

82
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:21,950
here's the world through this person's
eyes and they create this world.

83
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,340
If you put limitations on
that, you're going to, yeah,

84
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:29,030
you're going to eliminate some disturbing
aspects that might bother some people,

85
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:32,600
but you're also gonna eliminate some
magical moments that might just care.

86
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,720
It might literally like change
the way you view people,

87
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,460
you know? And part of it has to do
with the nature of, you know, movies,

88
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,380
movies are going to always kind of
attract, uh, a more dynamic audience.

89
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,290
Movies carry their own
authority through motion, uh,

90
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,790
and books are going to be a slower
medium that's harder to consume.

91
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,220
And so maybe books are always
going to, at this point,

92
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,650
be seen as kind of a sedative as a kind
of thing that loves you and comforts you

93
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:08,540
and puts you to sleep. But by
who? By some people, right?

94
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,090
I mean, I mean, maybe there's a
market for those kinds of books,

95
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,640
but there's also a market for
your books. There's a, there's,

96
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,230
there's clearly a market for people
that they want to tap into those more

97
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:21,560
disturbing aspects of
consciousness and of reality.

98
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,680
And that market is moving to video games
and that market is moving to edgier

99
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:27,764
films.

100
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,130
There's just other forms of storytelling
that are serving that market better

101
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,870
wheelie. Oh yeah. Better than
books. Oh yeah. But why is that?

102
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,900
Is that because of the censorship or is
because artists aren't exploring those

103
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:43,340
ideas as much anymore? You know,

104
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:45,680
and part of it is because
books are harder to consume.

105
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,160
Books take an enormous amount
of a commitment of time
and effort to read a book

106
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,800
where everything else is 30 minutes to
two hours and to write a book as well.

107
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,160
It's such a solitary discipline
to sit alone with your computer.

108
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,480
No, it is not, not for me. And
I, I hate that model. You know,

109
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,790
I want to be in the mermaid Tavern
talking about my ideas with my compatriots

110
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,960
and getting their take on them and finding
out how it resonates with everything

111
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:21,150
else in people's lives. What's
the mermaid Tavern? Oh, is the,

112
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:22,580
the reference to where uh,

113
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,323
Mmm,

114
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,940
not Coleridge. All the famous
writers of Shakespeare's time, ah,

115
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,600
basically hung out at, uh, it was like
the white horse Tavern in New York,

116
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,340
but the mermaid Tavern was in
London during that time. Um, and uh,

117
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,350
Boswell, uh,

118
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,190
all the writers hung out
there and exchange ideas
and entertained one another.

119
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:52,400
Hmm. And so, yeah, I want
writing to be my social outlet,

120
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,580
but you have to write it by
yourself, right? I mean, when you're,

121
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,350
when you're sitting alone actually
putting your fingers on the keyboards.

122
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,850
No, you do it. That part
in airplanes. Really? Yeah.

123
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,140
I write notebooks and notebooks and
notebooks in public and then when I'm

124
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:14,410
trapped in some unbearable place,
like an airplane or an airport,

125
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,420
then I do that horrible
part of keyboarding. Yeah.

126
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,790
So that's the only time
you actually write, right?

127
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,200
The keyboarding is not writing. You
remember the Truman Capote quote about uh,

128
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,960
on the road Jack Kerouac Capote. He
said that's not writing. That's typing.

129
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,011
And so the,

130
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:37,150
the part on the airplane or in the
airport where you have the laptop open,

131
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,740
that's not writing really.
That's typing. This is writing.

132
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,900
Writing to you is physical pen to
paper. Ah, sloppy everything. Yeah.

133
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,670
Why is that? Why is it different?

134
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,900
Because it's written down in the moment
that you hear it and that is not set in

135
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,380
new times. Roman 12 points
so that it looks so finished.

136
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,230
It looks like a finished book and
it's much harder to monkey with it.

137
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,240
Once you see it on that screen and
in word, ah, it looks like a book,

138
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,860
it's much harder to edit it.

139
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,080
But when it's scrawled on the page
in front of you, you can draw arrows,

140
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:16,320
you can scribble it out, you can, you
can do whatever you want to. It is,

141
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:20,500
it's much less precious. Is
this something that you voted?

142
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,080
There's the approach I've always taken.

143
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:25,800
Did you learn this approach or is it
something that just sort of made sense to

144
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:30,480
you? This is how old I am. It used to be,

145
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,180
I grew up in the age of ah,

146
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:38,010
typewriters when even typewriters were
kind of precious because you would have

147
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,120
to buy ribbons for them.

148
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,190
And those ribbons were really expensive
and so something had to be written out

149
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,820
completely long hand had to be perfect
longhand before you could risk wasting a

150
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:56,880
typewriter ribbon to type it out. Wow.

151
00:09:56,881 --> 00:10:01,470
So you just developed it this way and
just stuck with it even in the age of

152
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:02,790
computers? Well,

153
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,560
and also because writing is
something I do in the moment.

154
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,610
Somebody says something insightful,
something really bright,

155
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,060
something phrased just wrong so that it's
suddenly really fresh and I want to be

156
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:21,060
able to write it down in that moment so
that when I do have to go to the boring

157
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:22,170
part with a keyboard,

158
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,300
I have got so much wonderful fresh stuff
that it makes a keyboarding part fun

159
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,350
because it allows me to, to
sort of archive and to curate,

160
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,010
preserve these fantastically bright
things that were said by so many different

161
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:39,520
people. And you don't, do you ever record,

162
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,230
do you ever record yourself?

163
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,710
Like record ideas then listen to
them transcribe them? Oh God, no, no.

164
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,563
I hate that.

165
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,520
That was a big Hunter S Thompson thing
who'd record a lot of his ideas and then

166
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,760
transcribe them and
write them out. You know,

167
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,170
I kind of write word for word
sentence for sentence. And so, uh,

168
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,710
the transcription is just
too much of an effort for me.

169
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,310
Usually when I do interviews
for magazines, um,

170
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,990
I will record my interview
subjects. And even then, uh,

171
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,700
transcribing the interviews is so it's
such a misery because people seldom talk

172
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:22,410
in complete sentences and there's so
many false starts and so many sentences

173
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:26,610
that just don't go anywhere. Right. So no,

174
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,720
talking into a recorder
is just that a mess.

175
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,990
And so this notebook that you
have in front of you, this,

176
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,790
this is a notebook for life or this
a notebook for a particular project.

177
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,200
Like how do you, how do you organize it?

178
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,890
This is a notebook where three pages are
devoted to topics that I will talk to

179
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:48,180
you about if we're desperate.

180
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,760
And there are little notes in here about
contacting my for different issues.

181
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,180
Also, it's all universal. It's
like for all sorts of things.

182
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,280
It's through tasks that you need to do.

183
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:04,210
And then as well as that parts of books
you're writing and there's all these

184
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:07,570
little notes that Jamie just
gave me about microphones. Yeah.

185
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:11,080
You're writing something about someone
who's into recording equipment. Yeah.

186
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:15,850
That's just a small part of it.
But that's what she knows. Now

187
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,630
this, I want to go back to this
workshop thing, like what was it?

188
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:25,130
Just words, just the use of
the word faggot or the N word.

189
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:30,310
Was it just words that characters were
utilizing in your story that was so

190
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:31,190
disturbing to them?

191
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,693
Yeah,

192
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,070
it was words, but it was also some
situations that I thought were, you know,

193
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,850
I got that people were very upset by
people would leave the room or people

194
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:44,930
would, it would leave the
room or what would weep, uh,

195
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,370
would weep in just complete
upset. Does part of you go, yeah,

196
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:53,750
I got this and you see someone
weeping some shit you wrote? No.

197
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,080
Most of the time people would go to the
bathroom and weep and I would find out

198
00:12:57,081 --> 00:13:01,730
about it much later. So, so did you
get post satisfaction that way? No.

199
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:05,540
It just made me feel like a bully and
that really kind of another thing that

200
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,130
it's a thin line, especially
when I read a story like guts,

201
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,580
am I entertaining people
or am I bullying them?

202
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,450
Am I beating them up? And I
also bullying why in that way?

203
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,890
Why do you describe it that way?

204
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,450
Kind of charming them into a story
that eventually will make them faint or

205
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:31,040
eventually will, will make them wretch,
but will upset them very deeply.

206
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,840
Uh, and I, I feel a real
reluctance about that.

207
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,970
Doesn't that sort of half that bridge
have to be crossed though? If you're,

208
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:46,050
if you're really going to explore
every single possibility in a creative

209
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:46,884
narrative, if you're,

210
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,030
if you're really gonna write a book
and just let your mind go wild,

211
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,040
that has to be on the table, doesn't it?

212
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,990
It does. But I don't think
it hurts to be aware,

213
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,960
uh, so that you don't lapse into being
a bully for the sake of being a bully.

214
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:08,460
You know, I think anybody who's a
really hard trainer, uh, kind of,

215
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:13,680
you know, comes up against that. Am I
a really good trainer or as part of me,

216
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:17,730
a sadist? And you have to make sure
that you don't become that sadist,

217
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,220
but so you're not a monster. So there
you go. Yeah. But I worry about it. Well,

218
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:27,360
that's why you're not, but it's the

219
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,800
being able to explore those possibilities
and being able to just delve into the

220
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,370
deep recesses of your mind in the
interest of creativity that seems to be of

221
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:43,560
anybody's gonna appreciate that
it's going to be creative writers,

222
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,580
but it's not my mind. I'm
delving into the deep recesses,

223
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,500
if I'm lucky, if I'm doing it right,

224
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,990
of your mind of something
that they'll like comedians,

225
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,970
they'll say, Oh my gosh,
that happened to you too.

226
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,750
And a lot of times they're things that
people have never ever talked about.

227
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,990
Uh, I tell a classic anecdote
after I had read the, uh,

228
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:14,430
the guts story at an
event, a woman came up and,

229
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,870
uh, and she was a middle aged woman.
She was about my age and she said,

230
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,850
I really love that you read
that story about how you,

231
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,180
uh, got your anus prolapsed while
masturbating in a swimming pool,

232
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,060
which is not my story, but I'm the
one that read it. So that's the one,

233
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,840
I'm the one that they're picturing
in this horrendous situation.

234
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,280
And she says, since you can tell that
story, I'm going to tell you a story.

235
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,430
And she said, how? When when
she was seven years old,

236
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,810
she was in second grade and she was
in a little organization called the

237
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:54,960
brownies, which is a
precursor to the girl Scouts.

238
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,090
You wear a Brown dress, little Brown
hat, you get these little merit badges.

239
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,853
And she said,

240
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,350
one day I had a stomach ache and my mom
kept me home from school and we had this

241
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:11,030
heating pad,

242
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:15,440
it must have been in the 1960s and this
heating pad had this vibrating function

243
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,660
and she put me face down on this heating
pad on my stomach and I fell asleep.

244
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:21,830
And while I was asleep,

245
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,100
this vibrating warm heating pad
must have slid down between my legs.

246
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,671
She says,

247
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:33,671
because I woke up with the most amazing
feeling I feeling like I had never felt

248
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:38,210
before. Oh my God, it felt so good.

249
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,523
And so

250
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,700
next time it was my turn to host
the brownies. I said, brownies,

251
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:51,710
you've got to try this heating
pad. And she says all the brownies,

252
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,720
they turn the heating pad on the vibrating
heating pad and they wrote it like a

253
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:58,400
pony all afternoon.

254
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,960
And she said it was like sex in
the city for seven year old girls.

255
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,890
They could not get enough of this
heating pad and they were all riding this

256
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:09,890
heating pad and they had a
great time. And she said,

257
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:15,250
and for the first time in my life I was
the most popular girl in my class and I

258
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,860
was the girl that all the
girls wanted to play with.

259
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,400
And for every brownie troop meeting it
was at my house and I was the leader

260
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,320
until the day that my mother came home
from work early and she caught us with a

261
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:35,321
heating pad and she sent
the other brownies home and
she whipped the cord out of

262
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:37,800
the wall.

263
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,800
She just ripped it out of the socket and
she started to beat me with it and she

264
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:47,820
beat me with that cord and she beat me
and she said, you fucking piece of shit.

265
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,980
You dirty. What kind of a
fucking whore am I raising you?

266
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:57,540
Whore. And she beat me. And
she beat me and she says,

267
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,840
this woman who's my age now, she says,

268
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:04,740
I have not had an orgasm
since I was seven years old.

269
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,373
And then she goes,

270
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:13,010
but if you can tell that swimming pool
story about how you got hurt jacking off

271
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,740
underwater, she says,

272
00:18:16,741 --> 00:18:21,450
I can tell my heating pad story and I
can tell that story until I can make it

273
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:25,710
funny. And then maybe someday I can
go back to my mom and I can say,

274
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,780
do you remember that heating pad we
used to have and it will be complete.

275
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,390
Oh shit. As OCC CC, that's
what I'm trying to do.

276
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,880
I'm trying to create the opening for
people to tell these stories that they,

277
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,190
they never thought that they could tell
because that's the way in which they're

278
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,030
going to resolve these stories. And
they're going to master these stories.

279
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,490
We have these, um,

280
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,570
um, but day toilet things that
have a little button on the wall,

281
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,800
you press it, that shoots hot
water up your ass. And, uh,

282
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:08,300
my kids come over and, uh,
they love these toilets.

283
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,310
I have two daughters and my
youngest, when she was seven,

284
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
she would sit on the toilet and she was
laughing and giggling and we didn't tell

285
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:21,320
her there's anything wrong with it.

286
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,130
So she was telling us
how much she loves it,

287
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,940
how much she loves the hot water when
it shoots onto her. But she was like,

288
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:32,480
it feels so good. And
there was no shame in it.

289
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,570
And there was this weird
moment where I'm like,

290
00:19:35,571 --> 00:19:39,770
am I supposed to react to this?
Am I supposed to say? Yeah,

291
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:43,700
I know I like it too. Am
I supposed to say, Hey,

292
00:19:43,701 --> 00:19:45,080
don't do that too much.

293
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,130
Am I supposed to say don't tell
anybody you like that you can like it,

294
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:53,780
but don't tell anybody you like it.
Like what am I supposed to do? And uh,

295
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,850
I didn't do anything.

296
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,620
I just let her smile and she walked out
of the bathroom laughing like it was

297
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:03,500
great and it was, no, there was no issue.

298
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,990
But it was this moment
where I was like, wow,

299
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,840
if I was a religious person
or a suppressive person
or some person with some

300
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:15,890
sexual issues, this could be a
real problem for this little girl.

301
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,850
Instead I was like, okay, let's
get out of the bathroom now.

302
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,430
I guess you're done. Alrighty.

303
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,760
And she has no idea that this
was even like a moment of,

304
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,020
you know, crisis in my mind or I was
like, okay, how do I handle this?

305
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:34,880
I'm in the bathroom with
my seven year old daughter,

306
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:37,340
just can't water shot up her
ass and she's enjoying it.

307
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,750
What do you talk about it on the
radio? Is that how you deal with it?

308
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:46,100
I enjoy it to share. I enjoy it too.
We all do. We talk about these toilets.

309
00:20:46,101 --> 00:20:48,190
They're amazing. It's warm water

310
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,440
shoots in your, it's great. Feels awesome,

311
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,790
but it's not supposed to feel awesome
for like a little girl for some reason.

312
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,550
Right. Is he?

313
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:01,540
You tell that story and people will have
so many versions of that story. Yeah.

314
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,020
For me, I was in Germany. I went
in the bathroom in the airport.

315
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,290
I didn't know what this
button was. So I pressed it.

316
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,980
I looked down just in time to see
this little plastic arms swing out.

317
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,260
I didn't know what that
thing was going to do.

318
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,790
So I jumped off the head and this
thing shot up with such force.

319
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:23,970
It knocked a ceiling panel out of the
ceiling and all this hot toilet water came

320
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:28,330
sprinkling down on me. Uh, and I,

321
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:32,680
that's the only time I've ever been around
one of those. Well, we have one here.

322
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,610
If you want to try it out, I don't
know. Scares me. There's two of them.

323
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,010
There's one in that
bathroom, one in that one,

324
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,880
one of that one bathroom you
could lock. It's private. And see,

325
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:46,960
that's my process is you can tell these
stories and you kind of gathered the

326
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:49,630
stories that people tell
related to these stories.

327
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,710
And you choose the ones that escalate
the fastest, the escalate the best.

328
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,710
And that gives you a gradual sort of,

329
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,520
you've established the precedent
and then something worse.

330
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,980
Escalating Wars escalating, worse,

331
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,790
escalating to the most
atrocious or extreme version.

332
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,830
And that's what brings a story to crisis.
