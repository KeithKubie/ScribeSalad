00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
In today's video,

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.500
we're seeing what happens
if we run cinnamon,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.220
a highly flammable powder,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.560
through fire at high speeds
using our sandblaster.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:17.840
[Music]

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.400
Guys, not too long ago,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.364
we did a video showing
you some cool things you

00:00:20.364 --> 00:00:22.200
can do with cinnamon,
throwing it to a fire,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.742
and how it not only burns,

00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:25.694
but makes them
really cool sparks.

00:00:25.694 --> 00:00:27.577
A lot of people commented to see

00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:30.700
if we could actually put
cinnamon in our DIY sandblaster,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.790
and shoot it through a flame.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.700
So we decided not only
that we're going to try that,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.549
but we've also got

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:36.309
a couple other types
of flammable powder

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.059
that were also going to try
throwing in our sandblaster.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.600
And then, we thought we
might scale it up as well.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.800
Some of you may remember our
fire extinguisher flamethrower.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.100
We're going to fill
it with cinnamon.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.400
And the other two powders.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.442
And everything else.

00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:51.100
This is just a really
high volume of powder at once,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.700
and we want to see how it works.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.700
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.741
We have three different
highly flammable powders.

00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:00.910
We are going to put those
into our DIY sandblaster,

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.320
shoot them through a fire,
and see what happens.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.700
So I took up our sand blasted
into a compressor,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.800
fill it with cinnamon,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.400
maybe build the fire
up a little more,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.400
and then shoot it through,
see what it's going to do.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.816
Okay, this point,
we have air flow,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.300
and I'm keeping the whole
thing turned upside down

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.585
so that the cinnamon
is not flowing into it.

00:01:18.585 --> 00:01:19.924
So it should just be air.

00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:22.142
I've got it on fairly
low PSI at the moment.

00:01:22.142 --> 00:01:23.960
Let's just give
a blast in the fire.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.620
This is going
to be extra oxygen,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.600
should help the fire
grow a little bit.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.260
[Music]

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.240
That looks amazing.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.774
Let's add a little bit
more lighter fluid,

00:01:34.774 --> 00:01:37.000
because if you haven't seen
that other video,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.900
to get that effect
from the cinnamon,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.900
that spark effect,
it really works better

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.150
if it goes through
the open flames of the top.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.590
With sugar and coffee creamer,
sometimes works better

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.290
if you throw it down
onto the fire.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.224
But with cinnamon,

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:50.300
you really want to go
through the flames.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.900
Okay.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.100
Air compressor with cinnamon.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.400
Come on, cinnamon.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.940
Hmm.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.100
Yeah.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.580
Okay, that's about
what I thought might happen.

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.263
While it's blowing through,

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:11.500
the volume of cinnamon
is pretty low,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.940
and the speed is quite high.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.900
So I think it's just flying

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.800
right through without having
a chance to catch on fire.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.047
But you may have seen,

00:02:18.047 --> 00:02:21.400
when this sandblaster goes,
air travels through this pipe.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.465
There's a hole down
in the bottom of this pipe,

00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:25.800
and the cinnamon should be
feeding down through that.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.009
The Bernoulli effect
of the fast-moving air

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.080
through the tube sucks some
of the cinnamon into the tube.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.600
In the process however,
it does add a little bit

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:36.691
of pressure into the bottle
itself that's full of cinnamon.

00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:39.300
And when all of the fast-moving
air is turned off,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.780
because I release the trigger,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.080
they're still pressure
in that bottle,

00:02:42.085 --> 00:02:43.500
and that squeezes
it a little bit,

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.100
and we have a higher volume,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.500
but much slower amount
of cinnamon that then comes out

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500
as that stream of thick cinnamon
that you were seeing before.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.951
So there's the high volume,

00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:56.200
and then when I let go,
there's this secondary slower,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.930
but larger quantity of cinnamon,

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.580
and that I think is
what's actually catching well.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.740
[Music]

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.180
Yeah.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.640
[Music]

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.800
Oh, that looks so cool.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.300
That really look like a cinnamon
flamethrower right there.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.700
We're trying this again.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.303
We've turned up the pressure.

00:03:15.303 --> 00:03:17.500
Before, we're running
at about 25 psi.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.300
Now we're running at about 80.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.720
Ow.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.480
Why would you?

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.100
I was just trying to clean
the extra cinnamon off my hand.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.180
Ready?

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.694
Ready.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.280
[Music]

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.900
Yes.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:40.620
[Music]

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.100
That was like our best one yet.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.020
Oh, I love that.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:59.440
[Music]

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.400
Is it pretty much out again?

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.797
That is how fast we
are going through cinnamon.

00:04:02.797 --> 00:04:04.100
And this higher pressure,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.167
those, those spurts
like this bottle was half full.

00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:08.210
It goes through--

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.100
It's super fine so it's not--

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.540
It doesn't last nearly
as long as like a salt

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.400
or a courser grit.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.980
Yeah.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.520
[Music]

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.080
Here it goes.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.060
[Music]

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.360
What?

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.800
That was a 10-foot
purple flamethrower.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.340
Holy cow!

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:54.520
[Music]

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.000
Yes!

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.700
[Music]

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.120
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; That was beautiful.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:17.380
[Music]

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.500
Coffee creamer.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.600
This stuff is fun.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.800
Flares up nicely.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.100
I've got high hopes for this.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.638
Oh, this is going
to be beautiful.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.040
Yes.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.700
Yes, it will.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.780
Fill her up.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.700
It also pours a lot more easily
than the powdered sugar,

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.800
or cinnamon.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.940
Yum?

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.760
Mm-hmm.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.140
[Music]

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.893
That's a really good flame.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.800
But it seems...

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.100
I think it's so flammable
that is just all burns.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.300
Way too fast.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.300
Yeah, so that's short.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:01.040
[Music]

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.940
That's a really good flame.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.100
That looks, it's just
like straight-up Dragonfire,

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.600
like it goes straight
and concentrated,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.600
but it all burns up.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.100
It seems a lot more intense
than the other one.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.800
I think it does.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; The other ones,

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.930
I'm like I'm not too afraid
to be that close,

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.151
so long as you're not standing
in the dust cloud

00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:18.900
of the cinnamon
or the powdered sugar,

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.300
then you're pretty safe.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.688
This one, I would not want
to be close to.

00:06:22.688 --> 00:06:25.100
All right, so we
are mixing all three now,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.000
because we want to know
what's gonna happen.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.600
Maybe we'll get purple sparks
and intense fire.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.400
Oh, yes.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.700
That'll be neat.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:38.060
[Music]

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.500
The cinnamon, of course,
has the strongest flavor,

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.200
but you get some
good sugar, and...

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.500
That's why it's delicious.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.000
Yeah.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.340
[Music]

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.500
I don't really
see the purple,

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.900
but it's got a good flame,

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.670
and it's got sparks
from the cinnamon.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:54.300
That's fun.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.000
I like it.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.240
[Music]

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.140
Whoa. Okay.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.400
Nice.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.600
Now, we want to try scaling
this up a little bit,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.800
maybe not in terms of pressure,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.200
but definitely in
terms of volume.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.490
So we're going to be using
our good ol' flame thrower

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.900
made out of a fire extinguisher.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.705
It's got a Schrader valve on it

00:07:13.705 --> 00:07:16.000
so we can add pressure
with a bike pump.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.900
We're just going
to add powder in here.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.400
We're going to start
out with a mixture

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.653
that's mostly powdered sugar

00:07:20.653 --> 00:07:22.400
with some cinnamon
coffee creamer in it.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.317
And I think we'll also try one
that's just cinnamon to see

00:07:25.317 --> 00:07:28.200
how much of a spray
and sparks we get off of that.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:42.980
[Music]

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.380
That is delicious.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.260
This one's mostly
powdered sugar.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.058
Little bit of coffee creamer
and cinnamon in it.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:55.800
[Music]

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.340
3, 2, 1.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.440
That was amazing.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.320
This is my new
favorite toy ever.

00:08:07.326 --> 00:08:08.720
Man, that worked well.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.600
Oh my gosh.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.988
That works so well.

00:08:10.988 --> 00:08:12.450
That is my favorite.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.250
Woo!

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.700
&gt;&gt; That was--
&gt;&gt; Do it again.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.850
Well, it's empty.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.650
No.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.000
We have to refill now.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:32.980
[Music]

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.000
I think we got double

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.600
the distance that we had
with our small-scale one.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.000
So it was mostly powdered sugar.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.700
So you saw we got
some good purple.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.807
Yes, that was gorgeous.

00:08:40.807 --> 00:08:41.331
I like that.

00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:42.600
And then, we got a little bit

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.088
of a sparkling in there
from the cinnamon.

00:08:44.088 --> 00:08:45.855
The coffee creamer
may have helped a little bit

00:08:45.855 --> 00:08:47.700
with some more orange
or keeping it all together.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.052
That looked really cool,

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.700
but I do want to try one
that's just cinnamon.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.100
That is a fire extinguisher
full of cinnamon.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.720
I've never been so happy.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.200
Which is a weird thing to say.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.600
Not sure if anyone's
ever said that before.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.000
For anyone who gets this,
today is January 30th, 2019,

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.500
and a very certain game is
currently at my house waiting

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.900
for me to play.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.500
This is my only consolation.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.080
Here we go.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.900
About 99% cinnamon.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.800
Little bits of residue
from the other powders in there.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.400
And go for it.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.200
So much sparks.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.680
Yes!

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.860
I don't think it burned
quite as well,

00:09:32.866 --> 00:09:34.800
but the sparks were unreal.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.717
That was crazy.

00:09:35.717 --> 00:09:38.362
That was just like
a giant sparkly fireball.

00:09:38.362 --> 00:09:39.671
I don't really care.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.700
That's-- Ahh, that was amazing.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.513
That's really fun.

00:09:43.513 --> 00:09:45.052
I really liked that.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:57.840
[Music]

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.700
Guys, that's not all,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.500
we've always got more
for you to see.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.300

at the top will take you
to our latest video.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.500
That box the bottom is

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.600
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.900

and we'll see you

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.660
Talk to you then.
