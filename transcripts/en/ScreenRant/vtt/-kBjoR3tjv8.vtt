00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.310
The crews behind the TV-show The Walking Dead
are some of the biggest fans of horror and

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.389
Sci-Fi films out there.

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.850
Not to mention, most of them have worked on
iconic horror films that have been released

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.520
over the last 30 years.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.170
Lead by makeup special effects guru, Greg
Nicotero, they have created props and makeups

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.410
for over 100 Hollywood films.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.429
Throughout the show Nicotero has hidden numerous
Easter Eggs referencing his favorite horror

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:27.640
films and more.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.710
Remember to like our video to let us know,
if we reveal any Easter Eggs from films that

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.710
you love.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:01:04.040
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Awesome
Easter Eggs Hidden In The Walking Dead.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.040
Swamp Thing

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.720
Wes Craven’s 1982 film Swamp Thing is based
off a comic book created by Len Wein and Bernie

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.720
Wrightson.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.170
Executive producer, Greg Nicotero is a fan
of Wrightson’s and wanted to pay tribute

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.330
to him ever since season one but never found
the opportunity.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.000
In season six he got his chance when Daryl
is attacked by a zombie.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.740
Nicotero did the makeup himself on this one
so he could base the design off DC’s Swamp

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.740
Thing.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.430
He’s not the prettiest zombie but he is
cool!

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.760
Death Star Library

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.890
Academy award winning special effects genius
Joe Viskocil has worked on such films as Independence

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.560
Day, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and even
alongside Nicotero in Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.560
Massacre III.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.450
He is also responsible for the explosion of
the Death Star in Star Wars – A New Hope.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.200
After his death Nicotero wanted to pay tribute
to his friend and made a library called Viskocil

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.200
Public Library.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.720
It’s a sweet sentiment from a show with
a lot of death, we just wished it exploded

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.720
like the Death Star for fun.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.720
The Show’s Titles

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.720
As each season passes the walkers become more
and more decayed, showing the audience that

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.720
time has passed.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.720
Another way the show does this is with the
opening title card for the show.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.720
Each season the title becomes a little more
decayed, with added blood and grunge.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.720
It’s a nice reminder of how the world has
gone to hell and there seems to be no turning

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.720
back.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.720
If the show runs for another twenty years,
there may be no letters left.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.720
X- Files Cigarettes

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.720
In season five as Daryl and Carol go searching
for Beth in Atlanta, they stumble upon an

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.720
abandoned building.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.920
While they go through the building looking
for supplies they find a carton of cigarettes

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.579
with a familiar brand name.

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.230
The carton is named after the fictional brand
of cigarettes "Morley," that The Smoking Man

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.620
from the sci-fi series The X-Files smoked.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.529
Are the worlds of X-Files and The Waking Dead
one or is this just homage to the 1990’s

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.459
show?

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.459
Save the Turtles

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.019
Laugh out loud moments are not what The Walking
Dead is known for.

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.730
We may get a chuckle here and there but that
is about it, when it comes to comedy.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.569
So when Eastman is training Morgan with a
staff, it is surprising to see that Eastman

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.849
wore a t-shirt that said, “Save Terrapins.”

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.620
Then right above those words is a picture
of the turtle animal.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.529
This is only funny because two episodes earlier
Enid had eaten a turtle as a snack.

00:02:54.529 --> 00:03:02.790
Dare we say, this joke could leave a bad taste
in audience’s mouths?

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.799
General Custer’s Last Flight

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.749
General Custer is famous for his last stand
at the Battle of Little Bighorn, where he

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.389
lost his life fighting against Native Americans.

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:16.169
In the first episode of The Walking Dead,
Rick woke up in a hospital to a zombie-apocalyptic

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.169
world.

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:20.379
When he walked out of the hospital he found
a military helicopter with the insignia of

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:21.939
the 7th Cavalry on it.

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:27.370
This is referencing Custer’s 7th Cavalry
that was slaughtered with him on that memorable

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.370
day.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.090
An Easter Egg reminder that history repeats
itself.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.730
“Creepshow” Crate

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.730
With the premiere of season five, the survivors
have to escape from Terminus to survive.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.480
As they fight their way out they pass by a
crate that has the writing, "Ship to Horlicks

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.549
University via Julia Carpenter" on it.

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.859
This is a reference to Steven King’s short
novel that was made into a segment for Creepshow.

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.090
Since executive producer Greg Nicotero owns
one of the three original crate props made

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.510
for Creepshow, he added this reference.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.419
Luckily his cast never opened the crate!

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:01.669
Biblical Verses

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.949
When we first see Father Gabriel being saved
on a rock we are surprised to find out he’s

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:07.449
a man of the cloth.

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.010
Not to mention, how clean his collar looks.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.449
When Rick makes his way into Father Gabriel’s
church we see a list of scriptures on the

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:15.449
wall.

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:20.759
Romans 6:4, Ezekiel 37:7 and more; what these
all have in common is they all reference life

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.010
after death or eluding death.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.650
Very appropriate for a world that has the
dead coming back to life.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.520
Ben Gardner from Jaws

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.240
The Governor was one of those characters that
you love to hate, but there is no denying

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.120
that there was something wrong with him.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.949
Not only did he keep his zombie daughter around,
he also kept the fish tanks filled with zombie

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:41.949
heads.

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.729
So how did Ben Gardner from Jaws arrive there?

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.139
Last time we saw his head it was on the bottom
of the ocean after failing to kill the infamous

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.139
shark.

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:56.379
The crew states it was just another prop of
one of their favorite films.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.379
Aged Johnny Depp

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:59.389
Here’s another head for you.

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.960
The Hilltop group and Rick’s team needed
to find a head that looked like Gregory to

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.289
trick the Saviours and infiltrate their base.

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.080
They lined up a group of heads on the floor
and as they look them over we see one that

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.650
is made up to look like an older Johnny Depp.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.189
Greg Nicotero had a cast of Depp from a previous
film and decided to use it again.

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:20.500
Ironically the head that was used is from
a cast of Nicotero’s head; maybe he’s

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.789
hoping he looks like Depp.

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.060
What do you think of our video?

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.820

eggs from The Walking Dead?
