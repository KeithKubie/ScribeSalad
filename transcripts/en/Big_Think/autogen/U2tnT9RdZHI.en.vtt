Oh

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:04.970
 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.190
people are amazed that there is

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200
people are amazed that there is
 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.140
people are amazed that there is
something called the SETI post-detection

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150
something called the SETI post-detection
 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.379
something called the SETI post-detection
task group and I chair this and it's an

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389
task group and I chair this and it's an
 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.629
task group and I chair this and it's an
awesome responsibility I say if ET calls

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639
awesome responsibility I say if ET calls
 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.609
awesome responsibility I say if ET calls
on my watch I'll be among the first to

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619
on my watch I'll be among the first to
 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.800
on my watch I'll be among the first to
know and the not only the fate of the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810
know and the not only the fate of the
 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.179
know and the not only the fate of the
earth but the fate of the entire galaxy

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
earth but the fate of the entire galaxy
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.990
earth but the fate of the entire galaxy
may rest in my hand so it's not

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000
may rest in my hand so it's not
 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.640
may rest in my hand so it's not
something to be undertaken lightly of

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650
something to be undertaken lightly of
 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.950
something to be undertaken lightly of
course the people on this committee

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960
course the people on this committee
 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.140
course the people on this committee
think it's it's very hypothetical but

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150
think it's it's very hypothetical but
 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.380
think it's it's very hypothetical but
it's a tiny tiny chance that this is

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
it's a tiny tiny chance that this is
 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.939
it's a tiny tiny chance that this is
ever going to happen but it's as well

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949
ever going to happen but it's as well
 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.070
ever going to happen but it's as well
that we think through the issues and and

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080
that we think through the issues and and
 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.600
that we think through the issues and and
there are a number of issues because I

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610
there are a number of issues because I
 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.030
there are a number of issues because I
think if we suddenly did discover we're

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040
think if we suddenly did discover we're
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.680
think if we suddenly did discover we're
not alone in the universe the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690
not alone in the universe the
 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.180
not alone in the universe the
ramifications for that could be very

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
ramifications for that could be very
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.160
ramifications for that could be very
profound indeed now I like to make a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
profound indeed now I like to make a
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.430
profound indeed now I like to make a
distinction between two extremes one is

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
distinction between two extremes one is
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.799
distinction between two extremes one is
that we just stumble across some sort of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809
that we just stumble across some sort of
 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.660
that we just stumble across some sort of
evidence that there's somebody out there

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670
evidence that there's somebody out there
 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.090
evidence that there's somebody out there
that there's alien technology we can't

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
that there's alien technology we can't
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.950
that there's alien technology we can't
say anything more than that might be

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
say anything more than that might be
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.289
say anything more than that might be
that there's some distant star that's

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:00.299
that there's some distant star that's
 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:02.899
that there's some distant star that's
got some signs of tampering or the

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909
got some signs of tampering or the

tempering it's worth remembering that
 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.020
tempering it's worth remembering that
all technology leaves a footprint for

all technology leaves a footprint for

millions of millions of years would have

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369
millions of millions of years would have
 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.919
millions of millions of years would have
an even bigger footprint that might

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929
an even bigger footprint that might
 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:23.510
an even bigger footprint that might
extend beyond its planet to its

even be large-scale Astro engineering we

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649
even be large-scale Astro engineering we
 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.499
even be large-scale Astro engineering we
could look for that supposing we found

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509
could look for that supposing we found
 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.760
could look for that supposing we found
something like that it wouldn't be a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
something like that it wouldn't be a
 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.039
something like that it wouldn't be a
message it wouldn't be contact with

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049
message it wouldn't be contact with
 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.969
message it wouldn't be contact with
aliens but it would mean we could say

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979
aliens but it would mean we could say
 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.190
aliens but it would mean we could say
definitely that there is or was somebody

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
definitely that there is or was somebody
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.139
definitely that there is or was somebody
out there that they're these are the

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149
out there that they're these are the
 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.599
out there that they're these are the
fruits of their intelligent activity now

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609
fruits of their intelligent activity now
 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.489
fruits of their intelligent activity now
that would be in my view the most

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:46.499
that would be in my view the most
 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:48.529
that would be in my view the most
profound scientific discovery in the

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539
profound scientific discovery in the
 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.840
profound scientific discovery in the
history of mankind and its impact would

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
history of mankind and its impact would
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.099
history of mankind and its impact would
be a little bit like when Copernicus

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109
be a little bit like when Copernicus
 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:53.840
be a little bit like when Copernicus
announced that the earth is going around

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
announced that the earth is going around
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.289
announced that the earth is going around
the Sun there was no change in the price

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299
the Sun there was no change in the price
 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.520
the Sun there was no change in the price
of beer no rioting in the streets

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
of beer no rioting in the streets
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.099
of beer no rioting in the streets
nothing of that sort and yet over the

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109
nothing of that sort and yet over the
 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.469
nothing of that sort and yet over the
centuries it is enormous ly colored the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
centuries it is enormous ly colored the
 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.059
centuries it is enormous ly colored the
way we see ourselves and our place in

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069
way we see ourselves and our place in
 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.739
way we see ourselves and our place in
the universe same thing with Darwin's

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:06.749
the universe same thing with Darwin's
 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:11.330
the universe same thing with Darwin's
theory of evolution okay no rioting no

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
theory of evolution okay no rioting no
 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.880

dramatic changes in society but over the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
dramatic changes in society but over the
 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.340
dramatic changes in society but over the
decades very definitely he had has

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350
decades very definitely he had has
 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.130
decades very definitely he had has
changed the way we think

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140
changed the way we think
 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.440
changed the way we think
think about ourselves and in the same

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450
think about ourselves and in the same
 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.940
think about ourselves and in the same
way we knew we were not alone in the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950
way we knew we were not alone in the
 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.520
way we knew we were not alone in the
universe it would have a very very deep

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530
universe it would have a very very deep
 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.120
universe it would have a very very deep
impact on our worldview on a

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130
impact on our worldview on a
 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.840
impact on our worldview on a
understanding of our place in the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850
understanding of our place in the
 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.910
understanding of our place in the
universe but I think it could be

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920
universe but I think it could be
 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.190
universe but I think it could be
announced in the same way

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200
announced in the same way
 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.450
announced in the same way
well not quite in the same ways

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460
well not quite in the same ways

well not quite in the same ways
Copernicus he waited till he died before

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320
Copernicus he waited till he died before
 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.840
Copernicus he waited till he died before
he published it because he was afraid of

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850
he published it because he was afraid of
 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.560
he published it because he was afraid of
being killed by the church but we don't

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570
being killed by the church but we don't
 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.600
being killed by the church but we don't
have that fear I don't think but I think

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610
have that fear I don't think but I think
 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.250
have that fear I don't think but I think
it could be announced in the same way as

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260
it could be announced in the same way as
 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.530
it could be announced in the same way as
a major astronomical discovery with a

and all the rest of it now that's one

and all the rest of it now that's one
 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.740
and all the rest of it now that's one
extreme and that's the most likely thing

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750
extreme and that's the most likely thing
 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.330
extreme and that's the most likely thing
that we're going to find but the other
