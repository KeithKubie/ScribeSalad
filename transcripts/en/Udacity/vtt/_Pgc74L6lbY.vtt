00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
What's the best way to do that?

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
How can I map from function f to a function f prime?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
One possibility would be to edit the bytecode of f.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Another possibility would be to edit the source string of f

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and concatenate some strings together.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Another possibility would be to use an assigment statement to say

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
f = some function g of f to give us a new version of f.

00:00:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Which of these would be the best solution?
