00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.160
When I hear the names Tia and Tamara the first thing that comes into my head is the opening of their show 'Sister Sister' it had-

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.229
-these annoying drawings of these crying babies and this obnoxious theme song where they shouts "Sister SISTER!"

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.590
And it was grouped in with usually some bad gimmicky family shows, so like a fair amount of people

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.499
I always kind of associate them with being gimmicky and annoying

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.689
But honestly when you watch the show it's not that bad the two of them had good comedic timing

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.970
And they had a good supportive cast that was funny as well

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.329
The only thing that got annoyingly old outside of the intro is whenever they would do anything in unison, like say stuff at the same

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.300
Time or gasp at the same time or squee at the same time

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.580
But I have to be honest as family shows go especially leaning towards kids entertainment. It was fine

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.180
Twitches is the exact same thing

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.120
There's some funny Creative stuff on top of some corny and gimmicky stuff

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.280
and at the center of it are these two actresses who have grown their comedic timing over the years,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.780
can even do the dramatic stuff pretty well and can surprisingly carry a film.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.660
Apart from again, when they have to do anything in unison like say "Go twitches go twitches! It's our birthdays!" Ugh!

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.600
Like 'Sister Sister' the movie focuses on the twins being separated at birth, only to accidentally bump into each other years later

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.840
Or was it an accident?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.880
This bickering couple who honestly gets more laughs than they probably should are kind of like their guardian angels

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.870
They watch them over the years, make sure they don't get too much in trouble

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.169
But they alter their courses so that they'll eventually meet in a particularly enjoyable joke where they have to keep dropping clues to get one

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.420
Of them in a department store you see these guardian angels and the girls themselves it turns out are magical.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.720
They had to be kept apart - (ala Starwars, ala Harry Potter) to protect them from the darkness -

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.000
An especially horrible effect that you sadly have to look at throughout the majority of the film

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.550
But thankfully there's a lot of imagination in other scenes for example despite the sisters being very similar they both

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.830
Seem to have their opposite sides like one enjoys being up during the day and the other enjoys being up during the night.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.000
One is a writer who writes about this magical world, that it turns out is where they came from -

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.600
- and the other is an artist who thinks she's drawing self-portraits, but somehow she feels like it's not her.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.340
On top of that their magic only seems to work when they're close to each other.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.080
Hence why one has a necklace of the Sun and the other has a necklace of the Moon

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.220
Little touches like this I guess are obvious, but they're are also a lot of fun.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.290
They show a connection in both relationship and ability as well as make for some great visual storytelling.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.840
Things get even more complicated though when their mother finds out they're alive and *scoff* obvious not bad guy is gonna help her find them.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.100
The funny thing is, for as obvious as some of this dialogue is, these actors really tried their damnedest to pull it off

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.300
Listen to this incredibly clumsy exposition done almost perfectly by these two actors who are really giving their hardest;

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.440
"Someone has been protecting them."

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.260
"You know they were killed in the battle that night with Aaron. My husband, your brother."

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.720
"Hero, I have no doubt. But like the girls their bodies never were found, were they?"

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.460
That that almost sounded natural.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.680
Even the villain, we look at him, and we know he's the bad guy but look at how charming he is, and how smooth he is.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.160
You actually kind of really want to admire him for how diabolical he can be

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.180
But I know it's a Disney Channel movie we're not gonna get that deep.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.100
I mean what these two girls were separated from their parents

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.400
And even though they both have step parents, and one even had a step parent and die and replaced with another step parent;

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.600
now she's gonna meet her actual mother, come on! They're not gonna address any of this

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.920
Actually they do! One of the twins' mother died three months ago

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.500
and this other mother has to take over only to discover another mother is thrown into the mix, the real mother.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.760
A good chunk of the emotions you think would follow something like this actually are included.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.620
She doesn't want to meet the actual mother because she's lost so many mothers before.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.400
And even the stepmother she has now is feeling betrayed because she's almost dismissing her.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.600
And the acting from everyone impressively pulls it off!

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.860
It's never too heavy that feels like a soap opera, but it's not really ignored either.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.049
It does add a nice sense of drama and make the story feel a lot bigger than honestly it probably has any right to be.

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.739
I mean sure it has the lame lines and roll your eyes moments.

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.639
But there's not as many as you would think.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.120
In fact a good chunk of the scenes are supposed to get that are supposed to get laughs, do legitimately get laughs.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.180
I really love this one scene where the sister is saying she should be more aware of her surroundings only to look right past her sister and see a sale at a mall.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.580
Look at the way that's shot, that's legitimately humorous

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:36.700
So yeah, for an idea about  Sister Sister being witches that battle evil, this is much better than it probably should be.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.440
It's nothing great, and there's dumb moments, but for the audience It's aimed at

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.740
there's just enough comedic timing, dramatic moments and creativity to make it pretty good.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.124
If you just ignore the gimmicky scenes where they have to say stuff at the same time,

00:04:48.124 --> 00:04:51.040
you might actually find yourself having a fair amount of fun.
