00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.960
You've done an amazing job in this book of trying to boil it down for dummies

3
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:09.420
like me. But it's hard. It is.

4
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:14.220
It is a complicated and insanely nuanced subject. Yes,

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.250
and it's one of those things where it's like this many worlds theory.

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.770
For one example, the, the, the,

7
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:26.700
just the possibility that there's like, explain that.

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.120
Explain for people that don't understand what quantum mechanics even means.

9
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:36.150
Give them just like a little bit of that and then explain many worlds theory.

10
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.520
<v 1>Yeah, a good, this is what I'm here to do. So, you know,</v>

11
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.110
an electron take an electron,

12
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.620
quantum mechanics should apply to the entire universe,

13
00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:48.310
but it becomes unmistakable when you look at little tiny things, right?

14
00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:50.830
So we always are talking about electrons or atoms and so forth.

15
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.210
And electron has a position and, well, sorry, let me not even say that,

16
00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:56.110
that even that was wrong.

17
00:00:56.111 --> 00:00:59.110
It's just so hard to correctly talk about quantum mechanics, right?

18
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.260
If you were Isaac Newton before there was quantum mechanics,

19
00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:05.680
there was classical mechanics and basically quantum mechanics and classical

20
00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:09.610
mechanics are the only two big frameworks that have ever existed in physics.

21
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:09.821
You know,

22
00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:13.510
classical mechanics was so good that everyone thought that was just right and

23
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.480
it's all better at filling the details until quantum mechanics came along and

24
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.080
changed things in classical mechanics and electron is a point.

25
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.470
It has a position, a location in space and has a velocity.

26
00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:26.080
It's moving somewhere and from that you can predict what's going to happen.

27
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.050
Okay? Quantum mechanics says, no, no, no.

28
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.670
The electron has a wave function, so there's a wave. You know,

29
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:37.300
sometimes you hear this debate about are are things like electrons and photons,

30
00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:39.970
particles or waves. The answer is that they are waves

31
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.880
and the wave function has this weird property that when you're not looking at

32
00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:49.930
it, it's a wave. It's all spread out or it's localized somewhere,

33
00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:53.110
but it obeys an equation. The Schrodinger equation. So far so good.

34
00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:55.870
Just like regular physics, there's a thing, the wave function,

35
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.820
it obeys an equation. The Schrodinger equation.

36
00:01:57.821 --> 00:01:59.320
You can predict what's going to happen next.

37
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.400
But the weird thing about quantum mechanics is that there's a whole separate set

38
00:02:03.401 --> 00:02:08.110
of rules for what happens when you look at the thing. When you observe it,

39
00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:08.944
when you measure it,

40
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.850
that's where things get squirreled with people describing it. Yes.

41
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.480
And that's where they want to go. Woo. On you. It's an opening to be woo. Right?

42
00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:17.320
When you say like,

43
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.420
what do you mean observe something like does it have to be a conscious being?

44
00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:25.060
Can it be a video camera? You know, that's just right here, right?

45
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.170
Is it the act of measuring the changes things? Well,

46
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.150
this is the puzzle. Okay.

47
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:36.130
This is what is called the measurement problem of quantum mechanics that the

48
00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:39.880
rules we teach our students at Cal tech or anywhere else when we teach them

49
00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:43.060
quantum mechanics in their sophomore year of college, uh,

50
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.710
the rules say when a system is observed,

51
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.170
when it is measured, it's state.

52
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.920
It's wave function changes dramatically suddenly and unpredictably.

53
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.810
<v 0>Now, let me ask you this. How do we know this based on if,</v>

54
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.270
if you're measuring it and it changes, how do we know?

55
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.510
Because we didn't measure it before. Like what,

56
00:03:03.511 --> 00:03:08.140
what observations are we making that we understand the state of it before it's

57
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:09.460
measured without measuring it?

58
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.520
<v 1>Good. There's a couple of ways. So, um, let, let,</v>

59
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:13.970
let me make things even simpler.

60
00:03:13.971 --> 00:03:17.750
Forget about where the electron is located and think about the electron is

61
00:03:17.751 --> 00:03:21.200
spinning, right? Electron is spinning. Just like the earth spins.

62
00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.240
It's really exactly like that. It's like a little spinning top,

63
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.760
except when you measure the spin,

64
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.280
you can sort of send the electron through a magnetic field and it will get

65
00:03:28.281 --> 00:03:30.770
deflect either up or down, depending on whether it's spinning,

66
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.250
spin up or spin down. You only ever get one of two answers.

67
00:03:34.251 --> 00:03:36.800
It's either going up or going down. It's nowhere in between.

68
00:03:36.801 --> 00:03:40.400
This is an empirical measured fact. Okay. Um,

69
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.920
so that's a part of quantum mechanics.

70
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.540
That's the quantum fact that there's discrete set of possible answers to this

71
00:03:47.541 --> 00:03:50.930
question is it's been in clockwise or counterclockwise, yes or no.

72
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.620
It's just those two possibilities. Nowhere in between. So if you're,

73
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.410
if you have a magnetic field that is oriented vertically,

74
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.640
send your electron through it. It gets deflected up. You say, Oh, it's spin up.

75
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.810
So now I've measured it spin. Now I know what its state is.

76
00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:09.920
If I send it through another magnetic field or oriented vertically,

77
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.700
it will always be deflected up every single time we know what it is we're going

78
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.700
to measure it. Measuring it in this case doesn't change it.

79
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.550
It's in exactly that state. We know it. Okay,

80
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.140
now let's send it through a magnetic field that is oriented horizontally.

81
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.450
So it's going to be deflected either right or left.

82
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.240
We know exactly what state it's in, it's spinning this way,

83
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.170
but when you send it through that magnetic field that's oriented horizontally,

84
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.100
it gets deflected, left or right, 50 50 unpredictably.

85
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.300
There's no way we can predict it. And then once it is, so okay,

86
00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:43.970
now it's been spinning up. You measured it, spinned, left.

87
00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:47.960
Let's say send it through another magnet that is going vertically and now it's

88
00:04:47.961 --> 00:04:52.400
50 50 again, it could be spin up or spin down. So somehow,

89
00:04:52.401 --> 00:04:54.710
even though we knew exactly what state it was in,

90
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.460
we couldn't predict what would happen next. That is part of quantum mechanics.

91
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:59.290
So

92
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.370
<v 0>the act of sending it through these things where it makes it vertical or</v>

93
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:04.330
horizontal

94
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.730
<v 1>and what is, what is happening to it when it's going through these things.</v>

95
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.870
So in quantum mechanics,

96
00:05:09.871 --> 00:05:14.871
what we say is that it's not that we don't know whether the electron is spinning

97
00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:19.650
clockwise or counterclockwise. Um, it can be in a superposition of both.

98
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.300
That's just the spin version of the position of the electron can be spread out

99
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.490
in a, in a wave, right? It's,

100
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.960
it's truly not just that we are lacking some knowledge is that the knowledge

101
00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:32.190
really isn't there. And again,

102
00:05:32.191 --> 00:05:34.980
this is how we teach quantum mechanics in textbooks.

103
00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:37.680
And then I'm going to correct it cause many worlds is much better.

104
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.490
But this is the standard textbook version. There's a wave function.

105
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.850
The wave function for a spin is it's either up or down or some combination.

106
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.270
And then there's a rule that says when you measure the spin,

107
00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:50.880
you only get up or down. You don't see the wave function,

108
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.300
just like the cloud that you have for the electrons position.

109
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.270
When you look at it, you see it at a location.

110
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.270
So another way to get to make the same argument is take a little piece of,

111
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.940
I haven't a nice little image of this when I give talks,

112
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.000
little piece of uranium. So it's a radioactive,

113
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.920
a little chunk of metal and you put it in a bubble chamber.

114
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.090
So it is admitting radioactive particles and you detect the particles.

115
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:19.250
You can see a little streak of uh,

116
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:22.910
of motion when the particle leaves the uranium. Okay. Well, like I said,

117
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.170
when you're not looking at it, this electron is supposed to obey an equation,

118
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:30.560
the Schrodinger equation. And you can ask what the prediction is. When,

119
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.210
when a radioactive nucleus decays and gives off an electron,

120
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.280
what is its wave function going to do?

121
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.410
What is the wave functioning electron going to be?

122
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:42.470
And the answer is it goes off in a spherical wave.

123
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:47.210
It goes off in all directions at once evenly. Yeah, all directions evenly.

124
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.790
But you never see that. Is that [inaudible]

125
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.640
<v 0>the shape of the piece of uranium? Does it vary?</v>

126
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.590
<v 1>No, because the electron gets from one individual nucleus of an atom.</v>

127
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.470
Right? So the, the what the, the uranium is doing doesn't matter.

128
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:01.910
It's just like one Adam matters.

129
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.540
And the easiest thing for the electron to do is just to go out in a sphere.

130
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:09.020
It doesn't have to, we can go out and higher energy States. But the point is,

131
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:11.900
it's not going out in a straight line, but when you look at it,

132
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:13.430
you see a straight line, right?

133
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.920
That's the fundamental mystery of quantum mechanics.

134
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:19.100
That how we described the thing when we're not looking at it is different than

135
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:20.180
what we see when we look at it.

136
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.250
<v 0>So when you're in pursuit of an understanding,</v>

137
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:29.870
a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics, what you,

138
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.681
when you,

139
00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:33.830
you're thinking about people from the 19 hundreds that are just sort of

140
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.720
basically getting the first steps going to understand this stuff.

141
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:39.951
When,

142
00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:44.390
when you're talking about this lack of funding and the lack of encouragement for

143
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:46.130
people to pursue quantum mechanics,

144
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.080
you strongly feel like there are answers to these questions. Yeah,

145
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.740
that's right. That we just need better tools and a better understanding,

146
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:56.720
better equations. More time.

147
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.090
<v 1>Yeah, me and Einstein think that's right.</v>

148
00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:02.210
So Einstein is one of the secret heroes of the book because he has this

149
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:06.380
reputation as someone who just couldn't quite accept quantum mechanics.

150
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.070
The title is something deeply hidden is a quote from Einstein. Uh,

151
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.160
when he was talking about when he was a kid and he had a compass, right?

152
00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:16.220
And he was given his first magnetic compass and he could rotate it this way and

153
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:20.000
that way. And it always pointed North and you and I would go, huh, that's cool.

154
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:22.700
But he was Einstein. He's like, wow, this is amazing. Why?

155
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:25.400
How does it know where North is? Right? And he said,

156
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:28.670
there must be something deeply hidden that explains why it's doing this

157
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.140
mysterious thing. And he felt the same way about quantum mechanics that we have.

158
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.130
We gave these set of rules or called the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum

159
00:08:37.131 --> 00:08:39.800
mechanics. One set of rules for when you're looking at it,

160
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.130
one set of rules for when you're not. And Einstein was like, Oh, come on.

161
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:47.120
Clearly this is not the final answer to the nature of reality, right?

162
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.120
He wanted you to know God's thoughts. He's like, I want to know everything.

163
00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:52.580
We're not done yet. There must be more going on.

164
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:58.090
And so many worlds is one of proposed answers to what could be going on.

165
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:00.090
It's not the only one. There's alternatives,

166
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:03.510
but it's definitely my favorite is definitely the easiest one to, uh,

167
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.250
to write down. Let's put it that way. Okay,

168
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:07.380
so hit us with this many worlds theory. Okay?

169
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.600
So think about this electron you're going to you,

170
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.570
you say that it could be either spin up or spin down.

171
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.290
It's a combination of both. That's its wave function. You measure it.

172
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:18.000
You only ever see spin up or spin down.

173
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.870
So Copenhagen says that's because the wave function suddenly changed,

174
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.090
snapped into place when you observed it.

175
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.870
Don't ask me what it means to observe something that's not what Copenhagen lets

176
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:32.871
you ask many world says what you're missing is two things.

177
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:35.700
Number one, your a quantum system.

178
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.820
You are obeying the rules of quantum mechanics.

179
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:42.600
You're made of atoms and electrons and so forth. You have a wave function too.

180
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.493
Okay?

181
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.640
So you're secretly treating yourself as a classical thing when you make that

182
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:50.820
measurement. But you really should be treating yourself quantum mechanically.

183
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.270
Right? That's one thing. And the other thing is, uh,

184
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:56.880
something that Einstein invented, namely called entanglement.

185
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.170
When quantum mechanics says there's a wave function for a system,

186
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:05.340
it doesn't say there's a separate wave function for every particle, right?

187
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.820
It says that there's only one way function for the whole universe.

188
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.800
So the way I like to say it is imagine two particles come in and bounce off of

189
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:18.210
each other. Either one has a wave function and it's, you know, unpredictable.

190
00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:21.840
Exactly what angle it's going to go off at. So both of those,

191
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.200
both of the particles that go off, you don't know where they're going,

192
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.700
but because momentum is conserved, if they came in at equal velocities,

193
00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:33.810
they'll go out at equal velocities in opposite directions. If you measure one,

194
00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:36.900
then you know where the other one is going, right? That's entanglement.

195
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.930
The observed state of one system can be related to the observed state of another

196
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:44.550
system. So those are the two ingredients.

197
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.030
Your quantum system and quantum systems can be entangled with each other.

198
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.050
So whoever it,

199
00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:52.890
who was a graduate student when he invented this idea in the 1950s said, look,

200
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.540
when you measure that electron, what happens physically? Look,

201
00:10:57.541 --> 00:11:00.750
forget about you're a person, you're conscious, all of that BS.

202
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:03.450
Like you're a physical system. You obey the Schrodinger equation. You,

203
00:11:03.451 --> 00:11:06.270
you are quantum mechanical system. You obey the laws of physics.

204
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.340
So you look at the electron, your wave function changes.

205
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.430
It used to be you're just a person doing whatever you do.

206
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:16.110
But then after you look at the electron,

207
00:11:16.111 --> 00:11:19.170
you become entangled with it and it splits.

208
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.730
So there is one part of the wave function that says the electron was spinning

209
00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:26.280
clockwise and you measured it spinning clockwise.

210
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.190
And there's another part of the wave function that says the electron was

211
00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:32.370
spinning counterclockwise and you saw it spinning counterclockwise.

212
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:36.900
Now everybody knows this like that that far. It's not controversial at all.

213
00:11:36.901 --> 00:11:40.020
That's clearly the prediction of the equations of quantum mechanics.

214
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.480
But everyone else said, well that means that I'm some weird combination of,

215
00:11:45.481 --> 00:11:47.760
I saw it spinning one way and I saw it spinning the other way.

216
00:11:47.761 --> 00:11:50.130
But I've never felt that way. When I look at real electrons,

217
00:11:50.131 --> 00:11:54.490
I see them one way or the other. That can't be, that can't be the final answer.

218
00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:57.790
The wave function must somehow collapse and Everett said no.

219
00:11:57.791 --> 00:12:00.520
What you're missing is there's now two separate worlds.

220
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.050
Both of those part of the wave function are real, but they're different worlds.

221
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:06.880
They will never interact with each other again.

222
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:10.330
What happens in one part of the way you function will not affect what happens in

223
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:10.970
the other part.

224
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:15.220
So now there's a version of you that's all the electrons spinning clockwise and

225
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:16.660
there's another version of you that's all.

226
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:20.740
It's spinning counterclockwise and that's just taking seriously the prediction

227
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:24.640
of quantum mechanics. It's not adding any extra stuff, any extra worlds,

228
00:12:24.641 --> 00:12:25.474
anything like that.

229
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.530
<v 0>That is the part where my brain broke the,</v>

230
00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:32.930
the idea that there's a you that observes it going clockwise and the you that

231
00:12:32.931 --> 00:12:37.931
observes it going in a different direction like that is so hard to understand

232
00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.430
you. Do you apply this in your regular life? Like, do you think,

233
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.370
like when you go home and you say hi to your wife and you open up the

234
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:47.060
frigerator,

235
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:52.060
do you think of yourself as this quantum being that's existing in this super

236
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.560
state?

237
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.920
<v 1>So, I mean, there's a couple of answers to that. One is, you know, sure.</v>

238
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.170
If I think about it like I really do believe it. You know,

239
00:12:58.171 --> 00:13:02.580
I have a chapter in the book, which my editor resisted at at first,

240
00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:03.720
but then he let me get away with it,

241
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:08.520
which is a dialogue between a young philosopher and her father who was a

242
00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:12.480
physicist and the father is skeptical about all of this philosophical nonsense.

243
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:16.920
And she tries to explain how many worlds works to him. And at the end, you know,

244
00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:19.380
his last question is, you know, do you really believe this?

245
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.610
I you really taking this seriously? And look, that's a perfectly attic.

246
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.690
Good question.

247
00:13:24.691 --> 00:13:29.040
It's a very respectable question because it is many worlds.

248
00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:32.760
It's not crazy or weird or bizarre, but it's certainly very,

249
00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:35.460
very far away from our everyday experience. Right?

250
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:40.560
So what it's asking you to do is to say, I have these equations.

251
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.420
They are really,

252
00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:47.421
really good at fitting what I do observe in the world and making predictions.

253
00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:51.690
You know, I can build the large Hadron Collider, et cetera. Um,

254
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:57.390
I will take them seriously even for things that I can't directly observe cause

255
00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.920
they're the best equations I have. Right.

256
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:02.040
Until a better set of equations come along, I will believe these equations.

257
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.940
And the implication of that is yeah, there's a whole bunch of worlds,

258
00:14:05.941 --> 00:14:08.190
like a huge number, like a real, you know,

259
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.240
Jai humongously unimaginably big number may be an infinite number, maybe finite,

260
00:14:12.241 --> 00:14:15.960
we don't know of different copies of you and they're being created all the time.

261
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.940
Uh, the good news is that it doesn't really affect how you go through life.

262
00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.890
It doesn't really, um,

263
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.430
imply that you should behave any differently than you would if you just lived in

264
00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:31.290
one world. But do you think of each choice that you make

265
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:36.440
<v 0>possibly changing everything about the world that you exist in?</v>

266
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.120
How are you, how are you looking at it, if you know what I'm saying?

267
00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:44.260
Because you are a guy who probably understands it as good as anybody that's

268
00:14:44.261 --> 00:14:48.640
alive. So as weird as this stuff sounds too, to me it sounds like an,

269
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.340
I mean it's almost impossible for me to comprehend. So I'm trying

270
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.640
<v 1>to filter it through your understanding of it. Well,</v>

271
00:14:55.641 --> 00:14:57.290
I think that take his jacket off. We're going to see,

272
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:01.190
I know it's getting hot in here. Physics is heating us up. Um,

273
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.210
yeah, I'm not, I'm not exactly sure how to say it the best, you know. Um,

274
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.130
it doesn't, it, it doesn't change who you are.

275
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.750
It's certainly not true that you making a decision is what branches the wave

276
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:19.520
function of the universe. I guess that's the right thing to say.

277
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.120
Cause I want to stop all woo. Yeah. You can't hear that happen. Everyone,

278
00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:23.954
you know, believe me,

279
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.890
the joke about how certain political choices imply that we're living in the

280
00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:30.770
wrong branch of the wave function has been made many, many times. Right. But,

281
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.660
uh, you, it's not that your choices create different universes,

282
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.110
different universes get created and maybe you're different in them by a little

283
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:40.280
bit. In fact, I, you know,

284
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:43.190
I like to point out there is an app you can download if you have an iPhone

285
00:15:43.191 --> 00:15:45.680
called universe splitter, which will, uh,

286
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.630
branch the wave function of the universe for you.

287
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:50.960
And then if you agree ahead of time to do one thing in one branch and another

288
00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:51.800
thing and another branch,

289
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.990
then there will be multiple copies of you who are living different lives and

290
00:15:55.991 --> 00:15:58.430
then you can deal with that and your therapist however you like.

291
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:03.460
But does the application exactly doing what it's doing is a basically a version

292
00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:07.670
of measuring the spin of it's called universe splitter universe splitters only

293
00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:11.630
for iPhones. Oh, my grandma's right now. Sorry. Freud people. Yeah, sorry.

294
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.650
It's not even a webpage is only a only an app. There's equivalent webpages,

295
00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:18.320
but okay. I'm pulling it up right now. Yeah. And what so would you can do,

296
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.700
basically it sends a signal to a lab that coincidentally is located in Geneva,

297
00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:25.940
Switzerland, but has nothing to do with the Higgs boson or anything like that.

298
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.650
Um, they send a single photon down a pipe to what's called a beam splitter.

299
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.270
So the wave function to the photon goes 50, 50, it gets sent left, it gets sent.

300
00:16:35.271 --> 00:16:36.104
Right.

301
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:40.880
And if you agree and so then it sends back whether you ended up in the branch or

302
00:16:40.881 --> 00:16:44.150
the wave function where it went left or where it went. There you go. One 99.

303
00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:47.540
Come on. Yeah. That's the power of changing the universe is in your hands.

304
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.590
I downloaded it. I paid for it. I got it right here. Yeah.

305
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.530
So if you have any tough choices, uh, you can type in like, you know,

306
00:16:54.531 --> 00:16:59.000
I want to have pizza or I want to have Chinese food for dinner tonight. Well,

307
00:16:59.001 --> 00:17:02.030
it says in one universe, I will take a chance in the other one,

308
00:17:02.031 --> 00:17:04.700
I will play this. Yeah, but you can, uh, you can correct those.

309
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.300
You can fill in whatever you want. Rowing. Yeah, that's the good part.

310
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.330
But what is, what is homecoming? I will ask her to marry me.

311
00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:14.240
I will not ask her to marry me. I will accept this job.

312
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:18.020
I will go somewhere else. The equivalent of a quantum fortune cookie. Yeah.

313
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:23.390
But except that all possible fortunes have seen in different universes.

314
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.730
The bad news is you can't ever find out how things went in the other university.

315
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.080
You can't talk to the different universities. The problem, right,

316
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.680
it's the problem will be paralyzed by analysis. That's why it's,

317
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.850
you should act the same as if you just lived in one universe cause you can never

318
00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:39.350
talk to the people in the other ones.

319
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.460
But now let's hit hit the brakes on the Wu gap. Yeah.

320
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.850
Cause people would like to believe that there are,

321
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.370
I mean are there an infinite number

322
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.140
<v 0>of use existing</v>

323
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.680
at the exact same time making various choices which send you off in a different

324
00:17:58.681 --> 00:17:59.390
directions.

325
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.570
<v 1>So number one, we don't know if it's infinite number or just really big,</v>

326
00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.690
but there's certainly a really, really big number that's big enough to be,

327
00:18:05.691 --> 00:18:09.500
you know, big enough for whatever you want. But it's not everything. It's not,

328
00:18:09.501 --> 00:18:12.380
the theory does not say everything happens somewhere. Right?

329
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.930
The theory says the Schrodinger equation is obeyed.

330
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.430
There's an equation that is obeyed.

331
00:18:16.431 --> 00:18:21.431
So electrons will never convert into protons because electrons are negatively

332
00:18:21.711 --> 00:18:23.450
charged and protons are positively charged.

333
00:18:23.451 --> 00:18:26.810
And nowhere in this reneger equation can you violate the conservation of charge,

334
00:18:26.811 --> 00:18:28.970
right? So there's plenty of things that don't happen,

335
00:18:28.971 --> 00:18:32.090
but then there are plenty of things that do happen and some things are more

336
00:18:32.091 --> 00:18:35.300
likely than others for you to experience. So again, it's, it's sort of a,

337
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.000
you know, it's a mind bendy thing,

338
00:18:38.001 --> 00:18:41.120
but it's a straight forward prediction of the equations and it doesn't affect

339
00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:44.630
our lives. It, there's no rule that says, you know, to be a moral person,

340
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:49.340
to be a good utilitarian and make the world happy, knowing that the world,

341
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.290
the way function is branching into multiple copies,

342
00:18:51.291 --> 00:18:52.910
I should act differently somehow. It's,

343
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.130
it's exactly the same as it would be in the ordinary world.

344
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.070
<v 0>So you and you are the ordinary world no matter how copies,</v>

345
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.550
how many copies of you there are or how many versions of you, there's nothing.

346
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.260
<v 1>So when all these copies are being made,</v>

347
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.940
there's no essence of you that is traveling through one of the copies, right?

348
00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:14.110
Like all of these people are separate people. So I use the analogy,

349
00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:15.550
it's like identical twins.

350
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.630
They were the same zygote or whatever and now they're different people. Okay.

351
00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.440
So that's the same thing like your you now and if you hit the button and branch

352
00:19:23.441 --> 00:19:25.420
the wave function, there'll be two different people,

353
00:19:25.421 --> 00:19:29.470
both of whom used to be you but not the same person anymore because different

354
00:19:29.471 --> 00:19:30.304
things happen to them.

355
00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.620
<v 0>Now when people think about the concept of quantum mechanics and the way you're</v>

356
00:19:37.221 --> 00:19:40.430
talking about describing things in the micro and the macro,

357
00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:45.670
you think of your existence itself very similar in a very similar manner.

358
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.610
The way you think of electrons,

359
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.680
the way you think of things being quantum is that you are a combination of all

360
00:19:54.681 --> 00:19:56.300
these quantum things. Yeah.

361
00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:01.330
So you don't operate in some sort of static state that's very like here and now

362
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.830
and and, and carbon and you can put it on a scale and it will never change.

363
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.110
There's constant versions of you.

364
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.641
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

365
00:20:09.641 --> 00:20:12.880
It's kind of like a wishing where you know more and more versions of you are

366
00:20:12.881 --> 00:20:15.490
being created all the time. And it's a,

367
00:20:15.491 --> 00:20:20.491
it's an interesting thing because even the best trained physicists sort of think

368
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.370
intuitively, classically like, look, here's the [inaudible]

369
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.000
<v 0>table. There's a bottle, right? You have to, yeah. To the breaks.</v>

370
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.150
And this is how we evolve, right? That's how our brains work.

371
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.660
<v 1>And like I said, you know,</v>

372
00:20:32.661 --> 00:20:35.720
many worlds is one respectable version of quantum mechanics.

373
00:20:35.721 --> 00:20:37.580
There are other respectable versions,

374
00:20:37.581 --> 00:20:40.940
more respectable than the textbook presentation, but they all,

375
00:20:40.941 --> 00:20:45.440
all the other ones somehow lean on our classical experience.

376
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.830
And the textbook version certainly does, it says like,

377
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:50.920
you're a classical person observing a quantum mechanical system and so forth.

378
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.650
And Everett, when he was a graduate student, you know, he was,

379
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.000
he had arguments across the ocean with people in Copenhagen, you know,

380
00:20:58.001 --> 00:21:00.610
who tried to push their way forward. And he's like, well,

381
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.730
why do you get to be classical? And the electron has to be quantum.

382
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:05.710
Like why aren't you quantum? Like why isn't everything,

383
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.060
what's so special about you? Really?

384
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.930
And he was trying to think of the quantum mechanics of the whole universe.

385
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.020
Right? We're using not a separate observer outside because he's doing the whole

386
00:21:14.021 --> 00:21:16.540
universe all at once. And so everything had to be quantum.

387
00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:20.620
And I think that that's another thing that is pushing us to appreciate the

388
00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:22.390
foundations of quantum mechanics a little bit more,

389
00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:24.310
is that we're trying to understand quantum gravity.

390
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.140
We're trying to understand quantum cosmology,

391
00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:29.770
the universe all at once obeying the rules of quantum mechanics.

392
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:33.460
And the conventional Copenhagen theory is just not up to it.

393
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:41.340
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>
