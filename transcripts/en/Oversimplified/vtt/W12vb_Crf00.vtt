00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Quick, you have two seconds to name these two countries

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.660
You're wrong!

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.880
Unless you got it right

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.520
Then good job!

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.520
They are of course Honduras and El Salvador

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.280
One thing these two countries have in common is being fanatic about Football

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.580
Or if you're a freedom-loving patriot , Soccer

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.320
But do they love it so much, they would go to war over it?

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.200
You bet they would

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.800
And that is NO BUENO

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.680
If you look at these two countries you might notice one major difference, and that is that this one is a lot bigger than this one

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.860
However, this one had a larger population than this one, made up mostly of farmers

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.989
And there wasn't enough land for them to live and work on, so they started moving from El Salvador to Honduras in search of land

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.218
And by the 1960s a huge number of illegal immigrants had crossed over the border from El Salvador

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.459
Meanwhile in Honduras, it's 1963 and this guy has just staged a military coup to prevent the rise of Communism

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.400
And is now the military leader of the country

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.160
He immediately began harassing the peasants' unions and other left-wing groups

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.620
But he's a little insecure about the legitimacy of his leadership, so he holds an election and wins

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.260
But then the opposing party says, "Hey man, that election was clearly corrupt and fraudulent

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.480
And also you've been bribed by the rich American banana companies who are taking all of our bananas tax-free

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.260
And now our economy is in ruins"

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.820
And everyone started to get mad at him

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.680
Now if you ever find yourself the barely

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.600
legitimate military leader of a corrupt Central American country and you start getting into hot water

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.060
Here's a bit of advice that has been tried and tested throughout the centuries

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.320
Blame something else

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.820
So he blamed the Salvadoran immigrants for stealing all the land and all the jobs and ruining Honduras

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.740
The immigrants found themselves under attack by the hostile locals

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.660
Egged on by the rich American banana companies who wanted all the bananas to themselves

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.480
The Honduran government began evicting Salvadoran immigrants

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.480
Who had been living on the land for generations

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.440
And started sending them back to El Salvador

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.920
The Salvadoran elite were furious and protested, citing moral reasons

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.640
But in reality, they were just getting a little too crowded

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.120
So tensions were about as high as they could be, but then

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.960
FOOOOTBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALL

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.650
It's the 1970 World Cup qualifiers and both countries finished top of their qualifying tables

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.380
So it's now time for them to play against each other in a series of matches

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.440
The first match took place in Honduras

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.020
The night before the game, Hondurans gathered outside the Salvadoran team's hotel making noise and taunting them

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.480
The next day, Honduras defeated the exhausted Salvadorans with a late 90th minute goal

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.220
After the match, a young Salvadoran fan, unable to bear her country's defeat, shot herself

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.160
Disturbingly, the Salvadoran government glorified the incident and made her into a national hero

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.000
And at the next game, fans brought pictures of her to the stadium

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.480
Emotions were running high as the next match took place in El Salvador and this time the tables were turned

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.060
The Hondurans had to endure a sleepless night in their hotel

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.040
And the next day, before the match started, instead of the Honduran flag, the Salvadorans raised a dirty rag

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.720
So great job at reducing tensions

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.960
El Salvador won decisively over the exhausted Hondurans

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.120
While spectators battled in the stands, team Honduras fled home in a bulletproof bus with rocks being thrown at them

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.560
And the Honduran coach reportedly told his players that they were lucky they lost

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.790
In response to the defeat

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.700
Hondurans began terrorising the Salvadoran settlers even more

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.060
In some cases reportedly throwing them off their land and burning down their homes

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.600
And the immigrants began fleeing back to El Salvador

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.960
The final game in Mexico would decide who went to the World Cup

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.840
It was close

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.540
But El Salvador came out victorious, knocking Honduras out of the tournament

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.620
The atmosphere was riotous, literally

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.080
And back in Honduras attacks on the Salvadoran immigrants further increased

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.800
This was too much for El Salvador to bear, with its people under attack

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.660
And an unmanageable refugee crisis on its hands

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.260
El Salvador severed all diplomatic ties with Honduras and declared WAR

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.320
The Football War is also known as the 100 Hours War because that's how long it lasted

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.460
Making it one of the shortest wars in history

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.960
El Salvador started by carrying out air raids in strat egic locations within Honduras

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.820
Including Toncontin International Airport

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.480
Which prevented the Honduran Air Force from getting into the sky

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.180
Then, with their superior army, they began an invasion along two major roads complete with light tanks and infantry

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.200
Their advance was rapid and they were quickly approaching the Honduran capital

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.160
Then the Organization of American States met in a bit of a panic

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.800
And unanimously agreed that war between El Salvador and Honduras

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.600
Was a bad thing and probably shouldn't continue

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.680
So they went to El Salvador and said, "can you please stop invading?"

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.560
And El Salvador declared, "NOT UNTIL THEY STOP BEING JERKS!!!!"

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.140
And so the war went on

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.060
The Honduran Air Force finally got into the sky

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.640
And with aid from neighboring Nicaragua

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.260
They successfully carried out air raids in Salvadoran air bases and oil facilities

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.620
Crippling the Salvadoran supply line and stopping their advance dead

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.000
Caught in a bit of a stalemate, the situation was no longer advantageous to El Salvador

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.580
So when the Organization of American States once again asked them to stop and agreed to ensure the safety of the Salvadoran immigrants

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.220
El Salvador relented and a ceasefire was organized on the 18th of July

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.340
Then the OAS said, "can you now please withdraw your troops from Honduras?"

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.840
"No"

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.460
- "Please"
- "No"

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.180
- "Please"
- "No"

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.880
- "Please"
- "No"

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.640
"Do it or we'll sanction you"

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.960
"You know what?"

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.480
"Just for you"

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.860
"I'll do it"

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.840
So El Salvador pulled its troops out of Honduras on the 2nd of August and with casualties in the thousands,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.380
The war was over

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.040
The economies of both nations were damaged by the war

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.720
And El Salvador didn't have the capability to take care of all the returning immigrants

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.320
A crisis that eventually helped cause a civil war

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.320
The war left behind land and border disputes

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.680
Some of which are still a cause of tension to this day

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.060
El Salvador went on to play in the World Cup, but lost every match they played

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.840
And didn't make it past the group stage

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.960
So in the end nobody achieved anything and there were no winners

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.400
Except for this guy
