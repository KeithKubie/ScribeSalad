00:00:00.791 --> 00:00:02.278
- [Voiceover] The amount
of money that farmers

00:00:02.278 --> 00:00:04.705
in Massachusetts paid
to maintain their crops

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:07.027
between 1991 and 2008

00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:08.967
is modeled by the equation above,

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:11.872
where P is the amount of
money the farmers paid,

00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:13.695
in millions of dollars,

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:15.692
and t is the year.

00:00:15.692 --> 00:00:18.339
So this is how much they
paid in millions of dollars.

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:19.941
T is the year,

00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:24.237
but they're saying assuming
1991 is t equals zero.

00:00:24.237 --> 00:00:28.563
What does a 3.53 mean in the equation?

00:00:28.563 --> 00:00:29.440
So let's look at this.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.738
So in 1991 when t is equal to zero,

00:00:32.738 --> 00:00:35.454
this whole term is going
to be equal to zero,

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:36.918
and the farmers are going to pay.

00:00:36.918 --> 00:00:38.160
P is going to be 100.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.224
So they're going to pay
$100 million in 1991

00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:43.536
to maintain their crops.

00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:46.348
These are all the
farmers in Massachusetts.

00:00:46.348 --> 00:00:50.434
Now as t increments, each
time t increases by one,

00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:51.981
the amount that the farmers pay

00:00:51.981 --> 00:00:56.008
is going to increase by 3.53 times one.

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:57.418
So one way to think about is this is

00:00:57.418 --> 00:01:00.483
the rate of increase from year to year.

00:01:00.483 --> 00:01:02.261
As t goes up a year,

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.606
the amount the farmers
pay is going to increase

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:08.147
by $3.53 million.

00:01:08.147 --> 00:01:10.135
So let's see which of these choices

00:01:10.135 --> 00:01:12.169
are consistent with what I just said.

00:01:13.138 --> 00:01:17.096
The cost for maintaining crops
was $3.53 million in 1991.

00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:18.733
No, that's just not true.

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:23.053
In 1991, this term is zero,
and it was $100 million.

00:01:23.053 --> 00:01:27.106
The cost for maintaining crops
was 3.53 million in 2008.

00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:28.887
No, that's not going to be true either,

00:01:28.887 --> 00:01:31.316
because it's 100 million in 1991,

00:01:31.316 --> 00:01:32.802
and then each year it's going to increase

00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:35.630
by 3.53 million.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.313
The costs for maintaining crops increased

00:01:37.313 --> 00:01:41.465
a total of 3.53 million
between 1991 and 2008.

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:45.680
No, it's going to increase
3.53 million per year,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.139
not over the entire time span.

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:51.178
The costs for maintaining
crops increased by

00:01:52.658 --> 00:01:55.233
3.53 million each year

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:57.415
between 1991 and 2008.

00:01:57.415 --> 00:02:00.507
That is exactly right.

00:02:00.507 --> 00:02:02.795
Every time t, and we go forward a year,

00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:05.871
t increases by one,
it's going to increase.

00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:09.728
We're gonna have 3.53
times that one higher t,

00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:13.487
so we're gonna increase
the whole P by 3.53.

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:15.615
That kind of rhymed.
