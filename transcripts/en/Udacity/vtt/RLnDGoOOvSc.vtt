00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.719
All right, give me a name.

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:03.300
&gt;&gt; Fredrick.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.070
&gt;&gt; Fredrick, okay.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.150
And a verb?

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.540
&gt;&gt; Fly.
&gt;&gt; Fly, all right.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.830
Plural noun.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.510
&gt;&gt; Plural noun, camels.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.730
&gt;&gt; Camels, that's a good one.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:13.750
Occupation?

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.280
&gt;&gt; Occupation?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.550
Yoga instructor.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.050
&gt;&gt; Fair enough.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.770
And a place?

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.620
Let's go with Disney Land.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.900
&gt;&gt; All right, we've got our Mad Lib.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.000
Do you want to go ahead and read it?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.580
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.240
Hi, my name is Frederick and
I really like to fly camels.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.720
I'm also a yoga instructor
at Disney Land.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.210
&gt;&gt; Well your name isn't Frederick,
your name is Sean.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.840
And you will be seeing
a lot of Sean in stage two.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.310
Sean, would you like to introduce
yourself and this project?

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.380
&gt;&gt; Sure, hi there.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.140
My name is Sean Lubbers and I spent my
summer working as an intern at Udacity

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.480
to help improve this nanodegree.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.230
You'll learn a lot of
programming fundamentals and

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.110
you'll apply what you learned in the
work sessions by building a couple of

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.320
versions of a Mad Libs generator,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.860
with the final product looking like
the one you saw Andy and I just play.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.850
&gt;&gt; Now, if you're not super excited
about learning how to build a Mad Libs

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.210
game, don't worry,
that's not really the point.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.470
This is just a simple way to capture
a lot of the most important ideas

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.000
in programming.
