00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:03.603
- Best comic book adaptation...
- Oh, yeah.

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:05.138
- to film hands down.
- It's--oh, yeah.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.105
- No argument.
- Oh, yeah.

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:07.206 align:start position:0%
Oh.
See you later, girls.

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:08.708
- All right.
- Oh, yeah.

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:12.178
Um, I know I'm in the minority
here, but I don't really like

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:13.046 align:start position:0%
the Christopher Nolan
<i>Batman</i> movies.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.981
- [scoffs]
- I don't.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.050 align:start position:0%
I really just feel like
they're...overrated.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.019
Okay.

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:22.321 align:start size:44% position:56%
[all laughing]

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:25.191 align:start position:0%
Well, that's, um,
that's just an opinion.

00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:27.393 align:start position:0%
You see, that's why
I prefaced it by saying,

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.862
"I know I'm in the minority."

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:30.963
Awkward.

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:31.931 align:start size:53% position:47%
[both snickering]

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
You know, what, no.
No.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.902 align:start position:0%
Not really.
It's not awkward,

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:38.071 align:start position:0%
at least not until
you said "awkward."

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
Now it's awkward,
because of what you said.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.242
Anyway.

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:44.310 align:start position:0%
Anyway, what?
Anyway, what?

00:00:44.343 --> 00:00:46.279 align:start position:0%
Really, 'cause when you say
"anyway,"

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:50.049
then you have to follow it up
with an actual contribution

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:53.886 align:start position:0%
to the conversation
we're having.

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:55.121
- Yikes.
- No, look at me.

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:56.989 align:start position:0%
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

00:00:57.022 --> 00:00:58.624 align:start position:0%
There's no "yikes,"
and the reason why

00:00:58.657 --> 00:00:59.759 align:end size:72% position:72%
there's no "yikes" is,
there's nothing scary

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:02.228 size:84% position:42%
about this situation, okay?

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.063 align:start position:0%
It's a very low-stakes
situation.

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:05.098
- All right.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.466 align:start position:0%
No, not "all right."
Come here. No.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:07.834 align:start position:0%
Don't look at him. Don't look
at either of those guys.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:08.601 align:start position:0%
Look at me, all right?

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:11.204 align:start position:0%
"All right," what?

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.405 align:start position:0%
'Cause after you say
"all right,"

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:14.540 align:start position:0%
you have to follow that up
with something.

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:17.577 align:start position:0%
Don't do it.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.112 align:start position:0%
Don't look at them.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.780 align:start position:0%
Do not look at them.

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:22.482 align:start position:0%
No--No.
Do not look at them.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:23.783 align:start position:0%
Do not look at them.
Don't do it.

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:25.017
Tell us how you really feel.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.185 align:start position:0%
Okay, you know what?
I'll tell you how I really feel.

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:28.020 align:end size:72% position:72%
Listen, I really feel
like you're an asshole

00:01:28.053 --> 00:01:31.057 align:start position:0%
who has nothing interesting
to say.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.559 align:start position:0%
So what--oh.
No. Don't.

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:34.827 align:start position:0%
No, don't look at them.
Turn your head.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.497 align:start position:0%
Turn it.
Right here.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.700 align:start position:0%
Tell me an opinion
that you have about something.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.169 align:start position:0%
Just one opinion that you have
about anything at all.

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:45.071 align:start position:0%
Just share an opinion.
Anything. Share an opinion.

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:46.839 align:start position:0%
Share an opinion.
Share an opinion.

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:47.907 align:start position:0%
Share an opinion right now.
Just off the top of your head.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.343 align:start position:0%
Share an opinion.
Anything.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:51.978 align:start position:0%
Just one opinion,
that's all I'm asking.

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:53.446 size:88% position:44%
Share one opinion right now.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.780
- Share it. Share an opinion.
- Ah, ah, ah...

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:57.884
I don't have an opinion,
and that's why I just like

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:00.920
everything that everyone else
likes in pop culture.

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:01.154
[groans]

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.396
[sobs]

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:14.467
[sobbing]

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.273
Don't look at me.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:25.378
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me!

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.620
[sobbing]

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:36.621 align:start position:0%
Okay.
