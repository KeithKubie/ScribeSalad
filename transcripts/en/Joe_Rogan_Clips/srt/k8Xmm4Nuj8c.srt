1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,190
Wow.
Do you like roast battle?

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:05,450
Do you like a judging that I get,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,600
I cringe sometimes cause
they're so fucking mean.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,180
Yeah. Sometimes people
are so mean, you know? Um,

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,580
uh, but I do like it. I do
love the writing aspect of it.

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,930
I love the fact that it's a joke writer's
forum but I don't want to name any

7
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:28,620
names or this one comic that I'm friends
with that does really well on roast

8
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:30,570
battle and I said, hey man, how come you,

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,900
when you roast you have all this good
new material but you're doing the same

10
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,000
stupid shit when you go
on stage all the time.

11
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:38,700
Like you were doing the same
set for years. You're not,

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,080
you're not advancing cause you're not
writing a lot but you're writing a lot

13
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:47,430
when you write for roasts and I'm like
you should treat like your material.

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,100
Like the same way you treat your
material when you have to roast.

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,250
The thing about the roast is like say
if a you are going to roast with Tony

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,910
Hinchcliffe, you guys know each other,
you know who you're writing for. I Tony,

17
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:01,380
what does he look like?
He looks like, you know,

18
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:04,980
you start fucking around with all I know
this about Tony and that about Tony.

19
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,760
This is going to be funny.
And it forces you to be creative.

20
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,960
Whereas I think there's so many
guys that they, they develop, um,

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,310
a framework of a set, and then they just
kind of like that. That is their comfort.

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,790
The comfort is in the fact that they know,
even if it's not good,

23
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,730
they know that they can go from
this to that and that to this,

24
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:26,550
and they know where they're going and
they don't, they're not lost. You know?

25
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,970
And I think that the beautiful thing
about the roast is none of that material

26
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,280
you can do in any other place.
You can only do it right there.

27
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:36,300
So you have to work on.

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,440
And so oftentimes you see like what a
comics capable of when they're roasting

29
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,860
versus what they're doing when
they're actually doing the real set,

30
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:44,730
which seems stale.
