kind of a group of experts can you talk

00:39:59.240 --> 00:39:59.250
kind of a group of experts can you talk
 

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:01.460
kind of a group of experts can you talk
a little bit more about how do you think

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:01.470
a little bit more about how do you think
 

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:02.840

yeah yeah I think you know when you

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:08.070
yeah yeah I think you know when you
 

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:12.640
yeah yeah I think you know when you
really need to know something

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:12.650
 

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:17.270
like my my personal experience actually

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280
like my my personal experience actually
 

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:23.480

chemistry so suddenly I could go into

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:35.510
chemistry so suddenly I could go into
 

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:38.210

the Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh and

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.220
the Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh and
 

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.310
the Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh and
read organic chemistry

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.320
read organic chemistry
 

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.780
read organic chemistry
you know graduate level organic

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:41.790
you know graduate level organic
 

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:44.750
you know graduate level organic
chemistry textbooks and it made sense to

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760
chemistry textbooks and it made sense to
 

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.910
chemistry textbooks and it made sense to
me and when I you know like when I was

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:46.920
me and when I you know like when I was
 

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:51.140
me and when I you know like when I was
in high school you know I remember

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:51.150
in high school you know I remember
 

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:55.580
in high school you know I remember
learning these wrote formulas but they

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:55.590
learning these wrote formulas but they
 

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:58.460
learning these wrote formulas but they
couldn't understand it so when when you

00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:58.470
couldn't understand it so when when you
 

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:00.680
couldn't understand it so when when you
sit down and learn it and what the guys

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:00.690
sit down and learn it and what the guys
 

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:03.500
sit down and learn it and what the guys
did in treatment and data committee was

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:03.510
did in treatment and data committee was
 

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:07.160

they just they just first of all is much

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:07.170
they just they just first of all is much
 

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:08.300
they just they just first of all is much
more difficult to get the information

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:08.310
more difficult to get the information
 

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:11.150
more difficult to get the information
but they managed to by making all these

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160
but they managed to by making all these
 

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.830
but they managed to by making all these
phone calls you know you just start

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:12.840
phone calls you know you just start
 

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.960
phone calls you know you just start
calling people and say you know what

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:14.970
calling people and say you know what
 

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:18.830
calling people and say you know what
what trials are going on and and so and

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:18.840
what trials are going on and and so and
 

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.900
what trials are going on and and so and
they would make lists of them so that

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:20.910
they would make lists of them so that
 

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:22.370
they would make lists of them so that
people could actually try to get into

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:22.380
people could actually try to get into
 

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.140
people could actually try to get into
the trials but also they were reading

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:24.150
the trials but also they were reading
 

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:26.120
the trials but also they were reading
these abstracts and they were sitting

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:26.130
these abstracts and they were sitting
 

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:29.810
these abstracts and they were sitting
there with with dictionaries and just

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:29.820
there with with dictionaries and just
 

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.070
there with with dictionaries and just
looking up

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:31.080
looking up
 

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.960
looking up
one word after another and you know

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:32.970
one word after another and you know
 

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:35.600
one word after another and you know
after a while it starts making sense to

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:35.610
after a while it starts making sense to
 

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:36.500
after a while it starts making sense to
you

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:36.510
you
 

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:39.650
you
and then suddenly then someone had the

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:39.660
and then suddenly then someone had the
 

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.380
and then suddenly then someone had the
idea of creating a glossary so they've

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:42.390
idea of creating a glossary so they've
 

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:45.080
idea of creating a glossary so they've
typed up a glossary and xeroxed it it

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:45.090
typed up a glossary and xeroxed it it
 

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:49.310
typed up a glossary and xeroxed it it
was an immense Xerox pill in in act up

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:49.320
was an immense Xerox pill in in act up
 

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.130
was an immense Xerox pill in in act up
and also people who worked in copy shops

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.140
and also people who worked in copy shops
 

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.810
and also people who worked in copy shops
who would do it for free but still you

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820
who would do it for free but still you
 

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.780
who would do it for free but still you
know it's actually one of the ongoing

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:56.790
know it's actually one of the ongoing
 

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:58.310
know it's actually one of the ongoing
things about act up how much are we

00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:58.320
things about act up how much are we
 

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:03.320
things about act up how much are we
spending in in Xerox so so these things

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:03.330
spending in in Xerox so so these things
 

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:06.260
spending in in Xerox so so these things
you know like people just went to school

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:06.270
you know like people just went to school
 

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:11.480
you know like people just went to school
and they they got PhDs in organic

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:11.490
and they they got PhDs in organic
 

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:13.150
and they they got PhDs in organic
chemistry except they don't have the

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:13.160
chemistry except they don't have the
 

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:24.160
chemistry except they don't have the
parchment

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:24.170
 

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:32.800
yes

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:32.810
 

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:38.740
the things that you were able to get

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:38.750
 

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:44.950
for the interview

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960
 

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:50.960
because I'm not questioned you were in

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:50.970
because I'm not questioned you were in
 

00:42:50.970 --> 00:43:02.070
because I'm not questioned you were in
the house but but perspectives that

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:02.080
 

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.840
if there are I don't know what they are

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:03.850
if there are I don't know what they are
 

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:06.420
if there are I don't know what they are
I mean it's interesting design it when I

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:06.430
I mean it's interesting design it when I
 

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:09.330
I mean it's interesting design it when I
first saw your first cut I realized that

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:09.340
first saw your first cut I realized that
 

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:12.240
first saw your first cut I realized that
you the shots you have told from act ups

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:12.250
you the shots you have told from act ups
 

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:14.070
you the shots you have told from act ups
point of view were like shot from inside

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:14.080
point of view were like shot from inside
 

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.930
point of view were like shot from inside
the demonstrations from inside the

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:15.940
the demonstrations from inside the
 

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:17.760
the demonstrations from inside the
meetings and that you were making a

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:17.770
meetings and that you were making a
 

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:26.040
meetings and that you were making a
descent aesthetic decision yeah I mean

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:26.050
descent aesthetic decision yeah I mean
 

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:28.530
descent aesthetic decision yeah I mean
that the film is is from active point of

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:28.540
that the film is is from active point of
 

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:32.400
that the film is is from active point of
view in fact there there's my editor at

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:32.410
view in fact there there's my editor at
 

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:36.440
view in fact there there's my editor at
of forced me to put in a little bit of

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:36.450
of forced me to put in a little bit of
 

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:40.110
of forced me to put in a little bit of
mass media for mainstream media so

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:40.120
mass media for mainstream media so
 

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.380
mass media for mainstream media so
there's like a shot of Tom Brokaw and 20

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:43.390
there's like a shot of Tom Brokaw and 20
 

00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:45.570
there's like a shot of Tom Brokaw and 20
seconds of Dan Rather and two articles

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:45.580
seconds of Dan Rather and two articles
 

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:48.900
seconds of Dan Rather and two articles
from the New York Times but but you know

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:48.910
from the New York Times but but you know
 

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:50.790
from the New York Times but but you know
I don't really care about that they

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800
I don't really care about that they
 

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.010
I don't really care about that they
weren't telling the real story anyway

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:53.020
weren't telling the real story anyway
 

00:43:53.020 --> 00:44:04.920
weren't telling the real story anyway
the real story was

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:04.930
 

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:38.540
yeah

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:44.030
well no one said I mean I entitlement

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040
well no one said I mean I entitlement
 

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.470
well no one said I mean I entitlement
this is something that I learned from

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480
this is something that I learned from
 

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.760
this is something that I learned from
active entitlement allows people to

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:48.770
active entitlement allows people to
 

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:51.890
active entitlement allows people to
enter into institutions and believe that

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:51.900
enter into institutions and believe that
 

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.410
enter into institutions and believe that
they have the right to be part of them

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:53.420

violence and that's one of my very big
 

01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:19.200
violence and that's one of my very big
concerns for this movement because you

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:19.210

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:38.910
