00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.730
It's getting close to the point now where
an actor will have to appear in a superhero

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.430
movie to be considered a somebody.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.790
Gone are the days when the genre was considered
to be cheesy or even a poisoned chalice - now,

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.420
they're the in-thing in Hollywood, and anyone
who's anyone seems to want to be a part of

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.120
them.That being said, they're actually not
for everyone and, for various reasons, a number

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.270
of actors have turned down roles in the genre
- albeit, in some cases, for reasons out of

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.270
their control.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.020
Whether it's refusing specific roles, ruling
themselves out of the genre completely, or

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.309
otherwise, some of the biggest names in cinema
have said "no" to superhero roles.Here are

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.140
ten actors who refused roles in superhero
movies.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.969
Matthew McConaughey
The incredibly talented Matthew McConaughey

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.980
has reportedly turned down roles in both Marvel
and DC superhero movies, having read scripts

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.969
for both companies, but the only specific
role that we know he turned down is a Marvel

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.309
one.The star of Dallas Buyers Club and Interstellar
refused to take the part of the main villain

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.679
in the upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.
2, after both Marvel Studios and director

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.679
James Gunn wanted him for the role.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.030
Whether or not he'll take on one of the many
roles he'll inevitably be offered in future

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.530
superhero movies remains to be seen, but the
signs don't look promising so far.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.610
Amanda Seyfried
Although Amanda Seyfried hasn't actually been

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.770
offered a specific part in a superhero movie,
the Les MisÃ©rables and Ted 2 star has said

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.860
on record that she will never, ever appear
in one.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.860
Why?

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.850
Well because superhero movies involve action,
action requires stunts and stunts make Seyfried

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.290
feel sick!Speaking on Late Night with Seth
Meyers, and citing her brief action cameo

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.450
in 2015's Pan, the actress stated that she
enjoys watching superhero movies, but quite

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.780
vehemently stated "I just don't want to put
on the suit".

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.550
In the same interview, she even stated that
she'll never do a big, blockbuster movie franchise

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.450
of any kind.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.320
Tom Cruise
Prior to the release of 2008's Iron Man, if

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.930
fans had been given the choice between Robert
Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise, 99% of them would

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.100
have chosen Cruise as their Tony Stark - and
that's what Marvel Studios wanted.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.390
However, Cruise turned the opportunity down
and, in hindsight, it was a blessing in disguise.Downey

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.640
Jr. has been nothing short of iconic in the
role, but he certainly wasn't the first choice.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.510
Top Gun star Cruise had been in discussions
with Marvel Studios and Kevin Feige about

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.940
starring in AND producing the first Iron Man
movie for years, but he eventually backed

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.700
off, saying that he wasn't overly impressed
with the script and didn't feel like it was

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.140
going to work.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.140
Idiot!

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.450
Leonardo DiCaprio
Titanic star Leonardo DiCaprio is the only

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.130
actor on this list to have turned down specific
roles for both Marvel and DC movies - and,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.430
in both cases, it was because he claimed that
he simply wasn't ready to take on such roles

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.300
at the times that he was asked.First of all,
he met with director Joel Schumacher about

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.850
playing Robin in 1995's Batman Forever, but
didn't feel ready for the role.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.600
Secondly, he was approached by Sony, but turned
down the role of Peter Parker in 2002's Spider-Man

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.400
movie for the same reason.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.670
The two roles ultimately went to Chris O'Donnell
and Tobey Maguire respectively.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.950
Joaquin Phoenix
Of all the characters in the Marvel Cinematic

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.830
Universe, it is undoubtedly Doctor Strange
who has had the most actors linked to playing

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.830
him.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.641
The role that ultimately went to Sherlock
star Benedict Cumberbatch was rumoured to

00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:10.990
be going to the likes of Patrick Dempsey,
Tom Hardy and Joaquin Phoenix.Phoenix is the

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.792
only actor known to have outright refused
it, however.

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.390
When asked by Time Out London about exactly
why he said "no", the Walk the Line star spoke

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.120
in general about why he turns down big-budget
movies.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.490
He said "When I was younger I was probably
a bit of a snob about them.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.490
But they've gotten better.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.900
I've flirted with several of those films,
having meetings and getting close, but ultimately

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.360
it never felt like they'd really be fulfilling."

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.920
Emily Blunt
Sometimes, actors can say "no" to doing superhero

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.880
movies because it's out of their control,
because, for example, they have scheduling

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.880
conflicts.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.021
In some cases, that can work out well for
them, but in the case of Emily Blunt, it's

00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:42.360
a situation she must regret.The English star
had the opportunity to play both Peggy Carter

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.700
and Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,
but was busy on other projects.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.220
Having to say "no" to the Black Widow role
must play on Blunt's mind in particular.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.860
Scarlett Johansson has played the character
since 2010 in several massively successful

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.860
MCU movies - including both Avengers outings.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.360
And the reason Blunt couldn't take the role
in the first place?

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.840
She was working on the awful Gulliver's Travels.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.840
D'oh!

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.310
Jai Courtney
Of course, Jai Courtney did ultimately end

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.720
up appearing in 2016's Suicide Squad movie
but, prior to his casting in the movie, the

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.400
Terminator Genisys star had outright stated
that he didn't want to appear in any comic

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.299
book productions, telling MTV's Josh Horowitz
that he believed it was a "tired" and "saturated"

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.039
genre.In fact, the only reason he took the
role as Captain Boomerang AKA "Digger" Harkness

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.400
in Suicide Squad is because director and writer
David Ayer convinced him that it wouldn't

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.330
be anything like the typical comic book movie
adaptations that had been seen before, with

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.580
Courtney describing the adaptation as "dope",
"dark" and "cool".

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.889
Tom Hardy
Tom Hardy famously played the Batman villain

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.860
known as Bane in 2012's The Dark Knight Rises,
but he has since turned down a role in another

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.759
DC movie - 2016's Suicide Squad - although
the reason given for that happening differs,

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.210
depending on who you listen to.Initially,
it was believed that Hardy was forced to turn

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.760
down the role of Rick Flagg in the movie because
of scheduling conflicts with his role in 2015's

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.080
The Revenant, but it has apparently since
come to light that his reason for turning

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.770
down the role might have been more blunt than
that - he simply didn't like the script!

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.460
Regardless of which one you believe, he had
to refuse the invitation to appear in Suicide

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.110
Squad one way or another.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.249
Jake Gyllenhaal
Speaking of Tom Hardy, after the Mad Max:

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:17.090
Fury Road star turned his back on Suicide
Squad, a replacement actor for the role of

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.719
Rick Flagg was required.

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:23.180
Ultimately, the role went to RoboCop star
Joel Kinnaman - but Kinnaman wasn't the first

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.600
name DC and Warner Brothers had in mind as
the man to replace Hardy.Donnie Darko himself,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.449
Jake Gyllenhaal, was the first man approached
after Hardy walked away, but he opted not

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.500
to follow in the footsteps of his older sister
Maggie in appearing in a superhero movie.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.520
No specific reason has come out about why
Gyllenhaal didn't want to be Rick Flagg, but

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.669
it's been made very clear that he absolutely
didn't.

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.199
Rose McGowan
Rose McGowan is a little different to the

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.780
other actors on this list.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.020
She never turned down a specific role in the
superhero genre, but she did go one step further

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.229
- she quit acting completely because of the
fact that superhero movies had taken over

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:56.229
Hollywood.

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.020
The star of Scream, Planet Terror and Machete
is obviously not a fan of the genre and would

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.240
never get involved in a movie that was a part
of it.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.870
McGowan took to Instagram to vent her frustration
on the subject, saying that she didn't want

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.440
"green goblins and tight outfits" and expressing
her wishes for films to include more women,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.749
become more complex, become deeper and become
human again.
