Helmy: Hi YouTube, I'm Helmy Abouleish, a
social entrepreneur from Egypt.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.670
And I tend to think that the one thing our
country, our companies and our individuals

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.550
in Egypt have to tackle this year to make
the world a better place.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.749
Things related to climate change, to sustainable
development for us.

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:23.460
I think we have to consider the carbon footprint
and water footprint, and important part of

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.319
the sustainable earth that we are going to
live in.

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:30.669
And that we today have to take the right positions
to prepare a better future for forthcoming

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:31.279
generations.
