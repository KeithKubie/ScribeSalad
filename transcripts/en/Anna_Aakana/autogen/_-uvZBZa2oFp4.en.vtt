00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
You know what kind of person I am?

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.160
Exactly.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.400
So if you text, email, or tell me

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.900
"Hey let's hang out soon."

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.260
I'm gonna follow up with

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.320
Sure!  I can do Tuesday morning or Thursday night.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.900
Hello?

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.200
(gasps) Did you just block me?

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.240
Let's get one thing straight: if you say

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.600
"Let's hang out soon!"

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.740
or "We should catch up!"

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.480
You better be damn ready for me to follow up

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.000
with some specific dates, times, and location ideas

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.560
because I follow up, motherfucker.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.940
So if you don't want to hang out, don't suggest it.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.160
I don't suggest things I have no intention of doing.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.600
I'm gonna murder you.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.620
Mom!

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.140
Oh no, calm down.  I'm just saying a bunch of shit that I have no intention of following through on.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.340
As pathetic as it sounds, I've had quite a few people tell me

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.060
"We should catch up" and then just never respond when I offer up times we can actually hang out.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.900
And I feel stupid.  I feel like I'm being rejected even though I didn't put myself out there.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.220
Hey!  Uhm, would you like to go on a date sometime?

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.000
Sure!  Uhm, I can do Friday.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.380
No.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.140
Okay, how about Saturday?

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.180
No.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.060
I could do Sunday.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.340
Oh my God, I don't want to go on a date with you.  Could you get the hint already!?

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.180
And the solution is easy: don't say what you don't mean.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.880
Ta da!

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100
Because there is no reason to.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.720
If you really need an alternative say "see you later"

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.420
or "talk to you soon."  At least those are vague enough

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.580
that I could just respond with an emoji, and then move on with my life

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.160
without feeling utterly rejected for no reason.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.440
(sighs)

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.620
I wonder if the people this video is about are going to see this.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.580
I hope so.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.720
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.320

Squarespace.  You should.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.240
I'm not getting out of this one.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.840
You know what I love?  Being productive.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.900
Being productive isn't hard.  It just takes a little thought.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.960
So first off, if you don't have a Life Map for 2016, make that right now.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.520
This is your big picture.  It's your goals and your dreams and everything you hope to accomplish in the new year.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.560
Next, you're going to break down  each of those things into executable actions.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.101
