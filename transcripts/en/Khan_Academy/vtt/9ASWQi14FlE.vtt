00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.160
Point A is at
negative 5 comma 5.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.230
So this is negative
5 right over here.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.900
This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.430
That's 5 right over there.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.990
So point A is right about there.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.550
So that is point A, just like
that, at negative 5 comma 5.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.340
And then, it's a center
of circle A, which

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.006
I won't draw just yet, because I
don't know the radius of circle

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.963
A. Point B is at--
let me underline these

00:00:26.963 --> 00:00:30.880
in the appropriate color--
point B is at 3 comma 1.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.590
So 1, 2, 3 comma 1.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.320
So that's point B
right over there,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.510
so center of circle
B. Point P is at 0, 0,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.350
so it's right over
there at the origin.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.760
And it is on circles A and B.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.510
Well, that's a big
piece of information.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.950
Because that tells us, if
this is on both circles,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.500
then that means that
this is B's radius

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.460
away from the point
B from the center.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.350
And this tells us that it
is circle A's radius away

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.130
from its center,
which is at point A.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.459
So let's figure out what
those radii actually are.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.360
And so we can
imagine-- let me draw

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.610
a radius or the
radius for circle

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.330
A-- we now know
since P sits on it,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.217
that this could be considered
the radius for circle A.

00:01:21.217 --> 00:01:23.550
And you could use a distance
formula, but what we'll see

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.341
is that the distance
formula is really just

00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:27.110
falling out of the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.650
So the distance formula tells
us the radius right over here,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.900
this is just the distance
between those two points.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.850
So the radius or the distance
between those two points

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.570
squared is going to be equal
to our change in x values

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.100
between A and P. So
our change in x values,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.820
we could write it as
negative 5 minus 0 squared.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.060
That's our change in x,
negative 5 minus 0 squared,

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.130
plus our change in
y, 5 minus 0 squared,

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.539
which gets us that our distance
between these two points,

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.560
which is the length
of the radius squared,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.880
is equal to negative 5
squared plus 5 squared.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.280
Or we could say
that the radius is

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.990
equal to the square root of,
this is 25, this is 25, 50.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.072
50, we can write as 25 times 2.

00:02:32.072 --> 00:02:33.530
So this is equal
to the square root

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.210
of 25 times the square
root of 2, which

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.160
is 5 times the square root of 2.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.010
So this distance right over
here is 5 times the square root

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.770
of 2.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.730
Now, I said this is just the
same thing as the Pythagorean

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.229
theorem.

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:45.040
Why?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.780
Well, if we were to construct a
right triangle right over here,

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.320
then we can look
at this distance.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.210
This distance would be the
absolute value of negative 5

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.980
minus 0.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.100
Or you could say, this
is 0 minus negative 5.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.200
This distance right
over here is 5.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.030
This distance is the
distance between 0 and 5

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.840
in the y direction.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.920
That's 5.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.180
Pythagorean theorem tells
us that 5 squared, which

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.710
is 25, plus 5
squared, another 25,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.090
is going to be equal to
your hypotenuse squared.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.659
And that's exactly
what we have here.

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.450
Now, you might be
saying, wait, wait, wait,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.520
this thing had a
negative 5 squared here,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.924
while here, you
had a positive 5.

00:03:20.924 --> 00:03:23.340
But the reason why we could
do this is when you square it,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.624
the negative disappears.

00:03:24.624 --> 00:03:26.290
The distance formula,
you could write it

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.410
this way, where you're
taking the absolute value.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.410
And then, it becomes very
clear that this really

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.860
is just the Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.260
This would be 5
squared plus 5 squared.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.844
5 squared plus 5 squared.

00:03:35.844 --> 00:03:37.510
The reason why you
don't have to do this

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.700
is because a sign doesn't
matter when you square it.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.760
It always will become
a positive value.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.360
But either way, we
figured out this radius.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:54.940
Now, let's figure out the radius
of circle B. Same exact idea.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.320
The radius of circle B squared
is equal to our change in x.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.940
So we could write as 3
minus 0, or 0 minus 3.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.310
But we'll just write
it as 3 minus 0.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.290
3 minus 0 squared plus
1 minus 0 squared.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.430
Or the radius or the distance
between these two points

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.350
is equal to the square
root of-- let's see,

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.980
this is 3 squared
plus 1 squared.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.340
That's 9 plus 1.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.270
This is the square root of 10.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.242
The radius of B is
the square root of 10.

00:04:32.242 --> 00:04:34.200
Now, they ask us, which
of the following points

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.320
are on circle A, circle
B, or both circles?

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.280
So all we have to do now
is look at these points.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.190
If this point is the square
root of 10 away from point B,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.235
then it's on the circle.

00:04:44.235 --> 00:04:45.670
It's a radius away.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.910
A circle is the locus
of all points that

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.940
are a radius away
from the center.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.570
If it's 5 square roots
of 2 from this point,

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.780
then it's on circle A. If it's
neither, then it's neither.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.210
Or it could be both.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.130
So let's try these
out, one by one.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.930
So point C is at 4, negative 2.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.100
So let me color
this in a new color.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.470
So point C-- let me do
it in orange-- point

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.240
C is at 1, 2, 3, 4, negative 2.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.880
Point C is right over there.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.540
Now, it looks pretty close.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.410
Just, this is a hand-drawn
drawing, so it's not perfect.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.290
So point C is there.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.300
It looks pretty close.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.930
But let's actually verify it.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.070
The distance between
point C and point D,

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.860
so the distance squared, is
going to be equal to the change

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:31.700
in x's.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.080
So we could say, 4 minus--
so we're trying [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:46.930
C and B, is 4 minus 3 squared
plus negative 2 minus 1

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:54.210
squared, which is equal
to-- This is 1 squared

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.920
plus negative 3 squared.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.260
And so our distance
squared is equal to 10.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.100
Or our distance is equal
to the square root of 10.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.159
So this is also, the
distance right over here

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.200
is the square root of 10.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.600
So this is on the circle.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.850
If we wanted to
draw circle B, it

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.530
would look something like this.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.060
And once again, I'm hand-drawing
it, so it's not perfect.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.435
But it would look
something-- I'm

00:06:19.435 --> 00:06:21.840
going to draw part of it--
it looks something like this.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.770
This is exactly a radius away.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:30.560
So let me write, this
is on circle B. Now,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.610
let's look at this point.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.790
The point 5 comma 3.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.480
So I'll do that in pink.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.540
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 comma 3.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.800
So this looks close, but
let's verify, just in case.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.614
So now, our distance is equal
to-- let me just write it

00:06:48.614 --> 00:06:50.030
this way-- our
distance squared is

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.760
going to be our
change in x squared.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:07:00.302
So 5 minus 3 squared plus 3
minus 1 squared, change in y.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.030
And so our distance is going
to be equal to-- actually

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.530
I don't want to
skip too many steps.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.440
Let's see, this is
2 squared, which

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.420
is 4, plus 2 squared,
which is another 4.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.700
So our distance is going to be
equal to the square root of 8,

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.720
which is the same thing as
the square root of 2 times 4,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.140
which is the same thing as 2
times the square root of 2.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.750
Square root of 4 is 2.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.350
And then, of course, you just
have the 2 left in the radical.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.070
So this is a different distance
away than square root of 10.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.670
So this one right over here
is definitely not on circle B.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.340
And just eyeballing
it, you can see

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.180
that it's not going to be on
circle A. This distance, just

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:47.400
eyeballing it, is much further
than 5 square roots of 2.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.410
And that's also true
for point C. Point C

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.190
is much further than
5 square roots of 2.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.130
You can just look
at that visually.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.700
They're much further than
a radius away from A.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.970
So this point right over
here, this is neither.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.420
This is on neither circle.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.160
Now, finally, we have the
point, negative 2 comma 8.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.030
So let me find-- I'm
running out of colors.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.790
Let me see, I could use, so I
guess I'll use yellow again.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.628
Negative 2 comma 8, so that's
negative 2 comma 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:08:17.628 --> 00:08:19.000
6, 7, 8.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.300
So it's right over here.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.130
That is point E.
Just eyeballing it,

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.200
this distance-- so it's
clearly way too far.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.860
Just looking at,
just eyeballing it,

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.260
it's clearly more than
a radius away from B.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.330
So this isn't going
to be on circle B.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.250
And also, looking at
it relative to point A,

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.539
it looks much closer to point
A. It doesn't even seem close,

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:44.880
than point P is.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.650
So it looks, just inspecting
it, that you could rule this one

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.060
out, that this is
going to be neither.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.380
But we can verify this
on our own, if we like.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.020
We can just find the distance
between these two points.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.100
Our distance squared is going
to be our change in x's.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:08.590
So negative 2 minus negative 5
squared plus our change in y.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:13.040
So it's 8 minus 5 squared.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.970
And so this is, our
distance squared

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.520
is going to be equal to
negative 2 minus negative 5.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.840
That's negative 2 plus 5.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.671
So that's going to be 3
squared plus 3 squared.

00:09:24.671 --> 00:09:26.920
And you see that right over
here, Pythagorean theorem.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.570
This distance right
over here is 3.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.760
This distance right over here,
this is your change in x is 3.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.000
Change in y is 3.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.290
3 squared plus 3
squared is going

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.870
to be the distance squared,
the hypotenuse squared.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.530
So our distance squared is
going to be-- or I could say,

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.280
our distance--
skip a few steps--

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.850
is equal to the square root of--
we can write this as 9 times 2

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.940
or the distance is equal to
3 times the square root of 2.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.286
The radius of circle A is 5
times the square root of 2,

00:09:55.286 --> 00:09:56.660
not 3 times the
square root of 2.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.960
So this is actually going
to be inside the circle.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.840
So if we want to
draw circle A, it's

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.390
going to look
something like this.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.730
And point E is on the inside.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.250
Point D and point C are on
the outside of circle A.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:19.920
The only one that sits on any
of the circles is point C.
