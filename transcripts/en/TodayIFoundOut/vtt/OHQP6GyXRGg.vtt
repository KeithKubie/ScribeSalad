00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.880
On September 11, 1985 an elderly Kentucky
man named Fred Myers awoke to find a dead

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.350
man lying on his driveway.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.090
If this wasn’t odd enough, the deceased
individual was wearing a bulletproof vest,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.250
Gucci loafers, night vision goggles, a large
satchel, and a parachute.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.770
When the police arrived and investigated further,
they found he also had on his person two handguns,

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.859
a couple of knives, $4,500 in cash, ropes,
and food.

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.199
So what was in the satchel?

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.230
About $15 million worth of cocaine…

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.579
The police then surmised the man had leapt
from a plane and had died due to his parachute

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:56.579
failing.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.899
(It was also later noted by friends of the
man in question that he had a propensity to

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.250
push the envelope on how late he could open
his parachute; so it’s also possible that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.560
in the darkness, he simply waited too long
to deploy it.)

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.810
The man was later identified as Andrew C.
Thornton II- a child of wealth turned paratrooper

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:21.470
in the 101st Airborne Division, turned narcotics
officer, and later lawyer, before once again

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.640
changing careers and going with drug kingpin-
one of the heads of a drug smuggling ring

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.040
in Kentucky known as “The Company”.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.480
But we’re not here to talk about Thornton’s
exceptionally colourful life.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.500
The subject of today is an unlikely victim
of Thornton’s last adventure- a large black

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.800
bear now known colloquially as Pablo EskoBear
or more simply, Cocaine Bear.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.490
About three months after Thornton’s demise,
Cocaine Bear was discovered dead in the Chattahoochee

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.030
National Forest in Georgia- the same forest
where Thornton’s plane (a Cessna 404 which

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.990
he’d put on autopilot and leapt out of)
had crashed.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.390
The 175lb black bear was found surrounded
by 40 empty packages that had been torn open,

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.310
all of which contained traces of cocaine.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.810
Putting two and two together, investigators
reasoned that the packages had likely originally

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.950
been full of cocaine before the bear got to
them.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.040
They further surmised that Thornton must have
decided to drop the packages from the plane

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.540
owing to already being heavily loaded down
by the near 80 pounds of cocaine he’d been

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.010
carrying when he jumped.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.910
Presumably, he intended to go retrieve the
packages once safely on the ground.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.730
However, even had he survived the jump, he
would have found that the bear in question

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.540
had eaten the contents of all 40 containers…

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.890
To confirm this is what happened to the bear,
its body was sent to the Georgia Bureau of

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.020
Investigation where it was cut open and its
stomach examined.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.700
The medical examiner who performed the procedure
would later note of his findings:

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.260
Its stomach was literally packed to the brim
with cocaine.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.510
There isn’t a mammal on the planet that
could survive that.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.490
Cerebral hemorrhaging, respiratory failure,
hyperthermia, renal failure, heart failure,

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.490
stroke.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.540
You name it, that bear had it.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.760
News of the bear’s unusual fate was reported
upon by papers across the country and it quickly

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.970
became enshrined as part of the legend surrounding
Thornton in Kentucky- a tale known today as

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.980
The Bluegrass Conspiracy.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.160
Cocaine Bear himself was playfully nicknamed
by the media “Pablo EskoBear”, after notorious

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.660
drug lord Pablo Escobar who, at his cartel’s
peak, is estimated to have supplied upwards

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:39.120
of 80% of the cocaine smuggled into the United
States, doing a brisk business of about $26

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.319
billion (about $48 billion when adjusted for
inflation) per year.

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.240
This may have been the last anyone would have
heard of Cocaine Bear if it were not for an

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.200
entity known as Kentucky for Kentucky who,
in 2015, decided that the bear was a part

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.420
of the state’s cherished history and endeavoured
to track down what had happened to his body.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.920
What they discovered was that, after overdosing
on enough cocaine to kill an elephant, Pablo

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.760
EskoBear went on quite the adventure.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.770
They found that the aforementioned medical
examiner for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.319
opted to gift the body to an unnamed friend
who was a taxidermist on the side.

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:24.000
This friend had the bear stuffed and then
gave it away to the Chattahoochee River National

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.960
Recreation Area, who put it on display in
their visitor centre.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.680
Unfortunate for them, a forest fire in the
early 1990s prompted staff to temporarily

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.110
relocate Cocaine Bear to a storage facility
in Dalton for his own safety.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.200
However, after only a month in storage, he
was bear-napped by an unknown thief who sold

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.200
him to a pawnshop.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.050
The pawnshop owner then sold the bear to country
musician Waylon Jennings, who in turn gave

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.160
it to a friend of his who lived in Las Vegas,
one Ron Thompson- a man who was known for

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.320
helping the wealthy have a “good time”
while in Sin City.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.400
Thompson, who funny enough is rumoured to
have been an associate of Andrew Thornton

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.460
during his drug running days, then put the
bear on display in his giant mansion until

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.310
2009 when he passed away.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.630
Yes, even in death, Cocaine Bear knew how
to party, spending about a decade living in

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.270
an obscenely large Vegas mansion owned by
a man who made a living satisfying the vices

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.890
of the rich and famous who came to town, because
that’s just how Cocaine Bear rolled.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.470
Cocaine Bear’s story doesn’t end here
though.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.590
After Thompson died, he, along with most of
Thompson’s other possessions, went up for

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.940
auction.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.310
So who bought Cocaine Bear?

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.810
According to a manifest from the auction house,
an elderly Chinese man purchased him for the

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.380
princely sum of $200.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.100
This man, Zhu T’ang, then put the bear on
display in his traditional Chinese medicine

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.740
shop after his wife intimated she wasn’t
a fan of his latest purchase.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.900
To quote her, “I wouldn’t have it.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.900
It scared me.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.410
I made him take it to the store.”

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.960
According to T’ang’s wife, her husband
was always buying random stuff she didn’t

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.960
like, but he had a particular fondness for
the bear.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.220
On that note, after T’ang passed away in
2012, despite selling off his business, she

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.900
kept the bear for reasons not publicly known.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.460
However, after representatives of Kentucky
for Kentucky managed to track the bear down

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.940
and informed her of its storied history and
place amongst the pantheon of Kentucky folk

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.889
heroes, Mrs T’ang told them they could have
the animal for the cost of shipping, as she

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.060
at that point simply wanted it out of her
house.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.770
They accepted, putting an end to Cocaine Bear’s
adventures.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.120
Today, Cocaine Bear is the chief attraction
in Kentucky for Kentucky’s Fun Mall and

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.250
can be found wearing a fetching trucker cap
and a small sign around his neck featuring

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.360
a brief recap of his story, as well as a stark
warning:

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:57.860
Don’t do drugs or you’ll end up dead (and
maybe stuffed) like poor Cocaine Bear.
