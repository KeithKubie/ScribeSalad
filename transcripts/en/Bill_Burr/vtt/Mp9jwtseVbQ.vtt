00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.310
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr?

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.800
It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday.

3
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.980
[inaudible] 11th,
2019 what's going on?

4
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:14.280
How I yeah.
Oh,
how you doing?

5
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:18.940
I'm in a great mood despite the fact that I missed that fucking the first moto

6
00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:22.430
GP race of the,
of the year.
Uh,

7
00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:25.830
I found out direct TV isn't,
uh,

8
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.140
doesn't have it on fucking television anymore out here,

9
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:32.580
which was very disappointing to me.
You know,
I couldn't find it.
I was scampering.

10
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.860
I woke up in a sweat going,
wait a minute.
Wait.
It says f one start today.
I know,

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.490
right?
Freaking out.
OCD.
Fucking 20.
Goddamn racist.

12
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:48.660
God forbid you miss one.
So I look up f one.

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.920
That doesn't start til next week down in Australia.
Okay.

14
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.520
I already have that recorded.
That's easy because that got picked up by ESPN.

15
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.440
So I'm like,
all right.
Where the fuck's the Moto GP?
I have direct TV.
All right.

16
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:04.320
I'm not trying to talk down to all you people.
That's right.

17
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.810
I can still afford to pay for cable.

18
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.000
That's how fucking hard.
I am crushing it

19
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.860
out here in these streets.
All you fucking cord cutters,

20
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.490
Huh?
Just backing yourself into a fucking entertainment corner.

21
00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:21.261
Just sitting there.

22
00:01:21.261 --> 00:01:25.140
I with your apps and your little Netflix fucking subscription.

23
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.780
That's your world.
Oh,

24
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.790
where are you going to do watch every episode of Narcos and then some stupid

25
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.860
documentary to try and impress your friends,

26
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.950
you what you need.

27
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:42.570
You need those 700 fucking channels that they have 300 of which are radio

28
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:43.404
stations.

29
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.320
What are you walking away from millennials now?
What are you afraid of?

30
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.790
They're all proud of it too.
Cause when I couldn't find it on direct TV,

31
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.960
I went onto the Twitter and very nicely,

32
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.510
dare I say eloquently.
I just put out to the Twitter sphere.
I said,
hey,

33
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:08.280
does anybody know what channel the Moto GP is on?
On,
on direct TV?

34
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.470
And Oh did the cops come out of the woodwork?

35
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.240
Jesus Christ.

36
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:18.420
You would've thought they put a fucking piece of cheese down in a bun.

37
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.100
All the fucking little rats that came running out right to rats.
Even eat cheese.

38
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.060
Don't they kind of eat anything?
You know what I mean?

39
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.450
Like if you just put like a severed finger in a mouse trap,

40
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:33.090
wouldn't have fucking Rad.
Eventually come up and try and eat the fucking thing.

41
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:38.091
I mean they don't give a shit right there like that relative that always shows

42
00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.770
up to the event,
never brings anything and just hovers.
Right.

43
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.390
Hovers around the fucking table.
Doesn't use that fucking spoon,
you know,

44
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:49.950
to scoop.
It eases reaching in with his fucking meds.
That's what red sir.
Alright.

45
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.400
That's a rent and social Runkle.
Anyways,
plowing ahead.

46
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.070
So I put it out there nicely.
Okay.
I like to feel like,
you know,

47
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.480
being a man in my fifties now than I am,
I am refined.
I am a man of the world.

48
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.400
All right.
I drive a four door sedan.
I still pay for cable.

49
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.960
Okay.
So I'm,
I'm like this close to buying a pair of loafers.

50
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.271
Do you want to stay at it?

51
00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:20.170
Like that debt is like how established I am as an adult.

52
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.120
So I put it out there nicely.
Does anybody know what channel the MotoGP races on?

53
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.490
Uh,
on direct TV?
Oh these fucking cops come out of the woodwork.
I first of all,

54
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:35.400
you know 69 huh?
You got it.
Are you going to try that?
Uh Huh.

55
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.080
Right then they start doing this one birth and they start speaking in Twitter

56
00:03:39.081 --> 00:03:43.490
speak.
I didn't know that directv was still a thing.

57
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.700
Oh wow man.
You're like so cool.
The way you,
the way you get your entertainment,

58
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.570
Jesus Christ,
you would've,
you would've thought I showed up with a fucking,

59
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.490
I dunno,
the wrong pair of sneakers on and what that was like in fifth grade.

60
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.220
The fact that I actually suggested I,
I,

61
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.770
I had no idea there was so much shame and still haven't direct TV.

62
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.320
I pay like 200 bucks a month for cable.
It's funny.

63
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.270
God,
what do you think?
I went from one fucking uh,
podcasts a week to two.

64
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.180
I've got to pay for my direct TV.
I to,
you know,
somebody told me one time,

65
00:04:23.181 --> 00:04:24.590
he goes to you pay way too much money.

66
00:04:24.591 --> 00:04:27.110
Just kept me come over there and I'll yell at him.
I'll cut it in half.

67
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.990
Cause all these fucking people.
A cord cutting and shit.
You can,

68
00:04:29.991 --> 00:04:33.980
you know I have all this sports packages.
Oh yeah,
I'm talking shit.
Hit people.

69
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.870
Okay.
I pay for direct TV.

70
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.760
I have all four sports packages.
All right.

71
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.610
And I miss most of the Games.
Okay.

72
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.330
You want to talk about taking hundreds of just throwing them into a fire?

73
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.430
A lightness cigar.
That's how I'm rolling.
Um,

74
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.250
anyways,
so it turns out that directv no longer,
um,

75
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.380
Kerry's MotoGP,

76
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.370
which in my world is the best fucking racing out there as far as if you want to

77
00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:11.540
see excitement.
If you want passing,
okay.
You,
you,
you,

78
00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:15.690
you fucking NASCAR guys down there.
Huh?
With your fucking stale.

79
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.820
That also doubles as a smoker during the tailgate.
You want to get drunk,

80
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:25.500
you stayed on this side.
If you want some buffalo,
you get on that side,

81
00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:29.420
right?
You guys want to see fucking excitement.

82
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.310
If you want to see passing and that type of Shit,
you want to see a four.

83
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.400
Do you want to see a wreck?

84
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.450
Watch a fucking guy high side on a motorcycle going like fucking 200 miles an

85
00:05:38.451 --> 00:05:42.030
hour.
Like once every three races.

86
00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:45.370
There's just something that would make evil Knievel be like Jesus fucking crowds

87
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.120
.
That guy's still alive.
Which point you say it's called an airbag evil.

88
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.440
You know,
they watched you a little jump there and fucking Caesar's.

89
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.380
Who might say he evil Knievel would laugh at that bullshit.

90
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.190
The little light bikes in their fucking airbags.
You know,

91
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.990
he went out there wearing a fucking pair of leather under roos and gun on a

92
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:08.630
fucking chopper.
You can fucking buy down at the local store.

93
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.880
That fucking bike.
Way more than my goddamn head.

94
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.790
Um,
anyway.
Um,

95
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.150
do you want to watch this motor GP?
So I fucking,
and ended up going online.

96
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.990
Everybody's like,
why didn't you watch it on Reddit for free or whatever.

97
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.990
So I did,
I go to moto GP,
their website.

98
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.700
I sign up for this season 139 bucks.
Right?
More money,
more money.

99
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.190
Just fucking,
just flying out the window.
Right.
So,
um,

100
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.810
I signed up for it and then I'm such an old guy.

101
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:43.280
I couldn't figure out where to watch it.

102
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:46.040
And I finally figured it out after the race was over.
You've got to click on,

103
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.100
there's like four lines on the side and one of them says live.

104
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:51.170
And when you click on that,
that's the fucking race.

105
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.770
By the time I figured that out,
you know,
it's counting down like fucking,

106
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.920
you know,
9,000 hours until the next guy damn race.
So I missed it.

107
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.140
And like all MotoGP races said that sounded like it was exciting as hell.

108
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.490
And it came right down to the end.
And uh,
David CEO,

109
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.740
so beat Mark Knapp cares like he did last year by like the length of his bike.

110
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.260
And um,
I don't know.
I'm hoping if anybody you know,

111
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.440
watches it on Moto GP site,
if they replay it,

112
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:27.640
I can't even find a fucking highlight of it.
Um,
but anyways,

113
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.580
so all you read next down there,
who like your stock car racing,
just,

114
00:07:30.581 --> 00:07:33.370
it's 20 something lapse.
It'll go by in two seconds.

115
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.000
And I know it's a bunch of foreigners out there on their little motorized

116
00:07:37.001 --> 00:07:39.480
scooters.
I ain't,

117
00:07:39.481 --> 00:07:44.240
ain't nobody named Kale or Harry or Dale,
you know,

118
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.400
there's a mark that's kind of an,
uh,
you know,
Andre's Davitt CEO.

119
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.900
So Jorge Lorenzo,
close the fucking border.

120
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.610
I'd like to build a wall around that fucking race tracks.
What the fuck?

121
00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:03.560
I'd like to do.
Jump over that mother fucker.
Um,

122
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.790
so anyways,
I,
I might seem a little like,
my energy is a little higher,

123
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:12.360
little more giddy.
It's because,
uh,
I ain't doing shit.

124
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:17.670
I got a special in the can man.
And,
uh,

125
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:19.650
I'm just,
uh,

126
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.820
I haven't done stand up since I said goodnight night on the second show and a

127
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.590
tonight.
I'm actually going down to the,
um,
to the comedy store there.

128
00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:33.930
It's close to the public.
It's just for comics only,
and it's the,
uh,

129
00:08:33.931 --> 00:08:37.560
the memorial for Brody Stevens,
which I think is going to be a,

130
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.620
I think it's going to be great.
It's going to be sad,

131
00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:44.800
but I really think it's like he's such an uplifting guy and it was so,

132
00:08:44.801 --> 00:08:49.200
so much to learn from him that I,
I am really looking forward to,

133
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:54.930
uh,
to going down there and celebrating that guy's life and the work that he,
uh,

134
00:08:55.170 --> 00:09:00.040
he did down at the comedy store,
one of the legends,
one of the legends.
Um,

135
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.310
there's a place out front where they put all the,

136
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.640
all the names of the people that really built that place and kept it going.

137
00:09:07.641 --> 00:09:12.410
I hope they move his name up there.
That's what I'm going to,
uh,
suggest.

138
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.520
Um,
so anyway,
um,

139
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:18.030
<v 1>yeah,</v>

140
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.860
<v 0>yeah.
All I did,
I took my daughter down to the park,
you know,</v>

141
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:27.210
we went on the fucking,
all the rides and all that stuff.
Just said,

142
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:30.750
like the best time hanging out with her.
And um,

143
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.390
all right.
We said we watch the Bruins,
we watch the Celtics.

144
00:09:35.391 --> 00:09:40.310
Why I watch the Bruins.
I watched three Bruins games as fucking weekend.
Um,

145
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:45.560
the panthers,
Ottawa,
which both ended great.
And then,
uh,
Pittsburgh,

146
00:09:45.561 --> 00:09:46.700
I had a feeling they were going to get us.

147
00:09:46.701 --> 00:09:51.701
I mean we literally one like 18 or 19 in a row undefeated,

148
00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:55.490
you know,
we were like,
we're like 15.
Oh and four I think.

149
00:09:55.491 --> 00:09:59.090
So at some point someone was going to have to stop us and uh,
uh,

150
00:09:59.091 --> 00:10:02.930
the penguins always play as tough and as much as it sucked that the streak
ended.

151
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.440
It was our longest point streaks since I guess the early forties.
But um,

152
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.190
I gotta tell you some Sidney Crosby's pass in the second period.

153
00:10:10.191 --> 00:10:12.680
Did anybody see that?
Jesus Christ.

154
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.250
Oh yeah.
That's one of the things you watch.
It's just like,

155
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.360
what do we need robots for?
Like that's like the kind of thing like a robot,

156
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.070
you know,
skating that fast,

157
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.400
trying to get around the defenseman and then he has another guy streaking down

158
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.150
on the outside of another diff,
a Defenseman,

159
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.730
and then you've got the goalie who could poke check the pass away.

160
00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:37.080
He put it the only place where it could fucking be like a Tom Brady fucking pass

161
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.550
to the quarter of the end zone.

162
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:40.590
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

163
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.100
<v 0>right on the tape bank bag in the back of the fucking that it was just one of</v>

164
00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:46.590
those.
It's one of those things,
even though the other team did it,

165
00:10:46.591 --> 00:10:49.480
you can't even get mad.
You just like Jesus Christ.
That was fucking,

166
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.150
there was a thing of beauty.
Um,
so,
uh,

167
00:10:54.151 --> 00:10:58.000
I don't have another fucking gig other than one quick benefit in New York that

168
00:10:58.001 --> 00:11:02.130
I'm doing on,
um,
April 2nd garden of dreams,

169
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:08.010
um,
at Msg,
uh,
in the theater where Eddie Murphy did raw.

170
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.220
I always think about that when I,
when I go down and do the show that,
that,

171
00:11:11.221 --> 00:11:16.221
that this is where he did that special and I saw him on that tour.

172
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.190
Yeah.
What used to be called great words in Mansfield,

173
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:23.160
Massachusetts with the weather girls opening up.
I,
for the life of me,

174
00:11:23.161 --> 00:11:27.360
cannot find any record of that date when it happened.
I think I finally found it.

175
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.110
What do you,
what are you fucking millennial nerds find that all right.

176
00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:36.111
It was like 85 or in 1986 great woods had just opened Mansfield,

177
00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:42.240
Massachusetts.
And that summer I saw,

178
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.470
I saw Rodney Dangerfield and this was post back to school.

179
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.740
He was that movie hit and he was on this huge tour.

180
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.920
Um,
and then,
uh,
I saw him.

181
00:11:55.921 --> 00:12:00.480
And then that a couple of weeks later I saw Eddie Murphy.
And I remember that,

182
00:12:00.481 --> 00:12:05.000
that really,
uh,
was something that stuck with me.

183
00:12:05.001 --> 00:12:08.720
I was like 18 years old.
And um,

184
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:14.000
I remember when I went to see danger fields watching him and just looking around

185
00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:18.810
at the crowd.
Um,
and it didn't dawn on me,
that was an all white crowd.

186
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.430
Cause I,
you know,
I'm white.
I was just like,

187
00:12:20.431 --> 00:12:22.860
this is what the world looks like to me at that point in my life.
You know,

188
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.920
living in the safe suburbs of Boston,

189
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.770
Massachusetts was just a bunch of white people.
So it didn't really dawn on me.

190
00:12:28.771 --> 00:12:31.020
That was an all white crowd.
And I remember looking around thinking about,
man,

191
00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:33.690
this guy's making everybody laugh.
He's killing.
This is amazing.
Right?

192
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.440
And then a couple of weeks later I saw Eddie Murphy and the crowd was mixed.

193
00:12:39.781 --> 00:12:42.840
And I remember that stuck with me.
I was like,
this guy,
but this guy,

194
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.180
this guy's making everybody laugh.

195
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.200
<v 2>MMM.</v>

196
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.920
<v 0>I had lawn seats for that.
I had seats for Dangerfield,
so I actually saw him and,</v>

197
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:51.520
uh,

198
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.520
it kills me that I didn't try and pony up some more money back then,

199
00:12:56.651 --> 00:13:00.970
but I didn't have any money to not sit in the,
in,
in a fucking field.

200
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.690
I mean,
I didn't really technically see him.

201
00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:08.260
I was just watching them on the monitors,
but he was wearing that purple,

202
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.840
a Mariachi suit that he wore.

203
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:13.263
<v 2>MMM.</v>

204
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.250
<v 0>So anyway,
uh,
fuck am I talking about here?
How the hell did I get onto that?</v>

205
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.210
<v 2>Uh,
I dunno.</v>

206
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:24.140
<v 0>And I watched the Celtics versus the Lakers and,
uh,</v>

207
00:13:24.141 --> 00:13:28.790
at the risk of sounding like an old man,
just,
I fucking hate NBA hoop now.

208
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.730
You know,
it's just,
it's Jesus fuck up and down the fucking court.

209
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:36.610
Everybody launching a three.
There's nobody underneath,

210
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.660
you know the other teams on a 10 old run?
Yeah.
Just keep launching three's.

211
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.700
There's no feed and the big man down low anymore.

212
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.680
None of nobody can stand in the fucking paint.

213
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.110
<v 2>Um,
you know,</v>

214
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.600
<v 0>I dunno.
I Dunno what the fuck is going on with the Celtics.</v>

215
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.950
I haven't watched too much,

216
00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.300
but I watched a bunch the last couple of years and I can tell you this,

217
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:04.260
we had fucking Jae Crowder and Kelly Olynyk and everybody was fucking listening

218
00:14:04.261 --> 00:14:08.250
to Brad Stevens.
We were a tougher team to beat.

219
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.990
We didn't have the level of talent,

220
00:14:09.991 --> 00:14:12.840
but we were a tough team to beat and this whole fucking new era.

221
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:19.050
And you hear the announcers just like,
you know,
they,
they could don't,

222
00:14:19.051 --> 00:14:23.550
the behavior that people get so good that they don't have to listen to the coach

223
00:14:23.551 --> 00:14:25.720
anymore.
And I'm not just picking on the Celtics,

224
00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:30.750
like that's like a round the fucking league and I don't know.
I don't,

225
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.900
you know,
he's going to have to get his touches.
Fuck is touches.

226
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.640
They're going out here to win the fucking game.

227
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:37.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

228
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.610
<v 0>Drives me crazy.
We have this unbelievable chance right now.</v>

229
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:41.970
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

230
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.770
<v 0>With the talent talent that we have,</v>

231
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.030
we should be able to at the very least scare the golden state warriors.

232
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.180
Um,
I know we beat him the other day in Regulus,
but that doesn't mean shit.

233
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:57.140
It's one game,
regular season.
Like those guys are the fucking champs.

234
00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.740
They're in the middle of a fucking dynasty and they're going to have an entirely

235
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:05.060
different energy when you meet them in the finals.
All right?

236
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.750
As opposed to fucking one game out of 80 or whatever that you happen to catch

237
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:12.140
him on a fucking Wednesday night and you beat him.
Um,

238
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:17.770
we have this great opportunity to win another one while the Lakers are fucking

239
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.520
rebuilding.
And I love how everybody's like in panic mode,

240
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.360
like Magic Johnson of those guys are doing exactly what the fuck they said they

241
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:30.740
were going to do.
We brought in Lebron.
Okay.
This is a two year plan.

242
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:35.090
Like the,
the,
the fan base is,
they're so fucking impatient now,

243
00:15:35.091 --> 00:15:38.000
like a two year plan is taken too long.

244
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.910
So it's literally you bring in fucking Lebron the first year and then he's going

245
00:15:42.911 --> 00:15:47.900
to attract all of this free agent help and then they're all going to go out

246
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:52.310
there and pile on because everyone wants to be part of the Lakers fucking,

247
00:15:52.311 --> 00:15:53.144
you know,

248
00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:58.820
great history and they want to fuck models in famous women.

249
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:03.050
You know,
that's the fucking thing that they have over the Celtics.

250
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.620
They got the weather and they got the pussy.
We just can't fucking compete.

251
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.170
You know you want to go racist city to racist city where?
Right there.
Oh,

252
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.600
we got you eyeball to eyeball.
You want to go championships.

253
00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:21.460
We got two more than they do.
Unless you count that Baa one that they count,

254
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.950
but they have the weather and they have the pussy and that,

255
00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.370
that right fucking there.
You know what I mean?

256
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.850
The fuck are you going to do with the,
how do you,
how do you beat that

257
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.650
location,
location,
location.

258
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.750
How many titles do you think that the fucking

259
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.490
Lakers would have had if they stayed in Minneapolis?

260
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:52.110
Okay.
And they had the exact same ownership
I'm asking,

261
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.560
can they still attract the level of talent that they attracted

262
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.410
being out there in Hollywood.

263
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:07.550
Now all of a sudden you're in the frozen Tundra of Minneapolis,

264
00:17:08.581 --> 00:17:09.414
Minnesota,

265
00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:10.913
<v 2>right?</v>

266
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:17.510
<v 0>You got fucking farm fed chicks wearing their overalls coming in from Duluth.</v>

267
00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:24.300
Right.
You got some hay seeds making the trek in from fucking the Dakotas.

268
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.320
I mean,
I don't,
I just don't see it.
I just don't,

269
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:36.350
I just don't think there's enough pussy and you don't have the fucking weather,

270
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.910
whether in pussy have,
have,

271
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:46.420
have caused more goddamn athletes to make stupid fucking moves to jump out of

272
00:17:46.421 --> 00:17:49.210
the NFL and join the fucking world football.

273
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:56.190
Well,
money to money whether and pussy,
the TRIFECTA.

274
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.960
Um,
so I don't know,
I'm just hoping people listen to Brad Stevens.

275
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.260
Just listen to what the fuck this guy says.
Play like a Goddamn team.

276
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.790
Fuck your own stats and just go out there and get it done and let's fucking win

277
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:11.700
another one before the lake is a common cause.
The Lakers are common.

278
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.790
They're always coming.
Okay.
It's almost like a rule.

279
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:17.510
They can only suck for like five fucking years before they're going to read.

280
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.320
And you know,
they're going to their whole fucking,

281
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:23.640
their whole fucking history is,
is,
is free agents,

282
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.560
free agents,
free.
Write down to Kobe Bryant who was a fucking,
uh,

283
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.940
Charlotte Hornet and what kills me,
you know,
look at that Antonio Brown like,

284
00:18:32.941 --> 00:18:34.860
yeah,
you go into the bills,
you know,
I'm not playing for them.

285
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.450
What can they get the fuck out of the League?

286
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.540
Like I don't understand the bills just made a move to get one of the top

287
00:18:42.541 --> 00:18:45.420
receivers in the league,
but he doesn't like where the fuck they are.

288
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.800
So he's not going to fucking go.
I mean that,
that,

289
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.070
I don't know what happened at parody in the fucking league.
I'd like,
listen,

290
00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:56.310
I'm all for like players not getting fucked over by ownership,

291
00:18:56.311 --> 00:19:00.390
but they're at the point now where they have too much power,
you know,

292
00:19:00.391 --> 00:19:02.400
kind of like where the unions were when I was a kid,

293
00:19:02.401 --> 00:19:04.680
which caused all these fucking corporations and be like,
all right,

294
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:07.230
well we'll just going to move the corporation out of this fucking country

295
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.200
and go back to sweatshop labor.
You know,
and I'm a I,
you know,

296
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.360
I don't mind you unions.
I'm not saying don't ever fucking union,
but who's kid.

297
00:19:16.361 --> 00:19:19.450
No kidding.
And most people don't handle power well.
Right.

298
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.120
Then it became to Grady to conti too much leaning on the mop and then the

299
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:25.230
fucking rich guys.
We'll again,

300
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.750
we'll fucking out of here and I gotta tell you something.

301
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.790
All of what I've just said here,
I've,
no,

302
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.300
I don't think I've ever really read on it.
I've just,

303
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:37.200
this is all me just pasting together conversations I've heard throughout my
life.

304
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.290
Okay.
Well,
like I've said before,

305
00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:45.210
if you want clear and accurate information,

306
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.850
you listen to the Joe Rogan podcast.
By the way,

307
00:19:47.851 --> 00:19:50.090
I have to give that guy a shout out,
right?
Uh,

308
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:54.870
as far as like what that guy has done with his part,

309
00:19:54.871 --> 00:19:58.200
have you been looking at the fucking guests at that guy's getting,

310
00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:03.260
he's like Elon Musk and the doctor Phil and a David Lee Roth,

311
00:20:03.781 --> 00:20:07.770
and then like some scientists that ever even heard of who then blows my mind

312
00:20:07.771 --> 00:20:11.970
about like some sort of like a,
I dunno,
I know some scientific shit on a fucking,

313
00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.570
I,
I'm too stupid understand it.
But like,
that guy is

314
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:21.180
like,
I don't know.
I don't know what school,
where this podcasting world's goes,

315
00:20:21.181 --> 00:20:25.320
but like at this point,
if you do,

316
00:20:25.321 --> 00:20:27.480
if you're a guest on his show,

317
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:33.620
you get more heat than if you do like I got fucking legendary talk show.

318
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:41.310
It's,
I don't know.
It's unbelievable what that guy is as has done.

319
00:20:41.311 --> 00:20:44.460
I was just thinking the other day,
I forget what the fuck.
Yes.
Did I see,

320
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.370
I think once a David Lee Roth,
I think it was just the,

321
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.350
the variety of guests.
I mean,
again,

322
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:57.240
Doctor Phil,
that's fucking huge.

323
00:20:57.241 --> 00:21:01.830
I mean that is like a big mainstream oldschool guests.

324
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.870
I'm going to go do the talk show circuit.

325
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.900
I'm gonna fucking go do terrestrial radio and all that.
You get that fucking guy,

326
00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:13.500
me that.
I thought that that was a big,
you know,
I don't know.

327
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.810
That's a big moment.
That's,
that's right up there.
You know,

328
00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:20.010
when Marin had Obama on?
Um,

329
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.280
I think when they look back at like,

330
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.430
what are these podcasts come from and what were some of the watershed moments

331
00:21:26.431 --> 00:21:30.660
like I would say,
I dunno,

332
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:37.010
stamps.com starting to advertise and then it goes Obama on Mark Marin's and then

333
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:44.120
it's Joe Rogan's numbers and his wide variety of gay,

334
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.580
I mean he had like Elon Musk on his show.

335
00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:52.620
The guy took a hit of a joint and it affected his stock prices.

336
00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:01.320
That's fucking amazing.
Um,
anyways,
but meanwhile,

337
00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:05.610
here I sit and my fucking sweatpants talking to myself,
stubborn,

338
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.760
stubborn German Irish guy.
It's just going to do it this way.

339
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.780
I don't want to talk to people,
man.
I'm not fucking with you.
I,

340
00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.140
I,
if you've noticed when I do interviews,
I'm,

341
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:19.890
a lot of times they're too busy thinking about what the fuck I want to say.

342
00:22:19.891 --> 00:22:24.420
Or somebody says something and I drift off and then it becomes like that Chris

343
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.790
Farley thing where I'm just fucking grabbing the side of my pants going,
man,

344
00:22:26.791 --> 00:22:31.080
when you did this?
Yeah,
it was awesome.
Um,

345
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:35.160
all right.
So,
oh,
Billy,
no booze bag.

346
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:40.310
Okay.
107 fucking days.

347
00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.230
And I went to the gym yesterday and for the first time in like three years,

348
00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.440
I did a dip testing out my shoulders.

349
00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:53.720
Fortunately where I go to the gym,
they have like this,
uh,
the,
the dip machine,

350
00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.500
you can actually remove the dip bar and adjust adjusted to your height.

351
00:22:57.501 --> 00:23:02.501
So I have it just way down near the floor where my arms are actually straight

352
00:23:02.661 --> 00:23:06.050
when I'm holding onto it.
And then I just sort of,
uh,

353
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.810
went up on my toes,
you know,

354
00:23:08.811 --> 00:23:12.020
supporting my weight with my arms and went up on my toes like Michael Jackson,

355
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:16.250
you know,
and uh,
you know,
minus that documentary,

356
00:23:16.251 --> 00:23:18.530
whatever the fuck is going on with that.

357
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.870
And I was just slowing myself down and every day,

358
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.420
every time I felt a little bit stronger.
And then yesterday I was like,
oh no,

359
00:23:23.421 --> 00:23:24.890
I think I can do one.
I did one,

360
00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.490
felt all right and then I kind of did three in a row and I was just like,

361
00:23:28.491 --> 00:23:32.690
why did I just do that?
Because I'm finding with the,
the rotator cuff,
it's a,

362
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.550
is it rotator or wrote rotor cuff,
rotator cuff,
um,
rotor cuff.

363
00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.540
Jesus Christ.
He,
me,
I've had this injury for three fucking years and I don't,

364
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.380
it's one of the,
you know,

365
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.740
I just had these words that I don't really know how to say.
So I just them fast.

366
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.650
Oh,
people don't notice rotator cuff.
Yeah.

367
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.090
Oh,
and at first I just think,
is it rotator cup?
A rotator cuff?

368
00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:01.490
I don't know what the fuck it is.
Um,
if you're still listening,
God bless you.

369
00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:03.230
That's all I can say.
So anyways,

370
00:24:03.231 --> 00:24:07.240
I was able to do that and then they have one of those,
uh,
those,

371
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.880
those pull up machines that you can,
you know,
be on your knees,

372
00:24:10.881 --> 00:24:12.320
would like to wait and all that stuff.

373
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.290
So I did like two or three of those and now it's fucking hilarious as I'm kind

374
00:24:15.291 --> 00:24:19.490
of feeling a weird feeling in my other shoulder cause I think this one got worn

375
00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:23.060
out because of the other one.
And,
um,
I think I'm finally,

376
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:26.020
I'm just going to go get an Mri on both of my shoulders,

377
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:28.850
figured out what the fuck's going on and then I might do a rogue,

378
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:33.110
but Rogan's been telling me to do is go fucking check out this guy that does the

379
00:24:33.111 --> 00:24:35.720
stem cell thing and they just shoot it in there and all of a sudden you're like,

380
00:24:35.721 --> 00:24:39.320
a fucking x meant I think I might do that.
You know,

381
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.980
I think I deserve that.
I didn't,
I didn't get the hair plugs right.

382
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.820
I'm not doing botox.
I'm aging naturally,
you know,

383
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.240
I don't think it's anything wrong with rebuilding the engine in my fucking

384
00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:55.130
shoulders.
Oh Geez.
My kids screaming down there.
Um,
but anyways,

385
00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:59.330
I haven't been drinking,
I haven't really been smoking and uh,

386
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.820
I dunno,
I'm actually calling a fucking therapist today to find,

387
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.250
cause I've been saying on my aunt stage of it and working on my anger,

388
00:25:07.251 --> 00:25:10.190
but I've been kind of doing it on my own and I'm finally going to get some help

389
00:25:10.191 --> 00:25:14.930
here.
And,
uh,
I've been doing this joke in my act sane,
like,
you know,

390
00:25:14.931 --> 00:25:17.780
if I just didn't have a temper,

391
00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:19.653
<v 2>like</v>

392
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.350
<v 0>as far as like,
you know,
your wife's always,
you know,</v>

393
00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.230
trying to all say in a nice way,
tries.

394
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.430
He's always trying to help you become a better person.

395
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.940
Like I think if I got rid of my temper,
she would be out of suggestions,

396
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.903
<v 2>you know,</v>

397
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.710
<v 0>because other than my temper,
I mean,
I'm fucking crushing it.</v>

398
00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.680
Do you understand that guys?
Do you understand that?
I am a man

399
00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.280
that can still afford to pay for direct TV

400
00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.720
900 channels,
350 of which are radio stations.

401
00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.370
I don't even listen to those.

402
00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:52.453
<v 2>You know,</v>

403
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:54.630
<v 0>I'll fucking,</v>

404
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:59.280
I'll pay for that direct TV subscription and then I'll order a UFC fight and a

405
00:25:59.281 --> 00:26:03.630
sports package.
I don't give a fuck.
I'll fuck off.

406
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.580
I'll fucking stare at at $300 bill

407
00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.930
<v 2>pay it just like that.</v>

408
00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.560
<v 0>I'm sorry I'm doing this.</v>

409
00:26:15.561 --> 00:26:19.520
I just was so shamed for still paying for fucking cable and I didn't,
I didn't,

410
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.220
I didn't know that yet.
I'm going to fucking doing this shit where I got.

411
00:26:22.221 --> 00:26:26.450
Everything's like,
I like it all right there.
Oh my fucking TV.

412
00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.990
And I watched this on my laptop.
I watch this on my phone.

413
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:34.940
I got this thing on my fucking pad bill.
They're all the same technology.

414
00:26:34.941 --> 00:26:36.700
You can watch them anywhere.
I don't want to figure,

415
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.543
I don't want to figure it out.

416
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.660
You used to just fucking turn it on and that was it.
Three fucking channels.
Boom.

417
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.053
<v 4>Oh,
do do.</v>

418
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.433
<v 0>Okay.</v>

419
00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:49.900

[inaudible],
B.
U.
R.
R.
Okay,
there we go.
That was,

493
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.520
that was relatively painless,
right?

494
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:45.130
You know what I realized halfway through this,

495
00:31:45.131 --> 00:31:47.470
I need to let somebody know that I'm not gonna be able to get to where the fuck

496
00:31:47.471 --> 00:31:51.550
I'm supposed to be.
Anyways.
We plow forward here.
Okay.

497
00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.400
Creepy Lennon Mannequin.
All right.

498
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:59.680
A couple of weeks ago I was in Liverpool and uh,

499
00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:03.860
I went down to this,
this,
um,
oh,
it says right here,

500
00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.130
Magical Beatles Museum.
Okay.
This,
I actually,

501
00:32:06.131 --> 00:32:09.370
and I was making fun of that fucking John Lennon statue.

502
00:32:09.371 --> 00:32:13.120
If you missed the episode,
you can literally,
the,

503
00:32:13.121 --> 00:32:16.300
one of the first fucking things you see and it's like the white suit like,

504
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:17.980
oh fuck,
is that the white suit?

505
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:20.590
Why would that be out here in the open where anybody could just take it?

506
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.780
You Walk Up,
you realize it isn't the white suit,

507
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:26.350
you realize it doesn't look like fucking John Lennon and all,

508
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:30.430
it's got this awful beard like taped to the things face.
I mean it just,

509
00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.560
it just looks like a rip off.
I mean they might as well.

510
00:32:32.561 --> 00:32:34.840
I had a fucking two headed goat standing out there or something,

511
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.500
so I made fun of it.
So anyways,
it says hi belt.

512
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:43.550
I work at the Magical Beatles Museum and parentheses.

513
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.610
I like most of the staff agree with you.

514
00:32:46.611 --> 00:32:51.170
The mannequin should be thrown in the river.
Mercy.
Mercy.
Okay.

515
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.490
The guys from cheap trick found it weird as well.
All right,

516
00:32:55.491 --> 00:32:58.850
so that's a major fucking band with I believe that bands in the rock and roll

517
00:32:58.851 --> 00:33:02.410
hall of fame and they are looking at it like,
dude,
what the fuck?
Um,

518
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:03.470
it's unfortunate.

519
00:33:03.471 --> 00:33:07.370
You and your pal decided not to come in as the mannequins certainly does not

520
00:33:07.371 --> 00:33:12.371
represent what is inside the museum is on three floors and is filled with 300

521
00:33:12.441 --> 00:33:17.441
and counting genuine Beatles artifacts from 1959 to 1970.

522
00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.080
So you know,
this is making me wish I went in there.
Well,

523
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:23.270
you got to get rid of that fucking mannequin.
Uh,

524
00:33:23.271 --> 00:33:28.100
these include the metals John Lennon wore on the sergeant pepper cover.
Wow.

525
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.370
George Harrison's future Rama Guitar.
I didn't know what that is.

526
00:33:31.371 --> 00:33:35.870
The spotlights from Abbey Road Studios,
Ringo Starr's,

527
00:33:35.871 --> 00:33:36.704
snare drum,

528
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:42.430
Jesus seeds from Shea Stadium and the cello from the blue Jay way video,

529
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.300
et Cetera,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
The owner of the museum,

530
00:33:47.301 --> 00:33:52.100
also the guy responsible for the creepy mannequin is

531
00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.060
rogue ASP Denali.
Best

532
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.380
I,
I couldn't tell if that was an affliction or a name.
It's a name.
Okay.

533
00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:05.403
He's the son of

534
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.870
Neil Aspinall Lee Beatles roadie and head of apple records.

535
00:34:09.871 --> 00:34:14.760
He's also brother of Pete best original Beatles Drummer and is a great guy.

536
00:34:14.761 --> 00:34:15.930
Next time you were in Liverpool,

537
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:19.940
come in and we'll give you and your pals slash family of free tour.

538
00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:23.640
All the best bill.
Fuck that dude.
I'm going to pay.
I'm gonna pay.

539
00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:26.040
Although I would ask him.

540
00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:30.990
It does Pete get upset that he started a fucking museum to the band that fired

541
00:34:30.991 --> 00:34:34.500
him,
fired his brother has got it could be kind of weird.
Right.

542
00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:39.540
Um,
I don't know.
I'm sure.
I'm sure Pete best is over it at this point.
Right?

543
00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:44.700
I have one.
Is there any other,
you know,
that's another thing too,
you know,
on,
on,

544
00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:48.630
on Twitter.
I'm an old man.
I'm still on Twitter,
right?
I'm still on the Twitter.

545
00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:54.570
So they had this,
this hashtag going around that said,
um,
um,

546
00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:59.460
not popular opinions.
And people would say like,
you know,
I don't know,

547
00:34:59.461 --> 00:35:02.850
pick somebody like a,
I don't think it,
Dell has a good voice,
you know,

548
00:35:02.851 --> 00:35:06.040
stupid shit.
Like nobody said that by the way.
Um,

549
00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.680
I'm just happy I know how to say her name.

550
00:35:07.681 --> 00:35:11.330
I was calling her to Adelaide for a long fucking time.
Um,

551
00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.530
but somebody wrote that the Beatles are overrated.
That's another one.

552
00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:20.430
That's a big one.
When millennials want to appear edgy,

553
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:25.170
they go,
they're overrated.
Oh,
are they?
Okay.
Okay.

554
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:29.150
Well maybe if you read up on the history at some fucking point on cheese,

555
00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:34.120
I get a phone call.
Hang on a second.
All right,
here's the thing about that.

556
00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.890
I understand if the Beatles,

557
00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.380
you're young and the Beatles music doesn't move you because I mean,

558
00:35:40.381 --> 00:35:44.520
it's music from literally 50 fucking years ago at this point.

559
00:35:44.521 --> 00:35:45.820
That's the end of their career too.

560
00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:50.610
And then the other stuff is coming up on 60 years.
Okay.
So in defense,

561
00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:54.340
you guys,
I understand that,
uh,
if you don't like it or does it,

562
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:59.250
but they're not overrated.
I mean,
they just,
they influenced an entire generation

563
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:06.000
of,
of bands to get started.
They made the whole fucking thing possible.

564
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.100
And because of them,

565
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:11.460
you're listening to the music that you're listening to today.

566
00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:16.050
They are an undeniable part of music history.
But,

567
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:21.080
um,
I would never,
you know,
be this old guy going like,
you know,

568
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.330
if you told me that music sucks,
I'm not going to argue that.
That's just like,

569
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:28.380
I mean,
if I fucking grew up now,
I would like some of their songs.

570
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.540
Even I remember in the 80s,
like liking them in my teacher being like going like,

571
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:34.440
dude,
you don't get it.

572
00:36:34.441 --> 00:36:39.030
You don't get how fucking huge it was when a Beatles album came out.

573
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.090
It's like the thrill,

574
00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:44.490
the fucking world's stopped for younger people.

575
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.610
Then if you bought it and people do what I got to new Beatles album,

576
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:51.660
buddy came over and fucking listen to it.
It,
I,
I mean,
I wasn't even part of that,

577
00:36:51.661 --> 00:36:54.620
so,
um,
but as far as like,
uh,
like furs,

578
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:58.020
he always [inaudible] hates the Beatles and he's just like yellow submarine,

579
00:36:58.021 --> 00:37:02.700
Bill Yellow.
So I was like,
dude,
everybody's got a bad fucking joke in their rack.

580
00:37:02.701 --> 00:37:03.534
C'Mon.

581
00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:05.183
<v 1>Okay.</v>

582
00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:10.180
<v 0>Um,
anyways,
you know,
versus,
you know,
whatever.</v>

583
00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:14.800
I,
it's,
I,
I get it.
I get it.
It's,
it's too much time has passed.

584
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.880
Um,
I've heard,

585
00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:20.880
I've heard younger comics talk about some big comics that way and not get like,

586
00:37:22.061 --> 00:37:26.320
what the big deal is.
But what happens is,
is the further,

587
00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.020
like,
let's look at Beethoven.

588
00:37:29.021 --> 00:37:32.920
Can you fucking imagine when that Shit first came out?

589
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:38.460
Like it just keep fucking sitting there.
You got a goddamn boil,

590
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.640
the size of my foot on the side of your fucking head.

591
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.050
You fight enough typhoid for a yellow feet,
whatever the fuck God damn plague.

592
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.840
And all of a sudden this guy just shows up with a hunter,
but his friends I,
yeah,

593
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.780
but like,
dude,
what the fuck?
You know?

594
00:37:55.781 --> 00:37:59.230
And now you're just sitting there eating a subway sandwich in an elevator and in

595
00:37:59.231 --> 00:38:02.290
the backgrounds gone butter,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

596
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.890
Just it just something have the same fucking kick impact.
Um,

597
00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:11.470
but that it doesn't mean the dude's overrated.
Does it?
I don't fucking know.

598
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:15.803
MMM.

599
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

600
00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:20.770
<v 0>Anyways,
moving ahead here.
Or if you look at you,
if you look at what is,
uh,</v>

601
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:22.320
the salt,
you've watched soul train,

602
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.680
do you watch some of the people dancing from way fucking back then?

603
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.800
There's a lot of them that I've compared to today's standards.

604
00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:32.940
I'm not talking about the legendary dances,
just people on the dance floor.

605
00:38:32.941 --> 00:38:35.670
I just,
when I watch,
cause Nia loves that show and be just watching,

606
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.910
I just laugh going like,
you know,

607
00:38:36.911 --> 00:38:41.911
there's a lot of people on this show that are dancing at a level that awful

608
00:38:42.431 --> 00:38:43.870
white people dance at today.

609
00:38:43.871 --> 00:38:48.400
Like the bar just keeps getting raised off of the work.
So if you go back,

610
00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:53.401
the hardest thing to do when you go back in history is to block out what has

611
00:38:53.861 --> 00:38:58.750
happened since then and try to put it into historical perspective,

612
00:38:58.751 --> 00:39:02.450
which is practically impossible.
Um,

613
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.140
it's like going back and looking at Johnny Unitas,

614
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:10.170
how he threw for over 40,000 yards in his career and like the next closest guy

615
00:39:10.361 --> 00:39:14.350
had half as much as that.
But now I like the way the rules have changed,

616
00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:15.184
like a fucking,

617
00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:20.340
like a Goddamn backup quarterback will throw for 30,000 in his career.

618
00:39:20.801 --> 00:39:25.720
So it doesn't seem like a big deal.
Um,
so I dunno,

619
00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.440
I'm just defending the Beatles,
that's all.

620
00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:32.700
And I feel bad that I trust his fucking museum and I judged it by that goddamn

621
00:39:32.701 --> 00:39:35.520
mannequin.
I think the whole purpose,

622
00:39:35.521 --> 00:39:40.260
all that was me just realizing that I'm a bit of a cunt.
He's a bit of a con.

623
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:45.620
There he is.
He is a bit of a cunt.
Um,

624
00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.420
Eric cheesy cheesing babies,

625
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.250
a dear Billy badge.

626
00:39:51.251 --> 00:39:54.850
Have you seen these pussies throwing cheese onto their kids' faces?

627
00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.930
I saw one of them.

628
00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.910
It's just the fucking desperation for people to get views.

629
00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:02.893
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

630
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:06.330
<v 0>Um,
on the Internet to the appointment.
Look,
I'm a performer.</v>

631
00:40:06.331 --> 00:40:09.240
I have a desperation for it.
I get it on some level,

632
00:40:09.241 --> 00:40:12.720
but when you start like the amount of videos I just see like parents with their

633
00:40:12.721 --> 00:40:13.800
kids,
right.

634
00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:19.040
And they're starting to fall and they don't do anything and they just film it so

635
00:40:19.371 --> 00:40:23.930
they can laugh and they just like,
let their kid get hurt is,
you know,

636
00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:28.280
the real ones like you can tell it wasn't set up is cause right as a kid starts

637
00:40:28.281 --> 00:40:29.110
to fall,
like the,

638
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:32.240
you see the fucking phone flies out of frame and you actually missed the kid

639
00:40:32.241 --> 00:40:36.320
falling down.
You can tell the parent lunged and tried to save the person.

640
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:39.730
But,
um,
yeah,
I don't get it anyways.

641
00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.500
It's like how much the person said,
uh,

642
00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:46.190
how much do you hate yourself that you'd throw cheese on a baby's face?

643
00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:52.500
Just imagine what type of memory is sublimely stored where a baby sees a camera

644
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:54.870
and then something hit their face.

645
00:40:55.110 --> 00:41:00.110
I'd arrest all these asshole parents and throw fire hose water in that at their

646
00:41:00.361 --> 00:41:02.640
faces.
Um,
yeah,
I mean,

647
00:41:02.641 --> 00:41:07.330
I don't know if it does like psychological damage to the baby.

648
00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:08.800
If you can even fucking remember it.

649
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.590
Like some day it's going to be in Philly and they're like,
hey,

650
00:41:11.591 --> 00:41:13.490
you want to get a cheese steak?
It's like,
hey chase,

651
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:17.710
it fucking starts slamming a sandwich into his face.

652
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.310
Um,
I don't know that it does that.

653
00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.790
There is just the thing where when you are,

654
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:29.320
you become a parent just sounded like defenseless and helpless.
You kid is,

655
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:34.240
um,
look,
I'm not advocating being

656
00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.060
<v 3>a helicopter parent.
I'm not saying that,
but</v>

657
00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:43.370
<v 0>there's just something about filming it.
Like,
cause it's,</v>

658
00:41:43.371 --> 00:41:48.371
the kid obviously doesn't enjoy it obviously startles the kid and the fact that

659
00:41:49.101 --> 00:41:54.100
you're putting your own fucking adult needs ahead of that.
I mean I,

660
00:41:54.101 --> 00:41:55.070
I all of that,

661
00:41:55.071 --> 00:42:00.071
that whole category is giving your kid a stupid fucking name like coat hanger or

662
00:42:00.171 --> 00:42:05.050
some dumps,
Hollywood celebrity fucking name or,
or are

663
00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:06.420
<v 3>yeah,</v>

664
00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:10.260
<v 0>putting your fucking political agenda like your kid is going to live your</v>

665
00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:11.910
political agenda.

666
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:15.930
I'm raising my kid gender neutral and then all of a sudden you could see his son

667
00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:20.640
has to wear a fucking dress just so you can show off how fucking progressive you

668
00:42:20.641 --> 00:42:24.230
are rather than asking the kid if he just wants a football instead.

669
00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.210
You know what I mean?
Like you're going to make that decision.

670
00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:30.390
I think all of that stuff is,
um,

671
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.920
I don't know what the,
I'm not a psychologist.
I,
I just,

672
00:42:34.921 --> 00:42:38.850
it's not how I would do it,
you know?
I think he should,

673
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:42.240
if your kid starts to fall,
you should try to catch your kid.

674
00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:46.200
I think if there's cheese,
you should hand it to your child.

675
00:42:46.201 --> 00:42:48.420
If your kid wants to eat it,
they eat it.
If they don't,

676
00:42:48.421 --> 00:42:53.100
then you finish it and gain a few more pounds like a dad.
Right.
Um,

677
00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.500
I dunno.
And I,
I saw,
I also just like,

678
00:42:56.501 --> 00:42:59.820
if your kid fucks up and then you put it on the Internet,
it's just like,
it,

679
00:42:59.821 --> 00:43:04.090
it exists forever and kids are already made.
You're literally giving like,

680
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:10.370
um,
ammunition.
Like somebody showed me this video,

681
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:15.390
this woman or a kid was being a class clown and dancing at school and she gave

682
00:43:16.051 --> 00:43:20.730
him the option.
She says,
I'm either going to give you the belt or you can dance.

683
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:24.720
So the kid is crying cause he's scared and he's sitting there doing this half as

684
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.870
like dancing while he's crying and everybody thinks it's funny.

685
00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:29.670
It's like this fucking kid has to go to school.

686
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:32.700
Not to mention you should have hit a kid with a belt.

687
00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:36.180
There's like so many fucking things that are wrong with it.
Um,

688
00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:42.970
I don't know.
So,
yeah,
I don't,
I don't like,

689
00:43:42.971 --> 00:43:46.360
and I think you know,
your instincts that you're that mad that you,
you,

690
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:49.600
I could feel the anger that you have towards it.
Yeah.
Like you shouldn't do that.

691
00:43:49.601 --> 00:43:53.350
And I imagine with your level of anger,
like some shit was done to you,

692
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:57.880
um,
as was done to me and I think you go one of two ways.

693
00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:02.880
You either repeat it slash try to take it to the next level or you just go back

694
00:44:04.721 --> 00:44:07.690
to like,
oh,
I remember what that felt like.
I,
yeah,
I'm not doing that.

695
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:12.700
Why would I do that?
Um,
but you know,
there's a lot of morons that,
um,

696
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:16.810
you know,
you don't have to be smart to know how to fuck.
That's the thing.

697
00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:21.230
If they just made it like something like,
uh,
like if it was as difficult is,

698
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:25.960
is getting like a degree in something,
I think the world would be a better place.

699
00:44:25.961 --> 00:44:29.520
But anybody can be good.
But did stared it up,
but I wanted to stick it in there.

700
00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:31.950
And next thing you know,
you have a fucking kid,

701
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.700
you throwing cheese at it and you're filming it.
Um,

702
00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:37.720
<v 1>yeah,</v>

703
00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:41.460
<v 0>I dunno.
I it's,
I wouldn't do it.
We'll see.</v>

704
00:44:41.461 --> 00:44:42.840
We'll see what the fallout is,

705
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:46.890
but my kid's not going to be part of that fucking experiment.
All right.

706
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.940
Premiere league soccer,
soccer is in quotes.

707
00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:54.300
I'm imagining this is a fucking somebody who doesn't live in the u s uh,

708
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:55.530
hey Billy Ball breaker.

709
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:58.650
I've been listening for a long time and really enjoy your podcasts,

710
00:44:58.651 --> 00:45:03.651
especially during football season as I find your analysis is put more in

711
00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:07.650
layman's terms for us Brits being a fellow Patriot Fan.

712
00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:12.420
Niosh here also gets me shit as most people follow.

713
00:45:12.421 --> 00:45:15.050
The Seahawks wasn't that interesting.
Hey.
Yeah.

714
00:45:15.051 --> 00:45:18.780
If you don't mind right back and let me know why did they follow the Seahawks?

715
00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:21.530
Is it,

716
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:24.620
cause it's always cloudy over there and they had the same kind of weather in

717
00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:27.770
Britain as they do in Seattle.
That's really interesting.
Um,

718
00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.860
I've enjoyed your recent ramblings about the premier league in Liverpool's

719
00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:32.510
battle with Manchester this year.

720
00:45:32.511 --> 00:45:37.060
So I thought I'd share a few facts you may enjoy.
And Lpwan understand more.
Uh,

721
00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:40.880
Liverpool were actually the more successful team in history with 18 league

722
00:45:40.881 --> 00:45:42.710
titles.
Oh yeah.
The,
I heard about this,

723
00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.260
this is like before the premiere league existed,

724
00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:49.610
it's almost like pre Superbowl era.
They had five Europe Aka,

725
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:51.110
so 18 league titles,

726
00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:56.260
five European titles and a bunch of other cups until recently when their biggest

727
00:45:56.991 --> 00:45:57.824
rivals,

728
00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:02.390
Manchester United over took them and have 20 titles,

729
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:04.280
but only three European titles.

730
00:46:04.281 --> 00:46:09.281
So that's basically the Celtics and Lakers of a premier league football.

731
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.000
Um,
given your gripe about the Steelers,

732
00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.200
I thought you'd be interested to know that all 18 of Liverpool's titles were

733
00:46:18.201 --> 00:46:19.790
before the Premiere League era,

734
00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:24.950
but are still very much counted here as it should be.
Yes,
it should.
Uh,

735
00:46:24.951 --> 00:46:29.510
their Wikipedia page is very interesting as they have also faced tragedies along

736
00:46:29.511 --> 00:46:34.060
with other clubs and still cake out on top.

737
00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:38.480
Never heard that expression unless you,
that's a typo.
Secondly,
a man,

738
00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:43.570
man city are only recently a good team as 10 years ago they were about,

739
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:48.070
they were,
well,

740
00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:51.160
I think he missed a word here as 10 years ago.

741
00:46:51.161 --> 00:46:53.710
They were about over by Arab.

742
00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:57.180
I think they were bought out his what he wanted Eric Billionaires and if

743
00:46:57.181 --> 00:47:02.110
basically play paid extraordinary amounts of money for the best players and are

744
00:47:02.111 --> 00:47:06.850
still not quite good enough to win all the cups.
See this is,

745
00:47:06.851 --> 00:47:08.380
this is what you need to get into it.

746
00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:10.650
It's already a beautiful game and now all I need is the,

747
00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:15.400
the backstory and the drama.
So I think that's really interesting that man city,

748
00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:19.920
all of a sudden they have all this money.
Um,

749
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:21.690
which who gives a fuck,
cause you know,

750
00:47:21.691 --> 00:47:24.780
before then everyone was probably going to man United or Liverpool if they

751
00:47:24.781 --> 00:47:29.040
wanted to win a title.
Now here they come out of nowhere.
I like it.

752
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.610
It's good.
You know,
you guys all got money.
The Boston Red Sox on the Liverpool,

753
00:47:33.611 --> 00:47:38.380
God knows they got fucking more money than God.
Um,
what about man United?

754
00:47:38.381 --> 00:47:40.930
Did they got a bunch of money?
But that legacy,

755
00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:45.340
I feel like they need to do something soon or all of a sudden it starts to fade

756
00:47:45.341 --> 00:47:49.900
a little bit.
Like the Michigan Wolverines,
like thank God they got a,

757
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.300
what's his face there?
Captain?
Come back to save the end.
He did.

758
00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:55.580
Even though he hasn't beaten Ohio state yet,
uh,

759
00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:59.650
Harbaugh's saved that fucking program because you can only be bad for so long.

760
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:04.330
We're all this.
If you suck for kids in a recruits entire life,

761
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:07.870
they don't give a shit that becomes beetle ever.
Stuff like,
yeah,
whatever,

762
00:48:07.871 --> 00:48:10.240
that's yellow submarine football.
I don't give a fuck about it.

763
00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:13.420
And they're going to end up like Oregon came out of nowhere cause all of a

764
00:48:13.421 --> 00:48:18.070
sudden they started having these cool uniforms and started winning games.
Um,

765
00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:23.140
Abbott on a total tangent here.
So let's see.
Here we go.
Thirdly,

766
00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:28.060
going on what you said about the offsides rule and the defending player slowing

767
00:48:28.061 --> 00:48:31.930
down,
they can do this,
but if the attacking player is behind them,

768
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:34.300
when the ball is played,

769
00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:39.940
they are still on side and can score.
Wait,
how does that work?

770
00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:45.600
The attacking player is behind them.
When the ball is played,

771
00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.920
what does that mean?
He ran past him with the ball.

772
00:48:50.921 --> 00:48:54.070
He can't go past the last defender without the ball.
Right?

773
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:58.550
So the attacker must time they're run with the are.

774
00:48:58.551 --> 00:49:03.310
There are other players making the past and the defending players must do the

775
00:49:03.311 --> 00:49:07.180
same but also be aware that if they get,
oh I see what you're saying.

776
00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:11.020
So like if he's like parallel

777
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:13.723
to um,

778
00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:18.830
or is it perpendicular fees parallel to the defenseman and somebody kicks the

779
00:49:18.831 --> 00:49:20.600
ball,
pass through the defenseman,

780
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:25.190
he can take off as the ball's kicked and then he won't,

781
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:29.690
he'll still be on site.
I get that.
All right.
That's a little more,
uh,

782
00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:33.470
okay.
I guess.
So it's sort of like a moving blue line I guess.

783
00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:37.940
I really appreciate you taking the time to explain this to me though.
Um,

784
00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:42.770
so let me read that again.
Slowly when the ball is played that means kicked,

785
00:49:42.771 --> 00:49:47.540
I guess then they are still on the outside and kids scores.

786
00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:50.000
So the way of way,
way where the fuck was.
Thirdly going on,

787
00:49:50.001 --> 00:49:53.930
what you said about the offsides rule and the defending players slowing down,

788
00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:57.350
they can do this,
but if the attacking player is behind them,

789
00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:59.930
when the ball is played,
meaning kicked,

790
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:02.390
then they are still on site and can score.

791
00:50:02.391 --> 00:50:07.391
So the attacker must time they're run with their other player.

792
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:12.650
I like that.
There's a finesse to that.
I have to respect making the pass.
Oh,

793
00:50:12.651 --> 00:50:15.410
do you have to respect it?
You fucking arrogant cunt.
Whatever.

794
00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.273
I'm trying to be nicer.

795
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:21.430
And then defending players must do the same but also be aware that if they get,

796
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:27.590
if they get wrong,
they have to chase back and stopped the goal.

797
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:32.180
There are also other factors such as the other player isn't involved in the
play.

798
00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:37.010
He is an offside and can stand anywhere.
All right.
Apologies for the length.

799
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:39.440
Nah Man,
you actually cleared it up a little bit more.

800
00:50:39.441 --> 00:50:43.490
I still don't think I 100% understand it cause I don't know how far away you

801
00:50:43.491 --> 00:50:47.840
have to be from the play and stuff and you can still be on side.
Um,

802
00:50:47.841 --> 00:50:51.560
hope you found this interesting and please do a show and either Belfast or

803
00:50:51.561 --> 00:50:56.240
Dublin so I can go.
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
I was out in Dublin last June.

804
00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:00.470
I haven't been at Belfast in,
in a little bit,
but,
um,

805
00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:06.070
I have to tell you how excited the two tours I've done this year through Europe.

806
00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:10.010
It's been incredible.
And,
um,

807
00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:14.840
I got one more that starts in Iceland at the end of April.

808
00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:19.460
And,
um,
all it's,
I don't know,

809
00:51:19.461 --> 00:51:24.230
it's just incredible.
The people showing up,
the venues I get to play too.
Um,

810
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:29.450
yeah,
I dunno,
I'm still kind of a blown away by that,

811
00:51:29.451 --> 00:51:33.290
so I'm looking forward to it and I still am kept not been down to Australia.

812
00:51:33.291 --> 00:51:35.290
I keep saying if something always ends up coming up against,

813
00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:39.440
got some active work and to push some dates,
but,
um,

814
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:41.630
after I do my next year up run the next one I do,

815
00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:44.360
I have to go back to Australia because I haven't been there in a couple of
years.

816
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:47.090
Um,
all right.

817
00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:50.600
And now I just take the specials and I got to build a fucking hour back up again

818
00:51:50.601 --> 00:51:53.600
and I can't go over there when it's weak.
I gotta make sure,
you know,

819
00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:57.860
cause those eyes,
these fucking people don't screw around.
Right.
Um,

820
00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:02.090
so I gotta make sure it's where it needs to be,
but I will figure all of this up.

821
00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:07.040
All right.
Um,
all right.

Dear Bill,
have you heard of binary?
I'll beets.

823
00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:18.680
They're a great alternative to silent meditation and have the same benefits.

824
00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:22.610
All you need is a nice pair of headphones and Youtube on your phone.

825
00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:26.150
Just wanted to let you know,
because I'm also an angry cunt sometimes.

826
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:29.660
Um,

827
00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:34.220
I found these and they really help with every negative emotion.

828
00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:39.230
They are even a few.
There are even a few that apparently help with migraines.

829
00:52:39.231 --> 00:52:43.820
Check them out.
Thanks for the laughs.
Is this a real thing?
Is this a thing?

00:53:46.011 --> 00:53:50.990
Alumni can lie to you.
I was a little,
little e.
Oh,
speaking of scary movies,

842
00:53:50.991 --> 00:53:54.410
if you fuck,
did you see Jordan peals the trailer for his new movie?

843
00:53:56.750 --> 00:54:00.260
That movie looks so scary.
I'm almost angry at him because I've got,

844
00:54:00.261 --> 00:54:04.760
I'm going to go see it.
I saw that and he was like,
oh my God.
And I was like,
dude,

845
00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:08.720
fuck that movie.
Fuck that.
I'm going to go see it.
But Jesus Christ.

846
00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:15.310
Oh my God,
I fucking hate scary movies,
but I love Jordan.

847
00:54:15.311 --> 00:54:17.740
So I'm going to go see that movie.
And I also love,
this is um,

848
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:19.840
the last one he did sell,

849
00:54:19.841 --> 00:54:24.670
but like this one looks like it's just full on fucking horror and uh,

850
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:29.740
I don't need that,
but you know,
I'm going to go see it.
Alright.

851
00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:33.400
Boyfriend's family is silent during dinner.
We should go see it.

852
00:54:33.401 --> 00:54:35.650
Me In d and then we'll come on the podcast and talk about it.
She'll be like,

853
00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:36.610
oh my God,
I love that.

854
00:54:36.611 --> 00:54:41.020
I love being scared and I'll be fucking pissed that I went through that shit.

855
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.560
You know,
I told you when I saw it,
when I saw the Blair witch,

856
00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:48.340
I had a set at the laugh factory and I went to the moon like the midnight

857
00:54:48.341 --> 00:54:52.180
showing by myself.
And then I walked down to the parking garage

858
00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:57.220
by myself to the car.
Just totally freaked off like Josh,

859
00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:02.520
Josh.
Like
I know I,

860
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.680
I'm not one of those people that could just sit there and be like,

861
00:55:04.681 --> 00:55:09.390
this is the movie I fucking buy in and it's scares the shit out of me.
Um,

862
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:12.750
all right.
Boyfriend's family is silent during dinner.

863
00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:16.810
Okay.
Let's see.
Well,
what do we do with this one dear bill,

864
00:55:16.811 --> 00:55:20.050
I need some advice about a guy I've been seeing who is great,

865
00:55:20.051 --> 00:55:24.670
but it's family are kind of strange.
They are lovely and quite nice,

866
00:55:24.671 --> 00:55:27.700
but they are incredibly awkward when together as a family.

867
00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:30.790
It's not that they say or do weird things,

868
00:55:30.791 --> 00:55:33.700
it's that we basically sit in the silence when we're together.

869
00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:38.920
When I first met him,
when I first met them,
Jesus Christ,

870
00:55:38.921 --> 00:55:41.590
I feel like I should be playing that in meditation music while I fucking

871
00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:44.800
[inaudible] as I read this,
um,

872
00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:49.900
there's nobody there stirring coffee slowly are they are a tea,
whatever it was.

873
00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:55.510
Um,
when I first met them I thought that they must have just came from a funeral

874
00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:59.260
because we went out for lunch and it was eerily silent.

875
00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:01.980
I was trying to be nice and ask a few questions,

876
00:56:01.981 --> 00:56:04.660
but I was just getting one word answers.

877
00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.980
I asked my boyfriend about this and he had no idea what I was talking about.

878
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:13.090
He even started to get a bit defensive.
Oh,
all right,
well there you go.
That's,

879
00:56:13.091 --> 00:56:15.580
that's just how they are.
Um,

880
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.660
we've been dating about six months and I dread seeing that because it feels like

881
00:56:19.661 --> 00:56:24.520
I'm being tortured and,
and threat of speaking.

882
00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:29.580
My boyfriend is completely oblivious to it and loved seeing his family,

883
00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:34.790
which is crazy weird because I would say he is reasonably outgoing and fun when

884
00:56:35.401 --> 00:56:40.230
we go out with a group of friends.
Yeah.
That is what's really fucking weird.

885
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.110
Should I stop seeing him or do you think,

886
00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:45.970
<v 2>uh,
yeah,</v>

887
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:49.330
<v 0>Mr Warden you think would be some good techniques for dealing with them.</v>

888
00:56:49.331 --> 00:56:53.860
Please give me some advice.
Hey,
you're single,
you're not married,

889
00:56:53.861 --> 00:56:55.150
so this is all about you.

890
00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:56.893
<v 2>All right.</v>

891
00:56:57.650 --> 00:57:01.250
<v 0>You,
you just have to,
you have to figure out,
do I love this guy?</v>

892
00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:02.420
You haven't even said you loved him.

893
00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:07.460
Am I into this person enough to put up with this?
Like these people,

894
00:57:07.461 --> 00:57:08.780
you have a kid with this guy.

895
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:12.200
These fucking non talking motherfuckers are coming over to your house.

896
00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:14.290
<v 2>All right.</v>

897
00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:16.250
<v 0>It seems like you're early on where you like,</v>

898
00:57:16.251 --> 00:57:19.070
should I stop seeing this guy or should maybe a,

899
00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.020
it all depends on how much you liked the guy.

900
00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:25.843
<v 2>MMM.</v>

901
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:29.300
<v 0>That's so,
it's so weird that there,</v>

902
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:32.820
it's not weird that they're like that and it's not weird that he's oblivious

903
00:57:34.110 --> 00:57:37.620
because,
you know,
your family just seems like your family,
you grew up,

904
00:57:37.621 --> 00:57:39.030
but the fact

905
00:57:40.350 --> 00:57:41.370
<v 2>that</v>

906
00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:45.940
<v 0>he loves seeing them,
that's what's weird to me.</v>

907
00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:50.570
Like if they just like a not close,
cold family that barely talks,

908
00:57:50.571 --> 00:57:53.860
like that's usually would mean that,
you know,
I see him once every year,

909
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:56.360
year and a half.
I come around during the holidays and then that's it.

910
00:57:56.570 --> 00:57:59.750
But the fact that he goes there all the time to sit there and then not say

911
00:57:59.751 --> 00:58:00.620
anything to them,

912
00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:03.653
<v 2>mmm.</v>

913
00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:08.060
<v 0>I Dunno,
it starts making me wonder if they're like fucking aliens or something.</v>

914
00:58:08.061 --> 00:58:12.680
They're communicating through the center of their foreheads or some shit.
Um,

915
00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:15.070
<v 2>yeah.</v>

916
00:58:15.070 --> 00:58:17.980
<v 0>Yeah,
that's definitely strange.
Um,</v>

917
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:22.900
and the fact that you're so uncomfortable that now you're thinking maybe there's

918
00:58:22.901 --> 00:58:26.110
some good techniques that you're going to go in there and Dr Phil and fixed the

919
00:58:26.111 --> 00:58:30.850
whole fucking family in one segment,
it's not going to happen.
Um,

920
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:34.120
so I think you need to,
uh,

921
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:36.460
you got to make a tough choice there.

922
00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:38.330
<v 2>All right,</v>

923
00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:42.400
<v 0>me the is great guy.
Go and try to find another great guy.</v>

924
00:58:42.401 --> 00:58:43.660
You sound like you're still young,

925
00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:47.440
still drafted in the first couple of rounds so there's plenty of good talent

926
00:58:47.441 --> 00:58:52.000
left out there and maybe you could have more of a normal family,
but that is a,

927
00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:52.863
or

928
00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:58.850
you just learn to deal with their creepy horror show fucking vibe.

929
00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:02.340
<v 2>But
um,</v>

930
00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:05.130
<v 0>I don't know what good techniques you're going to use to fix that.</v>

931
00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:08.700
Especially when you brought it up to him.

932
00:59:08.701 --> 00:59:12.870
He had no idea what you were talking about and was like defensive about it.
So,

933
00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:18.510
so there is that.
Um,
anyways,
I'm going to try that,

934
00:59:18.511 --> 00:59:22.850
that fucking horror music chanting shit.
Sorry.
You're all,

935
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:25.640
I think I would actually like this better than

936
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.590
I have a meditation app and it's just this and this guy just keeps talking

937
00:59:30.591 --> 00:59:35.591
throughout being like hello again and welcome to another beautiful day with an

938
00:59:36.171 --> 00:59:39.680
opportunity to clear your mind.
Beditate

939
00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:45.880
I'd like you to find a comfortable chair

940
00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:50.820
and just sit in it,

941
00:59:54.970 --> 00:59:59.620
the other chair
up against your body.

942
01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:08.030
Are there places that it's touching you too much

943
01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:15.150
or does it feel just right?
I'm

944
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:21.380
fucking that shit and it's just like,
oh my God,
dude,
just shut the fuck up.

945
01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:25.250
All right.
Just tell me to breathe and that just shut up please.

946
01:00:25.251 --> 01:00:27.830
For the love of God shut up.
So I think I would rather,

947
01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:30.020
rather than listen to that guy,
I'd rather listen to this shit.

948
01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.080
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

949
01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:35.913
<v 0>Josh,</v>

950
01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:42.930
I don't mean to end this so fucking in such a creepy Goddamn web.
Um,

951
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.660
maybe I need to listen to this shit so I can go see Jordan teals,

952
01:00:45.661 --> 01:00:49.410
new fucking movie and not be overly freaked out and traumatized by it.

953
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:56.110
Um,
how great is it that that guy's making movies is,
it's every once in a,

954
01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:59.610
somebody fucking like that comes along.
It's just awesome.
It's awesome.

955
01:00:59.611 --> 01:01:02.520
If you love movies,
it's fucking awesome.
All right.
That is the,
uh,

956
01:01:02.521 --> 01:01:05.490
that is the podcast.
Ladies a gentleman.

957
01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:09.690
I'll check it on ya on Thursday.
Go Bruins,
go Celtics.

958
01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:14.550
Um,
if anybody knows how,
if I can watch a replay of the moto GP race,

959
01:01:14.551 --> 01:01:18.780
I would love to watch it.
Um,
send it to my Twitter account,

960
01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:21.900
please let me know.
I would love to see it.
All right.
That's it.

961
01:01:21.901 --> 01:01:24.120
Go fuck yourselves and I'll see you on Thursday.
