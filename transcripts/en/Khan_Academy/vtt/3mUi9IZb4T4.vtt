00:00:00.464 --> 00:00:01.880
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.937
give an overview of how money
is created in most market based

00:00:06.937 --> 00:00:09.270
economies, and even a little
bit of a discussion of what

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.420
really is money.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.711
And we can go into much
more depth in future videos.

00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:15.210
And I think in many
videos I already

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.620
have gone into a much
more technical depth.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.560
In most market based
economies right now

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.230
there is a central bank, which
is essentially the actor,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.410
they do many things.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.960
They often will be a
regulatory agency as well.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.120
But their main role is to
have the right to print money,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.960
and to put that money
into circulation.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.630
And I'll rely heavily
on the model of the US.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.620
That's hard to read.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.260
The central bank
in some countries

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.890
is formerly part
of the government.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.240
In other countries,
it's pseudo-independent.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.880
In the US.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.970
It's more of the
pseudo-independent flavor

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.510
of a central bank, although
obviously closely connected

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.540
with the government.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.220
The US Federal Reserve,
a lot of the leaders

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.430
are appointed by the government.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.890
It's excess profits go
back to the government.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.040
And so obviously it has very
close ties to the government.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.157
But when the central bank
decides to print money,

00:01:12.157 --> 00:01:13.490
it literally can just create it.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.740
It could literally
print physical money.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.520
Or it can create
electronic money,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.240
which has the same exact effect.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.000
So let's say the central
bank, it goes out there

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.170
and it goes out there
and it prints three--

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.320
and we'll just focus on
the physical right now.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.400
It's a little bit
easier to conceptualize.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.310
And it just goes out there and
it prints three physical dollar

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.839
bills.

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:36.380
Now it has to figure
out, how does it

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.560
get it into circulation?

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.090
How does it get it
into the economy?

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.480
And it does not just
put it into a helicopter

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.330
and drop it from
that helicopter.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.680
Sometimes, in certain
circumstances,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.070
it can lend to this directly to
banks, certain types of banks,

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.850
member banks.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.670
But the typical way that
this enters circulation

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.910
is that the central bank will
use this newly created money,

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.140
this newly created
reserves I should say,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.755
to go out into the open
market and buy securities.

00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:08.690
And they typically buy very
safe securities, typically

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.130
government debt.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.560
So they will go
out there and they

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.865
will put this into circulation.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.300
And in exchange they
are buying securities

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.500
from the open market.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.370
So then these securities
from the open market

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.910
will go to the central bank.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.390
So these are securities, or
maybe we could call them bonds.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.140
And once they do that, then
whoever had these before,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.170
whoever was the owner of
the securities before,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.003
they just sold them.

00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:39.440
Now they have
these dollar bills.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.825
And they could either directly
spend those dollar bills

00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:44.950
or they could deposit those
dollar bills in a bank.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.449
If they spend the
dollar bills, then

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:48.772
whoever they gave those
dollar bills to at some point

00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:50.230
would want to
deposit it in a bank.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.680
Some way, by buying
these securities,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.690
someone now has
these dollar bills.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.580
And they will deposit
them in a private bank.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.880
So let's draw that.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.120
So right over here
is a private bank.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.410
And now it has the dollar bills.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.900
It has these reserves now.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.760
It has the reserves.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.360
Now, that's not the
end of the story.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.730
This money can now be lent.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.050
And this is key,
because this is what's

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.200
typical in most
market economies where

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.490
they have fractional
reserve lending.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:34.690
So fractional reserve lending,
which is a bit strange,

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.200
because you are telling the
person who just deposited

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.290
this money right here, that
you can go at any time and you

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.310
can take this money out.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.840
We've got this money for you.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.590
You can trust us.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.340
You don't have to be
paranoid about what's

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.870
going on with this money.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.710
But the reality
is that this bank

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.570
is allowed to keep only a
fraction of these reserves,

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.420
and lend to the rest of it out.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.172
In order for this system
to not be super fragile,

00:03:58.172 --> 00:04:00.130
the Central Bank then
also insures these banks.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.020
But we'll talk about
that into more depth.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.520
But here.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.520
I just want to show you
how the money is created

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.914
in this fractional
reserve lending system.

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:08.330
So this bank right
over here says,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.870
well I have to keep a
little bit of these reserves

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.940
in case that guy comes.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.557
The probability of
all my customers

00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:15.890
coming on the same day and
asking for all of their money

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.589
is low.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.880
I just have to keep a little
bit for whoever does come.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.760
And then the rest of
it I can lend out,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.060
even though I promised everyone
that all of their money

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.260
is available.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.440
And so they lend
it out to whoever

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.870
needs to borrow that money,
who looks like a decent risk.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.870
And those people might
not spend it immediately.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.729
And so they would
deposit it into a bank.

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.520
Or they might spend
that money immediately.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.350
They by a factor,
or they buy a car.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.670
They do something with it.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.124
And whoever they bought
that new thing from,

00:04:41.124 --> 00:04:42.790
those people now have
the money and they

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.530
will deposit it into a bank.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.690
And so this newly
lent money will then

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.350
end up in perhaps another bank.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.340
It could even be the same bank.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:58.004
So that will also end up
in a bank, right over here.

00:04:58.004 --> 00:04:59.670
And now this bank,
it can also only keep

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.190
a fraction of the reserves
and lend out the rest.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.090
And for simplicity, in
most banking systems,

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.610
they only have to keep
on the order of about 10%

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.310
of the reserves in house, and
the rest they could lend out.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.920
But over here.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.600
I'm keeping much
larger reserves just

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.637
for the sake of making it
easy to draw this diagram.

00:05:15.637 --> 00:05:17.220
So this bank right
over here, maybe it

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.690
decides to keep
this dollar bill,

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.020
and it could lend this
one right over here out.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.410
And once again, when it
lands that dollar bill,

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.704
it will end up
somehow-- the person

00:05:25.704 --> 00:05:27.870
they lend it to might keep
it in a bank temporarily.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.410
Or they might immediately
buy something.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.090
And when they buy something,
it will eventually

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.464
end up in a bank because the
person they bought something

00:05:33.464 --> 00:05:34.910
from will deposit that money.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.730
And so it could end
up in another bank.

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:42.300
And now this is interesting,
and in future videos

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.760
we'll go into more of the math
of exactly how much money is

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.520
being created.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.650
And it's an interesting
mathematical problem.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.540
Actually, it's a sum of an
infinite series, and all that.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.970
And you can look
that up if you're

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.290
interested in those ideas.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.570
But the basic idea here is even
though the central bank printed

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.020
three units of base money,
$3.00 right over here,

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.430
there's a lot more
money in the system.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.692
You have this guy, who made this
deposit, thinks he has $3.00.

00:06:08.692 --> 00:06:10.150
This person thinks
they have $2.00.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.020
This person thinks
they have one.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.930
So just in this example over
here, we have one, two, three,

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.240
four, five $6.00.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.864
So just right over here we
have $6.00 in this system.

00:06:23.864 --> 00:06:25.780
And you might say, well,
is this really money?

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.940
This is deposited.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.120
This guy thinks he has
it, but he's not using it.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.770
If he had to use it he
would have to withdraw it,

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.686
and then the bank wouldn't
be able to do this.

00:06:32.686 --> 00:06:35.200
And this is where checking
accounts are really important.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.150
I'm assuming that these were
on demand checking accounts.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.046
So this guy, the
reason why he's not

00:06:40.046 --> 00:06:41.920
going to withdraw this
money, is he can still

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.540
use it as money
by writing checks.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.680
So if this guy, let's say this
is all the money that he has,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.960
and he decides if he really
needs to buy an apple.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.970
And that Apple costs $1.00.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.900
So this is my drawing of
an apple right over here.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.540
He does not have to withdraw
this $1.00 out of the bank.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.810
He can write a check.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.090
So right now he has claims to
all three of these dollars.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.460
He can write a check to
the apple vendor, so $1.00.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.030
He writes a check, gives
it to the apple vendor,

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.200
and now he'll get the apple, so
this check is acting as money.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.610
And now the apple vendor
will have the rights to one

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.045
of these dollars
right over here.

00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:22.920
And now the apple vendor
could write a check.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.450
So this dollar never has to
leave the banking system.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.310
But because of checks
it is essentially

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.190
enabling-- this check writing--
is enabling these transactions

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.950
to occur.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.690
So it's still
enabling, either you

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.520
could view it as it's still
acting in some forms of money

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.170
because the rights
to it can change,

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.310
even though it's sitting out
in here and it's been lent.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.685
Or you could say that it's
enabling the writing of checks

00:07:42.685 --> 00:07:45.340
that are acting as
some form of money.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.190
And the whole reason
I want to do this,

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.648
I'm going through
this exercise, is

00:07:48.648 --> 00:07:50.874
to show you that the amount
of money in circulation

00:07:50.874 --> 00:07:52.290
isn't really in
the Central Banks,

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.590
or not directly in the
Central Bank's control.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.120
They can definitely decide,
hey I'm going to print money,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.029
buy securities, put
it into circulation.

00:07:59.029 --> 00:08:01.070
Or if they want to take
money out of circulation,

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.336
they can decide to
sell these securities.

00:08:03.336 --> 00:08:04.960
And then when they
sell the securities,

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.906
maybe this guy will
buy them, those dollars

00:08:06.906 --> 00:08:08.280
will go back to
the Central Bank.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.196
And maybe they could put
it out of commission.

00:08:10.196 --> 00:08:12.290
But you have this whole
effect right over here.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.080
If you have more
lending occurring,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.210
if the banks are feeling very
confident, then more of this

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.000
will happen.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.800
You will get more of this--
the multiplier effect

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.860
of this lending.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.770
And if less lending
is happening,

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.273
then you could potentially
see all of this contract.
