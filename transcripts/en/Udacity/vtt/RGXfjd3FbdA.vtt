00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.350
We've reached the end of lesson one, and we've covered a lot of concepts

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.110
that can be summarized into four main

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.800
points. Point one. Every human is a collection

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.930
of traits. Traits that can be described

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.320
as either physical or behavioral, visible or hidden,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.100
and learned or innate. Point two. Inheritance

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.265
patterns have been described in many different ways.

00:00:21.265 --> 00:00:21.800
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.600
Two important ways are blended versus particulate

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.010
inheritance. With particulate inheritance laying the foundation for

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.990
modern genetics, and our idea of the individual

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.310
unit called a gene. Point three. The Environment

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.970
can play a major role in the presentation of certain traits. And point four. The

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.680
hereditary material that's passed down from generation to

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.350
generation is made up of a chemical substance

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.740
called DNA which comprises what we call our genome.
