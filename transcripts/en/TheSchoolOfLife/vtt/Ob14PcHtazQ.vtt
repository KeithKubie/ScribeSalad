00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.360
Our present dating habits can feel like a
natural part of existence, but in reality,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.980
they’ve only been around for a very short
time and, we predict, won’t continue for

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.740
too much longer in their current form. Dating
has a history, which it pays to try to understand

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.430
as we navigate the ritual’s paradoxical
and often confusing priorities. Let’s take

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.440
a selective look backwards – as well as
a peak forwards – at the history and future

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:42.300
of dating: 27 March 1489, Medina del Campo,
Spain In a treatise signed between England

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.140
and Spain, the two-year-old Tudor prince Arthur
is formally engaged to Catherine of Aragon

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.430
– who is at that point three years old.
It’s an extreme example of what is an entirely

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.040
normal practice all over the world in the
pre-modern era: relationships are strategic

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.540
transactions between families, where the feelings
of the couple themselves are of no importance

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.160
whatsoever. The idea that you might love,
let alone be physically attracted to, the

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:21.080
person you end up with would be deemed profoundly
irresponsible, if not plain peculiar. July

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.870
1761, Amsterdam, Netherlands The publication
of Julie, a novel by the French Romantic philosopher

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.000
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, which becomes the fastest
selling book ever written. The novel tells

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.560
the story of Julie, a beautiful young woman
from an aristocratic family who is expected

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.470
to marry someone of her standing – but,
contrary to all the rules, falls in love with

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.790
her middle-class teacher, Saint-Preux. However,
they cannot get married because of the differences

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.130
in their social status. Rousseau is on the
side of the unhappy couple – and his novel

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.690
is the first major statement of the idea that
relationships should essentially be founded

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.780
on the feelings that exist between people,
and have nothing to do with class, lineage

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.410
or family concerns. But, as yet, Rousseau
and his novel see no way of upturning the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.730
social order: you still marry who your parents
and society tell you, but now at least, with

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:25.160
Rousseau’s help, you can feel very sorry
that you have to. March 1855, Rome, Italy

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.650
In the major Italian novel of the 19th century,
I Viceré, by Federico di Roberto, two characters,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.959
Lucrezia and Benedetto, are in love but can’t
marry because Lucrezia’s mother refuses

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.690
to give her permission on the grounds of social
propriety. Crucially, the mother is shown

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.720
to be old-fashioned and narrow-minded; couples
formed by ‘reason’ are, the novelist suggests,

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.940
a lot less happy than those guided by instinct.
The book works with the growing Romantic assumption

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.670
that relationships should be based on sentiment
and that the best chances of finding someone

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.550
we can get on well with over a lifetime is
not to find out what their job is or whether

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.120
they come from a good family, but whether
we experience an overwhelming physical and

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:17.550
emotional attraction in their presence. Marriage
must be a union consecrated by feeling. 1892,

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.120
London, England The most successful comic
play of the year – Charley’s Aunt – turns

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.400
on the fact that Charley has invited Kitty
to lunch on a date but, at the last minute,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.240
learns that his aunt won’t be able to join
them. This creates a panic because a dating

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.629
couple should have a chaperone, an older woman
whose presence will ensure that nothing very

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.440
intimate can be said or done. Charley’s
solution is to get a male friend to put on

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.629
a dress and impersonate his relative. The
comedic atmosphere of the play suggests that

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.550
the old rules around dating are firmly on
their way out and are accepted as having some

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.569
of the fustiness of a maiden aunt. The audience
is meant to agree that dating is for the best

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.970
when couples are left on their own to discover
how they feel; there should even be a kiss

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.840
at the end if things go swimmingly. 1914, Eastbourne,

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.579
England The young George Orwell gets into
trouble at school when he is caught reading

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.879
Youth’s Encounter by Compton Mackenzie:
the first novel published in England that

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:28.349
describes unsupervised adolescent dating.
We’re starting to move beyond the odd chaste

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:40.159
kiss: dating starts to be about sex as well.
June 23, 1960, Washington DC, USA The US Food

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:45.509
and Drug Administration approves the first
oral female contraceptive pill. The idea that

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:51.729
a date can happily and uncomplicatedly lead
to sex becomes not only an emotional but now

00:04:51.729 --> 00:05:02.719
also a practical possibility. Los Angeles,
1998 Speed dating is invented and the romantic

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:08.860
comedy You’ve Got Mail – the first major
film based around online dating – is released.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.400
Both encourage the idea that it’s important
to search very widely before selecting a possible

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.300
partner. By now all the elements of modern
dating are finally in place: firstly, parents

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.150
have nothing to do with it; secondly, all
considerations of money and social status

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.909
are deemed ‘un-Romantic’ and unimportant;
thirdly, you are meant to be swiftly emotionally

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:35.349
drawn to someone in order for a relationship
to be deemed legitimate and viable in the

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:40.389
long term; fourthly, sex is interpreted as
a central part of getting to know someone

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:45.479
– and lastly, you’re meant to have a lot
of dates (and possibly meet quite a few horrors

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:51.589
on the way) before finally and happily settling
down with that archetypal figure of the modern

00:05:51.589 --> 00:06:03.610
dating scene: The One. Brussels, March 2009
The European Union releases a report that

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.409
reveals that 50% of married couples in countries
across the union end up divorced after fifteen

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.530
years. Though entirely ignored by Europe’s
dating couples, the report quietly raises

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.240
the question of whether instinct is really
any better guide to a good conjugal life than

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.440
the old parental or societal rules used to
be – as well as hinting at how much more

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.899
miserable we can end up being when the sole
justification for relationships is understood

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.600
to be the intense emotional and sexual happiness
of the two participants.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:47.339
Singapore, May, 2075 Artificial Intelligence has finally
arrived, human nature has at last accurately

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.200
been understood – and dating as we know
it dies.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.820
Machines now swiftly find for us the optimal choice of
partner for a lifetime together. They know

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.940
who is available, what our quirks are, and
who out there can best compliment them. All

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:11.599
the rigmarole of dating in the Romantic era
is done away: we no longer have to wonder

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:16.569
whether we have found the ‘right’ person;
a machine that we trust as much as we now

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:19.608
trust doctors, tells us when we have located
our destiny. We no longer have to rely on

00:07:19.608 --> 00:07:20.608
chance or random encounters. We no longer
have to keep asking our friends and hoping

00:07:20.608 --> 00:07:21.608
to be introduced. We don’t have to listen
to our parents, we don’t have to take along

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:22.608
a maiden aunt, and nor do we have to listen
to those equally unreliable entities, our

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:24.960
subjective feelings. Couples are not always
deliriously happy, but they at least have

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.539
the satisfaction of knowing that they are
with the person they should, all things being

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:31.789
equal, be with.

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:38.110
Way back in 1489, there wasn’t any choice
for Prince Arthur and Catherine of Aragon;

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:44.559
now there is no choice either, but in 2075,
it is a psychological machine that has determined

00:07:44.559 --> 00:07:51.449
the choice for us. Occasionally, people get a little
nostalgic and curious about the old-fashioned,

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:56.610
rather haphazard and sometimes thrilling Romantic
way of dating. Some of them might dress up

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.870
and recreate the ritual, like people who nowadays
have fun on weekends trying out what it was

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:08.360
like to row in a long-boat or live in a wigwam…
All of which should give us a humbling sense

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.260
of how particular and complicated contemporary
dating truly is. We shouldn’t blame ourselves

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:23.840
if, at the end of yet another barren or ambiguous
date, we feel in need of a little guidance.
