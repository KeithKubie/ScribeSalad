[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.312 --> 00:00:06.770
STACEY KULONGOWSKI:
So I'm thrilled

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.450
to be here with you personally.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.790
I'm a mom of three girls,
as I told you earlier.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.940
I literally jumped at the
chance to preread this book

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.040
and to take the journey
on motherhood with you.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.978
I absolutely loved,
loved, loved the book,

00:00:17.978 --> 00:00:19.520
as I've told you
many times on email.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.470
But I absolutely love the book.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.930
And we have books for you
all here in Ann Arbor.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.390
So I invite you to take
them with you when you go.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.100
You'll absolutely love it all.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.620
Just to set a little
context for the book,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.119
it's a short story collection.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.030
There's 12 stories of
all different women

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.940
with all different points of
view of becoming a mother,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.210
or an early motherhood
experience, I would call it.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.693
So it's absolutely
a great journey.

00:00:43.693 --> 00:00:44.860
I loved how candid you were.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.440
I felt like you told so many
behind-the-scenes stories.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.242
I think as mothers, a lot
of times we get so afraid.

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:52.700
And there's a lot
of shame involved

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.160
in sharing some of
these stories of seasons

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.110
that are really hard.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.030
So as a result, we
don't share them.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.730
And then when our fellow mothers
walk through these seasons,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.670
they feel so isolated
and alone that they're

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.020
the only ones going through it.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.530
So I felt that you
empowered me as a reader

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.112
and as mothers everywhere
to celebrate these truths

00:01:13.112 --> 00:01:14.070
and share these truths.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.890
So I just wanted to thank
you for that to start with.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.350
I thought that was beautiful.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.890
I thought your writing was
very raw in some places

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.300
and very romantic,
which I loved.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.700
And I think the
most impressive--

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.295
because I read a ton.

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:28.670
One of the most
impressive things

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.630
that you do in these collections
is character development

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.490
in such a short amount of time.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.550
It's really unbelievable
how you do that.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.590
Polly takes us into the
middle of someone's story

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.630
and drops us as a reader
right in the middle.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.368
And yet you're so connected
to these characters.

00:01:44.368 --> 00:01:45.410
And you want them to win.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.618
And you want them to triumph.

00:01:46.618 --> 00:01:49.010
And you're in the
season with them.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.850
And you really want the
stories to end well.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.290
So I thought that that
was really remarkable.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.830
So a bit more on Polly
before we get too into it.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.530
Polly has published stories
in an extensive amount

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.290
of well-read publications
and magazines.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.270
She's a book reviewer.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.520
And many of her
reviews and her essays

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.789
have been published in "The
New York Times Book Review,"

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.370
as well as many
other publications.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.280
She's a teacher as well,
teacher of creative writing,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.510
from all levels from elementary
to college students as well.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.670
And now she is a
freelance writer

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.740
and a fiction editor for the
"Michigan Quarterly Review."

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.140
So she's a local
here in Ann Arbor.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.610
And she lives with her
husband Cody Walker,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.755
who is a poet and teaches
at U of M as well--

00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:35.630
so I don't know if anyone
knows Cody Walker--

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.600
and their two daughters as well.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.490
So pleased to have you.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.960
So before we begin our
chat, I heard a rumor

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.635
that you're going to read an
excerpt of the book for us.

00:02:44.635 --> 00:02:44.910
POLLY ROSENWAIKE: Yeah.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.410
Well, first I want
to say thank you,

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.190
Stacey, so much for all of
that and for reading the book.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.140
And thanks to you
guys for coming out.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.310
I love that people are eating
their lunch while you're

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.870
listening to me talk
about mothers and babies

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.340
and that kind of stuff.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.650
I really appreciate
your being here.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.020
So those of you
who have children

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.600
may be familiar with
the fact that it

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.570
can be really hard to get
children to go to sleep.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.860
And I wrote the story that I'm
going to read some of to you

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.730
today out of that frustration
of having a new baby

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.250
and trying to get the
baby to sleep in her crib,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.670
which seems like such a simple
thing, but actually was not.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.730
So this is the last
story in the book.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.220
It's called "Parental Fade."

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.580
And I'll read about the
first third of the story.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.400
"Parental Fade."

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.220
You can do it the
long and painful way

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.060
or the quick and painful
way, the pediatrician says.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.760
The quick and painful
way, otherwise known

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.000
as "crying it out," means
putting the baby in her crib

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.410
at bedtime, shutting the door,
leaving her there till morning.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.020
Whatever it takes to
ignore the cries--

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.180
blast the TV, have noisy sex,
take turns leaving the house--

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.430
this is what we must do.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.360
The long and painful way is
called a "parental fade."

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.580
Put the baby in her
crib and get comfortable

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.960
in the rocking chair.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.579
Don't pick the baby up.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.649
Try not to even touch her.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:22.410
Wait for her to settle
her own self down.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.360
Cry herself to sleep.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.720
Each night, move the rocker
farther away from the crib.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.660
Remain in the room for a
shorter amount of time.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.540
Crying it out takes
a few nights at most.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.150
Parental fade may
take several weeks.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.040
Either way works.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.740
It's up to you, the
pediatrician says.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.710
He is the gentlest, smilingest
man we have ever met.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.970
He sings our baby's name when
we bring her into his office.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.940
He keeps a musical
frog on the ceiling,

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.480
sets it swinging as he draws
the needle for her shots.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.420
Look at the frog,
he croons happily.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.200
We cringe.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.070
We fear the baby will
develop a phobia of frogs.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.940
We are exhausted, despairing,
mad at each other and at all

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.820
parenting manuals,
at all parents

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.890
whose babies don't
regard their cribs

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.800
as horrible cages of doom.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.460
Our insurance covers a
30-minute sleep consultation.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.270
It's coded as a necessary
medical intervention.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.130
Now our 30 minutes are up.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.340
The pediatrician offers a
final compassionate smile.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.200
Believe me, it works.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.490
You'll be surprised.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.810
You'll be relieved.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.900
You'll be OK.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.990
In the car on the way home,
we consider our options.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.880
Can we get a hotel
room for the weekend?

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.480
Pay the babysitter to do this
cry it out all night thing?

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.210
Can we commit to two
weeks of being stationed

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.500
in a rocking chair, pretending
to ignore our screaming child?

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.440
Can we accept that
a baby crying is

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.410
nothing more than a baby
crying, that this is

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.810
only the first of many battles?

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.230
And we must be strong.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.600
We must not yield.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.710
We must stay fixed on the
goal for the good of all.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.750
Our daughter in her
rear-facing car seat

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.570
gnaws on the legs
of a rubber giraffe.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.100
She is 10 months old, crawling,
pulling herself up to stand,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.560
pointing, clapping, shaking her
head no, saying "da" and "ma,"

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.800
not necessarily in
reference to us.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.560
She has two teeth on top and
one about to break through

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.580
on the bottom.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.090
She eats mashed sweet
potato and peas and banana

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.360
but not spinach or
apricots or squash.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.520
She has her father's
broad forehead

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.610
and rounded nose, her
mother's hazel eyes

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.100
and loosely curling brown hair.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.520
She will fall asleep in the
stroller and the car seat,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.220
in our bed and in our arms.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.080
When she's asleep
in our bed, she

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.610
sprawls out, hits and kicks us,
sends one of us to the couch.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.010
The other one sleeps
fitfully, afraid she

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.060
might suffocate or roll
off of the unattended side.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.780
If we sneak her into the
crib, she usually wakes up.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.190
If the sneaking
thing actually works,

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.300
we tiptoe around and
speak in hushed voices.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.400
Perversely, we miss her.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.930
We are in our 40s.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.180
We look it and feel it.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.510
This doesn't fit with our vision
of how the world should work.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.680
We should be 23 always,
uncertain of the future yet

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.320
convinced of the
promise it holds.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.860
Though we could potentially be
the parents of a 23-year-old,

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.290
we feel too young
for parenthood.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.490
"Mama" and "dada"?

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.980
How can these words apply to us?

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.100
We still have trouble
with "ma'am" and "sir."

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.570
No, we have to remind ourselves.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.790
This is how the world works.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.210
Our own parents and stepparents
are senior citizens,

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.440
retired, ailing, acquiring
new knees and hips,

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.480
losing their memories.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.330
All of our
grandparents are gone.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.140
Pictures of these people from
another time line our mantle.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.950
They are young there, dashing
in their military uniforms,

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.140
zaftig in their
bathing costumes,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.750
stern in their wedding attire.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.640
We would liked to
have known them then.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.070
But we were born too late.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.920
The '70s will be as
remote to our daughter

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.530
as the '30s are to us.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.580
So it's decided.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.310
Starting tonight, parental fade.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.200
An aging rock band, a
haircut for the going bald,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.600
a chronic illness,
the way of the world.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.000
We wish we could do
quick and painful,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.710
but let's be realistic.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.539
As soon as we put
the baby in her crib,

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.400
she'll stand up and scream.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.350
She'll either never
lie back down,

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.960
or she'll collapse
in a mangled heap.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.299
She'll cry so hard
she'll throw up and then

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:45.160
choke on her own vomit.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.830
We'll have to go in and check
on her, and all will be lost.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.440
Actually, we believe the
pediatrician is right.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.760
The baby would be fine.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.860
She'd work it out on her own.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.920
In the morning when we entered
her bedroom, guilt ridden

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.010
and spent, our daughter
would smile her smile

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.660
of delight, her oldest and best
trick, the smile she offers

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.330
to anyone who shows
her a bit of interest,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.510
but most of all to her parents,
who are most in need of it.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.790
She's a narcissistic insomniac,
preventing others from sleeping

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.140
if she cannot.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.850
A sentimental whore, refusing
to sleep alone in her own bed.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.190
The most grating
of alarm clocks--

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.520
no radio option,
no snooze button.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.410
But here are her trump cards.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.890
She smiles as if she
herself had discovered joy.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.170
And she never holds a grudge.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.610
We just can't do
quick and painful.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.060
Though we're not those kinds
of parents, the ones who

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.790
declare on their blogs that
letting your baby cry herself

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.550
to sleep leaves
psychological scars,

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.870
gives the kid lifelong feelings
of security and abandonment,

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.290
our objection is not on
philosophical grounds,

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.070
nor is it out of genuine fear
for the baby's well-being.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.490
We believe fundamentally--
we have to believe--

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.730
that the baby will
always be all right.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.480
No, we're softies,
weaklings, cowards.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.370
It's easier for us to
do things the hard way.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.370
I'm going to stop there.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.640
And I'll keep you in
suspense as to whether

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.932
these desperate parents ever--

00:10:17.932 --> 00:10:19.640
STACEY KULONGOWSKI:
Figure it out or not.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.848
POLLY ROSENWAIKE: Get this
parental fade thing going,

00:10:21.848 --> 00:10:22.348
yeah.

00:10:22.348 --> 00:10:23.515
STACEY KULONGOWSKI: So good.

00:10:23.515 --> 00:10:26.270
I think so many of us as parents
can really-- and side note,

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.400
I was like, can you pay
the babysitter to do this?

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.030
Is this actually a thing?

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.740
POLLY ROSENWAIKE:
I didn't try it.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.630
But I want to know, too.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.830
STACEY KULONGOWSKI: Let me know.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.330
Let's talk.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.930
Let's talk.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.017
Awesome.

00:10:34.017 --> 00:10:35.600
So thank you so much
for sharing that.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.670
I loved that
chapter in the book.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.270
So just to jump into
some of the questions,

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.000
there's so many motherhood
books out there, as you know,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.270
about the blessings and the
challenges of motherhood.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.190
And your approach was
so interesting to me

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.270
because it was all about
this season of prebirth

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.350
to very new newborns.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.630
How did you choose that that
was the piece of journey

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.380
that you wanted to
tell the stories about?

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.338
POLLY ROSENWAIKE: Yeah.

00:10:59.338 --> 00:11:01.940
Well, just to tell you a little
bit about my own background,

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:02.870
I have two daughters.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.580
They're eight and five now.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.420
So pretty much for
the past decade,

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.740
I have been in the season of
thinking about having a baby,

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.480
getting pregnant, having
a few miscarriages, which

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.870
is something I address in the
book, and then having a baby

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.550
and thinking, wow, I
have a baby all the time.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.430
How am I going to handle this?

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.290
And so it's a period that's
very much been on my mind

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.110
and in my life.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.080
And I don't know
if anybody knows.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.790
In Ann Arbor, there's
an organization

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.370
called the Center for
the Childbearing Year,

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.820
where you can take birthing
classes and breastfeeding

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.610
classes and learn how to
take care of your newborn.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.440
And so I kind of
thought of this book

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:48.980
as the book of the childbearing
years for these various women.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.140
And so just to give
you a little sense

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.330
of the kind of
chronology of the book,

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.260
it's all different characters.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.550
But it starts with a
couple who are having

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.770
a hard time conceiving,
want to have a baby

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.920
but are struggling with it.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:08.270
There is a story about a woman
who is not ready to be a mother

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.550
and has an abortion.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.370
There's a story about a
woman who has a miscarriage.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:18.170
There's stories about other
experiences of pregnancy.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.270
There isn't a story
actually about childbirth

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.400
because I found that
I could not actually

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.012
write about that experience.

00:12:24.012 --> 00:12:25.220
It was a little too physical.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.000
STACEY KULONGOWSKI:
Still too soon.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.290
POLLY ROSENWAIKE: Yes.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.560
I didn't feel I was fully
there when I was giving birth,

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.360
though I certainly was.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.450
So then there's a story about
postpartum depression, which

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:39.020
I struggled with, a
story about introducing

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.740
the new baby to extended
family, going all the way up

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.070
to that story that
I read part of.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:46.985
Baby is 10 months.

00:12:46.985 --> 00:12:48.860
You've almost made it
through the first year.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.510
And you're having
these challenges

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.790
in getting the baby to sleep.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:56.930
So I really wanted to
limit it to that time frame

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.900
and to zoom in on what's really
special and really amazing

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.200
about that time
frame, but also what's

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.567
really challenging in it.

00:13:06.567 --> 00:13:07.900
STACEY KULONGOWSKI: I love that.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.290
How did you know that we
needed to hear these stories?

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.165
And how did you know
that you were the person

00:13:12.165 --> 00:13:14.160
to bring them to us?

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.540
POLLY ROSENWAIKE: Yeah.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:20.460
Well, when I was experiencing
this time myself,

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.730
I had only been living in
Ann Arbor for about a year.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:27.970
We had moved for Cody,
my husband's, job.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.850
And so I didn't know
many people here.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.310
I knew a few other people
that had young children.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.120
But I spent a lot of time
on the phone with my friends

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.960
who had had babies and wheeling
the baby in our stroller

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.340
through the neighborhood
and talking to people.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.410
But I also spent a lot of
time alone with the baby.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.950
And I found that
really difficult.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.550
And I kept a lot to myself.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.950
And then when my
partner would come home,

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:56.910
I would burst into tears.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.826
Some of it would come
out anyway at that point.

00:13:59.826 --> 00:14:04.110
So I think the thing
about having a new baby is

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.060
that it's so wonderful.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.830
And everyone congratulates you.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.578
And it's like your
family is complete.

00:14:09.578 --> 00:14:11.370
And this thing that
you've wanted to happen

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.820
has finally happened.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.656
And so you kind feel like,
well, I can't really complain.

00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:20.460
I shouldn't be having
these negative feelings

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.800
about this thing that
I've wanted and now have.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.290
And it's a blessing,
and it's beautiful.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.657
So I really felt like when I
talked with other people that

00:14:28.657 --> 00:14:30.240
were experiencing
some of these things

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.450
that it was really
helpful for me.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.960
And I wanted to put
that out there myself.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.300
And for me, writing fiction
has always been a way.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.240
Even though I fictionalize
the characters

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.160
and I fictionalize
the situations,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.210
it's always been a way for me
to address complicated emotions

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:49.630
that I have myself.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:56.280
And so I didn't write
actually until my daughter

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.295
was about a year and a half.

00:14:58.295 --> 00:15:00.420
And then I found that I
could get back into fiction

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.910
and look back on
these experiences.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.710
And then I knew I was
thinking about having

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.560
another child, which scared me.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.050
But it was also like, OK, I
kind of forget this stuff.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.740
And I need to know
it for the book.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:12.240
OK.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:12.990
It'll be research.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.334
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:14.334 --> 00:15:15.318
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:15:15.318 --> 00:15:16.585
--and have another baby.

00:15:16.585 --> 00:15:18.210
And then I didn't
write right after she

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.760
was born either for a while.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.340
But fiction has always
been a way for me

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.720
to tap into my own
emotions and explore

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.120
the inner lives of people.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.680
STACEY KULONGOWSKI: Love that.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.450
Love that.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.680
How did you choose--

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.340
or why did you choose, rather--
to tell multiple stories

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.730
versus create one large novel?

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:41.750
POLLY ROSENWAIKE: Right.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.120
Well, so I started--

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.440
I had always wanted to be
one of those people that just

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.750
wanted to be a writer
since I was five years old

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.240
and knew what
being a writer was.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.360
But I didn't really seriously
start writing fiction

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.510
until I was in my mid-20s.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.180
And I started off
writing stories.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.980
The short form really
appealed to me.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:06.220
And I was kind of afraid of
writing a longer work, a novel.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:10.050
But I went to graduate
school for creative writing.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.570
An MFA degree is what
I got, a Master's

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.635
of Fine Arts in creative
writing and fiction.

00:16:15.635 --> 00:16:17.260
So I was in my early
30s at that point.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.140
And I entered into the
program thinking, OK,

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.640
now I'm going to get serious.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.310
I'm going to try
to write a novel.

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.470
Those of you who
read fiction probably

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.990
lean towards novels and
not story collections.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.500
So I thought, OK, I'm
going to attempt this.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.300
And in the first semester of
the program, I started a novel.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.270
And then you all here at Google
will shake your head at me,

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.050
but my computer died.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.220
And I did not have a
good backup system.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.880
And I lost the
beginning of my novel.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.470
But the thing was,
I didn't care.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.860
It was kind of
like, good riddance.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.120
That wasn't working.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.570
And so at that point, I
really kind of embraced it.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.030
You know, I want to keep
writing short stories.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:03.918
I love this short form where
you jump in for a little while

00:17:03.918 --> 00:17:04.710
with the character.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:05.869
And then you jump back out.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:09.520
And you can move on
to something else.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.339
So I really dug into
the short story form

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:17.670
and kept going with it.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.800
And the characters, as I said--

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.099
in some story collections
that are linked,

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:24.780
you might have
different characters

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.599
appear across the stories so
it feels a little bit more

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:28.740
like a novel.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.870
But for me, I just
wanted to keep

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.810
entering into these
different women's experiences

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:39.360
and to capture a range of
people and a range of things

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.630
that they were going through.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.462
And so this format really
worked for me in that way.

00:17:43.462 --> 00:17:45.420
STACEY KULONGOWSKI: That's
so interesting, too,

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.480
because my next question
absolutely related to this

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.380
is around parallels.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.005
Because I think that
was the piece that

00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:52.567
wove them all together for me.

00:17:52.567 --> 00:17:54.525
I was actually writing
them down at some point,

00:17:54.525 --> 00:17:56.370
like, oh, she's
associating this with this.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.460
And it was so interesting to
see how you wove these themes

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.450
and variations between all
of these different characters

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.103
throughout even one
story or many stories.

00:18:06.103 --> 00:18:08.020
So I thought that that
kept the reader feeling

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.728
like they were belonging
in the same type

00:18:09.728 --> 00:18:13.820
of a holistic book of work.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.260
So for me, even in the
story "Tanglewood,"

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.670
Sam instructs Elise.

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.360
He says, listen for themes
and variations of symphonies.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.510
And I was like, wow, this is
an absolute beautiful parallel

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.655
to your work, too.

00:18:26.655 --> 00:18:28.030
I thought that
was so interesting

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.155
how you wove that in there.

00:18:29.155 --> 00:18:31.240
So how did you think
about the interweaving

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.670
of themes and variations
across either one

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:34.845
story or all stories?

00:18:34.845 --> 00:18:36.970
What was your goal around
that when you wrote this?

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.050
POLLY ROSENWAIKE: Yeah.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.150
Well, a lot of story
collections don't

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:41.530
have an overarching theme.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.910
And they're just
sort of stories.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:44.410
And there are many
story collections

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.530
that I love that are like that.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.970
But for me, when I was
writing stories and thinking

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.570
about putting a book together,
I felt a little bit lost.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.460
So when I hit upon
this idea one day

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.140
while I was paying
for child care,

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.850
my daughter was a
year and a half.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.815
And I was over at
the Malletts Library.

00:18:59.815 --> 00:19:02.410
And I thought, why
don't I do this?

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.180
Why don't I create
this chronology

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.150
of stories that are
all thematically linked

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:14.320
through having a baby, but
each one is their own thing?

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.600
And so of course, the
overall theme of the book

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.790
is motherhood and
becoming a mother.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:22.450
But there are a lot
of other things, too.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.390
There are a lot of romantic
relationships in the book.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:30.760
There's one character who gets
pregnant from a one-night stand

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.930
with a guy from France.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:32.895
And he's off.

00:19:32.895 --> 00:19:34.690
And she's never going
to see him again.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.120
And he's never going to
know that he's the father.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.750
So they're very brief
romantic episodes.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.210
But then there are also
long-term, committed

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.940
relationships where people
are having a baby together.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.390
And how does that affect
their relationship

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:54.050
for the woman to be pregnant
and then to have a baby?

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:57.130
So I was really interested
in exploring that.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.260
I also was interested
in exploring

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.310
familial relationships
between mothers and daughters,

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:10.180
between sisters, between
extended families.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.480
And also friendships among
women is another theme

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.760
of the book-- and
relationships that women

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.280
have with each other,
which in some cases

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.690
can be really supportive.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.910
But then there are
also certain jealousies

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.550
that come up when someone
is trying to get pregnant

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:27.340
and someone close to
her gets pregnant.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:32.920
And so I wanted to think about
those relationships as well.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:38.020
So I think they're all
connected with the idea

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.480
of being intimate
with other people

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.360
and figuring out who
you are as you enter

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.380
into this period of
becoming a mother

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:53.050
and what kinds of conflicts come
up that impede that intimacy.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.298
But yeah, something different
happens in each story.

00:20:56.298 --> 00:20:58.090
And they're all about
different characters.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.257
STACEY KULONGOWSKI: So good.

00:20:59.257 --> 00:21:00.512
So good.

00:21:00.512 --> 00:21:02.220
How did you choose
the title of the book?

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.760
So I know it comes up in one
of the first stories, maybe

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.530
the first story or the second.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.303
How did you choose
that that was what you

00:21:07.303 --> 00:21:08.470
were going to name the book?

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.262
POLLY ROSENWAIKE: Well,
the title was hard.

00:21:10.262 --> 00:21:12.420
Titling is hard for me.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.170
Sometimes when I set
out to write a story,

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.420
I know what it will be called.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.630
But most of the time I don't.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.890
And I write the whole story.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.690
And then I think,
what in the world

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.090
am I going to call this thing?

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.150
And a lot of story collections--

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.280
you use a title of
one of the stories

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.960
to then title the collection.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.330
But looking over my
titles, I just thought,

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:36.310
there's nothing that really
captures the book as a whole.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.410
So for a while--

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:42.130
and I'll watch your expressions
when I tell you this.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:47.540
For a while my possible
title was "Baby Person."

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.370
OK.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.680
A few of you maybe like it.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.555
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:50.555 --> 00:21:52.930
STACEY KULONGOWSKI: Market
research right here at Google.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:53.888
POLLY ROSENWAIKE: Yeah.

00:21:53.888 --> 00:21:56.412
But I told a few
people the title.

00:21:56.412 --> 00:21:58.120
And they kind of gave
me this blank look.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.620
What do you mean "baby person"?

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:04.480
Like a person who's
kind of like a baby?

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.110
And what I meant
was that expression,

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.610
like you're a baby person.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:10.750
You love babies.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.700
You think they're
cute and adorable.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.890
Or you're not a
baby person, which

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.710
is what one of the characters
in here says at one point.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.750
I'm not really a baby
person, actually.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:22.540
And that's true for me.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.590
I love kids.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:26.530
But babies aren't
necessarily my thing.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:27.725
Then I had two of them.

00:22:27.725 --> 00:22:28.600
I also had a friend--

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.130
STACEY KULONGOWSKI: They
become kids, though.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.047
POLLY ROSENWAIKE: Yes.

00:22:31.047 --> 00:22:32.230
Mine are now eight and five.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.330
So I survived.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.220
But yeah, I had
one friend tell me

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.230
that "Baby Person"
made her think

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:43.090
of a man who had like really
tiny, little hands, kind

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.160
of like "Boss Baby."

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.900
And this was just all
not what I was going for.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.760
And then just to tell you
a little bit about how

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.120
books become books
if you don't know--

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.920
so I had this manuscript.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.430
And I looked for
a literary agent.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.190
And agents will
help you try to sell

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:06.050
your collection or your fiction,
your nonfiction, whatever

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.970
it is to publishers.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.340
And so I had this agent who
had agreed to work with me.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.100
But she said, we're
not sending this out

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.560
to publishers with this
title, "Baby Person."

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.100
That's just not going to fly.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.270
So I had to come up
with another title.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:24.510
And as you mentioned, Stacey,
the title appears in the book.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:27.140
And so I kept combing
through the book.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:31.160
There has to be something in
here that I can call this.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.130
So I'll just read you the
little section where it appears.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:37.330
And it's the first story.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.620
And in this story, the
narrator and her husband

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.050
are trying to get pregnant.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:43.790
And it's not working.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.452
And the narrator's
sister, Audrey,

00:23:46.452 --> 00:23:48.410
has thought that she
would never have children.

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.660
She wasn't interested
in having children.

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.270
But she becomes pregnant.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.450
But in the scene that I'm going
to read, it's before that.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:02.150
And she's at a Thanksgiving
gathering with her mother.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.520
We don't feel the
need for children,

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.950
Audrey told our mother
last Thanksgiving.

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.490
You have to need them, I think,
so much that you don't think

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.040
you can be happy without them.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.270
Mom shook her head, proud
and sad on its wrinkled neck.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.050
That's not how it works.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:21.590
You can't know the joy until.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.810
She swiped at a tear
that was about to fall

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.790
into the wild rice stuffing.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.620
You just can't know it.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:31.250
Look how happy I'm
making you, Audrey said.

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:35.060
So it comes up in
the book in that way.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.370
And when I hit upon it,
I really liked that--

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:39.050
what does it suggest?

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.570
Of course kids do make us happy.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.887
And they're such
a source of joy.

00:24:43.887 --> 00:24:45.470
But at the same time,
I think if we're

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.238
being really honest
about it, there

00:24:47.238 --> 00:24:49.280
are a lot of times that
they don't make us happy.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.740
And they drive us crazy,
both little kids and adults

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.900
with their relationships
with their parents.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.460
So I liked that the
title was ironic.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.620
And then it sort of
got at this complexity

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:08.000
of what the experience
of becoming a mother is.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.350
Yes, I finally got it.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:10.920
STACEY KULONGOWSKI:
That's so good.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:11.120
All right.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.440
Next we need your advice, OK?

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.200
So one of the tough challenges
that we have here as mothers--

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.860
all Googlers probably, but
mothers here at Google--

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.310
is finding the time and
energy to do it all.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.060
It can sometimes feel
like at work in home

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.060
that it's always ever
going-- and in a good way,

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.050
too, sometimes, and in a
good way very challenging.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:29.925
And I don't love the
notion of balance.

00:25:29.925 --> 00:25:32.550
I don't think that's a word that
we should all be striving for.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.705
I think it's a difficult
one to achieve.

00:25:34.705 --> 00:25:36.080
It doesn't set us
up for success.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.060
But I love this
notion of energy,

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.710
how we create our energy.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:42.470
So I would love your advice
to all of us here at Google.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.840
How do you optimize
your energy level

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.983
for motherhood and writing?

00:25:46.983 --> 00:25:47.900
POLLY ROSENWAIKE: Wow.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:52.410
Well, my house is a mess
because the domestic scene--

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.140
I just kind of let a
lot of that stuff go.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.913
And I'm pawing through my
laundry baskets that are

00:25:57.913 --> 00:25:59.080
in my bedroom every morning.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.800
I'm like, I never have time
to put these clothes away.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.650
So I think I've really chosen
to make work a priority.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:11.100
And it's been different
for me because I've always

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.990
juggled part-time jobs.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.280
And I work from home.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.600
And I do freelance.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.030
And the writing I
pretty much never got

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:21.520
paid for until I finally got
paid something for this book.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.290
So I often also feel like
I have to kind of justify

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:30.090
working and make the space
to work because I could be--

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:30.732
I'm home.

00:26:30.732 --> 00:26:32.190
I could be taking
care of the kids.

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:35.530
And I could be doing the
dishes and all of that stuff.

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:39.540
So I feel like I've really
had to decide for myself.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.070
I love working.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:46.200
And I have to prioritize
and let other things go.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:53.430
And I honestly think, too, that
quality time over the quantity

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.280
of time is really important.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.060
So my kids have been going
to full-time childcare

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.520
since they were quite young.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.920
Sometimes we pay for
babysitters on the weekends.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.180
And I'm off to the
library getting work done.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.580
But then when I am
with them, I feel

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.760
like I enjoy them so much
more than if I were trying

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.490
to juggle everything together.

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:22.860
And I also think that it's
important for my kids--

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.690
my daughters
especially-- to know

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.987
that my work is important
to me and that I value it

00:27:27.987 --> 00:27:29.820
and that I love it and
that I've chosen work

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:33.540
that I really care about.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:39.690
And I think it makes me a better
mother to be able to just stake

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:44.400
out that work prioritizing
along with the kids.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.730
But I loved this conversation.

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:49.230
And I'd love to hear
from you guys how

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.397
you guys manage it all, too.

00:27:50.397 --> 00:27:52.813
STACEY KULONGOWSKI: Any tips
from the audience afterwards?

00:27:52.813 --> 00:27:54.410
Catch Polly afterwards, too.

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:57.070
Yeah, I see some
nodding of heads.

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:57.570
Great.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.350
So I think we'll do
one more question.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.710
And then we'll move
on to Q&amp;A here locally

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:04.360
but will end the video portion.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.340
So if you left us readers and
mothers with one key takeaway

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.110
from the book, or if
there's anything else

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:14.250
that you want to say to this
community, what would that be?

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:16.620
POLLY ROSENWAIKE: I
think the key takeaway

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:22.860
for me is that becoming a
mother, becoming a parent--

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:27.990
it's such a rich and
fascinating experience.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:31.410
And once you are one, you're
always going to be one.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:35.170
You're a mother all the time.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:37.110
But I think there are
so many challenges

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.510
involved in it as well.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.940
And I think that being
honest with ourselves,

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.610
open and honest with other
people, with other women--

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:47.220
I mean, as you said
at the beginning--

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.430
so that women who
feel kind of alone

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.770
in their difficult experiences
don't feel so alone.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:55.620
And I think it's
also important for--

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.560
especially our male partners--
to realize, especially

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.770
in that period of being pregnant
and giving birth and going

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:05.250
through so much hormonal
and physical stuff,

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:07.795
that this is difficult.

00:29:07.795 --> 00:29:09.420
And I also think it's
important, again,

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:14.490
for our kids to know that
we are their mothers.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.453
But we are also full
people in the world.

00:29:18.453 --> 00:29:20.370
I know I always felt
that about my own mother.

00:29:24.245 --> 00:29:26.370
STACEY KULONGOWSKI: Well,
thank you so much, Polly.

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:27.412
Thank you for being here.

00:29:27.412 --> 00:29:29.760

that the book launches today.

00:29:33.795 --> 00:29:35.420
So thank you so much
for being with us.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:36.587
