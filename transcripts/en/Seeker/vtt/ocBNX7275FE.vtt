For as long as I can remember, I've had a
pet. It's no wonder I'm such a social butterfly.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.399

Hi guys, I'm Catie Wayne filling in for Laci
Green on DNews. Come back Laci, I miss you.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.430
According to a new study, young adults with
loving relationships with their pets have

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.650
stronger social relationships as well as a
healthy connection with their communities.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.930
Over 500 participants aged 18-26 were surveyed
about their relationships with animals. Their

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.640
responses were recorded against answers they
gave to questions regarding the progress of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.770
their positive youth development characteristics.
These include competence, caring, confidence,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.680
connection, and character (alliteration for
the win). They were also surveyed about feelings

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.440
of depression.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.890
They found that those who cared for animals
also engaged in "contribution" activities

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.970
like community service, demonstrating leadership,
and helping friends and family, much more

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.800
so than those who gave zero cares about an
animal. The more they cared about their pet,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.400
the higher the contribution scores.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.260
However, it is important to know that just
because one owns an animal does not mean one

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.150
is going to be more socially savvy. It takes
the loves and cares.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.040
Developmental Psychologist and research assistant
professor at the Cummings School of Veterinary

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.130
Medicine at Tufts University (that's a wordy
title) Megan Mueller said that the "findings

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.000
suggest that it may not be whether an animal
is present in an individual's life that is

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.330
most significant but rather the quality of
the relationship." "The young adults in the

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.670
study who had strong attachment to pets reported
feeling more connected to their communities

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.530
and relationships."

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.520
While this is interesting, it kind of makes
sense. When you are able to develop an emotional

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.330
bond and attachment to an animal, it seems
a little obvious that your ability to empathize

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.890
and connect with other PEOPLE would correlate
positively.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.930
But, more research must be done. Mueller said,
while "we can't draw causal links with this

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.970
study" "it is a promising starting point to
better understanding the role of animals in

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.659
our lives, especially when we are young."

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.689
I personally didn't need another reason to
love my pets, but now I can be all scientific

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.320
and schtuff and be like "yeah, i love my pets,
and the more i love my pets the more i contribute

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.229
to society in a positive way so get off my
back i love animals okay?"

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.049
Tell me about your first pet in the comments
below! I want to know all of the things: what

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.939
kind of animal was it? Name? How old were
you? etc. Be sure to like this video and subscribe
