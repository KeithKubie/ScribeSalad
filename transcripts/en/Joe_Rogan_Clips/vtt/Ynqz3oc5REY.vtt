00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.990
The Joe Rogan experience.
It's that,

2
00:00:02.991 --> 00:00:05.070
that's the problem is that I feel like with the,
with the tasks,

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.020
I have a model x now,
so I had the SUV now and fix the ultimate flex.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.010
Tiffany Haddish had one and she had it in the parking lot at the comedy store

5
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:16.360
and she had it dancing,
really filming it,

6
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.500
kind of go up and down and stuff to the music and she's out in front of the car.

7
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.130
Dad said it hurt and I answered it.
Everybody's dancing and they're filming it.

8
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:27.030
It was a hilarious moment.
And it's funny cause I,
I found myself,

9
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:29.320
I feel like this car is ruined me as a person,
right?

10
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.550
Like I'm a typically like pretty humble person,
but like having like a Tesla,

11
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.750
the fact that you could push a button and the car comes to you is like the

12
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:39.960
biggest,
like it's a douchebag move.
Because honestly we were doing,

13
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.440
we were like getting into our cars,
like peasants for years,
you know.

14
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.820
And one day I was at the gym and I was looking at my car from,
you know,
from,
uh,

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.560
you know,
from a distance.
And I was like,
you know what,

16
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.220
I really don't feel like walking all the way to my car today.

17
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.040
How far it was probably like the distance from you to me.

18
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:57.000
It wasn't even that far.
I was like,

19
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.610
I was like a glass in between us and I was like,
you know what?
Come to Daddy,

20
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.520
come to Daddy.
It pushed the button.
The car is backed out.
Everyone's like,
Whoa,

21
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.190
that car's driving itself.
I was like,
yeah,
that's me.
Push the button,

22
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:07.800
open the door,
got in.
I just drove off.
Yeah.

23
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:11.370
When I take it and I put it in auto-drive,
that's when it really freaks me out.

24
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.840
Yeah.
Do you use that often?
Doesn't scare me.
Fun.
Yeah.
It scares me.
It scares me,

25
00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:19.380
but I keep my hands right there.
But it is freaky has tried to kill you yet?
No.

26
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.540
Okay,
let's do this.
It's coming.
Really?
No,
I'm just joking.
Just joking.
No,

27
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:26.160
it's like I always keep my hand there.
I always keep my hand there,
but um,

28
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.233
I'm always,
um,

29
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.440
well one thing I'm concerned with is that I think I'm lowering my guard.
Yes,

30
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.130
absolutely.
I'm letting the car,
I'll do too much.
When you drive.

31
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:37.890
Like one of the reasons for road rage is when we're driving around,

32
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.760
we don't know who the fuck's next to us and we're going very fast and requires

33
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:43.200
like the ability to think really quickly.

34
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:46.680
So your brain is in a heightened state of awareness and then someone does

35
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:51.120
something stupid like this fucker you pissed off.
Yeah.
Rage man.
Exactly.

36
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.950
Absolutely.
For the rage comes from.
Um,
but it,
it lightens that almost.

37
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.150
Maybe too much.
Cause I think you do need to be,
well Geez,
it's cut into my lane.

38
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.501
Right.

39
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:04.260
I think you do need to be at least aware that some shit could happen at any

40
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:07.080
moment when cars are flying by you going 70 [inaudible] so you don't take your

41
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:09.390
hands fully off.
You just let the car drive itself.
Really?
Yeah.

42
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.570
I just put my hand on it.
I don't take my hands fully off.
But if you do,

43
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.240
you can only do it for so long.
It'll start to warn that's a complaint.
Like,
Hey,

44
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:17.730
what's going on here buddy?
But apparently some dudes tried,

45
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.010
they say that didn't work.
I talked to one of those dudes who did that,

46
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.730
that experiment.
Apparently that experiment didn't or whatever.
Yeah,
the orange.

47
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.700
Yeah.
These are that orange.
I think I might work,
man.

48
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.080
I think what does work better is like they said all like a lightweight,

49
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.880
like if you take like a,

50
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.560
like a lightweight and put it on like a rubber band and you hang in,
there was,

51
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.100
you know what's funny,

52
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.680
there was a guy that was selling that you hear about that he was selling like it

53
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:43.470
looked like a,
uh,
it was like basically go wait.

54
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:46.470
That went around the steering wheel and it actually,
uh,

55
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.770
had the perfect amount of weight balance and make you think that your hand was

56
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:53.880
still on the wheel.
People were buying it.
There it is.
And Tessa autoplay buddy.

57
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:58.350
Hi Buddy.
Yes.
Mag relaunches as a phone mount.
Yeah.
So then so,

58
00:02:58.351 --> 00:02:59.710
so amounts we that right.

59
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:04.330
He was selling it and it was like 300 bucks and then,
you know,

60
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.370
they were like,
that's illegal.
You can't do that.

61
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.740
You're bypassing like a safety device of the car.

62
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.050
So then what he did was he came back again with a vengeance.

63
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:14.680
It made it a phone mount.
He's clever.
He's clever.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a smart move.

64
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.800
Although I'm not sure I support it.
I don't think I do either.
That's kind of,

65
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.610
that's a little bit much.
I don't think it's ready for that.
Weirds me out.

66
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.250
It weirds me out because the other thing is the other people are,

67
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.460
are not going with auto drive.
So you around,

68
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:30.520
you're going auto drive and all these other people are just driving.
Yeah.

69
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.110
And I think when everyone's driving together,

70
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:34.810
you kind of in tune with each other.
All this hassle is trying to go really fast.

71
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:37.230
Yeah.
Right.
Get the fuck on overtake this guy.
Right?
Yeah.

72
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.370
Let me pass this gate you were aware of when you're just,

73
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.380
when you're auto-driving it's like you're like,
uh,
like,
uh,
assist,

74
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.340
right in this moving.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ecosystem thinking.
Right.

75
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.590
All these people be calculating each other,

76
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.440
but it's probably ultimately like if you talk,
talk to Ilan,

77
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.690
he says it's way safer and then it's the future.

78
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.920
I hundred percent agree with them.
Absolutely.
Obviously hates fun.
Yeah.

79
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.400
Cause what would you do that.
