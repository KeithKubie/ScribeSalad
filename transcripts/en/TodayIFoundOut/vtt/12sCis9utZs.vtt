00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:19.770
Why Does Rudolph have a Red Nose?

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.080
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer was created
by the department store chain Montgomery Ward

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.090
as a way to save money on one of their annual
Christmas promotions.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.780
The year was 1939; Montgomery Ward, at that
time, gave away coloring books to try to get

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.000
more shoppers into their stores during the
holiday season.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.109
Up to this point, they simply bought these
coloring books to give away.

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:46.079
In 1939, in order to save on the price of
the books, they decided to try to make their

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.079
own.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.780
Enter Robert L. May who was a copywriter for
Montgomery Ward in Chicago and was apparently

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.909
known by his peers to be good at writing limericks
and children’s stories.

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.089
Because of this, he was chosen to write a
Christmas story to be used for this promotional

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.100
coloring book.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.580
May was very small as a child and was often
picked on, so decided to make it an Ugly Duckling

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.530
type tale, which he wrote in the same verse
as Twas the Night Before Christmas.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.580
While he was writing, he tested various versions
of the story out on his four year old daughter,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.970
Barbara, until he and she were both happy
with the results, at which point he presented

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.200
it to his boss.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.390
May’s boss did not like it at first, due
to the fact that he felt a red nose implied

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.340
the reindeer had been drinking.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.850
However, once it was partially illustrated
by Denver Gillen, who worked in Montgomery

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.690
Ward’s art department and was a friend of
Mays, his boss decided to approve the story.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.540
In the first year after its creation, around
2.4 million copies of Rudolph the Red-Nosed

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.470
Reindeer were given away.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.620
By 1946, over six million copies of the story
had been distributed by Montgomery Ward, which

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.690
was particularly impressive considering it
wasn’t printed through most of WWII.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.880
After the war, demand for the story skyrocketed,
receiving its biggest boost when May’s brother

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.000
in law, radio producer Johnny Marks, created
a modified musical version of the story.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.230
The first version of this song was sung by
Harry Brannon in 1948, but was made nationally

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.380
popular by Gene Autry’s 1949 version, selling
2.5 million copies of that version in 1949

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.510
alone and has sold to date around 25 million
copies.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.810
Despite the fact that May created the story
of Rudolph and it was wildly popular, he did

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.590
not at first receive any royalties from it
because he had created it as an assignment

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.690
for Montgomery Ward; thus, they held the copyright,
not him.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.040
In a rare move for a business, in 1947, Montgomery
Ward decided to give the copyright to May

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.760
with no strings attached.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.990
At the time, May was deeply in debt due to
medical bills from his wife’s terminal illness.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.569
Once the copyright was his, May quickly was
able to pay off his debts and within a few

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.910
years was able to quit working at Montgomery
Ward, though just under a decade later he

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:28.459
did go back and work for them again until
retiring 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.069
in 1971.
