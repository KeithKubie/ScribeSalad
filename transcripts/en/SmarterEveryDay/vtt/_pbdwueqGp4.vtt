00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.040
Helicopters have a speed limit 
that has nothing to do with laws.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.620
Well, unless you count the laws of physics.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.390
Hey it's me Destin.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.570
Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. 
The show where we do science. So today

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.750
I'm gonna explain to you something pretty interesting about the dissymmetry of rotor flight.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.770
But before we get too serious, let's just have a little fun.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.910
Check this out. Nighttime flying with Carl.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.090
( rotor noise )
Sick!

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.260
( rotor noise )

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:57.830
   

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.020
( excited shouts )

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.200
( laughing )

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.270
Right there.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.450
'kay we're going to do some light painting with a helicopter at night.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.620
( rotor noise )

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.000
( music )

00:01:31.020 --> 00:02:00.050
      

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.230
( music )

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:41.460
        

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.560
Did you see that? 
Look real close. Go back to the image.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.640
If you look on one side you see this really tight radius of curvature.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.820
But on the other side you see a much larger radius 
of curvature. What's going on there?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.990
OK so to explain the effects of this 
unsymmetric travel of the blades

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.180
I've rigged one up on a stick here, 
and I'm gonna try, let's see if this works.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.360
There we go. 
So as the advancing blade comes around,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.540
it's moving faster relative to the air because 
the helicopter's moving so you

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.710
add those two values together, 
but the retreating blade, you subtract

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.890
away the velocity of the blade from the forward 
air speed and that's the total relative

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.920
velocity of the blade through the air. 
This causes some funny things.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.950
OK Let's start the blades and check things out. 
As the chopper flies forward, the air

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.120
flows over both sides of the helicopter. 
The advancing blade is also

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.310
travelling forward so this adds to the air velocity 
of the rotor on that side.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.500
Now as long as the air speed of the rotor stays 
under the sound barrier you're OK.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.670
But if the helicopter goes too fast you'll 
create shock waves and start

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.760
to damage things. The retreating blade sees 
the same airflow of the vehicle movement

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.890
but because the blade is travelling in the opposite 
direction from that movement the

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.030
actual air speed of that rotor is less. 
This creates something called

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.220
Dissymmetry of Lift, and to counterract this 
the rotor on the retreating

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.400
side is given more pitch to produce 
more lift. This works up

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.440
to a point, but if the helicopter goes too fast, 
the pitch becomes too great and

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.570
you lose lift creating what's called a retreating blade stall.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.730
The cool thing about a retreating blade stall is that it is 
a self correcting problem. If you think

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.920
about it due to gyroscopic procession, if you have 
a dissymmetry of lift between a left

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.100
and right side of the helicopter, it won't roll the helicopter 
like you think it would, it

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.280
actually pitches it. That's good news because as you're 
flying along if you get too fast

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.460
and you get a retreating blade stall, it'll just slow 
the helicopter down, automatically.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.640
OK There's a lot of things I did not cover in this video series, but for the most part you should be

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.680
way smarter than when we started on helicopters. 
Smart enough in fact where you can make an educated

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.790
guess as to which of these three helicopters 
is the fastest in the US Army inventory.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.920
While you're thinking about that please consider going to the Facebook page. I put all the photos from the

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.090
night flights on there. Go download them, use them as your 
desktop background, stuff like that. While you're there

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.260
please Like the Facebook page. Also if you have ideas for future Smarter Every Day episodes

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.450
please Tweet me, I'd appreciate that, at SmarterYoutube.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.490
It's been about a year since we started Smarter Every Day. If you have ideas for a one year episode I'm all ears.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.530
OK. Enough babbling. The answer is the Chinook. 
It is the fastest in the US Army

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.590
inventory. I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day.
Have a good one.
