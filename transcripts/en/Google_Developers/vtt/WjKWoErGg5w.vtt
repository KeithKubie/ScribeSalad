JAMES NORRIS: My
name's James Norris,

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.750
and I'm the founder
and CEO of DeadSocial.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.310
DeadSocial is the
end-of-life planning tool.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.230
This enables us to say goodbye
to our friends and family,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.820
both on and offline.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.990
Today I'm going to show
you the six-step process

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.230
that I follow to ensure that
my business and brand utilizes

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.450
pop-up spaces and event spaces
to the best of our ability.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.470
So the first step,
you really have

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.000
got to look at
deciding when, where,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.379
and how you're going to run
your event or pop-up shop.

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.920
So the first thing
you may want to do

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.640
is try to justify
the amount of time

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.020
and spend that you're
going to dedicate

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.750
on a specific project-- so if
you're running an exhibition

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.770
space, the cost of the
stand, the amount of resource

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.910
that you're going to need to
allocate, et cetera, et cetera.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.530
By running our
pop-up shop, we have

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.620
managed to forge a
number of very, very

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.270
strong relationships,
both within the profit

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.330
and the not-for-profit sector.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.040
This has led to
business being attained.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.250
And it has also led to
an increased awareness

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.720
of our brand within the sector.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.740
We launched DeadSocial last
year at South by Southwest,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.780
and we wanted to create
as much noise as possible.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.420
South by Southwest is the
biggest tech conference

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.280
in the world, so we had to
create a strong narrative that

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.110
engaged with both the general
public and the tech community

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.910
at large.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.360
We decided to hire a small venue
called The Museum of the Weird

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.430
to help evoke discussion and
thought prior to the event.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.410
We sold our launch
party out by tenfold,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.060
and the event had a
strong creative narrative

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.770
running through it.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.480
At each event, we try to drive
a story or a different narrative

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.010
to help to ensure
that it's fresh

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.820
and to help ensure
that it engages

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.840
with the general public.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.520
During Dying Matters
Awareness Week,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.610
we created, for example,
a live infographic.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.110
The way the live
infographic worked

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.100
was we took a near
real-time data

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.770
feed from the
digital death survey,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.500
and during the
course of the week as

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.850
and when the data was
populated, we populated

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.750
and we updated the physical
installation in space

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.000
to help reflect the data
that was being generated.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.460
Both South by Southwest and the
pop-up shop that we carried out

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.320
for Dying Matters Awareness
Week were very different.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.410
In terms of their
narrative, they

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.500
both took a very,
very different path.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.170
However, they both helped
reflect the brand image

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.700
and helped to evoke
discussion around our business

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.700
and our core ethos.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.720
At the Ideal Death Show, we
had a small exhibition stand.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.270
So it's very, very different
to the pop-up space.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.500
But again, we wanted
to create a narrative

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.910
and tell a story around
technology and around death.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.790
We decided to use a DSLR
camera and very simply just

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.900
to increase the shutter speed.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.410
By doing so, we emulated
the Victorian photos

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.780
and the Victorian
ghost images that

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.350
are very intertwined with
Victorian mythology and to try

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.290
and highlight that relationship
between both technology

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.000
and death.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.470
Step 6-- Reviewing and
Gauging Success Metrics.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.530
There are a number
of ways in which you

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.050
can analyze and review your own
success at an event or whilst

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.190
carrying out a pop-up shop.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.650
These range from a quantitative
statistical-based analysis

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.630
based on your Google analytics,
the amount of shares,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.730
the amount of tweets,
et cetera, all the way

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.580
through to that
general gut feeling

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.680
or the value that you place on a
partnership that's been forged.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.940
I have followed the
six steps to help

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.779
ensure that my brand creates as
much noise as possible whilst

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.139
at events and
running pop-up shops.
