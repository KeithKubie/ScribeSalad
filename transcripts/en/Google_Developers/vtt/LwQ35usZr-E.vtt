[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.383
ALICE BARTLETT: I'm Alice.

00:00:01.383 --> 00:00:03.530
I'm a principal engineer
at the "Financial Times."

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.100
I also founded Tampon Club.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.930
And this is "How I Code."

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.710
So I code in the
FT building, which

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.340
is this big, brown office,
a massive cube on the River

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.280
Thames.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.650
The office is full of mice.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.530
They're fine, but they
will eat your cereal.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.240
My desk is a horrible mess.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.860
It's got paper all
over it, and then

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.360
Post-it notes of
things that I think

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.310
are really important
stuck to the monitor.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.890
I sit with my team,
who I really like.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.800
And we've got these
origami cranes everywhere

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.214
because the team is
called the Origami Team.

00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:41.890
One of the things that I
think is really important

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.860
is writing good commit messages.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.230
As developers, and
particularly working front end,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.780
often you add weird code to make
things work in older browsers.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.340
And having a decent
commit message

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.840
that explains what the change
was, but more importantly, why

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.520
you made it will really help
you and future developers

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.400
from removing that coding and
then breaking functionality

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.490
in older browsers.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.090
OK.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.540
