00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540
The Fibonacci numbers again start:

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.000
1, 1, 2, 3, 5

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.200
and the rule is: if each number here

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.660
equals the one before it

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.400
So, if this was the nth number

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.080
and we're gonna call that x n

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.180
for the nth number

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.060
it equals the one before it

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.360
plus the one before that

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.440
so that equals

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.100
x n minus one

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.400
plus x n minus two

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.320
So that's our finding thing

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.820
and what we're trying to find

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.140
ultimately

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.800
is what is the ratio between the two of the numbers

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.180
and importantly, because

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.880
we're looking for the ratio

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.560
it is approaching the limit

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.180
it doesn't matter which two terms

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.320
it should be the same ratio, give or take

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.820
and

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.400
if you do infinitely many the same ratio for all of them

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.480
but,  rrrrhhhhh

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.660
So. Uh. For any two of the terms

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.900
so what we can say now

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.620
is the ratio between

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.320
x to the n and the one before that

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.260
which was x to the n minus one. The one before.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.500
should equal the same as the ratio

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.580
between x n minus one to the one before that

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.940
which is x n minus two

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.060
and we're gonna call it

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.220
What letter would you like Brady?

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.140
awa aya a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.080
any any Greek letter?

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.260
Do you have a favorite?

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.520
Brady: uhhh....

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.700
delta?

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.740
Guy: DELTA!

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.900
ok, so lets

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.880
do a capital delta

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.820
because its quicker to draw

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.460
so we're trying [to come up] with this ratio, delta is.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.680
and we know its the ratio between any two

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.440
consecutive terms

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.600
now we know

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.520
according to our relationship which generates this sequence

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.480
that x n equals the two before it

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.120
added together

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.840
so I'm gonna put that in

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.640
intstead of

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.980
so all I've done is substitute that in

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.300
but now I could start simplifying

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.880
because I've got the same term

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.400
there twice

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.160
so, in fact, if I divide through

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.780
that's one plus

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.500
x to the n minus two

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.580
over x to the n minus one

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.440
which still equals

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.740
x to the n minus one over

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.820
x to the n minus two

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.180
which still equal to the ratio

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.120
delta we're looking for

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.740
so now you'll go

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.940
hang on a second

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.880
that is the same as this but upside down

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.320
and in fact that equals that ratio delta

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.980
so I can now change this to be

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.100
one  plus

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.820
well that's the inverse of this ratio

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.400
so that's one over delta

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.360
equals and that there is the delta

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.560
and so the relationship

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.540
for the ratio of any sequence

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.540
where you get the next term

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.920
from adding the two previous ones

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.320
one plus the inverse of that ratio

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.560
equals the ratio

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.720
Now what ratio could that possibly be?

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.340
well let's work it out!

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.600
because we can turn this

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.760
into a

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.140
quadratic?

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.580
If I multiply through by triangle

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.540
it equals that plus one

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.700
equals triangle squared

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.960
and so delta squared minus delta

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.400
minus one equals zero

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.260
So, all I've done is rearrange that formula

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.440
now we can solve this using our friend the quadratic equation

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.500
cuz we know

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.700
that if you have a

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.280
times x squared plus

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.080
b x plus c

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.060
equals zero

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.180
then x equals negative b

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.100
plus or minus

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.660
the square root of b squared minus four a c

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.180
over two a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.940
so we can substitute in to use the quadratic formula

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.380
So we now know delta equals

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.680
negative b, which is the coefficient there

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.980
which will be one

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.480
plus or minus the square root of b squared --is going to be one

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.560
minus four times one, times negative one, so it's going to be

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.980
plus four. Two times one is two. So that's going to equal...

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.020
Now I'm only going to use the positive for now.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.560
One plus root 5 divided by two, which is the golden ratio.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.920
If you actually work that out, that's where 1.6180... comes from.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.400
And in fact, that is one of the definitions of the golden ratio

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.420
And so that's why, for any starting term, it always approaches the same sequence

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.060
If you use the negative, you get the negative inverse of the golden ratio; another wonderful property of it.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.220
It I'd use the negative... If I'd used equals one minus root five over two

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.600
and that equals -0.6180...

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.360
So they're the two solutions to that [particular] equation

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.600
So, that's why it works of any sequence where you add two terms to get the next one

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.000
Brady: So the fact... The Fibonacci numbers meant nothing there?

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.300
Guy: The Fibonacci numbers are one of [an] infinite family of such numbers

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.680
because for any two whole numbers you want to start with, the exact same thing works out

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.860
In fact, why use whole numbers? Go bananas! At no point did I specify whole numbers here.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.800
It's just, whatever you start with, add two terms, you get the next one. You always get the golden ratio

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.880
That's not some special property Fibonacci numbers have.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.360
All of them have got that property. We want a better link.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.960
What we really want is a sequence of numbers which have a link the the golden ratio

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.760
that other sequences don't get. We want something above this.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.420
Brady: The Brady numbers!

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.580
Guy: Well, the Brady numbers are wonderful, but I can go slightly better

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.020
So, I'm going to show you the Lucas numbers.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.220
I, personally, am a massive golden ratio septic. I think it's hugely overrated...
