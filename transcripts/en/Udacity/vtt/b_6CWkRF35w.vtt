00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.264
Now that you have a good grasp of the strength and direction of linear

00:00:03.264 --> 00:00:08.138
relationships, we need a way to quantify these characteristics. The number that

00:00:08.138 --> 00:00:12.423
quantifies the relationship is called the correlation coefficient, denoted by

00:00:12.423 --> 00:00:18.402
r. You have seen r before when we did t-tests. This is also known as Pearson's

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:23.490
r, named after a statistician as usual. We will describe the formula so that

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.730
you know what it is, and we'll focus on interpreting r. r is a fraction just

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.890
like many of our other statistics. The numerator is the covariance of x and y.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.984
This is a function. This does not mean Cov or some number times x, y. This is

00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:47.144
the covariance of x and y which is in itself a statistic for how much x and y

00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:54.846
co vary, in other words how much they vary together. In the demoninator is the

00:00:54.846 --> 00:01:00.064
standard deviation of x times the standard deviation of y. And this describes

00:01:00.064 --> 00:01:05.660
how the two variables vary apart from each other rather than with each other.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.549
Another way of writing it is like this. Even though r is a ratio, it's not

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.988
interpreted as a percentage. However, r squared is the percentage of the

00:01:14.988 --> 00:01:21.275
variation in y explained by the variation in x. You saw this before when we did

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:25.435
t-tests, and you saw how we explained a certain percentage of the difference

00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:29.725
between sample means, or between a sample mean and the population mean, that's

00:01:29.725 --> 00:01:36.979
due to the different treatments. r squared here has the same interpretation. r

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.004
squared is called the coefficient of determination. r measures the strength of

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:47.240
a relationship, by looking at how closely the data falls along a straight line.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.104
If it falls perfectly along a straight line in the positive direction, then r

00:01:52.104 --> 00:01:57.504
is positive 1. And if the data fall perfectly along a straight line in the

00:01:57.504 --> 00:02:03.774
negative direction, r is negative 1. Data that are not correlated at all have a

00:02:03.774 --> 00:02:08.768
correlation coefficient of zero. Usually data will not fall along a straight

00:02:08.768 --> 00:02:14.290
line, but sometimes it comes pretty close. And then r in this case might have a

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.629
correlation coefficient of 0.8, which is actually pretty high.
