00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.340
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.960
And we're almost done! We're almost done! Sequel Month is almost over!

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.540
I only have one more movie to review! Just one more!

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.800
And who knows? Maybe it'll be good!

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.800
I mean, for crying out loud, you can't always judge a book by its cover-

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.020
D'AAH, EXCEPT THAT ONE!

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.240
Yes, Care Bears is another one of those classic "What the hell were you thinking?" moments of nostalgia.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.100
We all hate to admit it, but we did watch this lovey-dovey bullshit, and it has not aged well with time.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.880
The first film was bad, but I gave it credit that at least it had some atmosphere, a decent pace, and a pretty cool villain.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.920
This film...

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.100
Ugh, let's just get Sequel Month over with.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.540
Let's dive right into The Care Bears Movie II.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.700
Actually, let me rephrase that. It's not THE Care Bears Movie II, it's just Care Bears Movie II.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.380
I guess the word the was just cramping the title's style.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.060
And on top of that, it's not just Care Bears Movie II, it's A New Generation.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.820
So really, the opening should look like this:

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.060
[Star Trek: The Next Generation Theme plays]

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.700
So, as the credits roll, we see this ship in the middle of the ocean being handled by a bear and a horse.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.940
Isn't it always?

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.500
They're taking care of a big bundle of babies that are sleeping down below.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.260
So... I guess this is the new generation, right?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.900
Actually, no. It's the exact same generation, they're just all babies now.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.800
Well, that would make this a prequel then, right?

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.400
Actually, no. Because the care bear cousins like the lion, the penguin, and so forth, they're in there as well.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.380
Even though the first film stated they had a completely different back story.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.640
So... I guess the bear and the horse are their parents, right?

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.660
Actually, NO. Because, well, how the fuck does a bear and a horse get together and produce a lion, a sheep, a penguin,

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.500
And God knows what else?

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.280
And, for that matter, how the hell did she squeeze all those little bastards out at the same time?

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.180
Her cooch must be hanging to the fucking floor!

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.700
And, hi, what the fuck are they doing in the middle of the ocean with a ba-jillion fucking babies?!

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.100
Fucking credits aren't even over, and this movie makes no Goddamn sense!

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.500
It's Care Bears! It shouldn't be that hard to follow!

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.500
It's him!

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.860
So... another creature with no real origin pops up named Dark Heart.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.000
We have no idea what he is, where he came from, or how he works, but....

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.000
He's just evil, woooh!

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.720
Ah!

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.000
Agh!

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.440
Woah!

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.400
God has you, Care Bears!

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.280
Taste the holy rainbow of awesomeness, mother fuckers!

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.800
Taste the holy rainbow of awesomeness!

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.700
No matter where you go, I will find you!

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.400
So their boat gets an upgrade-

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.860
Or... downgrade...

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.500
And the care bears enter into...

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.600
Care-halla...

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.960
As we finally see who pulled them out of trouble.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.040
Well done, my little star and heart buddies!

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.300
ah.......

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.320
Let me guess, we're never gonna be told what that thing is?

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.500
Yeah, great, terrific. We're what, five minutes in? And already NOBODY HAS ANY IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON!

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.520
I mean, this "new generation" isn't a new generation,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.900
the evil thing chasing them, we have no idea what it is,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.280
that creepy star face...

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.000
ew

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.860
I mean, why is this even called "Care Bears 2"? It's in no way continuing the story from the last movie!

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.800
They're just changing it half way through, and all the little kids are praying their parents are gonna know what's going on,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.140
but fuck it, we don't have a clue!

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.300
It's like doing Lord of the Rings, and as soon as you hit the two towers the author's like,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.940
"Eh, fuck it, let's make Frodo a porcupine.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.700
Aragorn will be an Easy-Bake Oven,

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.000
and Sauron, the lord of evil, is now being replaced with a pencil sharpener.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.100
We'll never explain why, but, fuck it, nobody will notice!"

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.320
WHAT THE FUCK'S WRONG WITH YOU!?

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.200
Our search is now over.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.040
We have found the two creatures whose love and kindness for others is so great,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.900
that it sets them apart from the rest of the world.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.000
By dragging these newborns into harsh, dangerous, waters, you've shown just how much you truly care for them.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.100
That didn't sound right...

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.300
So we do find out that the cubs are orphans, at least,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.000
though, why an orphanage is on a boat in the middle of the water, I have no idea.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.120
And we're told their ultimate purpose.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.700
And as they have helped to protect the little orphan cubs,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.600
they shall help others to share their feelings,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.800
and protect everyone from Dark Heart's evil.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.400
Thanks, curiously non-denominational star God.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.000
We'll enjoy carrying out your incredibly vague quest!

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.920
So the care-takers are now given the name True Heart and Noble Heart.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.900
And they have the incredibly simple task of making everybody in the freaking world feel better.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.220
Um.. yeah... you may wanna look into outsourcing, curiously non-denominational star God.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.380
Ohh... what am I to do?

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.500
Thankfully, only one set of kids is having problems in the whole entire world,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.520
and that's John, Dawn, and Christy.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.040
I could've sworn that maybe some Afghan kids were feeling a little blue,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.500
but nope, just seems to be these three. Lucky, lucky.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.380
No!

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.600
First back! I win!

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.420
You three are last at everything! If you can't keep up, leave!

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.780
Uh, after you do the trash duty. Ha ha ha!

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.700
Yeah, I always loved those camps that had no camp counselors, and only let the kids call the shots.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.880
Things always turned out fair that way.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.680
I hate being last, and I hate being here!

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.040
He's right. We'll always be last.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.220
So Christy decides to run away because she's not able to be what she's always dreamed.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.600
Can you guess what that is?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.640
Camp champ. Camp champ. Camp champ. Camp. champ.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.660
Camp champ. Camp champ. Camp champ. Camp champ.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.900
Camp champ. Camp Champ.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.540
I'm gonna say...

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.260
a bitch!

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.100
The other two kids decide to come with, but get lost along the way.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.880
True Heart comes across the children and, in typical Care Bears fashion,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.440
they never question WHY THE FUCK A TALKING BEAR IS IN FRONT OF THEM!

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.600
Running away from a problem never solved it.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.020
You two are just too worried about the things you can't do.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.080
Maybe you should think about all the things you can do!

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.800
Like what?

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.600
Like stopping producers from making movies based on characters from greeting cards!

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.580
That'd be a great thing you can do!

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:41.940
So True Heart has a very weird idea by taking the two kids to their home, and putting them to work looking after the babies because...

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.720
child labor is a sign of caring, i guess?

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.940
♪ Somehow it all works, ♪

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.040
♪ though it's really not so rare. ♪

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.020
♪ Give a little here, give a little there. ♪

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.300
GOD there's only so much cutesy-ness I can take.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.200
I mean, tell me, do they shit sprinkles or Lucky Charms?

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.700
Because nothing else would make this crap anymore schmaltzy.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.140
Seriously, who had the idea for this anyway?!

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.640
Even the Devil couldn't think of something so terrible!

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.880
Funny you should mention that...

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.200
Sage?

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.620
Yes.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.500
You... you're the Devil?

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.760
*laughing* Really, who else could it be?

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.420
Well, ok, fair enough, but what the hell are you doing here?

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:31.960
Well, I've come to explain this unholy abomination that you humans call...

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.280
Care Bears...

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.600
Really? So you're the one who created Care Bears, huh?

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.900
Why the hell would you do that? It's harmless!

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:46.100
No, Critic. There are several subconscious messages that are being planted in little children's minds.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.320
Like what?

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.600
Well, for example, notice how the care takers leave the children behind

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.060
with these two little delinquents looking after them?

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.320
Well, this is to show that being a dead-beat parent is ok.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.620
No kidding!

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.000
And abandoning your children who can't take care of themselves

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.180
to be raised by other children who can't take care of themselves

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.800
is the way of the future.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.940
Also notice how the Care Bears always use magic to solve their problems.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.240
Well, this is to show the little children that the black arts are the path towards life

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.660
and should be used in more everyday occurrences.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.460
Good Lord, are there more subconscious messages like this?

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.860
*Laughs* You have no idea.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.080
I'm the Devil! THE DEVIL!!!

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.680
MWAH HA HA HA HA HA!

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.400
Yeah, well, your head looks like it's coming out of a vagina.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.220
Hey! This is stylish!

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.040
NC: And, speaking of devils, we get another visit from Dark Heart

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.760
as he talks to Christy by turning himself into a boy.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.600
And just to make the coherency in this movie even MORE confusing,

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.760
not only do the main two kids look like the main two kids from the first movie,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.640
but Dark Heart is voiced by Nicholas from the first movie,

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.300
and Christy is voiced by the girl from the first movie!

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.320
As if this shit wasn't confusing enough already!

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.640
You are the camp champ, ain't you?

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.680
No... I'm not.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.740
Well you sure could've fooled me!

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.300
Who are you?

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.460
I have so many names...

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.560
You wouldn't wanna be the camp champ, would ya?

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.900
I could fix it for ya!

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.360
I don't know...

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.060
There's only one catch, though...

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.100
YOUR SOUL!!!!!!

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.940
It's no big deal.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.160
Sometime I'll drop by and ask you to return the favor

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.820
and you just... do it.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.280
No questions asked. What do ya say?

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.220
(As Marlon Brando) Eh, come on, it's an offer you can't refuse, huh?

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.140
So Dark Heart makes her dream come true and she's suddenly a sports all-star.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.740
By the way, am I the only one who thinks Dark Heart sounds like the Evil Dead demons?

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.440
Beware, True Heart, soon I'll be coming for you!

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.320
We are the things that were and shall be again!

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.320
I wouldn't mind so much if they didn't steal the CONTINUITY from the Evil Dead movies, as well.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.700
Knowing that it was only a matter of time before Dark Heart found them,

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.560
Noble Heart and True Heart moved the little cubs to a safer place.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.000
And seeing how in a later scene, Dark Heart finds them anyway,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.400
this was completely pointless.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:20.280
So years go by as the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins all grow up into their adult form,

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.400
Yet somehow the children on earth never change!

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.360
What, is there some sort of space-time continuum thing that Care-A-Lot is pulling off?!

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.200
Actually, this is all once again a part of my plan!

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.960
Oh what, the whole time-change thing is part of your plan?

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.960
Yes... you see,

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.780
when the girl made that deal with Dark Heart, it caused time to slow down for her.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:45.540
No doubt showing that a deal with the Devil has many perks and benefits...

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.780
like living FOREVER!!... MWAHAHAHAHA!!

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.200
If you would like to sell you soul today, just dial this number.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.300
Whether it be power, or glory, or being the camp champ, all opportunities are open to you.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.100
PISS OFF!

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.480
Remember, if it ain't the Devil, it ain't worth hell!

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So yeah, like I said before, even though they moved all the way to Care-A-Lot,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.740
Dark Heart finds them anyway.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.860
How? Only the baked minds of the writers could answer that for ya.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.800
He claims he's there to fix the caring meter, which, it turns out, is really broken.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.000
um... good timing, I guess?

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.580
We're having a party!

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.940
Who likes games?

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.320
Oh! Oh! Me! Yeah!

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.840
Blind Man's Bluffers down there, and Leap Froggers up there!

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.000
Time for a game of disappearing bears!

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.580
Hehe, I don't know why, I really love the way he says that one line!

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.580
Time for a game of disappearing bears!

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:42.640
It almost sounds like he's channeling Christopher Walken. It just cracks me up!

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.700
Time for a game of disappearing bears!

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.400
This is not over, BEARS!!!

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.900
So Dark Heart plans to capture all of the Care Bears together with...

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.700
a bag...

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.040
The lord of evil's secret weapon is a bag...

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.180
Hey, here's a crazy idea!

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.400
Um, remember when you turned into that giant KILLER dragon before?

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.320
Um, why don't you just DO THAT AGAIN?!

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.600
I mean, I know it's not as subtle as... A BAG! But I think it would still be much more effective.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.700
We're terribly sorry! Can we give you a hand?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.400
NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.780
No! NO! NOOOO!!!! YOU WILL DIE!!!

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.660
Keep your kindness and affection to yourselves!! It's...

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:28.980
Dark Heart!

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.240
So Dark Heart shows off his real form,

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.500
but luckily True Heart and Noble Heart are there to lead the attack against him.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.860
Dark Heart: You have won today, but I'll be BACK!!!!!

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.120
Green Goblin: We'll meet again, SPIDER-MAN!!!!!

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.060
NC: So Noble Heart and True Heart try to track him down and defeat him, once and for all,

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.560
leaving the rest of the Care Bears to look after the Earth.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.800
But Dark Heart goes back to Christy to ask about that favor she promised him.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.160
I want to trap the Care Bears, and I have a plan.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.440
The world must learn to fear me...

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.200
DARK HEAAARRRTTT!!!

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.740
Oh, I'm sorry, I've been saying his name wrong the whole time!

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.320
It isn't Dark Heart, it's DARK HEAAARRRTTT!!!

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.400
And what if I refuse to help you? What then?

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.940
Do you want to go back to being the little girl who never won anything?

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.360
The one who always came in last?

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.260
Oh no!!!

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.280
Yes it's either help the lord of darkness rule the earth, or be pissy-poor at sports.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.600
Don't make her choose!

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.900
So, of course, like an idiot, she agrees, and they go riding into the night.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.500
Come now, we're wasting time! Woah!

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.500
Hey, this is a lot like those Twilight movies... NO IT'S NOT!

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.180
WE'RE BUTCH COMPARED TO THAT SHIT!

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:52.880
So Christy and DARK HEAAARRRTTT plan a trap for the bears by making it look like she's stuck in a canoe.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.600
Help!

00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:01.900
Um... is this really a Care Bear related matter? I mean, it's not like she doesn't CARE that she's in the canoe....

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.660
Yay! He got to use his fucking little bag!

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.280
I guess it can make a handy weapon if you force it on the scenario.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.240
It's Dark Heart!

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.700
You mean... DARK HEAAARRRTTT!!!!

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.780
Well we can't just sit here. We have to help that little girl!

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.500
Secret Bear and I saw her throw her paddles into the water!

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.640
She's working with Dark Heart!

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.280
JUDAS!

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.640
Why so glum, Christy? You're doing a great job!

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.040
There'll be no one left to stop me!

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.100
Ah!

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.460
Woah!

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.320
Ow!

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.860
Wow. DARK HEAAARRRTTT is a bit of a klutz, isn't he?

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.120
But luckily, Christy has a soft spot for satanic spawns of darkness

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.120
You saved me... why?

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.200
You're still a person.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.100
If you knew what was good for you... you would've left me.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:07.180
Yeah, I have to admit, tripping and hitting your head on a canoe is a pretty funny way to go for the ruler of all evil.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.800
What's that? He hit his head on a canoe and drowned?

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.440
Huh...

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.480
I can't believe we were actually afraid of this guy.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:17.700
Tsk. Well, let's break out the peppermint schnapps

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:25.500
So just like the first film, DARK HEAAARRRTTT turns all the people in the world into jerks.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:32.640
With Christy's help, Dark Heart had trapped almost every one of the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:38.480
HOW!? I mean, did she really keep calling for help and those fuzzy little idiots kept going after her?

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.320
How many times do you fall for that?

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:46.000
Each time we go to help someone in trouble, that someone could be Christy setting another trap.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:51.180
Hey! Here's an idea! Why don't you just not go after Christy!?

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:55.880
I mean, this is really simple! If you hear her screaming, just don't go!

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.180
How fucking hard is that?!

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.840
NC as Christy: (Offscreen) Help! Help!

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.080
Nope, no, not interested...

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.220
NC as Christy: Oh! Somebody help me!

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.240
Nah, nah, nah I can't hear you...

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.180
NC as Christy: Help! Somebody help! Please help! Somebody help me!

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.480
Oh, I can't get out of this situation... whatever it is!

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.700
HELP ME!!!

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.280
DON'T WORRY! I'LL SAVE YOU!

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.840
NC: (offscreen) Oh my God, A BAG!

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:24.620
So, the Care Bears get the two kids together, and decide to put a stop to DARK HEAAARRRTTT'S evil.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.620
They end up at his hideout which, conveniently enough, happens to be right at the camp ground!

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.980
There's Brave Heart's signal!

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.620
Dooohhh! We thought it was something else!

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:42.740
So they go into Skeletor's workout basement, only to find that DARK HEAAARRRTTT is there waiting for them.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.860
Now I have you all!

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.320
You can't keep us in here, Dark Heart!

00:16:51.400 --> 00:17:02.100
Oh, I don't intend to. I have a very special place all set... yawn... but that will keep until after I've rested.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.100
NC: Yeah... I guess the lord of darkness is... sleepy!

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:10.800
Kind of odd... you'd think he'd be more awake for the destruction of his mortal enemy...

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.600
But that little star and heart come in to pick the locks!

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:20.100
Good work! Oh no! Little star buddy can't unlock all these doors!

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.240
You're right! And we don't have much time!

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.200
(as Braveheart) Well, I guess the rest of ya gotta die. Toodles!

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.120
NC: No, they go to get the key from around his neck

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.260
as he keeps changing shape as he snoozes.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.160
Any logical person would just squash the bastard while he's a frog,

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.800
(mockingly) but that wouldn't be caring enough.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.500
But the plan backfires as he banishes all the Care Bears into little, red crystals.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.800
The kids show up to see the evil he's done, Christy included.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.540
And the caretakers show up as well.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:51.420
The time has come to put an end to your evil trickery!

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.840
Ahh!!!

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.420
What was that? Did he just lay an egg?

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.400
Ahh!!!

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.100
(Insert chicken sound)

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.840
NC: So Christy gets zapped, but manages to use her marbles and get the chandelier down.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.680
Oh, it's a good thing she knew that would work, and not shatter them into a million bloody pieces.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.620
Dark Heart: NOOOOOO!!!

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:24.000
Oh no! What have I done!?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.880
NC: (As Dark Heart) No really, what have I done? I... I don't know what this is.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.680
Help me Care Bears!

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.100
We can't!

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:34.780
It would take more love and caring than even we have.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:39.700
If you can't help, who can?

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.940
Nobody! She's screwed! Bye!

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.720
We care! We all really care!

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:52.300
If all of us, and everyone, everywhere, all care together it just might be enough to save Christy!

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:57.720
NC: And when we say everywhere, we mean specifically the few dollar theaters that were desperate enough to show this film.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.120
We care! We care!

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:08.420
If you have ever cared, do it now! Help us! Tell us you care!

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.960
Tell your friend next to you that you care!

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.320
Tell them how much you care!

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.040
Tell 'em again!

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.420
Say it!

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.580
Shout it!

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.400
Help us!

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.800
We care!!

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.440
We care!

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.220
I BELIEVE IN SANTA CHRIST!

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:29.780
What!?

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.520
Oh nothing, sorry.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.300
um, force of habit.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.100
Oh, ok. Ha ha ha...

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.460
Fucking Bears!

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.620
I know the feeling.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.460
I care...

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.300
I care!

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:53.500
Now just out of curiosity, devil Sage, what evil underlining message were you trying to get across here?

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.800
More abortions.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.500
What!? This is recommending abortions!?

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.500
Yes! I'm actually surprised you don't see the connection, really.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.460
You see, the girl is like the fetus, and the Care Bears are like the scalpel.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.500
Okay, never mind! Let's just get through this!

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.400
NC: Of course, Christy comes back to life, despite your inevitable empty silence

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.260
and everything seems to be alright.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.940
Hooray!

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.200
Woah!

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.300
NC: Okay, that didn't happen, but they do escape in time and find that everybody's ok.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.020
Your eyes!

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.700
Look!

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.660
I'm a boy! A real boy! Whoopee!

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:59.840
NC: So it turns out the evil hell spawn all this time just wanted to be a real  little boy.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.660
Who knew? Hell, maybe even Pinocchio had a similar backstory?

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.560
I'm a real boy!

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.560
[Growling]

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:12.080
So that's "Care Bears Movie" 2 a New Generation. And...

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.000
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.900
It's not as good as the original.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.840
And of course, the first film is bad.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.540
But it did have a three-act structure and some understanding of character.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.980
This movie's just a mess and a bore!

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.420
Outside of maybe the kid characters,

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.240
no one in this movie is given enough screen time to build any character development.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.740
I mean, even very basic development.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.500
The story's all over the map, that is when it's not just rehashing the first movie again,

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.420
and of course there's a million confusing plot holes about the basic origins of these guys.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.060
It's just a lame, lame movie.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:50.860
All these sequels were lame! If I had my way, I'd have them eradicated from my memory!

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.400
I could make that possible...

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.160
Really? You can?!

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.380
Yes... It is totally within my powers...

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.060
Well, God that'd be wonderful! Go ahead and do it!

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:08.200
By the powers of darkness... by the minions of hell...by the...

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.580
Did you really think I was the Devil?

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:10.660
What?

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:15.300
The Devil? Did you REALLY think I was the Devil?! I was the FREAKIN' DEVIL?

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.300
I bought this costume AT A FREAKING WALMART!

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.980
Oh... you... you're not the Devil then, huh?

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.600
NO!

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.940
Ugh! What a shame! I was gonna give you everything to get rid of these sequels!

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:27.960
Everything?

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.900
Yeah. Everything.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:39.320
Um... congratulations! You've passed the... I'm... not... the... Devil test... You passed with flying colors!

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.100
I was just testing to see how strong your faith really was!

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:42.940
How does that work?

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:47.760
Never mind! Anyway, I can remove all these memories of these bad sequels,

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.800
and all you have to do is wire every bit of your money into my PayPal account!

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.040
Done!

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:57.200
Wow!

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.140
So, you'll get rid of all the sequels from my memory!?

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.920
Oh yeah, sure...

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.400
Oh... oh yes... oh I can feel them perishing from my mind!

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.940
Yeah, it'll do that...

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:13.640
Oh... it's incredible! Oh! OH! And they're totally gone! Haha that's unbelievable!

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.220
I..Is there anything else I can do for you, Mr. Beelzebub?

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.500
Hmm? Oh uh... jump off a cliff or something...

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.500
Yes, Sir!

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.000
AAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.980
My God!

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.180
