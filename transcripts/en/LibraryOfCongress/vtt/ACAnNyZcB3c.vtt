00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.853
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.730
&gt;&gt; David Brown: Our speaker
this session is Harold Varmus.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.353
It's hard to know how to describe
him although the first appositional

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.473
phrase would almost certainly be
1989 winner of the Nobel Prize

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.683
in medicine or physiology.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.450
[ Applause ]

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.243
&gt;&gt; David Brown: As readers of Dr.
Varmus' autobiography of last year,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.196
The Art and Politics of
Science know or barring that,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.906
readers of last Sunday's Book
World section in the Post,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.993
our speaker came to
science quite indirectly.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.810
The son of a physician he
went to Amherst College

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.763
where he was an English major

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.563
who also took all of
a pre-med curriculum.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.536
He opted to pursue English; went
to Harvard to get a Doctorate

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.996
but dropped out when he felt the
siren song of family expectation

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.933
and practical usefulness
draw him back to medicine.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.840
He may have been one of the few
people who sat his parents down,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.733
told them he was going to medical
school and saw their faces drop.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.963
What happened to our
son the English prof?

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.963
He went to medical school but
he didn't go into medicine.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.230
Instead he went into science which
is quite a different enterprise.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.396
He learned to talk the language of
science late and perhaps came to wit

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.233
with the inside and daring
of a non-native speaker;

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.643
and he barged right into the
most heated conversation.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.783
What is the relationship
between genes, the repository

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.203
of our permanent biological
identity and cancer,

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.096
the disease of wild
and fatal innovation?

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.110
He and Michael Bishop
found part of the answer

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.040
in onko [assumed spelling] genes.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.163
They're the virus-like remnants
in our DNA heritage that can

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.523
under certain circumstances
be awakened

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.390
to produce uncontrolled cell growth.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.073
The modern understanding
of cancer and someday much

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.206
of the therapeutics will
owe their debt to him.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.950
Dr. Varmus went on to become the
head of the National Institutes

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.336
of Health during the Clinton
years and later the head

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.396
of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
in New York.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.370
He recently accepted
President Obama's invitation

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.806
to become the Director of the
National Cancer Institute,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.373
which I guess is a little bit

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.506
like William Howard Taft
becoming Chief Justice

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.106
after becoming President.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.283
He's also a big bicyclist.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.070
One day on vacation in France he got
up before breakfast to go for a ride

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.916
and ended up in another
country-- Italy I believe.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.463
Please welcome Harold Varmus.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.030
[ Applause ]

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.336
&gt;&gt; Dr. Varmus: Well I want to begin
with a couple of thanks not just

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.946
to the Library of Congress
and the Washington Post

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.223
which have been thanked many, many
times but I want to thank Michelle

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.213
for bringing my message to those
of you who have hearing problems,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.396
and I want to thank my friend
David Brown, himself a physician

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.896
and distinguished science reporter,
for his very depth introduction.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.823
I also want to thank all of you.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.436
I've been sitting around listening
to people all day and I'm about worn

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.743
out so your endurance is great
so thank you very much for those

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.616
of are back loaded on
the program for you

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.163
to have stayed around for us.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.286
Now unlike most of the other
speakers you've heard from today,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.506
I don't call myself an author
except possibly on days like today;

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.260
and I am now above
all else a scientist.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.343
When I'm asked at integration what
do I do I don't way I write books;

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.743
I say I do science or I'm
a government official.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.780
I'm also lapse position and
I run some institutions;

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.873
but for like most academically
based scientists I've done a lot

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.980
of writing, usually in my own fields

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.046
of cancer research
and virus research.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.296
But like many other
speakers you've heard from,

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.096
I aspire to be an author.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.973
And last year to give
myself legitimacy

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.733
in this role I did publish
a book, as you've heard,

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.526
about my life in science
and politics.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.563
How did that happen?

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.430
Well in 2003 a friend of mine,
the noted barber for Gene Strauss

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.076
who runs the program
in the Humanities

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.793
at the New York Public Library,
asked me to give a series

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.766
of lectures called the Norton
Lectures to talk to humanists

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.570
about science; initially
she wanted me to talk

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.156
about C.P. Snow's 'Two Cultures';
that idea seemed a little worn out

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.280
and I put together three lectures on
becoming a scientists, doing science

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.363
and being a scientist
engaged in politics.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.536
I gave the lectures, that was fun in
2004 and then I read the contract.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.363
And the contract said that after the
lectures were given a book would be

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.603
delivered to Norton after
which a check will be received.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.710
So that you might think
would be a strong motivation

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.200
but indeed it took me four
more years to write the book

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.966
because unlike one
might have anticipated

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.380
from one's initial reaction
to a contract like that,

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.086
you can't simply take three
lectures and put them into a book.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.566
Books take a lot more work and a lot
more depth, and indeed after a lot

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.963
of procrastination I tried to
give it that kind of depth.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.670
Now, a motivation to
put the lectures

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.920
into a book form was not
simply based on the idea

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.890
of getting a modest check from
the Norton Publishing Company.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.933
Indeed as I thought about it, I
realized that the country needed--

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.510
at least those who might
be readers of this book,

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.833
could profit from a better
explanation of what human motivation

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.870
and trials and tribulations lie
behind the science that people read

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.856
about when David Brown
and others report on it.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.183
I was also concerned
that despite the fact

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.300
that this is the age of Obama.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.926
I stood here on Inauguration Day and
heard the new President declare it

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.520
in his Inaugural Address that
he was going to restore science

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.243
to its rightful place, that science
was one of the few ways we had

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.810
to deal with the chronic and acute
problems of our society, disease

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.790
and environmental degradation, lack
of energy sources and difficulties

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.756
in our economy; and I believe
I that and yet I am concerned

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.380
that for most people science remains
an abstraction not a human activity.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.686
And in particular, not a human
activity with moments of drama,

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.280
frustration, exhilaration
and as a result for people

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.990
who don't understand this, science
and scientists are mysterious

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.890
and remote; not an exciting realm of
activity carried out by real people.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:49.223
This notion very nicely expressed
by my new friend Richard Holmes,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:49.666
the British author who is speaking

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.533
in a tent a few blocks away hence
my sweaty appearance in front

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.706
of you a few minutes a go, who
in his book, the Age of Wonder,

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.166
a book about science and
the arts in the late 18th

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.966
and early 19th Century
said as a means

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.760
of explaining why he wrote the
book he wrote, it's now important

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.060
to understand how science
is actually made;

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:15.563
how scientists themselves think
and feel and speculate and we need

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:19.110
to explore what makes scientists
creative as well as poets

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.416
or painters of musicians.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:25.886
So, there are a lot of
ways to tackle this problem

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.063
and indeed there are now movies.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.456
There's even a recent opera, John
Adams' Dr. Atomic, there are books

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.886
like Richard Holmes that
describe histories of science--

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.770
how the atomic bomb was made and you
just heard that from Richard Rhodes;

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:42.516
the Eighth Day of Creation and
others that I won't bore you with.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:46.756
There are biographies; that is,

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:49.730
books written by authors
about famous scientists.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:51.150
The one I like particularly
is the book by Lisa Jardine

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.373
on the Curious Life of Robert Hook,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.060
a 17th Century scientist,
one of the first.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.320
There are novelistic treatments
of science that are entertaining

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:04.290
and often give a picture
of what science is like;

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.343
one of our speakers
today Allegra Goodman,

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.106
has written a very wonderful
book called Intuition

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.846
about doing the kind of
science my lab does; Ian McEwen,

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.216
the remarkable novelist has written
a recent book about a physicist,

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.310
a book entitled Solar;
and again C.P. Snow,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.616
who I mentioned earlier has written
several good books including The

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.063
Search and The Masters.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.270
And there's poetry-- poetry by
a woman named Rebecca Ellison,

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.790
an astronomer, called A
Responsibility to Awe.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.496
My own book, as you've heard, is
in the realm of memoir and here I'm

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.960
in a realm in which
there are giants.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.313
The biggest giant in this
field is Jim Watson whose book,

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.476
The Double Helix, broke the ice

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.826
and having scientists talk
about the work they do.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.010
My own emphasis has been
focused on three broad topics;

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.556
each of which represents an
important aspect of science,

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.900
and each of which reflects the
odd features of my own career.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:05.113
So first how do you
become a scientist?

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.113
And as you've heard
briefly from David,

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.780
I had a tortuous path
toward science,

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:14.020
a path that illustrates the
forgiving nature of American society

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.306
that allows one to have a prolonged
adolescence and win one's way

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.560
through literature and medicine
and eventually on to science.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.093
My family background is
interesting in the sense

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.466
that my grandparents escaped
anti-Semitism and poverty in Europe,

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:42.290
came to this country around the
turn of-- last turn of the century,

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.553
and yet in only the course of a
few years had children who went

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:48.660
to ivy league colleges,
had professional success,

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.480
and gave me the luxury of being able

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.813
to indulge my curiosity
about many fields.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.330
Then the Vietnam War played
a role in my transitions

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:01.786
because as a physician trained
in the 60's, I was obligated

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.176
to serve my country which was then
fighting a war that I didn't approve

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:12.863
of and I became a member of a core
often called the Yellow Berets,

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:13.546
young doctors who often were
objectors to the war who ended

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.096
up in a wonderful situation being
trained at the National Institutes

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.370
of Health which has been the fuel
of my loyalty to that institution

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.703
over the last forty years.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:32.670
At the NIH I learned what science
could do and how engaging it was,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.293
and part of that experience is
what fuels my current enthusiasm

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.653
for telling others how
wonderful science can be.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:41.683
So that's one part of the story.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.640
The second part has to do with the
science itself and here as a writer

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.593
who understands a lot of molecular
biology, I knew I had a challenge.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:52.766
I had been trying to teach my wife
for 41 years what I do in the lab

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.086
and I can tell you it's
not easy to do that.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.436
So I've tried to figure out
how I could distill the kind

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.940
of science I work on into
a story that could connect

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.196
with some basic facts
that people know

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:15.330
like The Double Helix is the shape
of DNA; and to try to explain how--

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.980
curiosity about how a
virus that caused cancer

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.876
in chickens could be pursued to
understand the fundamental nature

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.083
of cancer in human beings.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:28.383
And I try to take the reader
through a series of steps

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:35.050
that reflect both the
struggles of doing the work

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.173
and the current triumphalism that
some of us feel about the new kinds

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:45.263
of therapies and strategies
for prevention and diagnosis,

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.490
that are the result of that work.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:57.113
Along the way the work was of course
it carried out not just by me alone

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
but a partner, Michael Bishop,

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:02.293
with whom I shared the Nobel Prize
several years ago, and by a number

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.526
of trainees all of whom
I tried to portray--

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.406
some of whom I tried
to portray in the book.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.366
Finally, I wanted to
talk about something

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.293
that was an unusual
experience for scientists

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:23.616
like myself namely a change into
a kind of politician of science.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.850
The prize having given me a
certain unearned creditability

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.336
as a spokesperson, I was turned to
for opinions and eventually asked

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.633
to run the nation's, indeed
the world's largest supporter

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.093
by medical research, the NIH.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:46.430
And in that role I had to learn
a lot about budgets and politics

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:48.256
that I didn't know before, and
set scientific priorities and deal

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:56.236
with advocacy groups and many
other supporters and critics.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:02.650
So that whole realm of activity
is one that I think is useful

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:05.853
for other scientists to
know about and for those

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.586
who respect science to understand.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.730
Along the way as I took on the
chores of being the director of NIH,

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:18.890
I was privileged to deal with
a number of important issues

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:24.043
that have become obsessions
for me in the ensuing years--

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:25.540
in the 10 years since I've
been at the NIH as director.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.493
One if the importance of research
on stem cells, another is the means

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:34.853
in which we use the Internet
to promulgate our work

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.646
and make it more accessible
to others,

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.910
and the third is the importance
of using the information we know

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.710
about research and medicine to
try to improve the status of most

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.500
of the world living in lower
middle income and poor countries

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.863
in a field called Global
Health and Global Science.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:04.130
Now I am in a tent called
contemporary and I want

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.133
to remind you that some of these
issues are just as alive today

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.373
as they were ten years ago;
indeed the World Cancer Research

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.180
of course is moving ahead
extremely rapidly these days.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:22.893
Three of the big issues that I've
mentioned are still in the news.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.853
Open access publication is now
something which is widely respected

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.980
and carried out without
financial disaster;

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.850
and congress has directed
the NIH to insure that all

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:41.033
of the work that's carried
out with this money ends

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.146
up in a publically accessible
database within a year.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:48.310
Second...

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.310
[ Applause ]

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.776
Dr. Varmus: Thank you.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.003
Secondly, the nation is
taking seriously the challenge

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.290
of improving health in
developing countries

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:03.623
and the Obama Administration's
global health initiative is setting

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:07.650
a new standard extending some
very commendable wok carried

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.173
out by the Bush Administration
in providing remedies for HIV

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.296
under the Cupfar [assumed spelling]
Program; and as I'm sure many

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:16.443
of you know stem cell research is,
while having advanced dramatically

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:21.973
over the last several years
and having been encouraged

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:23.736
by the Obama Administration,
has taken a real blow

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.796
with a recent ruling that has
offered a reinterpretation

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.873
of an appropriate provision
that now threatens the future

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.346
of stem cell research.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.280
As you've heard I am back at the NIH
as director of the Cancer Institute,

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.146
and the adventure is ongoing

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.243
and with luck maybe
there'll be another book.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.590
Well thanks very much and
happy to take some questions.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.040
[ Applause ]

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.030
&gt;&gt; Audience question: Coleridge,
the poet, had a dream that lead

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:12.716
to his poem, Kubla Khan and as you
know Keloy [assumed spelling] had

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.636
the dream about the Benzene
ring; and I was wondering...

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:17.650
&gt;&gt; Dr. Varmus: That's the
snake devouring its own tail.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:21.836
&gt;&gt; Audience question:
And I was wondering

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:24.970
about the creative process.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.273
Is there such a thing that has
inspiration in science and if

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.800
so is it analogist to
that and what are...?

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.750
&gt;&gt; Dr. Varmus: Yes and so I'm not
an authority on the creative process

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:37.500
but one of the things I
try to do in this book is

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.826
to relate how ideas came to me.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:45.353
I don't really understand how it
happens but one important idea

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.170
that happens to lie in the narrative

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.690
of the work I did is somebody
trying to find cancer genes.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:56.156
Just popped into my head when I
was wheeling my six-month old son

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.713
through a churchyard during
a sabbatical in London.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:00.856
And I would say the important
thing there is the word sabbatical.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.263
Many of my fellow scientists
don't take a year off;

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:07.700
they just plunge ahead all the time.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:09.706
They're working, working, working,

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.706
trying to get their next
graph [assumed spelling],

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.636
publish the next paper and I
think some time to get away

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.443
from routine work and
think more deeply

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:20.620
about science is an important thing.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.193
I'm in the midst of trying
to do an analogist thing

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.406
at the NIH at the moment.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.940
We're in a phase of
remarkably dense data generation

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.140
in the cancer research world; and
I've asked a number of my colleagues

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.466
to come together and think not
about the next piece of data

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.360
or how we interpret it
but what are the big ideas

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.900
that we have not been working on
that we now could possibly answer.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.893
Hopefully out of that
process of saying

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:52.693
to my colleagues I know
there are a lot of ideas

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:55.733
that we really haven't
thought much about.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:57.016
For example, we all say isn't
it amazing Lance Armstrong was--

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:01.083
took chemotherapy for
testicular cancer

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:03.773
and then won seven tours of France.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:05.930
But we don't think
much on a daily basis

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:11.590
about why cyst platen actually
cures testicular cancer,

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.810
and I find myself saying
all the time

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.500
if we could make cancer a
controllable chronic disease,

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:22.076
that would be a real step
forward and it would be.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.520
But I don't think we
should lose site of the fact

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.020
that in some situations and there
are a few other diseases as well,

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.020
chemotherapy does cure cancer.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.420
Why does that happen?

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.686
It's a tough problem to answer
but I think we have tools

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.820
to try to look at that now.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.816
Sorry. Over here; I'm
going to alternate.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.116
&gt;&gt; Audience question: My question
is about stem cell research.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:45.856
And given that it's an ethical
controversy isn't it true

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.793
that we can make any
cell pluripotent--

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.426
we have enough information
to do that.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.273
Can we now go about it another way?

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.393
Why not, if not, is it not a form
of slavery if you can own a life

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.006
like that and do whatever
you want with it otherwise?

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.586
&gt;&gt; Dr. Varmus: Let me try
to answer that question.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.120
You're referring of
course to the induction

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.120
of what are called
pluripotent stem cells--

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.453
a very important method that may
actually be the most important

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.170
technology in developing
therapeutic cells.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.323
But I would caution you a little bit
about that because we've only known

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.976
about induced pluripotent
stem cells for a few years.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:32.176
We know already that they are not
identical to embryonic stem cells.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.386
There are limitations in
their potential very likely,

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.056
they retain memory of the
kind of mature cell they were;

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:44.463
it probably weighs around that but
if you want to compare those cells

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.406
with the most well
understood primitive cell

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:51.796
with maximum potential I think it is
important to carry out comparisons

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:56.863
with human embryonic stem cells.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.293
Now, I think your other point about
enslaving a life depends a lot

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:07.026
on what one considers life; and here
we have an area of moral argument.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.000
But I would point out what most
scientists are saying at this point

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:17.690
about the process by which stem
cell research is being funded is

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.730
that what they're asking
is that cells derived

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.000
with non-federal money be
used or be able to be used

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.746
with federal money to
do further studies.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:35.156
So there is a division that
was made traditionally accepted

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.420
by the Bush Administration and
by the Clinton Administration too

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.440
but also the Obama Administration
to allow work on stem cells

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.420
that have been derived with
non-public money; non-federal money.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.846
That's an arguable position.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.100
I know there are people who feel
strongly the other way but I think

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:55.656
that the benefits to human life of
working with cells that were derived

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:04.063
from smaller cluster of cells that
were going to be discarded anyway,

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.820
makes a lot of sense to me.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.020
[ Applause ]

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:14.153
&gt;&gt; Audience question: Would you
say a few words about copyright

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:19.683
and the way you can
do things over the web

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.713
and perhaps even micro
dollar exchanges

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.106
or something of that nature?

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.240
&gt;&gt; Dr. Varmus: Sure I
assume you mean the context

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.173
of scientific publication.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.040
Now I'm not anti-copyright
by any means.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.706
I believe the copyright is useful,

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:35.220
but traditionally what
authors have done

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:37.550
because there really
was no alternative,

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.890
was to turn over copyright
to publishers

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:42.846
after their papers were
accepted and allow publishers

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.580
to do whatever they
like with papers.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.850
I think there's another way
to do things and that is

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.123
to allow the copyright
to be held by authors.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.180
We're in, of course
a realm this day,

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.556
of authors who make their living by
selling their work and I don't want

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.720
to stop doing that; that's
very, very, important.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.860
But most of us who are scientists

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:07.800
when we write scientific articles
we're not interested in money;

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.986
we're interested in fame.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.520
We don't get money for
the publications we write.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.866
What we want to do we want
everybody to read our papers,

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:17.610
we want those papers to be not just
famous by read by others and built

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:21.876
on because the scientific process
depends on the dissemination

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:30.330
of one's work and the greatest
possible access by other scientists.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:34.603
So in the world of open access
publication what's done is

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:39.183
to allow the author to hold
the copyright and not turn it

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.930
over to the Journal, and
grant a license to the Journal

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:47.856
to publish the work, allow it to be
used freely for any purpose as long

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.906
as acknowledgment of
authorship is retained.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.693
I think that's a very
reasonable position;

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.960
it's one that's been
espoused by many journals

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.626
and in the larger world it's
become routine now at least

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.433
in the biomedical world, even

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:08.150
if one doesn't publish an open
access journal but in journals

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.413
that are either for-profit
or for the sustenance

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:15.490
of scientific societies to
allow that work to be placed

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.660
in a public repository called
Pub Med Central how to the NIH;

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.086
and that has served the scientific
community exceedingly well.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:23.363
I believe the delay
of a year is excessive

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.356
but the copyright rules
there have been worked out

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.120
and we've made a big
improvement in the way

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.853
in which we all access
scientific literature.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:43.283
Libraries have become smaller,
of course there's a crisis

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.826
in university libraries
created by the pricing practices

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:54.386
of many for-profit journals; and one
of the few ways to try to overcome

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.866
that is by publishing by a
different business method,

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.860
the open access method
which we know works.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.486
The open access publishing house
that I founded some years ago

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:10.293
with my colleagues called the Public
Library of Science, now actually is

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.493
in the black and doing experiments
with the excessive income

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.266
that it receives from the
publication fee paid by the authors;

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:19.146
and everything that's published

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:21.813
by the group is made instantly
available to the entire world

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.680
for free at the time of publication.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.360
Over here?

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.370
&gt;&gt; Audience question: Because of my
personal and family history I feel

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:36.283
that going to the doctor is very
important, having the colonoscopy

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:42.393
and in my case being tested for skin
problems because I've had melanoma.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:47.550
Harold, how much is detection in
education for preventive medicine?

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:51.630
How important is that for the NIH

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:52.266
and what is your priority
with that-- with NIH?

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.406
&gt;&gt; Dr. Varmus: Well, I think
this is extremely important

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:00.406
and indeed we know that
prevention is often not as sexy.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:01.013
I'm not often asked when are
you going to prevent cancer;

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:04.376
I'm asked when are you
going to cure cancer?

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:06.503
Because there are no grateful
people who's cancers were prevented.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:14.330
So screening is incredibly important
and we need to do a better job

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:15.603
but that's not just the job of the
NIH of course, but it's the job

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:19.193
of personal physicians,
it's the job of the CDC,

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.786
it's the job of the
Department and Health

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:24.796
and Human Services more generally;
I'd like to think it's the job

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.060
of the insurance companies which
have a great deal to benefit

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.426
from preventing disease
becomes very costly.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.606
So this is a major thrust in my
own administration at the NCI.

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.380
I think we can do a lot in
prevention both here at home

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.853
and also around the world.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.920
We tend to neglect cancer as
a threat to poor populations;

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:52.730
but the fact is that cancer is
a major burden of disease even

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.253
in the poorest countries, and there
are many things that could be done--

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:56.636
whether it's vaccination
against Hepatitis B

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:02.430
or Papillomavirus infection, or
whether it's reduction in use

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.966
of tobacco or early detection of
other cancers, simple surgeries,

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:11.650
use of those anti-cancer
drugs who have gone off patent

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:13.540
and become feasible for
use in poor countries.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:16.746
So from my point of view emphasizing
prevention and dissemination

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.696
of what can be done, using
the Internet to help us

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:22.213
out in dissemination is
a very important feature

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:25.740
of what we see happening in
the next five to ten years.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.060
Over here?

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.373
&gt;&gt; Audience question: Okay I guess
my question is I worked in the lab

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:34.516
for a while so I understand
that there is some good science

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.830
and some bad science and so...

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:40.756
&gt;&gt; Dr. Varmus: What do
you mean by bad science?

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.096
&gt;&gt; Audience question: Some science
that doesn't follow protocol perhaps

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:48.843
as closely as others do; and so
the results may be somewhat skewed

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.293
and so I see the benefit in having
peer review before publication.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:54.173
&gt;&gt; Dr. Varmus: Nothing I've said

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.373
about open access publication has
anything to do with peer review.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:58.840
Open access publication
is all peer review.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.040
&gt;&gt; Audience question: Oh okay.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.840
But I think that the change

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:04.790
in funding structure during
the Reagan era had some effect

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:11.756
on willingness to share data, and I
wondered if there had been any sort

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.370
of study that has looked
at how that change

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.813
in funding structure
has had an effect.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.073
&gt;&gt; Dr. Varmus: Actually
I'm not sure what change

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.673
in funding structure you're
talking about but I would say

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:24.306
that on the whole the
willingness of scientists

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:26.990
to share data has increased
enormously; and it's increased

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:30.766
in part because of the
kind of science we're doing

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.053
which is much more data intensive,
it requires teams much more often;

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.773
a phenomena which I
think has its own dangers

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:43.450
because sometimes the greatest
moments in science occur

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.006
when a lone scientists is
thinking alone about a problem

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.513
and not working in a team;

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:49.980
but nevertheless there is
much more team science,

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:50.786
much more interaction
among scientists

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.906
of different institutions,
and the nature

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.130
of the science itself
demands more sharing.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:02.876
In addition to that voluntary
willingness to do more as teams,

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:08.076
the NCI and other institutes of the
NIH demand sharing policies as part

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:11.576
of grant applications
and I think that we're

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:12.930
on a good trajectory in that regard.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:14.676
&gt;&gt; Audience question:
Can you talk a little bit

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:19.316
about the funding decisions.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:23.516
How it's decided which programs
get funded and related to that

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:26.503
about publicizing what the NIH does

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:27.580
so you can build support
within the community.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:29.936
&gt;&gt; Dr. Varmus: Right well
on your latter topic,

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:36.516
I think we have pretty good support
from the American community for NIH

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:37.916
and what it does, but it
could be a lot more informed

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.490
and we are responsible
for creating stories

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:44.040
that reflect what we're doing,
explain to the public more fully.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:48.090
And I think the instinct
is to support the NIH

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:54.016
because life expectancy in
this country has improved,

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:54.586
we're the pioneers in the world

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.020
and generating sophisticated
new approaches to healthcare.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.553
And I think the reputation

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.753
of the NIH is strong
but I do agree with you.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:04.883
In fact I was meeting with
some journalists today to talk

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.756
about how the NCI should
sort of redraft its story

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:10.920
so we're not worried day by day
about whether we're winning the war

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:14.870
in cancer, but instead talking
about what has actually happened,

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:22.050
how our understanding of why a
normal cell becomes a cancer cell

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:22.853
can be translated into
new ways to prevent

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.640
and treat and diagnose cancer.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.573
So I agree with those points.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.040
Your first point was?

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.906
&gt;&gt; Audience question: About
the funding decision--

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.440
how do you decide what
programs get funded?

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.800
&gt;&gt; Dr. Varmus: First of all
there's a macro set of decisions.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:37.733
How much does the President ask
Congress to give to the NIH?

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:41.973
How does Congress decide how much
it's going to give to the NIH

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.080
and those are issues
that we participate

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:49.970
in by telling the President

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:50.880
and Congress what we
could do with more money?

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.633
In general, Congress and the
Presidents have been kind

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:57.530
to the NIH; we're probably
among the agencies least likely

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:04.196
to have our budget cut at
a time of verconian cuts

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.676
that are talked about
by both parties.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.800
And but you're asking
about is how do we

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.693
at the Cancer Institute
decide which programs to fund.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:14.240
And that's a complicated process.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.453
Some of its determined simply
by peer review we're saying

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:18.693
that grants better than that grant.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.333
Some of its decided by saying you
know we looked at our portfolio,

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.120
we're not doing anything on cancer
X and there's a new opportunity.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.920
So you've got to weigh
the burden of the disease,

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.460
the public health effects
of the disease

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.973
against first the opportunities
to study that disease specifically

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.616
and importantly against the
opportunities to make end roads

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:44.456
against a certain disease
by studying something

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:47.516
that may not be obvious
to the public.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:49.323
The public says well
ovarian cancer is terrible,

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:51.976
let's invest in ovarian cancer.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:54.643
But it may be that
understanding something

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:58.710
about DNA is repaired
may be more important

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:02.990
and I'm using new facts here to
inform that specific suggestion.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:03.740
Someone's holding in the front row
a sign that says to me overtime.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.353
This is not a football match; you
should not be more excited by that.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:11.556
We have to acknowledge that we're
reached the end of the hour;

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:14.056
other speakers are
lined up behind me.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.623
Thank you very much
for your attention.

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:19.090
