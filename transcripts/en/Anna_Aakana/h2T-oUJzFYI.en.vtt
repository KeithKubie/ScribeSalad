00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:01.990
We've all had, or been,

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.681
toxic friends at one point
or another in our lives.

00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:06.199
But sometimes, it takes you a while

00:00:06.199 --> 00:00:07.730
to recognize who they are,

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.352
or when you're being one.

00:00:09.352 --> 00:00:10.551
There's the "Copycat,"

00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:11.761
Do you like my new outfit?

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.308
I mean, I guess it looks
a little bit like yours.

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:16.412
It's..

00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:18.991
exactly..the same.

00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:21.869
It's..exactly the same.

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:26.490
Are you..copying me?

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.520
Are you..copying me?

00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:32.230
The "Negative Nancy,"

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.729
I can't believe I got that promotion.

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:36.821
So much extra responsibility, so much stress.

00:00:36.821 --> 00:00:38.112
And it's a bunch more money too.

00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:40.537
More money, more problems!
Duh!

00:00:40.537 --> 00:00:41.914
And a bigger office..

00:00:41.914 --> 00:00:42.760
Well, looks like you're gonna spend all

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.699
that extra money on furniture then.

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:45.822
The "Wild Child,"

00:00:45.822 --> 00:00:46.674
Anna: Hey..
Man: No..

00:00:46.674 --> 00:00:47.914
I need a place to lay low, and like,

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:49.359
so does Megan,
(Man stammers)

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.459
and Brad,
Brad: Birdy!

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:52.230
and Kyle..
Man: This guy..

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.113
Anna: And if you could uh..stash this somewhere..

00:00:54.113 --> 00:00:55.828
I'll love you~
(Man screams)

00:00:55.828 --> 00:00:57.081
The "Social Climber,"

00:00:57.081 --> 00:00:58.143
I heard you're like, friends with like,

00:00:58.143 --> 00:00:59.582
a FAMOUS person.

00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:00.382
Can we be friends?

00:01:00.382 --> 00:01:01.173
I like jogging too!

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:01.851
Hi~

00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:03.143
Brad: No, get away from me!

00:01:03.143 --> 00:01:04.760
OMG, that's totally what the friend of

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.612
a famous person would say!

00:01:06.612 --> 00:01:07.791
Besties! Wait up!

00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:09.489
And..the "Drama Queen."

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:10.913
(quotes Hamlet)
To be..

00:01:10.913 --> 00:01:12.459
or not to be..

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:14.174
that is the question.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:15.552
Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind

00:01:15.552 --> 00:01:17.112
to suffer the Slings and Arrows

00:01:17.112 --> 00:01:18.705
of outrageous Fortune..

00:01:18.705 --> 00:01:20.065
It's just a parking ticket.

00:01:20.065 --> 00:01:22.520
Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.291
and by opposing end them:

00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:26.469
What? Wh--You're gonna..fight it in court?

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:27.959
I-It's only $25.

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:28.730
To die,

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.821
You aren't dying..

00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:30.791
To sleep,

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:32.112
Maybe you should take a nap.

00:01:32.112 --> 00:01:33.705
No more..

00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:36.734
What, are you for real finished?

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:38.383
(cries) JUST SHUT UP, YOU GUYS!

00:01:38.383 --> 00:01:39.729
DO YOU KNOW HOW THIS WORKS?!

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:40.730
I TALK,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.019
AND THEN YOU LISTEN

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:43.612
AND THEN YOU SYMPATHIZE

00:01:43.612 --> 00:01:45.199
AND YOU GIVE ME ATTENTION!

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:46.765
(screeches gibberish)

00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:48.413
If you have a toxic friend in your life,

00:01:48.413 --> 00:01:49.475
and talking things out

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:50.612
just isn't gonna work,

00:01:50.612 --> 00:01:51.791
then break it off.

00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:53.112
Pull the plug.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:54.520
Nothing healthy is gonna come from

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.096
that relationship.

00:01:56.096 --> 00:01:57.112
Do it right now.

00:01:57.112 --> 00:01:58.230
Do it RIGHT NOW.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.291
I'll do it right now.

00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:02.322
(softly) We need to talk.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.388
I'd like to thank NuMe
for sponsoring today's episode.

00:02:11.388 --> 00:02:13.459
They sent me a great curling wand set,

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.443
thank you guys!

00:02:14.443 --> 00:02:15.790
It came with all these different like,

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.791
sized wands,

00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:18.581
and I've been a fan of wands forever.

00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:20.321
So it was great to like, try each one,

00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:21.414
and then see the different looks

00:02:21.414 --> 00:02:22.536
that you can get,

00:02:22.536 --> 00:02:23.459
but this one

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.291
was by far my favorite,

00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:25.673
because it gives me such..

00:02:25.673 --> 00:02:27.474
long, gorgeously giant curls

00:02:27.474 --> 00:02:29.688
that bring all the boys to the yard~

00:02:29.688 --> 00:02:31.882
And when you do use the Argan oil,

00:02:31.882 --> 00:02:33.735
I use it as like, a heat protectant.

00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:35.382
It keeps your hair anti-frizz,

00:02:35.382 --> 00:02:37.852
smooth, shiny, and healthy.

00:02:37.852 --> 00:02:39.566
I get all the compliments.

00:03:01.051 --> 00:03:03.050

Then goodbye.
