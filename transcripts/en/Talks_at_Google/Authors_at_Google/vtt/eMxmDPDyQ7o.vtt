[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.290
SPEAKER: So I
think before we get

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.470
into some of the exciting things
that come up in your book,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.890
today was a pretty
big day in astronomy.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.190
There is some news
about a black hole.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.400
Can you talk about that?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.040
MICHIO KAKU: Yes.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.820
A black hole is a
cosmic roach motel.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.390
Everything checks in,
nothing checks out.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.670
And we photographed this.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.690
This is incredible.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.420
History was made
when we actually

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.510
showed a photograph of
a gigantic black hole.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.860
It weighs six and a
half billion, with a B,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.280
billion times more
massive than the sun.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.810
It is 55 million
light years away.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.480
It is a gigantic monster.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.400
And it's sort of like a unicorn.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.690
We physicists knew at some
point this exotic object would

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.890
be found.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.820
Einstein's equations
predicted it in 1916.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.880
We've known for a hundred
years that a black hole

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.930
could be lurking in the
heavens, but we finally--

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.730
we finally photographed it.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.230
And it was revealed
this morning.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.970
Next, in a few weeks,
we'll reveal the black hole

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.430
at the center of the
Milky Way Galaxy.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.240
So tonight, when you go
outside, look in the direction

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.800
of Sagittarius.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.660
There's a raging black hole in
the constellation Sagittarius,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.540
in the center of the
Milky Way Galaxy.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.630
It weighs about two to
four million times more

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.580
massive than the sun.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.810
And it's in our backyard.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.720
So children ask the question--

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.450
if the moon goes
around the Earth

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.910
and the Earth goes
around the sun,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.470
what does the sun go around?

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.200
And the answer
is-- a black hole.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.570
SPEAKER: So you talk about
children asking questions.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.810
And you've talked
about that you had

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.580
a moment when you
were growing up,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.860
of what sparked your
interest in science.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.600
MICHIO KAKU: Yeah, when
I was eight years old,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.100
something happened which
changed my life completely.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.870
They made the
announcement, when I

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.470
was in elementary school, that
a great scientist had died.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.240
And they flashed a picture
in the newspaper of his desk.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.460
And on the desk was a
book, an unfinished book.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.970
And the caption said, this
is the unfinished manuscript

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.190
of the greatest
scientist of our time.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.160
So I was eight years old.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.520
I said to myself, why
couldn't he finish that book?

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.220
It's a homework problem, right?

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.040
Why didn't he ask his mother?

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.200
So, I went to the library.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.640
And I later found out his
name was Albert Einstein.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.470
And that book was "The
Theory of Everything."

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.770
He wanted an equation no
more than one inch long

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.840
that would allow us to,
quote, "Read the Mind of God."

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.800
So I said to myself,
wow, that's for me.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.520
I want to work on this
theory of everything.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.823
And in fact, that's
what I do for a living.

00:03:16.823 --> 00:03:18.240
I'm the co-founder
of string field

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.410
theory, one the main
branches of string theory.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.590
And we think that that is
the theory of everything,

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.750
that everything we see
around us is nothing

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.220
but vibrations of tiny strings.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.390
Each subatomic particle is a
note on a vibrating string.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.700
What is physics?

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.290
Physics is the harmonies we
can write on vibrating strings.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.240
What is chemistry?

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.470
Chemistry is the melodies we
can play on vibrating strings.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.090
What is the universe?

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.980
The universe is a
symphony of strings.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.560
And then what is
the mind of God?

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.450
The mind of God is
cosmic music resonating

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.570
through eleven
dimensional hyperspace.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.590
That is the mind of God.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.138
SPEAKER: I think
for all of us who

00:04:08.138 --> 00:04:09.930
are not theoretical
physicists in the room,

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.110
we appreciate that clarifying
explanation, really

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.001
elegant metaphor as well.

00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:17.459
One of the things
that I found when

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.950
I was sort of thinking about
questions that I might want

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.779
to ask you, or that
might be interesting,

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.983
is that, in looking at
the breadth of your work,

00:04:23.983 --> 00:04:25.650
it's really hard to
know where to start,

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.170
because your work spans an
incredible range of fields

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.250
from the history of
astronomy, to string theory,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.202
to theories of consciousness.

00:04:38.202 --> 00:04:39.660
And so I was going
to ask you, what

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.150
do you feel like is at
the heart of your work?

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.430
If your body of work
were a solar system, say,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.660
what would be the
sun at its center?

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.590
MICHIO KAKU: Well,
when I write books,

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.180
I write for myself as a child.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.160
Because when I was a child
going to the library,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.390
I would look up things
like the fourth dimension,

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.290
like anti-matter, like
parallel universes.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.090
And there was nothing,
absolutely nothing

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.660
in the library for
a young kid who

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.940
wants to know about all
these fantastic things they

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.320
see in the movies.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.540
So I said to myself,
when I grow up,

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.990
and I become a professor
of theoretical physics,

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.150
and I work at the
unified field theory,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.330
I want to write for
myself, as a child.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.950
And then when I
was in high school,

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.780
I decided to put
this into motion.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.280
So I went to my mom one
day, and I said, mom,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.970
can I have permission to build
an atom smasher in the garage?

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.140
SPEAKER: As one does.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.810
MICHIO KAKU: Yeah.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.420
I grew up in Palo
Alto, where a lot

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.840
of young people in their
garages built machines.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.180
So I built a beta-tron
particle accelerator.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.890
I got 400 pounds of transformer
steel, 22 miles of copper wire,

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.290
and I built a
6-kilowatt, 2.3 million

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.490
electron vol beta-tron
in my mom's garage.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.680
I plugged it in finally.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.420
I closed my eyes.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.340
I shut my ears.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.580
And I heard this
huge crackling sound

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.570
as 6 kilowatts of raw power
surged through the capacitor

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.060
bank.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.050
And then I heard this
pop, pop, pop, sound,

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.510
I blew out all the
circuit breakers and fuses

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.550
in the house.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.120
So my poor mom, she'd come
home from a hard day's work

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.610
and say to herself,
why couldn't I

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.840
have a son who plays baseball?

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.065
Maybe if I buy
him a basketball--

00:06:34.065 --> 00:06:35.440
and for God's
sake, why can't you

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.780
find a nice Japanese girlfriend?

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.040
Why does he have to build
these machines in the garage?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.430
But it earned the attention
of another physicist.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.080
A physicist took
an interest in me

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.960
at the National
Science Foundation--

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.070
at the National Science
Fair in Albuquerque.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.110
And he arranged for me to
get a scholarship to Harvard.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.300
His name was Edward Teller,
father of the hydrogen bomb.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.330
SPEAKER: And from
then to now, how

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.930
do you feel like the course
of your career has changed,

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:08.735
or what--

00:07:08.735 --> 00:07:10.360
have your interests
shifted since then,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.450
since that beginning
of you want to solve

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.920
the theory of everything?

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.110
MICHIO KAKU: Yeah,
that's still the goal.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.400
But as a hobby I like
to read science books.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.200
I'm a science junkie.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.420
And I have the privilege
of interviewing

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.960
hundreds of scientists for
BBC Television, the Discovery

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.790
Channel.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.580
And whenever I interview these
scientists-- about one a week,

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.860
for my radio show and TV--

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.950
I always ask them
the key question,

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.780
the question of all questions.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:46.465
And that is-- is there
intelligent life on the earth?

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.800
Well, I was watching the
Kardashians on TV last night.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.930
And I'm convinced that
there's no intelligent life

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.630
on this planet.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.490
But maybe in outer space,
maybe in outer space

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.602
there's intelligent
life out there.

00:08:03.602 --> 00:08:05.060
SPEAKER: So, in
your book, you talk

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.660
about how we might leave
the earth to possibly meet

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.040
intelligent life elsewhere.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.810
MICHIO KAKU: And we may have to.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:15.410
The dinosaurs-- the
dinosaurs did not

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:20.660
have a space program and that's
why they're not here today.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.850
That's why there are not
dinosaurs in this room,

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.110
because they didn't
have a space program.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.130
But we do have a space program.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.400
And prices are
dropping every day.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.539
Things are getting cheaper.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:36.200
Silicon Valley billionaires
are writing checks.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.990
And, for example, how many
people in this room have seen

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.330
the movie, "The Martian"-- raise
your hand-- with Matt Damon?

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.059
Whoa.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.960
That movie cost $100 million.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.580
But the Indian government sent
a probe to Mars for $70 million.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.440
So a Hollywood movie
about going to Mars

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.640
costs more than
actually going to Mars.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.300
That's how much
prices have dropped.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.250
And rockets are going to
be reusable in the future.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.290
When we commute to work, and you
drive your car to work and park

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.130
the car, do you junk your
car and sell it for scrap

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.080
after one trip?

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.300
That's what we do
for rocket ships.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:25.130
We take one trip in a rocket
ship and dump it in the ocean.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.860
You'd bankrupt the
world if every car had

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.920
to be junked after one ride.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.920
That's going to change the
economics of space travel

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.590
when we have reusable rockets.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.080
SPEAKER: So, one thing I
like about your book is

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.130
you've structured it as sort
of like, we're starting with,

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.030
how do we get off the planet?

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.312
How do we colonize
our solar system?

00:09:47.312 --> 00:09:49.520
And then how do we think
beyond that and beyond that?

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.670
So, when someone
asks you, like, well,

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.780
how close are we actually
to living on Mars,

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.287
how do you answer that?

00:09:58.287 --> 00:10:00.620
MICHIO KAKU: Well, first of
all, we're going to the moon

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.390
next year.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.330
After a 50-year gap,
the SLS booster rocket

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.380
is going to be fired up and
we're going to go to the moon.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.230
And not only that, there's
going to be a traffic

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:17.750
jam around the moon, because
Elon Musk has his Falcon Heavy

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.680
rocket capable of going not
just to the moon, but Mars.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.840
He has sent a Tesla sports
car on a trajectory to Mars.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.840
And then we also
have the richest man

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.000
in the world, Jeff Bezos--

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.600
or the former richest
man in the world--

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.840
he has the Neil
Armstrong rocket.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.010
And then the Chinese have
the Long March rocket.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.570
We're going to have a
traffic jam around the moon

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.760
pretty soon.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.750
And I think our grandkids--

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.490
our grandkids may
have the option

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.250
of honeymooning on the moon.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.740
The moon is-- the moon
is only three days away.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.340
It's a hop, skip, and a jump.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:02.110
SPEAKER: So the moon is closer,
Mars is a little bit farther.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.330
So, you talk in your book
about also possibly colonizing

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.320
some of the moons around
Jupiter and Saturn.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.060
How do you imagine
us getting there?

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:16.890
How far-- I mean, is this within
our generation, our lifetime?

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.010
MICHIO KAKU: Well
starting next year,

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.250
we're going back to the
moon with an unmanned space

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.620
probe that will orbit
around the moon.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:30.080
Around 2023, humans will
go back to the moon.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.130
And so we'll begin the process
of making the moon a base,

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.500
to eventually go to Mars.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:43.380
And then SpaceX already has the
preparations for a Mars rocket.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.330
It is a huge rocket, the
biggest one ever conceived.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.510
It's called the BFR,
the biggest rocket.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:59.310
B for Big, R for Rocket,
and F for your imagination.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.630
It's already being built.
So we're already laying out

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.660
the steps to go to Mars.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.970
And when Elon Musk was
a high school student,

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.190
he read the book,
"Foundation" by Isaac Asimov.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.940
How many people have
read the "Foundation"

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.520
series by Isaac Asimov?

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.730
Then you know that that
is a dream of becoming

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.800
a multi planet species.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.260
It's not going to
happen anytime soon.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.590
But we begin the process of
terraforming Mars perhaps

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.360
in this century.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.590
SPEAKER: I love how you talk
a lot about science fiction

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:37.400
and that there's-- that science
fiction has both inspired

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.412
and predicted some of the
technological advances that

00:12:40.412 --> 00:12:42.620
we've seen and some of the
things that we learn about

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.850
our universe.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:47.330
Do you have a favorite
anecdote or story

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.100
of where fact and
fiction have intersected?

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.720
MICHIO KAKU: Well, I'm on radio.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.040
And people call me.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.440
And many times people say,
professor, you're wrong.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.500
You're wrong because the
aliens are already here.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.880
They're not in outer space.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.720
They've already landed
with their flying saucers.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.090
So, I tell them,
well, how do you know?

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.100
And they say, well,
they've been kidnapped,

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.080
kidnapped by flying saucers.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.750
So if any of you have
ever been kidnapped

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:21.490
by a flying saucer, for
God's sake, steal something.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.030
There's no law
against stealing from

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.240
an extraterrestrial
civilization, no law

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.890
whatsoever.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.610
Steal anything-- an alien
chip, an alien hammer,

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:35.310
an alien paperclip,
anything, so you

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.640
have bragging rights about
going into outer space

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.677
on a flying saucer.

00:13:40.677 --> 00:13:41.760
SPEAKER: I like that idea.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.420
Noted.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.270
Not that Google endorses
any kind of that activity.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.270
MICHIO KAKU: But there's
no law against stealing

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.180
from an extraterrestrial
civilization.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.770
SPEAKER: Should there be?

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:53.550
MICHIO KAKU: No.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.400
SPEAKER: No.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.320
So what are the-- once
we've established a presence

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.140
within our solar system, and
we know how to get around,

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.330
what's beyond that?

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.610
MICHIO KAKU: Well,
already we physicists

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.500
are looking at starships.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.070
NASA has a 100 year
starship program.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.830
My colleague, the
former Steven Hawking,

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:21.930
already was responsible for the
break through Star Shot program

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:25.440
to send the first
starship to a nearby star.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.840
It would be the size
of a postage stamp.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.050
It's a chip with a
parachute, inflated

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.440
by a bank of laser beams,
which would accelerate it

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.540
to 20% the speed of light.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.900
And it would reach Alpha
Centauri in 20 years.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.610
And so we are talking about
the first microchip starship

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.440
to take us to the heavens.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.260
And then we physicists have
looked at Ram jet fusion

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.940
engines.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.710
Fusion engines-- of course,
we don't have them yet,

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:55.290
but one day we will--

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.730
Ram jet fusion engines
require no fueling whatsoever.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.000
They scoop up hydrogen in the
forward direction like an ice

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.970
cream cone, burn interstellar
hydrogen in the engine,

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:13.600
and run forever with no
refueling whatsoever.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.100
That's the Ram jet fusion
engine, which could possibly

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.500
take us to the nearby stars.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.010
And then even
beyond that, there's

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:26.940
a possibility of maybe
using a black hole.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.330
And, of course,
just this morning we

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:34.140
had the first picture ever
of a black hole that's

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.720
been revealed to the public.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.590
And what is a black hole?

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.310
A black hole is a
cosmic roach motel.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.400
Everything checks in,
nothing checks out.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.190
And we photographed it.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.410
And there's a
controversy as to what's

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.740
on the other side
of the black hole.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.900
Some people say nothing.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.390
Things just fall in, and
that's the end of the story.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.970
But if you look at
the mathematics,

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:03.120
we have an exact solution
of Einstein's equation,

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:08.250
given by Roy Kerr in 1963,
of a rotating black hole.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.950
A rotating black hole does
not collapse to a dot.

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.100
That's the old
fashioned thinking.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.220
It collapses to a ring,
a ring of neutrons.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.630
And if you fall through the
ring of neutrons vertically,

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.850
you wind up in Wonderland.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.770
You wind up on the
other side of forever.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.130
It's a gateway to a wormhole.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.920
And if you fall
through a second time,

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.930
you wind up on a second
parallel universe.

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.840
So it's sort of like hitting
the up button of an elevator.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.420
You have different floors.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.210
Each time you go to a
different floor, every time

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.810
you go through the gateway.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.010
And then the question
is, is that a solution

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.510
of Einstein's equations?

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.340
And the answer is, yes.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.170
What's the catch?

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:54.390
There's always a
catch someplace.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:59.400
And that is, we don't know
how stable the wormhole is.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.090
That requires us to
go beyond Einstein.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.569
Einstein's equations give
us rotating black holes,

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:09.660
where there's a gateway
to a parallel universe.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.400
That's Einstein's theory.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.760
However, we don't know whether
radiation effects, as quantum

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.530
effects, will destabilize it.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.349
That's where string
theory comes in.

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.579
String theory is
a quantum theory.

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.480
Now we can calculate
quantum corrections

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.470
and calculate the
stability of the wormhole,

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:32.010
but that is still an
active area investigation.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.700
And then the question is, if
you go through the wormhole,

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.390
can you go backwards in time?

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.990
And the answer is, yes.

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:43.777
These things are potentially
time machines as well.

00:17:43.777 --> 00:17:45.360
And then the question
is, what happens

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.900
if you go backwards in time meet
your mother before you're born,

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.030
and she falls in love with you?

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.330
Well you're in deep doo
doo if that happens.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.720
But yeah, the quantum theory
does make possible the fact

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.330
that you might be able to
build a time machine if you

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.085
can stabilize the Kerr metric.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.620
SPEAKER: Did we have
anyone who wanted to ask

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.320
Professor Kaku any questions?

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.940
AUDIENCE: Hi, so, I wanted
to ask about string theory

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:14.510
specifically.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.220
And one of the things that I
understand about string theory,

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.845
is that it's proven very
difficult to find tests,

00:18:18.845 --> 00:18:20.720
to find out whether
string theory is actually

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.890
the way the universe
works, or maybe there's

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:23.630
some other way that
the universe works.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:24.890
And I wanted to
get your thoughts

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.598
on that in sort of a
philosophical level.

00:18:26.598 --> 00:18:29.690
Do you think that
you eventually will

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.690
discover some aspect of string
theory that will be verifiable?

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:34.790
Or do you think that
we're sort of destined

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.970
to have to guess at
some level of what's

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.413
going on at the very most
basic levels of the universe?

00:18:40.413 --> 00:18:42.080
MICHIO KAKU: Well,
first of all, we have

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.700
the mystery of dark matter.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.990
Dark matter holds
the galaxy together.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:48.680
And that's why we're here today.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.800
If there was no dark matter
holding the galaxy together,

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.260
the galaxy would have
disintegrated billions of years

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.530
ago, and we wouldn't be here
to talk about this question.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.510
And then, what is dark matter?

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:03.260
It is invisible
and it has gravity.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.010
If I held it in my hand, it
would seep through my fingers,

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.730
go right to China, reverse
direction in China,

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:14.520
and oscillate between
here and China.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.800
And then what is it?

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.810
The leading candidate
for dark matter

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:23.270
is the photino, the next
octave of the string.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.760
We are the lowest octave
of vibrating strings.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.990
We can fit protons,
neutrons, electrons,

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:33.710
using a very low energy
approximation to string theory.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.500
But string theory has
higher vibrations.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.190
The next vibration
up is the photino.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.420
Photino has mass.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.540
It has gravity, but no
electromagnetic interactions.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.710
It's stable.

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.730
That, we think, is dark matter.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.530
And we hope to create
it with the Large Hadron

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:55.220
Collider or the next
generation beyond that.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.630
Already, the Japanese, the
Chinese, and the Europeans

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.590
are proposing the next step
beyond the Large Hadron

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:04.730
Collider.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.400
The Japanese have the ILC.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.500
It's a linear accelerator.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.950
The Chinese are also proposing
a linear accelerator.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:17.810
And even CERN is proposing the
next generation beyond that.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:21.350
We may find dark matter
in the laboratory,

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:24.080
and that could clinch
it right there.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.270
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.090
AUDIENCE: Hi Professor, what
are your thoughts on quantum

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.020
computing and the future of it?

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.510
And how long you
think Google will

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:37.230
be able to deploy a quantum
computer into our data center?

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:42.140
MICHIO KAKU: Well, as you know,
Moore's Law is slowing down.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.870
Moore's Law is the reason
why we're here today.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.020
If it wasn't for Moore's Law,
there would be no Google.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.190
But it is slowing down.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.570
And it's bumping up against
the quantum principle.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:57.470
Right now, your Pentium chip
has a layer about 20 or so atoms

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.840
across at minimum.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.920
In another 10 or so years,
if you just extrapolate,

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.150
it'll be five atoms across.

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:08.600
When you hit five atoms
across, all hell breaks loose.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.300
The Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle takes over.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.370
You don't know where
the electron is anymore.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:14.570
You get leakage.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.030
And you get heat generation,
so much that you could

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.000
for an egg on a microchip.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.570
Moore's Law is
already slowing down.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.400
You can talk to any
physicists, we're

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.950
beginning to hit
the quantum limit.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:31.370
So we have to go beyond silicon.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.440
In other words, Silicon
Valley could eventually

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:38.060
become a rust belt, like
the Rust Belt of Pittsburgh.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:41.310
Eventually, yes, Silicon Valley
could become a rust belt,

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.870
and we had to go to
the post silicon era.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:49.070
We have to go to
photonic transistors,

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:54.410
molecular transistors, protein
transistors, DNA transistors,

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:58.280
atomic transistors,
photonic transistors.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.990
We physicists are looking
at all sorts of alternatives

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.250
to silicon.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:05.480
But there's a catch.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.410
None of them are ready
yet for prime time.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:15.320
I will put my money on molecular
transistors, like graphene.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.220
We can make a transistor out
of a single atom of carbon.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.670
That's pretty good.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.300
But we cannot machine it.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.840
We cannot mass produce it.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.420
We cannot engineer it.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.070
It's a technical problem.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.670
Quantum computers are
even worse because

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.530
of the de-coherence problem.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.810
I was in Moscow just
a few months ago.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:40.250
I actually met with Medvedev
and the leader of Alibaba.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.860
And yeah, everyone's working
on quantum computers.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:46.560
The Russians are, the Chinese
are, we are, of course.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.550
But there's a
problem, de-coherence.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:53.360
Every time someone
sneezes in a block away,

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.870
the coherence of your
quantum system disintegrates.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:59.150
So I'm not saying
we can't do it.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.330
I'm saying it's
probably decades away.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.240
The turning point is 50 qubits.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.830
If you hit 50 qubits--

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:10.340
quantum bits-- then you
could surpass any known

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.710
digital turing machine.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.780
But how do you go
beyond that yet?

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.380
We don't know because of
the de-coherence problem.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.460
I have friends upon--

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.440
I have friends working on this.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.120
This is a multi-billion
dollar question.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.780
There's going to be
a new Silicon Valley.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.350
A new Silicon Valley emerging
from all this, probably

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:34.250
a quantum valley, and
it's up for grabs.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:37.880
Nobody knows what's
going to replace silicon.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.126
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:23:39.126 --> 00:23:40.820
AUDIENCE: Hi, Professor.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.310
I wanted to ask a general
question about projecting

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.420
or predicting into the future.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.525
So, generally, when sci-fi
writers or futurists

00:23:48.525 --> 00:23:50.150
try to predict into
the future, they'll

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.640
look at the state of
technology or the cutting

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.920
edge around them, or in
the last couple of years,

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.120
and they'll try to
extrapolate forward.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.715
We've already seen that,
like back in the '60s,

00:23:59.715 --> 00:24:02.090
people were predicting that
by now we'd have flying cars,

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.790
and hoverboards, and we'd
be vacationing on the moon.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:10.280
And instead, we're sending
cat pictures across the world.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.630
So, when you're predicting
out into the future, how do

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:18.240
you-- how do you account for
that kind of uncertainty?

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.630
How do you have confidence
in your predictions?

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.255
MICHIO KAKU: Well,
first of all, people

00:24:22.255 --> 00:24:25.250
forget that when they
look at flying cars,

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.890
that was a creation
of cartoonists.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:32.150
Most people's understanding of
the future comes from cartoons.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.790
I'm a physicist,
not a cartoonist.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:38.940
We knew that flying cars would
be hard to do, but possible.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.220
In fact, I was just
in Dubai last month,

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.280
and we are going to
have flying cars.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.530
Dubai is already
in the final stages

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:49.760
of signing contracts for
a fleet of flying cars.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:55.400
So yes, flying cars are coming,
but hoverboards are not.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.680
Hoverboards would violate
the Quantum Principle.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.570
We do not have anti-magnetism,
because the anti particle

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.330
or the photon is the
photon, therefore

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.820
there's no such thing
as anti-magnetism,

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:12.160
or even anti-gravity,
that Michael J Fox can use

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.650
to scoot across a wooden floor.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:18.680
And so, we're not going
to have hoverboards,

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.870
but we will have flying cars.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:22.920
Now, I'm a physicist.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.500
When I try to
project the future,

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.810
first I look at Moore's Law.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:30.940
So I see where we might be
in the coming decades, OK.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.460
And I realize that yes,
artificial intelligence is

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.400
coming, but we're
going to hit a brick

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.030
wall at a certain point,
or perhaps a problem

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:45.580
when Moore's Law is
eventually sealed off

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:51.320
and robots are not going to
become arbitrarily intelligent.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.570
But I'm a physicist.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.090
I realize that with
ingenuity we could make them

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:56.890
smarter and smarter.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:00.580
For example, right now, our most
advanced robot, or one of them,

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.140
is ASIMO.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.960
You've probably seen him on TV.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.020
It's like a little
boy who can run, walk,

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.750
climb up stairs, dance.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:15.480
And I interviewed the creator
of ASIMO for BBC television.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.760
And I asked him, how smart
is the world's smartest

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.490
robot, your robot, ASIMO?

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:23.020
And he was very frank.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:28.190
He said that ASIMO has the
intelligence of a cockroach--

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:33.260
a retarded cockroach-- a
lobotomized retarded cockroach.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.840
But I could see that, yeah,
you could extrapolate.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.480
Eventually, they'll be
as smart as a mouse,

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:45.310
then as smart as a rat,
then as smart as a rabbit,

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:49.150
then as smart as a dog and
cat, and then maybe as smart

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.380
as a monkey.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.930
Now, at that point,
like in science fiction,

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.160
I think they could be dangerous.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:59.950
I think Elon Musk is right,
but in another 100 years.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:03.280
Because monkeys are self-aware.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.200
They know they're monkeys.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.000
They're potentially dangerous.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.400
But dogs, dogs are confused.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.880
Dogs think that we are a dog.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.450
We're the top dog and that's
why they slobber all over us.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.210
They haven't quite
figured it out yet,

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.230
that we're not really dogs.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:25.870
But monkeys, they
have self-awareness.

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:28.220
So how long will it take
before we get robots

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.100
with self-awareness?

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.500
I think maybe by the
end of the century.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.680
At that point, I think we
should put a chip in their brain

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:39.730
to shut them off if they
have murderous thoughts.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:44.860
But again, going to the next
century, the 22nd century now,

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.470
robots will become
self-aware and they'll

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.930
remove the chip in their brain.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:53.950
Then what do we do when there
are no more fail-safe systems?

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:56.680
At that point, I think we
only have one alternative.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:02.340
In a 22nd century, I think
we should merge with them.

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:06.180
Why not become super
man or a super woman?

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:10.963
Why not rule the universe by
merging with our creations?

00:28:10.963 --> 00:28:12.630
That's not going to
happen anytime soon,

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.240
but I'm just simply
projecting Moore's Law,

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.500
projecting known physics
into the next 200 years.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.300
AUDIENCE: OK, thank
you very much.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.800
AUDIENCE: Thank
you, Professor Kaku.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.060
And I have to say that
I'm a big fan of you,

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.810
and I've read many of
your previous books,

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.477
and looking forward
to reading this one.

00:28:28.477 --> 00:28:30.510
And based on-- based on
my previous readings,

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:33.810
you believe that humans
have a very bright future.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.550
With the advancement
of technology,

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.430
we'll gradually conquer the
solar system, and Milky Way,

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:39.332
and beyond.

00:28:39.332 --> 00:28:41.040
But there is the other
stream of theories

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.740
like, they are
really pessimistic

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.420
on the human future.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.243
Like, for example, the
giant filter theory,

00:28:48.243 --> 00:28:49.410
and the great filter theory.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:53.250
Basically, they say that any
advanced civilizations will--

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.470
as they develop,
will sooner or later

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.780
encounter some
very big obstacles.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.310
They call it filters.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:02.040
And be it like meteorites,
or the nuclear war,

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.890
or the advanced of the double
edged sword, the technology.

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.120
So what's your take on this?

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.972
Can we humans really
avoid this to happen?

00:29:09.972 --> 00:29:11.430
MICHIO KAKU: Can
we humans do what?

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.120
Do you understand?

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.740
SPEAKER: Yeah, so I
think the question--

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.157
and correct me if
I get it wrong--

00:29:15.157 --> 00:29:18.090
but I think it's about that you
have a really optimistic view

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.540
of the future.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:23.700
But there are parties who don't
have such an optimistic view,

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:28.670
that believe that we'll succumb
to some great catastrophe.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:30.503
Is that kind of the gist of it?

00:29:30.503 --> 00:29:31.920
AUDIENCE: The great
filter theory.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.710
They say we will become--

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.340
MICHIO KAKU: OK, well, let's
take a look at the long view.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.600
I'm a physicist.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.700
And we like to quantify things--

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.950
dangers, as well as progress--

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:44.910
on the basis of two things--
information and energy.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.160
That's how we
parametrize the future.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.770
When you parametrize the
future in terms of energy,

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:53.990
we rank civilizations by type
one, and type two, type three.

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:57.040
A type one civilization
is planetary.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.920
They control the weather.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.430
They control the oceans,
volcanoes, earthquakes.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:07.260
Planetary civilization
controls planetary energy.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.720
Eventually, they exhaust
the power of planet

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.850
and begin to play with stars.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.870
They create Dyson spheres.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.130
They play with-- they
colonize our solar system.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:18.780
That's type two.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.490
For example, "Star Trek"--

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.670
"Star Trek" would be a
typical type two civilization.

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:25.560
Then there's type three.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.390
Type three is galactic.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.550
They roam the
galactic space lane.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:32.100
They play with black holes.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.250
And "Star Wars" would
be a typical type three

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:36.780
civilization.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.090
And then, by the way, I was
giving this talk in London

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:40.920
once, and a little
boy comes up to me--

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:46.830
10-year-old boy-- and the boy
says, Professor, you're wrong.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:50.610
You're totally wrong,
there's type four.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:53.940
And I was kind of tempted to
say to the kid, shut up, kid.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:58.350
I was polite.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:02.460
I said, look, there are
planets, stars, and galaxies.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.760
That's all there are.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.950
There's no type four.

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:09.750
And he insisted no,
Professor, there's type four--

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:13.150
the power of the continuum.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:15.000
Now who's a "Star
Trek" fan here?

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.010
What is the only type
four civilization

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:18.840
on network television?

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.150
The Q.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.790
That energy is dark energy.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:27.550
There is an energy source
even bigger than galactic.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:30.390
Dark energy is the
energy of the Big Bang.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.120
It's the
anti-gravitational force

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.070
that's creating the
expanding universe.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:40.215
So then the question is, where
are we on this scale of energy?

00:31:40.215 --> 00:31:42.810
Are we type one, that
play with the weather?

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.430
Are we type two,
that play with stars?

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:48.030
Are we type three, that
play with black holes?

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:50.820
No, we're type zero.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.010
We get our energy
from dead plants.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:59.190
But we can calculate when
we will become type one.

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:01.620
And the answer is, in 100 years.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:05.880
Around 2,100, we will
become planetary.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.410
Now, we see that everywhere.

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:09.130
What is the internet?

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:12.960
The internet is the first
type one telephone system.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:18.540
The first type one technology
to fall into the 21st century.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.790
That is what the internet is.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:24.300
What language will the type
one civilization speak?

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:27.870
Well, already on the internet,
English and Mandarin Chinese

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:30.660
are the two-- number one,
number two languages.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.900
We see the beginning of a type
one economy with the European

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:34.700
Union.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.620
We see the beginning
of a type one sports

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.260
with soccer and the Olympics.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.730
We see the beginning
of a type one

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:44.730
fashion with Chanel and Gucci.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:49.260
We see the beginning of a
type one culture spreading

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.390
throughout the planet.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:56.370
But as you pointed out, there
are dangerous things facing us.

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:59.550
A type two civilization
is immortal.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:04.860
Nothing known to science can
kill a type two civilization.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.710
Asteroids could be deflected.

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:10.230
The weather can be altered
so global warming is not

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:12.030
a problem.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.690
Type two civilizations
are immortal.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:18.060
The danger is type
zero to type one.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:21.120
That is the most dangerous
transition of all,

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.450
because we have all this
sectarianism, fundamentalism,

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:28.140
racism, whatever
coming from the swamp.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.140
We just emerged from the swamp.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.560
And we're reaching for type one.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.640
Every time I read
the newspaper, I

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.130
see the birth pangs of
a type one civilization.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:44.580
All the headlines, all
the controversies, I see

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:48.870
are the birth pangs of the birth
of a planetary civilization.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:52.890
And it's not guaranteed
we're going to make it.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:56.970
I think we will, but
there's no guarantee.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:58.670
AUDIENCE: Thank
you, very inspiring.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:33:59.670
AUDIENCE: Hi, Professor.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.740
Thanks for coming
to talk to us today.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.200
There's a book series called,
"The Three Body Problem,"

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.510
that I'm not sure
you're familiar with.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.909
It basically presents
humanity's first encounter

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:10.980
with extraterrestrials.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:15.360
And sort of the
intergalactic diplomacy

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.820
that the book sort of advocates
for is this preemptive strike.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.210
It says that the only way
to stay safe in our universe

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:24.630
is, as soon as we identify
other intelligent life,

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:26.699
you have to destroy
it right away.

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:28.900
I was wondering if you
would agree with that,

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.690
and how you would
recommend we navigate

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.030
these intergalactic
relationships, potentially

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.560
in the future?

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.610
MICHIO KAKU: Well, if you're
walking down a country road

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:42.870
and you bump into an anthill,
do you go down to the ants

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:46.230
and say, I bring you trinkets?

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.270
I bring your beads.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:51.090
I give you nuclear energy.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.480
Take me to your ant Queen.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.699
Or do you have this
politically incorrect urge

00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:59.910
to step on a few of them?

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:03.450
And then the ants, do they have
the idea that they can launch

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:10.500
a pre-emptive strike
against humans by flinging

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.530
their weapons-- little
kernels of rice--

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.540
at us?

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.420
So, like I said, if they can
reach us from outer space,

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:23.130
they're probably type two, or
more than likely, type three.

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:26.490
At that point, they already
have mastered starships.

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:29.610
Type three, you can
access the Planck energy.

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:31.470
The Planck energy is
the energy of which

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:34.770
space and time become unstable.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:37.380
In other words,
wormholes become possible

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.540
for a type three civilization.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.390
You take out a
calculator and calculate.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.730
Growing at 3% per year--

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:46.830
a modest growth in energy--

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:50.620
how long before we
become type three?

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.320
In 100 years, we'll be type one.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.310
In a few thousand years,
we'll be type two.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:00.380
In about 100,000 years,
we'll be type three.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:06.170
And 100,000 years is nothing,
nothing on a cosmic scale.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:08.330
By the time you're type
three, you have access

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:09.770
to the Planck energy.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:13.490
Space and time become unstable.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:15.470
Bubbles begin to form.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:17.990
You can heat up space so
that bubbles begin to form.

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:22.070
These bubbles are gateways,
gateways to other universes.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.290
And you're going to
have a preemptive strike

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:26.760
against these people?

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.270
I don't think so.

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:32.360
Now, are they going
to be dangerous?

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.810
Well, I think we
have not too much

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:40.620
to fear from them,
because what do they want?

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.372
Do they want to
plunder our resources?

00:36:43.372 --> 00:36:45.080
There are lots of dead
planets out there,

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.307
like Mars, that they
can plunder at will.

00:36:48.307 --> 00:36:50.390
So, I think that there's
really no reason for them

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.280
to plunder the earth,
because there's

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.910
plenty of uninhabited
planets out there to plunder.

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:59.120
And for the most part, what
do we have to offer them?

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.800
If you're going to
a forest and you

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:06.410
meet the deer and the squirrels,
do you talk to the squirrels?

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:09.470
Initially, yeah.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:10.790
Good boy.

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:13.095
Yes, you talk to the squirrels.

00:37:13.095 --> 00:37:14.720
But then you lose
interest because they

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.250
don't talk back to you.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:18.890
And even if they did
talk back to you,

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:23.150
do they have a preemtive strike
by throwing acorns at you?

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:27.290
So I think that on that
scale, if they can reach us

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:31.430
from another star, they're
already type two, or more

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:34.520
than likely, type three.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.110
AUDIENCE: Thank you, very much.

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:40.782
AUDIENCE: Do you think we
will ever leave Earth forever?

00:37:40.782 --> 00:37:42.240
MICHIO KAKU: I
think at some point,

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.690
we may have to leave
the Earth forever.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:48.470
In five billion years,
the sun will expand.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:52.130
The mountains will melt.
The oceans will boil.

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:56.570
The sky will be on fire and we
will have the last nice day.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:37:59.540
We have to.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.630
Five billion years from now--
it's the law of physics.

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:06.860
Physics is a death warrant
for intelligent life.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:13.940
And in fact, 99.9% of
all lifeforms go extinct.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.320
How do we prove that?

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.900
Just dig right under your feet.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.730
Right under your
feet are the bones,

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:26.720
the bones of 99.9% of all
species that have ever

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.700
existed on the planet Earth.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.610
Extinction is the norm for life.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:32.600
We forget that.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.570
Extinction is the norm.

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:35.930
We have a brain.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:39.560
We can control our destiny,
but most animals cannot.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.920
And so we forget the fact
that extinction is the norm.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.730
So it's not a
question of if, it's

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:50.990
a question of when we
leave the planet Earth.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.770
There's no choice.

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:54.150
It's the law of physics.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:55.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.620
SPEAKER: Thank you all
so much for coming.

00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:58.850
That's the end of our talk.

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:01.350
And we are just so grateful
to have had you here.

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:02.322
Thank you, so much.

00:39:02.322 --> 00:39:03.530
MICHIO KAKU: OK, my pleasure.

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:05.680
