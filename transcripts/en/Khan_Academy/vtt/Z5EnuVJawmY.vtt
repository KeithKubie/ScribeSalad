00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.120
The Nile River has
overflowed and covered

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.380
its entire surroundings,
except for the tip

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.780
of the Great Pyramid
in Giza, Egypt.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.180
An expedition was sent to find
how high the water had risen.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.590
The people measured the
edge of the pyramid that's

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.890
above the water and found
it was 72 meters long.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.720
So this distance right
over here is 72 meters.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.610
They knew that the
entire length of the edge

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.870
is 180 meters, when
it's not flooded.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.911
So this entire
length is 180 meters.

00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:29.160
They also knew that the
vertical height of the pyramid

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.760
is 139 meters.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.800
So this is 139 meters.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.350
What is the level of the
water above the ground?

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.006
So the ground is right over
here at the base of the pyramid.

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:40.380
And so they want the level of
the water above the ground.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.910
So that's this height, this
height right over here.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.270
So let's just call that h.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.710
We want to figure out what h is.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.450
Round your answer, if necessary,
to two decimal places.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.420
So what do we know, and
what do we not know?

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.230
So they've labeled this
little angle here theta.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.470
And this, of course,
is a right angle.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.757
So this angle here at
the base of the pyramid,

00:00:59.757 --> 00:01:01.590
this is going to be the
complement of theta.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.170
It's going to be 90
degrees minus theta.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.200
And using that
information, we can also

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.570
figure out that this angle up
here is also going to be theta.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.170
If that looks a little
bit strange to you,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.640
let me just draw it out here and
make it a little bit clearer.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.820
If we have a triangle,
a right triangle,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.849
where this angle right over
here is 90 minus theta,

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:27.890
and we wanted to figure
out what this is up here,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.400
let's say this is x.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.980
Well, we could say x
plus 90 minus theta,

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.386
90 degrees minus
theta, plus 90 degrees

00:01:38.386 --> 00:01:40.010
is going to be equal
to-- well, the sum

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.520
of the angles of a triangle
are going to be 180 degrees.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.060
Well, if we subtract 180 from
both sides, so that's 100,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.780
and that's 100.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.440
That's 180 from the
left, 180 from the right.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.640
We get x minus
theta is equal to 0.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.100
Or if you add theta to both
sides, x is equal to theta.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.250
So this thing up here is
going to be theta as well.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.550
So this is also
going to be theta.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.100
And what else do we know?

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.630
Well, we know this is 72.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.949
We know that the
whole thing is 180.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.540
So this is 72, and the
whole thing is 180.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.140
The part of this edge that's
below the water, this distance

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.807
right over here.

00:02:16.807 --> 00:02:18.848
Let me draw it without
cluttering the picture too

00:02:18.848 --> 00:02:19.575
much.

00:02:19.575 --> 00:02:21.020
I'll do it in that black color.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.130
This distance right over
here is going to be 108.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.140
108 plus 72 is 180.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.170
So what does this do for us?

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.840
We need to figure
out this height.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.325
We know that this right over
here is a right triangle.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.340
I could color this in just to
make it a little bit clearer.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.190
This thing in yellow, right
over here is a right triangle.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.030
If we look at that
right triangle,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.710
and if we wanted to solve for
h and solve for h using a trig

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.790
ratio based on this angle
theta right over here,

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.270
we know that relative
to this angle theta,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.790
this side of length h
is an adjacent side.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.190
And this length of
108 right over here

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.950
along the edge,
that's the hypotenuse

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.650
of this yellow triangle
that I just highlighted in.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.390
So which trig ratio involves an
adjacent side and a hypotenuse?

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.885
Well, we just write SOHCAHTOA.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.220
Sine is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.680
That would be this distance
over the hypotenuse.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.020
Cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.750
So we get the cosine of theta is
going to be equal to the height

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.932
that we care about.

00:03:38.932 --> 00:03:40.890
That's the adjacent side
of this right triangle

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.982
over the length of the
hypotenuse, OVER 108.

00:03:44.982 --> 00:03:46.690
Well, that doesn't
help us yet because we

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.910
don't know what the
cosine of theta is.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:49.910
But there's a clue here.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.460
Theta is also sitting up here.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.760
So maybe if we can figure
out what cosine of theta

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.310
is based up here, then
we can solve for h.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.944
So if we look at this data,
what is the cosine of theta?

00:03:58.944 --> 00:04:01.110
And now we're looking at a
different right triangle.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.300
We're looking at this
entire right triangle now.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.600
Based on that entire
right triangle,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.320
what is cosine of theta?

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.150
Well, cosine of
theta, once again,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.360
is equal to adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.980
The adjacent length is this
length right over here.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.519
We already know
that's 139 meters.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.440
So it's going to be
equal to 139 meters.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.790
And what's the length
of the hypotenuse?

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.280
Well, the hypotenuse is
this length right over here.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.990
It's 72 plus 108.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.490
Oh, we already have
it labeled here.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.340
It's 180.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.350
We can assume that
this is an isosceles--

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.600
that this pyramid is
an isosceles triangle.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.300
So 180 on that side
and 180 on that side.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.850
So the cosine is
adjacent-- 139--

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.400
over the hypotenuse,
which is 180, over 180.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.890
And these data
are the same data.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.210
We just showed that.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.560
So now we have cosine
of theta is h/108.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.890
Cosine of theta is 139/180.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.730
Or we could say that h/108,
which is cosine of theta,

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.370
also is equal to 139/180.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.210
Both of these things are
equal to cosine of theta.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.160
Now to solve for h, we just
multiply both sides by 108.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.440
So h is equal to
139 times 108/180.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.150
So let's get our calculator
out and calculate that.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:30.060
So that is going to be 139
times 108, divided by 180,

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.910
gets us to 83.4 meters.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.110
So h is equal to 83.4 meters.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.340
The height of the water is 83.4.
