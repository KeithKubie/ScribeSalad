00:00:00.111 --> 00:00:04.361
We all have sick remedies that we swear by.
I mean, nothing feels better than a hot bowl

00:00:04.361 --> 00:00:09.161
of chicken soup, right? Well, it turns out
that it may actually have an anti-inflammatory

00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:14.071
impact, as it prevents neutrophils, a type
of white blood cell, from moving. And by slowing

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:18.301
down the movement of neutrophils, it prevents
the cells congregating in the lung area, relieving

00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:19.381
congestion.

00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:23.751
But you may have also heard the expression
‘feed a cold, starve a fever’ - so should

00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:29.290
you only eat soup...sometimes? It turns out
this is only half true. In both cases you

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.041
should actually be eating nutrient rich food,
which gives your body the energy to heal itself,

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:38.501
and increases something called gamma interferon
- which is essential for your immunity against

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:40.861
both viral and bacterial infections.

00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:45.931
So why not eat an apple? Because an apple
a day keeps the doctor away, right? Well...to

00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:52.451
a degree! 100 grams of apple contain the same
antioxidant power as 1500 mg of vitamin C,

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:56.010
which has been shown to inhibit the growth
of both liver and colon cancerous tumours.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.440
Their peels, which are rich in flavonoids
are also linked to a reduced risk of coronary

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.711
heart disease. So while it may be associated
with less visits to the doctor, and as a preventative

00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:10.261
medicine for your overall health, it’s impact
on the common cold is still debated.

00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:14.431
So what about just taking lots of Vitamin
C, whether in the form of lemons, other foods,

00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:18.571
or pills? It turns out, in a double blind
study, it didn’t reduce the incidence of

00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:23.721
the common cold. However, it did significantly
reduce the length of colds. This may be due

00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:27.871
to the increased growth in T Cells, which
are white blood cells involved in your immune

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:32.351
response, as well as an increased production
of interferon, which causes virus-infected

00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:35.051
cells to ramp up their anti-viral defenses.

00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:38.611
If you’re in need of some immediate relief
for a cough or sleeping difficulty from a

00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:44.031
respiratory infection, honey has your back!
Known for its antibacterial activity, It increases

00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:48.551
the release of inflammatory cytokines, which
signal cells to repair themselves.

00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:52.651
And garlic? Not only can it ward off vampires,
but it’s been shown to decrease the length

00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:57.141
and severity of cold and flu symptoms. By
increasing the growth of Gamma-Delta-T-Cells

00:01:57.141 --> 00:02:01.391
and Natural-Killer cells, it’s able to pick
up on invading pathogens and remove them more

00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:02.461
effectively.

00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:07.371
Ever try Echinacea? It’s one of the most
popular herbal supplements, and for good reason.

00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:12.131
In a meta-analysis on 14 studies, Echinacea
decreased the odds of developing a cold by

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:18.871
58% and reduced the length of colds by approximately
one and a half days. It works as an anti-inflammatory

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:22.901
and similar to other remedies, influences
cytokine production in the body.

00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:26.951
And while you’re at it, have a drink - with
a little alcohol. Seriously, some studies

00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:31.371
have found that moderate amounts of alcohol
can help boost your immune system. But before

00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:35.681
you crack a bottle open, consider that ‘heavy
drinkers’ were found to have the weakest

00:02:35.681 --> 00:02:36.490
immune systems.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.481
If all else fails, water, rest, and time are
surefire contributors to recovery.

00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:46.100
So which sick remedies are just plain old
false then? We break down the top sick myths you

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.551
