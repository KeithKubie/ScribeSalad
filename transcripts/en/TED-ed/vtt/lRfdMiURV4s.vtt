00:00:07.316 --> 00:00:10.753
You’ve found Leonardo Da Vinci’s 
secret vault,

00:00:10.753 --> 00:00:13.974
secured by a series of combination locks.

00:00:13.974 --> 00:00:17.238
Fortunately, your treasure map 
has three codes:

00:00:17.238 --> 00:00:19.011
1210,

00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:21.753
3211000,

00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:24.104
and… hmm.

00:00:24.104 --> 00:00:25.861
The last one appears to be missing.

00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:29.329
Looks like you’re gonna have 
to figure it out on your own.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.391
There’s something those 
first two numbers have in common:

00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:35.465
they’re what’s called 
autobiographical numbers.

00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:39.979
This is a special type of number 
whose structure describes itself.

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.725
Each of an autobiographical
number’s digits

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:44.527
indicates how many times

00:00:44.527 --> 00:00:49.257
the digit corresponding to that
position occurs within the number.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:52.210
The first digit indicates 
the quantity of zeroes,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.161
the second digit indicates 
the number of ones,

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:59.155
the third digit the number of twos, 
and so on until the end.

00:00:59.155 --> 00:01:02.080
The last lock takes a 10 digit number,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.429
and it just so happens

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:07.869
that there’s exactly one ten-digit
autobiographical number.

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.483
What is it?

00:01:09.483 --> 00:01:13.136
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself!

00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:14.460
Answer in: 3

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.744
Answer in: 2

00:01:15.744 --> 00:01:17.303
Answer in: 1

00:01:17.303 --> 00:01:20.642
Blindly trying different combinations 
would take forever.

00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:24.783
So let’s analyze the autobiographical 
numbers we already have

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:27.381
to see what kinds of patterns we can find.

00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:31.710
By adding all the digits in 1210 together,

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.400
we get 4 – the total number of digits.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.462
This makes sense 
since each individual digit

00:01:37.462 --> 00:01:41.876
tells us the number of times a specific 
digit occurs within the total.

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:44.795
So the digits in our 
ten-digit autobiographical number

00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:47.054
must add up to ten.

00:01:47.054 --> 00:01:49.453
This tells us another important thing –

00:01:49.453 --> 00:01:52.336
the number can’t have 
too many large digits.

00:01:52.336 --> 00:01:53.498
For example,

00:01:53.498 --> 00:01:55.119
if it included a 6 and a 7,

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.758
then some digit would 
have to appear 6 times,

00:01:57.758 --> 00:01:59.764
and another digit 7 times–

00:01:59.764 --> 00:02:02.115
making more than 10 digits.

00:02:02.115 --> 00:02:04.741
We can conclude 
that there can be no more

00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:08.573
than one digit greater than 5 
in the entire sequence.

00:02:08.573 --> 00:02:12.404
So out of the four digits 6, 7, 8, and 9,

00:02:12.404 --> 00:02:15.646
only one – if any-- will make the cut.

00:02:15.646 --> 00:02:18.641
And there will be zeroes in the positions

00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:21.524
corresponding to the numbers 
that aren’t used.

00:02:21.524 --> 00:02:25.697
So now we know that our number
must contain at least three zeroes –

00:02:25.697 --> 00:02:30.398
which also means that the leading 
digit must be 3 or greater.

00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:34.392
Now, while this first digit counts 
the number of zeroes,

00:02:34.392 --> 00:02:40.477
every digit after it counts how many times
a particular non-zero digit occurs.

00:02:40.477 --> 00:02:43.968
If we add together 
all the digits besides the first one –

00:02:43.968 --> 00:02:47.191
and remember, 
zeroes don’t increase the sum –

00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:51.561
we get a count of how many 
non-zero digits appear in the sequence,

00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:53.979
including that leading digit.

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:57.296
For example, 
if we try this with the first code,

00:02:57.296 --> 00:03:00.621
we get 2 plus 1 equals 3 digits.

00:03:00.621 --> 00:03:02.775
Now, if we subtract one,

00:03:02.775 --> 00:03:07.762
we have a count of how many non-zero 
digits there are after the first digit –

00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:09.857
two, in our example.

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:11.701
Why go through all that?

00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:14.322
Well, we now know something important:

00:03:14.322 --> 00:03:19.465
the total quantity of non-zero digits
that occur after the first digit

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:23.598
is equal to the sum of these digits, 
minus one.

00:03:23.598 --> 00:03:27.701
And how can you get a distribution
where the sum is exactly 1 greater

00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:32.043
than the number of non-zero 
positive integers being added together?

00:03:32.043 --> 00:03:35.538
The only way is for one 
of the addends to be a 2,

00:03:35.538 --> 00:03:37.274
and the rest 1s.

00:03:37.274 --> 00:03:38.590
How many 1s?

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.543
Turns out there can only be two –

00:03:40.543 --> 00:03:45.536
any more would require additional 
digits like 3 or 4 to count them.

00:03:45.536 --> 00:03:50.460
So now we have the leading digit of 3 
or greater counting the zeroes,

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.479
a 2 counting the 1s,

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.229
and two 1s –

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.499
one to count the 2s

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:57.969
and another to count the leading digit.

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:59.402
And speaking of that,

00:03:59.402 --> 00:04:02.643
it’s time to find out 
what the leading digit is.

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:06.682
Since we know that the 2 
and the double 1s have a sum of 4,

00:04:06.682 --> 00:04:09.433
we can subtract that from 10 to get 6.

00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:12.653
Now it’s just a matter 
of putting them all in place:

00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:13.654
6 zeroes,

00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:14.656
2 ones,

00:04:14.656 --> 00:04:15.641
1 two,

00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:16.749
0 threes,

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:17.854
0 fours,

00:04:17.854 --> 00:04:18.996
0 fives,

00:04:18.996 --> 00:04:20.196
1 six,

00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:21.365
0 sevens,

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:22.597
0 eights,

00:04:22.597 --> 00:04:24.903
and 0 nines.

00:04:24.903 --> 00:04:28.183
The safe swings open, 
and inside you find...

00:04:28.183 --> 00:04:31.304
Da Vinci’s long-lost autobiography.
