00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.319
What’s ten times stronger than nuclear fusion!!?
QUARK FUSION!!

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.500
The particles that make up the neutrons and
protons inside of atoms are known as quarks.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.140
And researchers found that when quarks bind
together, energy is produced.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.130
Scientists have already been smashing together
particles at the Large Hadron Collider but

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.890
that’s been with hydrogen atoms, not quarks.
At the Large Hadron Collider, particles are

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.190
zooming through a a 27 km long ring at near
the speed of light. When particles collide

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.600
scientists are poised to collect lots of data.
And sometimes in the data strange particles

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.550
will emerge.. Totally unexpectedly! And this
precisely what happened when what’s known

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.430
as a “doubly charmed baryon” emerged in
2016. It was made up of two charm quarks!

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.450
This publishing of their paper, lead other
researcher to drawing calculations of just

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.290
how much energy would be needed to fuse these
quarks together... AND how much energy would

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.280
be released. They found, it would take about
130 MeV to fuse the collision of the charm

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.400
quarks. But wait- there’s more!
More researchers theorized that if they fused

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.380
a different type of quark -- a heavier bottom
quark -- it may produce around 138 MeV … which

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.960
is about 8 times more energy than fusing hydrogen
(aka what powers hydrogen bombs)! That’s

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.619
a lot of energy!
Of course, you shouldn’t worry about bombs

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.200
because the scientists say these types of
quarks won’t live long enough after a collision

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.320
for a chain reaction to happen. In other words,
they decay too quickly and won’t be usable

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.840
for weapons.
Scientists DO say it’s technically possible

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.390
to create this fusion with the Large Hadron
Collider and there may be a good chance that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.040
in the next couple of years this study will
go into action. But before you dream about

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.080
a fusion future…Many scientists don't think
this will ever work

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.520
Also the amount of energy it'll take to even

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.410
combine these together is so high that the
energy getting out of it won't be significantly

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.280
much more.
Current clean energy systems are generating

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.200
a good amount of energy but with quark fusion,
if scientists can develop a technology to

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.720
make it a reality--
Well then we’ll be talking!

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.670
Trace actually went to the Large Hadron Collider
a while back, and met scientists making Antimatter

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.790
-- learn how they do it, in this video.
Do you think we should keep working to see

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.099
if quark fusion could be a thing? Or should
we focus on other clean technologies?

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.999
