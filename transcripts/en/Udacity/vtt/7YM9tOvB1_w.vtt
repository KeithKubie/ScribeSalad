You can track exceptions and
crashes in Google Analytics.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.220
So in the dashboard, you would go to
Behavior &gt; Crashes and Exceptions.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.560
And the exceptions are grouped
by the app version number.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.340
You could drill down with
the different version numbers.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.050
And see, I had a NoSuchMethodException
and a NumberFormatException.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.860
So you can track caught exceptions and
uncaught exceptions.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.650
So to track exceptions that get caught,
you need to send an exception hit.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.940
And you use ExceptionBuilder to build
a hit, and you set the description and

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.600
you setFatal, whether or
not it's fatal, and that's boolean.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.720
And then you build the hit and send it.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.770
And for uncaught exceptions,
you can't add code,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.655
obviously, because you don't know where
in the code the exceptions occur.

00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:52.565
However, you can enable automatic
tracking for uncaught exceptions.

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:57.845
And to do this you set
ga_reportUncaughtExceptions

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:01.430
to true in the tracker config file.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.709
I just want to mention that there have
been some issues about sending hits for

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.140
uncaught exceptions.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.180
The issue tracker links in
the instructor notes below and

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.830
I leave it to you to setup tracking for
exceptions if you want.
