00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.007
Five years ago, I stood on the TED stage,
and I spoke about my work.

00:00:17.373 --> 00:00:18.676
But one year later,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.393
I had a terrible accident as I left a pub
one dark night with friends,

00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:23.846
in Scotland.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.568
As we followed the path through a forest,
I suddenly felt a massive thud,

00:00:28.592 --> 00:00:29.972
then a second thud,

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:31.663
and I fell to the ground.

00:00:31.687 --> 00:00:33.671
I had no idea what had hit me.

00:00:34.211 --> 00:00:38.633
I later found out that when
the gate was opened on a garden,

00:00:38.657 --> 00:00:43.422
a wild stag stampeded along the path
and ran straight into me.

00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:47.447
Its antler penetrated my trachea
and my esophagus

00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:50.366
and stopped at my spinal cord
and fractured my neck.

00:00:51.502 --> 00:00:53.751
My best friend found me
lying on the floor,

00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:56.283
gurgling for help
through a hole in my neck.

00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:59.323
And we locked eyes,
and although I couldn't speak,

00:00:59.347 --> 00:01:01.363
she could understand what I was thinking.

00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:04.080
And she told me, "Just breathe."

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.720
And so, whilst focusing on my breath,
I had a strong sense of calmness,

00:01:08.744 --> 00:01:11.113
but I was certain that I was going to die.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:12.781
Somehow, I was content with this,

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.918
because I've always tried
to do my best in life whenever I can.

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:19.141
So I just continued to enjoy each breath
as one more moment --

00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:21.241
one breath in and one breath out.

00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:24.162
An ambulance came,
I was still fully conscious,

00:01:24.186 --> 00:01:27.415
and I analyzed everything on the journey,
because I'm a scientist:

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.788
the sound of the tires on the road,
the frequency of the street lights

00:01:30.812 --> 00:01:32.751
and eventually, the city street lights.

00:01:32.775 --> 00:01:35.030
And I thought, "Maybe I will survive."

00:01:35.054 --> 00:01:36.799
And then I passed out.

00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:42.268
I was stabilized at a local hospital
and then airlifted to Glasgow,

00:01:42.292 --> 00:01:45.711
where they reconstructed my throat
and put me in a coma.

00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:49.960
And while I was in the coma,
I had many alternate realities.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:53.617
It was like a crazy mix
of "Westworld" and "Black Mirror."

00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:55.707
But that's a whole other story.

00:01:56.165 --> 00:01:59.819
My local TV station reported live
from outside the hospital

00:01:59.843 --> 00:02:03.288
of a Cambridge scientist
who was in a coma,

00:02:03.312 --> 00:02:07.071
and they didn't know
if she would live or die or walk or talk.

00:02:07.855 --> 00:02:10.874
And a week later,
I woke up from that coma.

00:02:12.163 --> 00:02:14.069
And that was the first gift.

00:02:14.093 --> 00:02:17.244
Then I had the gift to think,
the gift to move,

00:02:17.268 --> 00:02:19.310
the gift to breathe

00:02:19.334 --> 00:02:21.457
and the gift to eat and to drink.

00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:23.769
That took three and a half months.

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.887
But there was one thing
that I never got back, though,

00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:28.640
and that was my privacy.

00:02:28.664 --> 00:02:31.474
The tabloid press
made the story about gender.

00:02:31.498 --> 00:02:34.617
Look -- I'm transgender,
it's not that big a deal.

00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:38.714
Like, my hair color or my shoe size
is way more interesting.

00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:40.847
When I last spoke here --

00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:42.022
(Applause)

00:02:42.046 --> 00:02:43.245
When I last spoke here --

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.434
(Applause)

00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:47.168
at TED, I didn't talk about it,
because it's boring.

00:02:47.727 --> 00:02:50.806
And one Scottish newspaper
ran with the headline:

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.393
"Sex Swap Scientist Gored by Stag."

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:55.640
And five others did similar things.

00:02:55.664 --> 00:02:57.418
And for a minute, I was angry.

00:02:57.442 --> 00:02:59.649
But then I found my calm place.

00:02:59.673 --> 00:03:02.839
And what ran through my head was,
"They've crossed the wrong woman,

00:03:02.863 --> 00:03:05.132
and they're not going to know
what's hit them."

00:03:05.156 --> 00:03:06.898
(Laughter)

00:03:06.922 --> 00:03:08.129
I'm a kindness ninja.

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:09.998
I don't really know what a ninja does,

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:13.206
but to me, they slip through the shadows,
crawl through the sewers,

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.660
skip across the rooftops,

00:03:14.684 --> 00:03:16.696
and before you know it,
they're behind you.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.971
They don't turn up
with an army or complain,

00:03:18.995 --> 00:03:20.757
and they're laser-focused on a plan.

00:03:20.781 --> 00:03:22.584
So when I lay in my hospital bed,

00:03:22.608 --> 00:03:25.633
I thought of my plan
to help reduce the chances

00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:27.506
of them doing this to somebody else,

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.592
by using the system as is, and paying
the price of sacrificing my privacy.

00:03:32.616 --> 00:03:36.503
What they told one million people,
I will tell 10 million people.

00:03:36.887 --> 00:03:39.361
Because when you're angry,
people defend themselves.

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:40.745
So I didn't attack them,

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.273
and they were defenseless.

00:03:42.297 --> 00:03:46.258
I wrote kind and calm letters
to these newspapers.

00:03:46.282 --> 00:03:49.536
And The Sun newspaper,
the kind of "Fox News" of the UK,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.196
thanked me for my "reasoned approach."

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:56.569
I asked for no apology,
no retraction, no money,

00:03:56.593 --> 00:03:59.172
just an acknowledgment
that they broke their own rules,

00:03:59.196 --> 00:04:01.579
and what they did was just wrong.

00:04:03.022 --> 00:04:06.646
And on this journey,
I started to learn who they are,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.939
and they began to learn who I am.

00:04:08.963 --> 00:04:10.773
And we actually became friends.

00:04:10.797 --> 00:04:14.582
I've even had a few glasses of wine
with Philippa from The Sun since then.

00:04:15.273 --> 00:04:17.637
And after three months, they all agreed,

00:04:17.661 --> 00:04:19.813
and the statements
were published on a Friday,

00:04:19.837 --> 00:04:21.225
and that was the end of that.

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:22.496
Or so they thought.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.597
On the Saturday,
I went on the evening news,

00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:29.858
with the headline "Six National
Newspapers Admit They Were Wrong."

00:04:29.882 --> 00:04:31.386
And the anchor said to me,

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.781
"But don't you think
it's our job as journalists

00:04:33.805 --> 00:04:35.595
to sensationalize a story?"

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:40.389
And I said, "I was laying
on a forest floor, gored by a stag.

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:41.976
Is that not sensational enough?"

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.722
(Laughter)

00:04:44.746 --> 00:04:46.514
And I was now writing the headlines.

00:04:46.538 --> 00:04:48.164
My favorite one was,

00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:52.418
"The stag trampled on my throat,
and the press trampled on my privacy."

00:04:52.442 --> 00:04:55.712
It was the most read piece
of BBC News online that day.

00:04:55.736 --> 00:04:57.489
And I was kind of having fun.

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.157
And by the end of my week of media,

00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:03.061
I started to use my newfound
voice and platform

00:05:03.085 --> 00:05:05.243
to spread a message of love and kindness.

00:05:05.608 --> 00:05:08.672
And when I had the minute
of anger and hatred

00:05:08.696 --> 00:05:10.522
towards those press and journalists,

00:05:10.546 --> 00:05:14.500
I had to identify my inner
bigotry towards them.

00:05:15.188 --> 00:05:17.648
And I had to meet and speak
with these people

00:05:17.672 --> 00:05:18.822
without judgment.

00:05:19.482 --> 00:05:21.625
I had to let myself understand them,

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:24.363
and in return, they began
to understand me.

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.823
Well, six months later, they asked me
to join the committee

00:05:27.847 --> 00:05:29.513
that regulates the press.

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:34.210
And a few times a year,
I sip tea and dip biscuits

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:37.653
with the likes of Daily Mail editor
Paul Dacre, who says to me,

00:05:37.677 --> 00:05:40.307
"So, Kate, how have
your last few months been?"

00:05:40.863 --> 00:05:42.184
And I respect them.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.673
And I'm now one of three
members of the public

00:05:44.697 --> 00:05:46.276
who has a seat at the table --

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.887
not because I'm different,

00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:51.103
but because my voice counts,
just like anybody else.

00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:53.021
And the irony is,

00:05:53.045 --> 00:05:56.005
every now and again, I'm asked
to visit those printing presses

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:57.895
of this declining industry,

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.451
because some people think

00:05:59.475 --> 00:06:04.678
that the technology I spoke about here,
last time at TED, my interactive print,

00:06:04.702 --> 00:06:06.610
might actually help save them.

00:06:07.053 --> 00:06:09.747
So beware of your inner bigot,

00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:12.222
and make friends from your enemies.

00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:13.405
Thank you.

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:16.889
(Applause)
