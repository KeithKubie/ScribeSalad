00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.540
- Hello, this is Sal
Khan of the Khan Academy.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.250
I'm here with David
Coleman who's president

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.350
of the College Board and
we're excited to together

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.100
announce the first launch
of our collaboration

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.320
between the College Board
and the Khan Academy

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.620
to create the first ever
official SAT preparation

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.890
for the new SAT.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.890
And what I'm personally
really excited about

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.410
is that this is a very different SAT.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.330
It's much simpler, it's much more focused

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.962
on the things that students
actually learn in school.

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:33.650
The vocabulary is vocabulary
that you would actually

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.230
use in life as opposed
to these kind of crazy,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.140
classic SAT words.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.060
- When we redesigned the SAT,
starting three years ago,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.090
our whole aim actually was
to put students more at ease.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.010
We eliminated the penalty for
wrong answers, as you know.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.470
We want students to be able
to do their personal best

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.370
on the exam to show what they know

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.870
and it's also why we partnered
with you with Khan Academy,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.770
to provide the best, world
class, free test preparation

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.040
in the world, right here, working together

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.170
close with you to make sure it focuses

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.570
on what the exam measures
and helps kids advance.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.800
So I think what's so
exciting about Khan has done

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.440
is whatever level of
performance students are at,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.160
whether they're behind in math,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.860
even far behind in math, they can start

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.490
with where they're confident and strong

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.638
and build on those strengths
to get more and more ready

00:01:16.638 --> 00:01:20.400
for PSAT, for SAT, and
really ready for college

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.470
and career readiness
'cause that's the core now

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.640
of what those exams measure.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.740
- Yeah, and what I wanna
stress for everyone is

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.040
a lot of what we've been focused on

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.729
with our team here at Khan Academy,

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.729
as software engineers,
the designers, scientists,

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.040
have been working on a
personalization platform

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.320
where students go, they can
take some practice tests,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.780
some practice questions,
and then based on that,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.390
the software is trying to say,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.420
well what's the next best
thing they should work on

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.030
to get more practice so that they can

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.750
advance in the best possible way.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.840
So there's really no reason why someone

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.140
should feel intimidated.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.600
It's all stuff that they've seen in school

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.433
and they're gonna be able to get

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:57.730
as much practice as they need.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.049
- So go for it and do your best.

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.049
- All right.
