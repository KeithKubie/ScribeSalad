&gt;&gt; Hello YouTubers.
I'm joining you today to tell you about a

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.100
meeting we have in May at the Dead Sea in
Jordan, mid-May 15th, 16th, 17th, where we

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.150
will be talking about many of the important
questions that the Arab world is facing.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.730
Now one important one I'd like your help on
is to help us discuss and to see how role

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.570
models can make a difference in the Middle
East.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.619
We have one question I'd like you to answer
by uploading your videos, and that is

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:36.269
What are the important qualities that a leader
from business, from science, and from young,

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.899
or the young population, the youth should
have to make a difference in the future of

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.899
the Middle East.
Please upload your views and your responses

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.399
on that, and we will take these responses
to the Dead Sea and share them with our participants,

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.369
and they'll become part of the discussion
we have there.

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:59.109
To get a feeling from all of you on how important
you think this subject is, please respond

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:07.299
to our poll by saying yes or no to the question
Do you think role models are important for

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.780
the future of the Middle East?
Thank you for your views and your contributions,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.620
I look forward to receiving them.
We will take them and discuss them and will

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.420
come back to you also after the meeting in
May.
