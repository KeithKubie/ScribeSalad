is born and we do this work both because
 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.090
is born and we do this work both because
we're really interested in this

and then trying to see through a use of
of this population to see something

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080
of this population to see something
 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.750
of this population to see something
about the nature of hope to try and

about the nature of hope to try and
 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.490
about the nature of hope to try and

at the level of not just one individual

at the level of not just one individual

at the level of not just one individual
but in this case a couple or family and

but in this case a couple or family and
 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.730
but in this case a couple or family and
emerging family we have three premises

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740
emerging family we have three premises
 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.560
emerging family we have three premises
that guide our work two of them are

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570
that guide our work two of them are
 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.210
that guide our work two of them are
already underway and the third one is

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220
already underway and the third one is
 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.710
already underway and the third one is
more of a future direction that we're

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720
more of a future direction that we're
 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.620
more of a future direction that we're
hoping to to pursue the two that are

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630
hoping to to pursue the two that are
 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.500
hoping to to pursue the two that are
underway are looking at hope is more

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510
underway are looking at hope is more
 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.900
underway are looking at hope is more
than just a stable quality and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910
than just a stable quality and
 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.370
than just a stable quality and
individual characteristic that

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380
individual characteristic that
 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.250
individual characteristic that
differentiates one person from another

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260
differentiates one person from another
 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.440
differentiates one person from another
or maybe one couple from another and

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450
or maybe one couple from another and
 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.040
or maybe one couple from another and
instead recognizing that hope has this

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050
instead recognizing that hope has this
 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.970
instead recognizing that hope has this
fluctuating component to it that it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980
fluctuating component to it that it
 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.730
fluctuating component to it that it
could change over time that there are

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740
could change over time that there are
 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.410
could change over time that there are
ways in which the stability or

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420
ways in which the stability or
 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.960
ways in which the stability or
instability in it beyond just its set

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970
instability in it beyond just its set
 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.880
instability in it beyond just its set
level it could be really interesting and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890
level it could be really interesting and
 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.550
level it could be really interesting and
important this dynamic quality of hope

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560
important this dynamic quality of hope
 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.410
important this dynamic quality of hope
is one thing we're looking at and we do

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420
is one thing we're looking at and we do
 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.020
is one thing we're looking at and we do
that by having these partners these

that by having these partners these
 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.200
that by having these partners these
couples tell us about their hope

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210
couples tell us about their hope
 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.960

feelings and to impute feelings about
 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.670
feelings and to impute feelings about
their partner so that we'll be able to

see how these things change from moment

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690
see how these things change from moment
 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.190
see how these things change from moment
to moment so that's one premise or one

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200
to moment so that's one premise or one
 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.890

individual characteristic that there's
 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.070
individual characteristic that there's
something about it that could be

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080
something about it that could be
 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.680
something about it that could be
interesting to explore to understand at

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690
interesting to explore to understand at
 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.750
interesting to explore to understand at
the level of a system dyad in this case

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760
the level of a system dyad in this case
 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.770
the level of a system dyad in this case
a pair of people we're curious whether

a pair of people we're curious whether
 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.690
a pair of people we're curious whether
hope is contagious for that you need

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700
hope is contagious for that you need

hope is contagious for that you need
these two people's reports of their own

these two people's reports of their own
 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.380
these two people's reports of their own
hopes to see whether one person's hope

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390
hopes to see whether one person's hope
 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.020
hopes to see whether one person's hope
affects the other over time we were

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030
affects the other over time we were
 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.190
affects the other over time we were
wondering whether it's compensatory

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200
wondering whether it's compensatory
 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.830
wondering whether it's compensatory
whether the the presence of hope for one

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840
whether the the presence of hope for one
 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.550
whether the the presence of hope for one
could carry the day carry them through

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560
could carry the day carry them through
 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.120
could carry the day carry them through
difficult periods like the sleepless

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130
difficult periods like the sleepless
 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.560
difficult periods like the sleepless
days that come after birth or the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570
days that come after birth or the
 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.900
days that come after birth or the
prepartum period where there's often a

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910
prepartum period where there's often a
 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.310
prepartum period where there's often a
lot of anxiety but what this will be

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320
lot of anxiety but what this will be
 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.070
lot of anxiety but what this will be
like what parenting will become like is

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080
like what parenting will become like is
 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.870
like what parenting will become like is
it enough for one person to have hope

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880
it enough for one person to have hope
 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.240
it enough for one person to have hope
for both partners or do we really need

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250
for both partners or do we really need
 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.970
for both partners or do we really need
it to be high for both those are two

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980
it to be high for both those are two
 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.890
it to be high for both those are two

least in part we're still waiting for

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880
least in part we're still waiting for
 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.930
least in part we're still waiting for
the last of those couples in our sample

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940
the last of those couples in our sample
 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.660
the last of those couples in our sample
to complete the three months and six

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670
to complete the three months and six
 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.150
to complete the three months and six
months postpartum but thankfully all the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160
months postpartum but thankfully all the
 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.560
months postpartum but thankfully all the
people that we recruited in this study

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570
people that we recruited in this study
 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.840
people that we recruited in this study
have by now given birth to healthy

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850
have by now given birth to healthy
 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:05.220
have by now given birth to healthy
babies which was a relief and and we've

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230
babies which was a relief and and we've
 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.320
babies which was a relief and and we've
been starting to look at the data mostly

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330
been starting to look at the data mostly
 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.420
been starting to look at the data mostly
from the pre pardon phase at this point

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430
from the pre pardon phase at this point
 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.190
from the pre pardon phase at this point
so the data before the child was born

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200
so the data before the child was born
 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.560
so the data before the child was born
and we saw some interesting things

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570
and we saw some interesting things
 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.750
and we saw some interesting things
already one of them is that it seems

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760
already one of them is that it seems
 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.670
already one of them is that it seems
that it's the expectant mothers hope

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680
that it's the expectant mothers hope
 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.110
that it's the expectant mothers hope
much more so than the expectant fathers

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120
much more so than the expectant fathers
 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.350
much more so than the expectant fathers
that seems to have effect both for

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360
that seems to have effect both for
 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.730
that seems to have effect both for
themselves so for the these expectant

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740
themselves so for the these expectant
 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.200
themselves so for the these expectant
mothers themselves

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210
mothers themselves
 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.340
mothers themselves
their sense of relationship satisfaction

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350
their sense of relationship satisfaction
 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.939
their sense of relationship satisfaction
their sense of well-being in the world

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949
their sense of well-being in the world
 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.379
their sense of well-being in the world
was tied to their own hope but so was

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389
was tied to their own hope but so was
 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.020
was tied to their own hope but so was
their partners so the women's Hope

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030
their partners so the women's Hope
 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.939
their partners so the women's Hope
seemed to have both a direct effect on

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949
seemed to have both a direct effect on
 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.219
seemed to have both a direct effect on
their own feelings well-being

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229
their own feelings well-being
 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.260
their own feelings well-being
satisfaction and on their partners and

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270
satisfaction and on their partners and
 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.510
satisfaction and on their partners and
we didn't find the counterpart effect

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520
we didn't find the counterpart effect
 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.610
we didn't find the counterpart effect
from the men's hope in other words

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620
from the men's hope in other words
 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.129
from the men's hope in other words
there's something about this period

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139
there's something about this period
 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.200
there's something about this period
maybe and we'll have to see whether it's

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210
maybe and we'll have to see whether it's
 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.010
maybe and we'll have to see whether it's
just this period that gives extra weight

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020
just this period that gives extra weight
 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.820
just this period that gives extra weight
to hope on these expectant mothers more

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830
to hope on these expectant mothers more
 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.560
to hope on these expectant mothers more
than the expected father's side one of

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570
than the expected father's side one of
 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.879
than the expected father's side one of
the things we want to explore is whether

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889
the things we want to explore is whether
 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.830
the things we want to explore is whether
this will shift maybe even maybe even

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840
this will shift maybe even maybe even
 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.820
this will shift maybe even maybe even
flip over or at least balance itself out

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830
flip over or at least balance itself out
 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.260
flip over or at least balance itself out
postpartum we think it might we think

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270
postpartum we think it might we think
 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.279
postpartum we think it might we think
that there's something about the kind of

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289
that there's something about the kind of
 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.510
that there's something about the kind of
experience that expectant mothers have

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520
experience that expectant mothers have
 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.029
experience that expectant mothers have
that just by the sheer fact that they

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039
that just by the sheer fact that they
 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.629
that just by the sheer fact that they
are the one carrying the baby that makes

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639
are the one carrying the baby that makes
 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.640
are the one carrying the baby that makes
them much more connected to thinking

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650
them much more connected to thinking
 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.140
them much more connected to thinking
about what parents would be like

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150
about what parents would be like
 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.969
about what parents would be like
thinking about the baby and that the

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979
thinking about the baby and that the
 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.180
thinking about the baby and that the
father's in a sense may not be quite

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190
father's in a sense may not be quite
 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.460
father's in a sense may not be quite
getting it until after childbirth

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470
getting it until after childbirth
 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.230
getting it until after childbirth
happens after they become parents so

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240
happens after they become parents so
 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.279
happens after they become parents so
we're expecting that something will

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289
we're expecting that something will
 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:39.960
we're expecting that something will
change with this postpartum and it may

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970
change with this postpartum and it may
 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.990
change with this postpartum and it may
be that the greater exhaustion that that

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000
be that the greater exhaustion that that
 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.860
be that the greater exhaustion that that
new mothers seem to have may wash out

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870
new mothers seem to have may wash out
 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.390
new mothers seem to have may wash out
this effect of hope maybe there won't be

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400
this effect of hope maybe there won't be
 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.189
this effect of hope maybe there won't be
much hope we do see some drops in hope

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199
much hope we do see some drops in hope
 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.839
much hope we do see some drops in hope
postpartum from what we've peaked at but

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849
postpartum from what we've peaked at but
 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.560
postpartum from what we've peaked at but
really it's too early to tell whether

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570
really it's too early to tell whether
 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.290
really it's too early to tell whether
whether it's really a serious drop or

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300
whether it's really a serious drop or
 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.510
whether it's really a serious drop or
just a minor drop in hope levels okay so

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520
just a minor drop in hope levels okay so
 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.749
just a minor drop in hope levels okay so
these two premises that we've been

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759
these two premises that we've been
 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.890
these two premises that we've been
exploring in data are that hope

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900
exploring in data are that hope
 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.990
exploring in data are that hope
fluctuates that it's dynamic and that

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000
fluctuates that it's dynamic and that
 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.930
fluctuates that it's dynamic and that
hope is a quality of the couple that

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940
hope is a quality of the couple that
 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.120
hope is a quality of the couple that
it's dyadic we have a third premise but

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130
it's dyadic we have a third premise but
 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.140
it's dyadic we have a third premise but
that's one that we're going to be

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150
that's one that we're going to be
 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.879
that's one that we're going to be
exploring in our next project we're

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889
exploring in our next project we're
 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.310
exploring in our next project we're
really interesting to see whether we're

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320
really interesting to see whether we're
 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.740
really interesting to see whether we're
really interested to see whether hope is

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750
really interested to see whether hope is
 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.899
really interested to see whether hope is
malleable whether we can change it and

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909
malleable whether we can change it and
 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:26.909
malleable whether we can change it and
to do that we're planning a study that

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919
to do that we're planning a study that
 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.990
to do that we're planning a study that
applies some research on mental imagery

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000
applies some research on mental imagery
 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.640
applies some research on mental imagery
hope is a strong imagery component as

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650
hope is a strong imagery component as
 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.640
hope is a strong imagery component as

this festival have talked about there's
 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:39.779
this festival have talked about there's
a daydreaming component there's an

a daydreaming component there's an
 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.399
a daydreaming component there's an
imaginal component

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:41.409
imaginal component
 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:43.079
imaginal component
to hope and we are emphasizing this

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:43.089
to hope and we are emphasizing this

our work we want to see whether we can

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:47.409
our work we want to see whether we can
 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:49.889
our work we want to see whether we can
train people in this case couples to

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:49.899
train people in this case couples to
 

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:52.259
train people in this case couples to
imagine their desired outcomes these

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:52.269
imagine their desired outcomes these
 

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:54.600
imagine their desired outcomes these
things that they hope for in a more or

doing this as a randomized study where
 

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:02.369
doing this as a randomized study where
some of the couples receive this I think

00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:02.379
some of the couples receive this I think
 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:04.649

let's imagine the future and let's think
 

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:07.949
let's imagine the future and let's think
about these positive outcomes that that

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:07.959
about these positive outcomes that that
 

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:11.600
about these positive outcomes that that
will happen which on the face of it

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610
will happen which on the face of it

will happen which on the face of it
sounds like would be a way to increase

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:14.289
sounds like would be a way to increase
 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:17.159
sounds like would be a way to increase
hope but in reality is going to be or we

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:17.169
hope but in reality is going to be or we

a different kind of intervention where

a different kind of intervention where

a different kind of intervention where
we have to imagine these desired

00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:22.749
we have to imagine these desired
 

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:24.359
we have to imagine these desired
outcomes but we also have them imagine

outcomes but we also have them imagine
 

00:07:24.369 --> 00:07:26.189
