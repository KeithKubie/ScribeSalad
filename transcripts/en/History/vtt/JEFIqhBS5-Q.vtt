00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:06.506
year in American car culture.

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.641
Ford was poised to roll
out a car that would bring

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.010
more affordable
muscle to the masses,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.112
thanks largely to one man.

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:19.252
Lee Iacocca grew up in
Pennsylvania steelmaking

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:22.922
region, where his dad ran one of
the first car rental agencies.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:25.825
As a teenager,
Iacocca was determined

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.894
to one day become an
executive at an auto company.

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:31.064
So after graduating from
Princeton University,

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:35.101
he landed his first
job at Ford in 1946.

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.670
By the time he was
only 36, Iacocca

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.939
was named vice
president at Ford,

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:42.075
the youngest VP In
the company's history.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:45.945
Lee Iacocca understood
that Ford needed to bring

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.815
a youthful flair to its market.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:49.916
NARRATOR: Millions
of baby boomers

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:52.285
would soon be getting
their license.

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:55.088
Iacocca knew that these
teenagers, who grew up

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:57.290
on rock and roll
and TV westerns,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.759
would want a cool car
that was fun to drive

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:01.528
but still affordable.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:02.996
So he directed
his team to design

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:07.767
a sporty coupe, priced at less
than $2,500, about $20 grand

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:11.104
in today's money.

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.773
To suggest speeding
through the countryside,

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:15.675
Iacocca named his
car, the Mustang.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:23.616
[engine revving]

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:26.286
The Mustang was something
that was not designed just

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.087
from a transportation
standpoint,

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:30.623
but designed from
a fun standpoint.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:33.159
NARRATOR: And like the
Pontiac GTO that year,

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.527
this lightweight car could
be fitted with a powerful V8

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.729
engine, a first for Ford.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.598
If you even go
back through the 50s,

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.734
stuffing a big V8 into an
Impala or a Galaxie 500,

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.203
those are huge cars.

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:46.306
Mustang was a lot smaller,
and to put a V8 into a Mustang

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.942
meant that it inherently handled
better, got better mileage,

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.910
and was probably as good
or better performance

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.213
because it was a smaller car.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:55.248
NARRATOR: Lee Iacocca
introduced Ford's latest vehicle

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:58.685
at the 1964 World's
Fair, which would be one

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.154
of the biggest in US history.

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:03.623
With 50 million visitors
from 80 nations,

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:06.626
this international
showcase guaranteed

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.261
the Mustang instant publicity.

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:10.730
ANNOUNCER: Out of
the Ford pavilion,

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.801
there's a daydream
corner called Mustang.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.269
NARRATOR: The gambit
worked, and he and his coupe

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.738
landed on the front of
both "Time" and "Newsweek,"

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:21.174
the first time either
publication featured

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:23.009
a retail product on its cover.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.546
The Mustang exploded
in terms of sales.

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:28.181
Lee Iacocca was so
dead on understanding

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:29.182
what people wanted.

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:31.985
It sold incredibly well.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:35.788
Ford planned on producing 80,000
Mustangs in its first year,

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.857
but within a year and a half,
they'd sold over a million,

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:41.694
breaking all post-World
War II auto sales records.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:45.932
The customer base was all over
the place, from women, to men,

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:47.767
to young, to old.

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:51.237
It just had this kind
of universal appeal

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:54.807
that I don't think Detroit
had ever seen before.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.242
NARRATOR: The magnitude of
the Mustang's popularity

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:59.879
put the other car
makers on notice.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:00.613
When Ford came out with
the Mustang, everybody

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:02.749
was caught flat-footed.

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.118
And so for three
years, the Mustang

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:06.853
ran absolutely unchecked.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.988
NARRATOR: By 1968,
both Ford and Chrysler

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:12.559
offered muscle cars
with oversized engines

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.595
well over 400 cubic inches.

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:18.131
The younger market
loved these fast rides,

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.266
and that gave manufacturers
the green light they needed

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:23.036
to storm back to the track.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.037
The muscle car era
was in full force.
