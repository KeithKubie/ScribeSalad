00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.440
I've got a fever and the only cure for it
is more SPRING.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.120
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.620
Hi, I'm Cristen Conger of Stuff Mom Never
Told You in today for DNews.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.500
The first day of spring on March 20 is just
around the corner, which is probably an exciting

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.250
prospect for many U.S. residents who have
experienced a bitterly cold winter.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.420
In fact, January 6th was the coldest day of
the 21st century thus far in the United States,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.870
and there's already a Wikipedia entry for
Early 2014 North American Cold Wave.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.399
And while the physiological and psychological
effects of cold, gray winter, such as Seasonal

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.810
Affectiveness Disorder, are more readily understood,
what do we know about the science of spring

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.810
fever?

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.840
Is that anecdotal ants-in-the-pants restlessness
for warm weather and sunshine a real thing?

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.190
Chronobiologists who study the interaction
between people's circadian rhythms, mood and

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.889
behavior say YES, spring fever is a bona fide
phenomenon largely thanks to the relationship

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:04.560
between sunlight and a part of the brain called
the hypothalamus.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.540
You see, longer spring days mean we're exposed
to more daylight, setting off a chain reaction

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.331
from the light-sensitive retina in our eyes
to the hypothalamus, which also happens to

00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:20.780
be the neurological home of the suprachiasmatic
nucleus -- better known as our biological

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.780
clock.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.140
The hypothalamus then signals the brain's
pineal gland to slow production of melatonin,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.220
a hormone associated with regulating sleep
cycles, while increasing production of the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.320
so-called "happiness hormone," serotonin.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.080
As a result, people often experience a springtime
boost in energy, confidence and sex drive.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.690
Men, in fact, even have higher sperm counts
in the spring than winter, which is probably

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.130
why ob-gyns also report a springtime spate
of unplanned pregnancies -- a baby-making

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.500
pattern also reflected among other mammalian
species

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.250
The additionally colorful and fragrant sights
and smells of springtime can also amplify

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.000
its enlivening effects.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.640
But not everyone experiences this seasonal
jolt positively, as things like insomnia,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.140
car crashes and criminality also exhibit springtime
revivals.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.060
Spring also is associated with an increase
in depressive and suicidal behavior, a trend

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.780
that psychiatrists still haven't been able
to conclusively explain.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.620
Different theories echo the aspects of spring
fever generally associated with sunnier moods:

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.830
more socializing and restless energy.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.730
On a brighter note, one study out of the Virginia
Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.700
suggests that basking in the spring sun is
good for us, and the more time we spend outside,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.700
the better our moods -- which, I'm sad, to
report, will likely take another weather-related

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.750
dip once hot temperatures begin to crest in
the sweaty summertime.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.770
And if you're in need of a mood boost to get
you through until spring is finally sprung,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.280
