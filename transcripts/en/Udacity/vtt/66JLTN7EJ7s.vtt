In addition to attributions we also use schemas to make sense of our world. Do

00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:06.194
you remember when we talked about schemas and how as humans we try to

00:00:06.194 --> 00:00:10.780
categorize things? Well, we do this with our social world when trying to form

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.676
impressions of other people, especially in ambiguous situations. And one way to

00:00:15.676 --> 00:00:19.478
do this is through stereotypes. Stereotypes are schemas of how people are

00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:24.262
likely to act, based on the group they belong to. We stereotypes that draw

00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:28.168
inferences about people based on the knowledge we have of the categories to

00:00:28.168 --> 00:00:30.350
which they belong.
