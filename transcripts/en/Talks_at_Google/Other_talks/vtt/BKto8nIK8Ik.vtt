00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.090
&gt;&gt;presenter: Hi Googlers and hi YouTube.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.480
I'm [ indistinct ] and I'm a software engineer
in the Maps Team and in my 20 percent time

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.060
I help out with personal growth initiatives
at Google.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.160
So first I'd like to remind everyone here
that May is Personal Growth Month in New York

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.160
City.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.320
You can find out more at the GoLink go/pgny.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.750
There's tons of resources.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.400
I'll be teaching a course, an introductory
course in meditation and awareness for anyone

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.689
who is new to the field.

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:38.080
But today on behalf of the Authors at Google
series I'm proud to present Dr. Deepak Chopra.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.080
[applause]

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.190
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Thank you.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.720
[applause]

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.760
&gt;&gt;presenter: Thank you for joining us today
Dr. Chopra.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.960
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Thank you.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.530
&gt;&gt;presenter: So it's been said that if Dr.
Chopra were to marry his close personal friend

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.550
Oprah Winfrey --

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.550
[laughter]

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.550
she would become Oprah Chopra.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.550
[laughter]

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.270
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: I mentioned that on her
site and she did not appreciate it.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.270
[laughter]

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.260
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs] Well, then we'll cut
that from this video.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.860
But all joking aside we're delighted to have
Dr. Chopra here today.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.970
He's world renowned as an expert in matters
of spirituality and mind/body medicine and

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.940
millions of people look up to him for guidance.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.500
He's authored dozens of books, many of them
best sellers.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.940
And most recently he's published a book Spiritual
Solutions: Answers to Life's Greatest Challenges.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.920
So Dr. Chopra I'd love to ask you a few questions
about your book in general and after about

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.890
half way through the hour we're gonna open
up the questions to the audience.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.270
How does that sound?

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.340
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: That sounds great.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.340
&gt;&gt;presenter: Great.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.990
So first of all a warm welcome.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.750
How are you finding Google New York City?

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.560
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: I've been here before
--

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.560
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.810
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: and I think it's a great
space.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.740
In the language of the audience it's cool.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.740
[laughter]

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.820
presenter: Have you gotten lost yet?

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.820
[laughter]

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.260
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: I never get lost.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.260
&gt;&gt;presenter: Oh that's fantastic.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.260
[laughter]

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.260
Most of us get lost all the time so --

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.260
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: [chuckles]

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.260
&gt;&gt;presenter: that is wonderful.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.510
So I wanna know so having published so many
other works, so many wonderful works, what

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.000
was your main motivation or goal or inspiration
for this particular book?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.590
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: To reach the audience
that we are speaking to right now because

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:35.230
my audience is already on board with the idea
that spirituality is awareness, it's consciousness.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.630
I think many of the people who are new to
the word spirituality associated it with religion

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:49.890
or dogma or ideology or self righteous morality
which is just jealousy with a halo.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.450
When I use the word spirit or spirituality
I mean awareness.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.580
And awareness has many components which we
can talk about as we proceed.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.680
&gt;&gt;presenter: Fantastic.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.580
So you would say that your audience primarily
for this book is people who are new to the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.580
ideas of --

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.739
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: People who are new to
the ideas of spirituality.

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.319
Scientists once again --

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.319
&gt;&gt;presenter: Okay.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.690
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: because I have a constant
kind of battle with scientists and we can

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.690
talk about that too --

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.690
&gt;&gt;presenter: Sure, sure.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.230
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: so I decided to change
tactics for awhile.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.610
&gt;&gt;presenter: Okay, so this is mostly for,
this crowd is largely scientific as you must

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.950
know so this may speak particularly well to
this audience.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.830
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Yeah, this is an audience
of technologists I wouldn't necessarily call

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:38.840
them scientists.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.849
&gt;&gt;presenter: Sure.

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:40.849
Think we have a mix.

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.930
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Okay.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.930
[laughter]

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.930
&gt;&gt;presenter: So one thing is in this book
you talk about the usefulness of when addressing

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.790
a problem instead of addressing it from what
you called the level of the problem you advocate

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.390
addressing it from a place of expanded awareness.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.060
And so I'm hoping you can tell us a little
bit about what the difference between these

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.060
two might be.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.060
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Good.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.280
So let me start out with something that you
will be very familiar with because all of

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.440
you deal with information in a sense.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:21.291
When my wife was pregnant with our first child,
Mallika who's sitting in the audience, my

00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:28.870
chief resident called me and he said, "You
know I just took your wife's blood sample

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.590
and it shows a thalassemia minor trait."

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.120
So I went and looked at the blood sample and
sure enough the cells were not what you see

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.120
normally.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.630
It took me two days to go to the library to
track where I could find that information.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.491
Then I was in New Jersey, then I had to go
to the public library in New York, and it

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:52.790
took me another two days.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:59.550
And what I discovered was very exciting and
that is that that blood trait existed along

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:08.741
the exact route that the armies of Alexander
the Great took in 323 B.C. from Greece, from

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.800
Macedonia to India.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.610
That the trait, and of course I told my wife,
"It seem like your ancestors were screwing

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.610
around."

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.610
[laughter]

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.270
But it took me five days to get that information.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.400
Today I could go to Google and take me less
than a minute.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.060
I'd get to some sites and then from there
go to other sites and in a minute I'd have

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.670
that information.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.350
So what does information do?

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:44.010
Information expands our awareness of what
is.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:51.830
And so through the Google network, which is
the biggest search engine, we expand our awareness.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.610
But there's another thing that people don't
understand: our state of awareness actually

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:04.340
chooses the information that we seek out.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:13.229
So if my state of awareness is I wanna understand
the causes of war, terrorism, global warming,

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:19.930
social injustice, economic injustice, all
the things that are kind of surfacing now

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:27.199
as the what's happening in Syria and all the
Middle East the so called Arab Spring, Occupy

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:33.210
Wall Street, then my state of awareness looking
at this global picture will seek out the right

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.620
information.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.160
So they co-feed on each other.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.800
The information expands awareness but the
state of awareness also expands the information

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.800
we seek.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.800
&gt;&gt;presenter: Sure.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.020
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: And if by awareness I
mean spirituality, which is my definition,

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.880
then awareness has many more components than
information.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:04.620
Awareness influences your moods so if you're
depressed then everything looks dark and bleak.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:12.889
It influences your beliefs, it influences
your assumptions, it influences your perceptions,

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:16.169
it influences your expectations.

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:25.340
So in the book my thesis is that all problems
exist because of what I call contracted awareness.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.250
Contracted awareness means you feel separate
from the ecosystem.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:37.789
The Google network is an ecosystem so you
feel separate from the ecosystem that nurtures

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:41.220
the web of relationships.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:51.580
And that then of course results in fear, in
anxiety, in expectations that are doomsday

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:58.139
prophesies, in assumptions that everything
is gonna go wrong, and so on and so forth.

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:04.790
So in my mind the analogy is you're walking
in a dark room and you have a candle, that's

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:12.819
the light of your awareness, and you keep
bumping into stuff and so everything's a problem

00:08:12.819 --> 00:08:14.510
and that's you're world.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:21.259
But now imagine that you can expand that candle's
light of awareness.

00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:25.740
So now you have a flashlight and you can move
around and everything that seemed like an

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.430
obstacle is actually has a purpose.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:33.089
This has a purpose, this has a purpose, that
screen has a purpose.

00:08:33.089 --> 00:08:39.919
So all problems are now opportunities for
some purpose.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.269
So that's expanded awareness.

00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:47.829
You now feel connected to the web of relationships,
the network of relationships, which is exactly

00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:52.579
what Google is, it's a network of relationships.

00:08:52.579 --> 00:08:55.869
So I like to use the Google example here.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:09:01.080
But then imagine another state which I call
pure awareness, that's called pure awareness

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.720
in Eastern wisdom traditions.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:12.589
And here now you're in the same room but all
the walls are transparent, glass, including

00:09:12.589 --> 00:09:18.470
the ceiling and the floor, and the room is
flooded with sunlight and you look outside

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.249
and the whole world is your playground.

00:09:21.249 --> 00:09:27.869
There are no problems and therefore no need
for solutions, you are the creative, evolutionary

00:09:27.869 --> 00:09:36.000
impulse of the universe and so you play, you're
in flow, every situation is a conspiracy of

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.869
the total universe.

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:44.860
And so the thesis of my book is problems arise
in contracted awareness, solutions emerge

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:50.499
automatically in expanded awareness, and then
when you have pure awareness which is awareness

00:09:50.499 --> 00:09:57.899
without boundaries, no conceptual boundaries,
then it's pure creativity.

00:09:57.899 --> 00:10:01.779
That's the basis of this book and you can
apply these principles you don't even actually

00:10:01.779 --> 00:10:05.160
have to read the book if you understand the
principles.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.029
You can apply these principles whether you
want material success, want to improve the

00:10:10.029 --> 00:10:18.089
quality of your relationships, want to have
an understanding of insight, intuition, imagination,

00:10:18.089 --> 00:10:24.519
creativity, inspiration, which is spirituality,
higher consciousness, or whether you want

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:27.549
to solve mundane, easy problems.

00:10:27.549 --> 00:10:35.209
Nobody's addressing the problems at a higher
state of awareness than the awareness that

00:10:35.209 --> 00:10:36.489
created the problems.

00:10:36.489 --> 00:10:38.189
And that quote of mine is from Einstein.

00:10:38.189 --> 00:10:46.759
He said, "No problem can ever be solved at
the level of awareness at which it was created."

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:47.759
Long answer --

00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:48.759
&gt;&gt;presenter: Fantastic.

00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:49.759
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: but it's the summary
of the book.

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:55.110
&gt;&gt;presenter: So now let me ask you, I find
it also easier to speak of awareness using

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.689
analogies because it's sometimes hard to speak
about directly.

00:10:58.689 --> 00:11:02.779
But if I'm trying to understand whether I'm
approaching a problem from the perspective

00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:08.429
of contracted or expanded awareness how can
I be sure, what objective signs do I have

00:11:08.429 --> 00:11:10.291
to know that I'm in a place of expanded awareness
--

00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:15.639
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Your body language, your
body language shows it.

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:19.389
A baby can read body language before a baby
learns language.

00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:26.429
So if you're in contracted awareness your
posture first of all is depressed, your eyes

00:11:26.429 --> 00:11:34.529
are shifty, you have a scowl on your face,
you're contracted in general, you're probably

00:11:34.529 --> 00:11:38.339
constipated as well because you have tight
sphincters, [chuckles] everywhere.

00:11:38.339 --> 00:11:39.339
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:11:39.339 --> 00:11:40.339
[laughter]

00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:46.240
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: your blood pressure's
up, your heart rate is speeded up, and everything's

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.240
a problem.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:54.859
Your beliefs reflect that, expectations reflect
that, assumptions reflect that, perceptions

00:11:54.859 --> 00:11:55.859
reflect that.

00:11:55.859 --> 00:11:56.859
Everything is bleak.

00:11:56.859 --> 00:12:02.459
So when a baby looks at its mother, if the
mother is in contracted awareness, the baby

00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:07.879
immediately goes into contracted awareness
because her voice tone and all the things

00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:12.980
that I mentioned, body language, reflect that
and baby has a, there's a phenomenon called

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:18.820
mirror neurons, that's how we learn even regular
language, but that's how we learn emotional

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.429
language as well.

00:12:20.429 --> 00:12:25.399
If the mother smiles, let's say the baby falls
down, the mother screams and is getting upset

00:12:25.399 --> 00:12:28.860
and contracted, the baby will look at that
situation with fear.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.860
&gt;&gt;presenter: Sure.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.079
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: If the mother smiles
and says, "Oh you fell down," and her tone

00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:38.739
reflects that, her body language reflects
that, she has a smile, the baby interprets

00:12:38.739 --> 00:12:41.509
that same situation in a different way.

00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:46.819
So you can read anyone's awareness just by
looking at them.

00:12:46.819 --> 00:12:51.609
And even dogs can do it by the way, animals
can do it, they read your state of awareness

00:12:51.609 --> 00:12:53.529
just by looking at you.

00:12:53.529 --> 00:12:57.230
&gt;&gt;presenter: So if I wanted to expand my awareness.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:03.439
So one way of doing it seems to be to take
spiritual problems and address the spiritual

00:13:03.439 --> 00:13:05.290
solutions to those problems.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.510
Is there a more direct way of doing it?

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:11.660
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Here's the most direct
way: remember I said to every situation you

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:17.759
bring your awareness and that includes moods
and feelings, expectations, assumptions, perceptions,

00:13:17.759 --> 00:13:21.709
and beliefs, those are the components of awareness.

00:13:21.709 --> 00:13:29.250
So when you are seeing a problem, any problem,
just take my word for it, you're in contracted

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.759
awareness and you need to shift that.

00:13:31.759 --> 00:13:34.000
And how do you shift that?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.329
There are many ways to shift that.

00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:40.119
First of all you can sit down, just stop at
that moment, recognize that you're in contracted

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:42.399
awareness and expand your awareness.

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:44.569
What do I mean expand your awareness?

00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:47.889
Establish a connection with the web of relationships
around you.

00:13:47.889 --> 00:13:51.739
One way to do is feel gratitude.

00:13:51.739 --> 00:13:52.879
And what does that mean?

00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:56.419
Just count the things that you're already
grateful for notwithstanding the problems

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:58.170
you're in.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:03.600
Gratitude moves your ego out of the way, connects
you to the people and situations and circumstances

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.470
that you're grateful for.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.259
Forgiveness is another way.

00:14:07.259 --> 00:14:12.730
Forgiveness means letting go of resentments
and grievances because in every state of contracted

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:16.879
awareness that's an ingredient: resentment,
grievance.

00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:21.980
Nelson Mandela said that having a grievance
is like drinking poison and hoping it'll kill

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:22.980
your enemy.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:23.980
[laughter]

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.980
It doesn't work.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.600
Hurting yourself is throwing you into contraction.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.550
So those are the first two things and then
there are other things.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:34.559
You can remember an experience of love.

00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:39.449
Everyone's had that experience whether it's
instinctive love, protecting a child, or it's

00:14:39.449 --> 00:14:43.669
emotional, romantic love, or what we call
spiritual love.

00:14:43.669 --> 00:14:51.239
So remember an experience of love that evokes
feelings of compassion, empathy, joy, equanimity,

00:14:51.239 --> 00:14:55.939
what we call platonic values: truth, goodness,
beauty, harmony, evolution.

00:14:55.939 --> 00:15:01.569
So by remembering that or even imagining that
will shift your awareness.

00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:07.839
Then what you can do is now see how immediately,
immediately that changes your mood, that changes

00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:14.259
your beliefs, first the belief was everything's
a problem now you're seeing more context,

00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:20.259
relationship, you're going beyond win/lose
orientation, you're seeing that the world

00:15:20.259 --> 00:15:27.679
is relational and holistic and ultimately
an ecosystem where everything is interdependent.

00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:32.720
And then you can go beyond that, you can go
beyond expanded awareness into what I call

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.350
pure awareness and that is going into the
silence.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:41.049
This is a tough one but it's achievable.

00:15:41.049 --> 00:15:45.470
Going into the silence between your thoughts.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.829
Between every thought there's a little space
and that's where there is no thought.

00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:55.310
So right now as you're listening to me just
turn your attention to who's listening.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:56.899
[pause]

00:15:56.899 --> 00:16:01.660
So as you're listening to me be aware of the
listener.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.290
[pause]

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.290
That still presence that you feel that's pure
awareness.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:07.290
[pause]

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:13.209
It's not your mind which might be saying,
"I wish I'd gone to the bathroom before I

00:16:13.209 --> 00:16:17.859
came here," or "why didn't my girlfriend return
my call," or whatever.

00:16:17.859 --> 00:16:19.169
That's the mind.

00:16:19.169 --> 00:16:26.639
But between the spaces, the spaces between
thoughts is just pure awareness.

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:29.689
That's the place of infinite creativity, anything.

00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:34.160
It's the feel of all possibilities: creativity,
intention.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:40.129
It's also a place of ambiguity and uncertainty
because without ambiguity and uncertainty

00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:41.939
there's no creativity.

00:16:41.939 --> 00:16:47.989
So the space between our thoughts is a field
of possibilities, it's a field of creativity,

00:16:47.989 --> 00:16:54.179
it's the place where our intentions come from,
and it's also the place of uncertainty.

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:56.589
You embrace uncertainty.

00:16:56.589 --> 00:17:03.230
That's the place where you wanna be even more
than expanded awareness.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.270
&gt;&gt;presenter: That's fantastic.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:09.519
I know a lot of modern science, in particular
positive psychology, is definitely validating

00:17:09.519 --> 00:17:14.949
a lot of these ideas and helping come up with
actual practices which have been known forever

00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:19.110
but are finally being validated and there'll
be more talk of this during Personal Growth

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.329
Month, there'll be many more opportunities
to learn about it.

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:24.970
So I think that's fantastic.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:30.510
I wanted to say also the final page of your
book really connected with me for a particular

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:31.510
reason.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:35.570
In there you explain that one of the most
important reasons that you speak about spiritual

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:42.060
solutions is that it's a practical way to
incorporate spirituality into life and that

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.740
since we no longer live in an age of faith
we may risk losing touch with some of these

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.500
deep connections.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.669
Can you speak more about that?

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:55.019
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Yeah, the age of faith,
the age of religion all began with a spiritual

00:17:55.019 --> 00:17:56.230
experience.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.330
And what is a spiritual experience?

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:02.570
In short, I've outlined it from contracted
to expanded and to pure.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:07.179
But when you look at all the religions they
all have a few principles.

00:18:07.179 --> 00:18:13.039
The first principle is transcendence, which
is going beyond space time and causality,

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:17.370
getting in touch with something that is eternal.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:23.680
Transcendent is almost inexplicable but you
feel that that's real.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:32.769
Second, is that the emergence from that experience
of the interconnectedness of life as an ecosystem.

00:18:32.769 --> 00:18:38.610
So from that truth, goodness, beauty, harmony,
love, compassion, joy, equanimity which the

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:43.419
Buddha calls divine attitudes, but they're
there in every religion.

00:18:43.419 --> 00:18:50.120
And the third experience from all religion
is the experience of the loss of fear of death

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:56.769
because you've touched something that is beyond
both birth and death where you're being transcended.

00:18:56.769 --> 00:18:59.159
That's the basis of all religion and faith.

00:18:59.159 --> 00:19:04.289
But you know what people do is they institutionalize
this, they make it a dogma, an ideology, and

00:19:04.289 --> 00:19:10.169
then it becomes a belief system which is another
word for a cover up for insecurity.

00:19:10.169 --> 00:19:14.180
I believe that all belief is a cover up for
insecurity.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:19.480
You only believe in things that you really
wanna be convinced of but are not.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:24.380
If I told you, "Do you believe in electricity?"
you say, "It's obvious, right; we are using

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.380
it."

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.289
So belief is a cover up for insecurity.

00:19:28.289 --> 00:19:35.970
So in today's age, we need a secular spirituality
that's based on understanding, that's based

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.580
on science, and that's based on experience.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.960
And that was what I meant in that last sentence.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.860
&gt;&gt;presenter: That makes a lot of sense --
that's what I took from that, too.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:49.100
So I wanted to ask you also you already touched
on this earlier, but about the role of technology

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.100
with spirituality.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.560
So this is kind of a two part thing: first,
since we're a technology company I think some

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:59.509
of us might be interested in understanding
how spirituality and technology may interface.

00:19:59.509 --> 00:20:05.200
For example how may technological tools assist
in deepening spirituality and vise versa how

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.639
may spirituality inform technological progress?

00:20:08.639 --> 00:20:11.559
And then the second part is how might it relate
to Google?

00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:15.629
Are there specific Google products you see
that may help or can we do a better job?

00:20:15.629 --> 00:20:18.490
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: You can do a better job
and I'll tell you how.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:19.490
&gt;&gt;presenter: Fantastic.

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:20.490
[laughter]

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.490
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: But --

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:22.490
&gt;&gt;presenter: That's what I wanted to hear.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.490
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: I'm the biggest fan of
technology.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:29.669
I think God finally got, whatever that mystery
is that we call God, got frustrated and said,

00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:31.009
"I better use technology."

00:20:31.009 --> 00:20:32.009
[laughter]

00:20:32.009 --> 00:20:33.009
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:20:33.009 --> 00:20:36.580
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: So technology's the latest
incarnation of consciousness and as I said

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.140
I'm a big fan.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:43.279
I have this little thing that, this little
gizmo that's right now monitoring everything

00:20:43.279 --> 00:20:44.549
that's happening in my body.

00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:50.549
I have another one here in my pocket that
does similar things.

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:58.200
I can USB these things and put them in a Cloud
and compare how my body is doing with, or

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:03.750
my state of awareness is doing with other
people that I'm in contact with in the Cloud.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:04.750
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:05.750
[laughter]

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:12.450
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: And so here's the future:
all the things that we've spoken of in Eastern

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:18.440
wisdom traditions are now subject to technological
innovation.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.350
I've been working here with someone right
in the audience and in a few months we'll

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:29.490
have a little gizmo that you can tune in if
you want into deep sleep, dream state, or

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:30.950
any other fantasy that you will.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:32.720
&gt;&gt;presenter: Where can we learn more about
this?

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.470
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Google it.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:35.470
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:36.470
[laughter]

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.179
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: I'll post it on YouTube.

00:21:38.179 --> 00:21:44.350
But here's the future, technology future is,
you should be able to regulate what's happening

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:51.330
in your body, in your mind, in your emotions,
by watching something on a monitor and then

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:52.950
shifting your state of awareness.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:53.950
&gt;&gt;presenter: So biofeedback?

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.789
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Biofeedback, I prefer
the word bioregulation.

00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:57.789
&gt;&gt;presenter: Okay.

00:21:57.789 --> 00:22:02.120
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: So bioregulation because
not only biofeedback, biofeedback is getting

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.549
the information.

00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:06.450
Now what do we do with it is bioregulation.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:07.450
&gt;&gt;presenter: Okay.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:12.289
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: So so far Google is into
the age of information.

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:17.500
The next step for Google is the age of knowledge.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.500
What's the difference between knowledge and
information?

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:25.940
Knowledge is information that can be put to
use, divine or diabolical.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:34.120
We can use knowledge to cause a nuclear plant
to leak or interfere with traffic signals

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:41.309
with this or shut off a pacemaker or whatever
else you wanna do, you'll be able to do with

00:22:41.309 --> 00:22:42.309
this little thing

00:22:42.309 --> 00:22:43.309
&gt;&gt;presenter: Sure.

00:22:43.309 --> 00:22:44.309
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Cut off electricity in
New York.

00:22:44.309 --> 00:22:49.570
So knowledge can be diabolical, destructive,
knowledge can be divine, constructive.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:54.880
Create a peaceful, just, sustainable, and
healthy and happy world.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.900
And you can do that.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.809
That's what Google can do and move from the
information age into the age of knowledge

00:23:00.809 --> 00:23:04.270
and move from the age of knowledge to the
age of wisdom.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:14.169
A wisdom based civilization using social networks
as the neural networks of a global brain,

00:23:14.169 --> 00:23:16.440
and ultimately a cosmic brain.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.040
That's the future of technology.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.169
&gt;&gt;presenter: Great.

00:23:19.169 --> 00:23:23.370
So before we turn over the questions to the
audience I wanted to ask you just one final

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.270
question.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:30.950
So I noticed in this book that in contrast
to some of your earlier works that you avoided

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:36.440
using some maybe quasi-scientific terminology
like quantum healing which may have appeared

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.780
in your previous books.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:42.740
And I'm wondering is that based on feedback
that such terms may confuse some of your readership

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.330
or was it for a different reason?

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.230
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: It's a very interesting
history.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:54.610
When I used the word quantum healing and I
was in my mind using it very legitimately

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:56.990
and I got attacked by all the scientists.

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:00.320
In fact I got the Ignoble Prize.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.320
[laughter]

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.389
Do you know about that?

00:24:02.389 --> 00:24:03.389
[laughter]

00:24:03.389 --> 00:24:04.879
The Nobel Prize for ignorance.

00:24:04.879 --> 00:24:05.879
[laughter]

00:24:05.879 --> 00:24:10.870
And I was attacked by scientists and so I
backed off a little bit because I was convinced

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:13.679
about the terminology I was using but I'm
not a quantum physicist.

00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:14.679
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um.

00:24:14.679 --> 00:24:17.950
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: So I was being criticized
by quantum physicists so I said, "Back off

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:18.950
a little bit."

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:19.950
&gt;&gt;presenter: Okay.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:23.200
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: But then in the last
three years, I started holding a conference

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.960
at my center through our non-profit.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.149
We call it Sages and Scientists.

00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:32.620
So I'll bring in all the skeptics, I'll bring
in all the people who are interested in consciousness,

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:38.580
and I suddenly found that there was a bunch
of really high level scientists including

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.830
Nobel laureates, not Ignoble laureates, --

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:41.830
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.590
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: but Nobel laureates who
were closet spiritual, consciousness adherents.

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.590
&gt;&gt;presenter: Sure.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:49.850
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: And I said, "Let me bring
them out of the closet.

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:50.850
Let me out them."

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:51.850
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.539
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: And so I started to do
that and so recently what I've started to

00:24:54.539 --> 00:25:01.120
do is I started to post those conversations
with them on YouTube --

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.120
&gt;&gt;presenter: Fantastic.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.690
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: and we're getting a lot
of good feedback and still a lot of attack.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:14.620
Last week in a physics journal, Nature Physics,
there was a scientific paper by the guy, Zellwinger

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.620
or Zell --

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.620
&gt;&gt;presenter: Zeilinger?

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.820
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Zeilinger about retrograde
causation and I'd --

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:20.820
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:21.820
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: spoken about this 30
years from today --

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:22.820
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum, um-hum.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.679
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: because it's all there
in the wisdom traditions.

00:25:24.679 --> 00:25:30.610
So this time I said instead of me writing
a blog about it and posting it on the Chronicle

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.730
and Huffington and YouTube and all this --

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:33.730
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:38.270
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: I'll get a computational
physicist to co-author it with me.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:44.259
So I wrote the article, I got a computational
physicist in quantum physics to co-author

00:25:44.259 --> 00:25:45.259
it.

00:25:45.259 --> 00:25:46.259
He made a few changes technically --

00:25:46.259 --> 00:25:47.259
&gt;&gt;presenter: Um-hum.

00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:49.769
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: and now it's the buzz,
it's in the physics community.

00:25:49.769 --> 00:25:51.140
&gt;&gt;presenter: Zeilinger's quite popular --

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:55.679
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: so we've come back full
circle to quantum healing and I feel validated.

00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:56.980
&gt;&gt;presenter: That's fantastic.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:57.980
[laughter]

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:58.980
That's fantastic.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.330
Well that's a great finish to my questions.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.960
So now I think we have time for audience questions.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:10.279
So there are two mics here and here and if
people have questions please feel free to

00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:12.970
come on up.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:14.200
[pause]

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.279
I think everyone's shy.

00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:18.940
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Do you want me to give
you the questions or not?

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.460
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.460
[pause]

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.390
Alternatively if there are things that I haven't
covered during my questions --

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:25.390
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: You've covered a lot.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:26.390
&gt;&gt;presenter: feel like --

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:29.890
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: You know since time immemorial
people have asked these questions.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.260
Who am I?

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.730
What do I really want?

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:34.860
What's my real identity?

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.450
Do I have a soul?

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:40.710
What happens to me after death?

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:50.360
Does God exist and if so what's He, She, It
doing about me personally?

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:55.779
These have been answered through religion
but as you recognize now that most of religion,

00:26:55.779 --> 00:27:03.919
although based on experience and legitimate
experience, is still cultural mythology.

00:27:03.919 --> 00:27:10.210
So we need a new framework and that framework
can only come through science and technology.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:15.260
And I think for the first time we may be able
to address these same questions that human

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:20.350
beings have asked for a long time through
a new state of awareness.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.330
Yes sir.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.299
&gt;&gt;male #1: Hi.

00:27:25.299 --> 00:27:30.179
When you were speaking about being in the
room in the dark with a candle and then moving

00:27:30.179 --> 00:27:36.529
from there to having the room have glass walls
and glass ceiling, I was thinking of chicken

00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:39.950
and egg problem.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:46.039
I don't spend a lot of time sitting in the
cancer ward holding people's hands or going

00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:49.000
and feeding the homeless.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:56.470
Not because I don't care but because I find
it so overwhelming that I cannot fix those

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.090
problems.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:03.070
And so the idea of suddenly having this global
awareness of everything that's going on is

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.379
rather terrifying.

00:28:04.379 --> 00:28:06.970
And I don't think that that's what you're
talking about.

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:12.139
So I was wondering if you could kind of address
how those two things fit together.

00:28:12.139 --> 00:28:16.740
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Yes, it's a very important
question because in the last one year we've

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:22.610
hosted at our studio here, Deepak Homebase
which is a few blocks from here.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:28.480
I've hosted people who speak about climate
chaos and the fact that in the last three

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:33.759
years there were 40 million climate refugees
in the world that most people don't even know

00:28:33.759 --> 00:28:35.440
about.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:40.580
That new epidemics like malaria are killing
a child per minute.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:45.909
That 50 percent of the world lives on less
than two dollars a day, 20 percent are less

00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:48.559
than one dollar a day.

00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:53.139
That there's gonna be water wars in the next
10 years.

00:28:53.139 --> 00:28:59.210
And every time you speak to one of these experts
they're correct when you look, I mean we've

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:09.360
got like 50 years to, at most hundred years,
to repair our ecosystem before we go extinct,

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.159
literally extinction.

00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:17.110
If insects disappeared from our planet today
life would flourish in five years.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:22.049
If human beings, sorry, if human beings disappeared
from our planet [chuckles] life would flourish.

00:29:22.049 --> 00:29:25.059
If insects disappeared, life would disappear.

00:29:25.059 --> 00:29:32.649
So as far as the ecosystem is concerned every
form of life is more nurturing to the planet

00:29:32.649 --> 00:29:34.620
than us humans.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.650
And your question, this becomes overwhelming.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:42.130
I worry about my grandkids when they grow
up, what's gonna happen?

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:48.679
So either you can say, "Give up," or you can
say, "We have the technology right here,"

00:29:48.679 --> 00:29:55.269
and Google is a good example of that to actually
not only expand awareness but to take that

00:29:55.269 --> 00:30:03.470
feeling that we have of love and compassion
for the rest of life on our planet and take

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:04.470
action.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:08.850
Because for every one of these problems there's
a solution, for every one of these problems

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:15.809
whether it's climate change, whether it's
the ecosystem, whether it's water shortage,

00:30:15.809 --> 00:30:21.299
whether it's energy depletion or oil, there
are creative solutions.

00:30:21.299 --> 00:30:25.769
There are special interest groups that'll
prevent that from happening.

00:30:25.769 --> 00:30:29.820
Today if all war ceased in the world the U.S.
economy would sink.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:37.480
If today we had a cure for cancer the medical,
industrial complex would have huge problems.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:43.320
Cancer's a huge business with CAT scans and
technology and chemotherapy.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.320
That's how we make money.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.679
I'm a physician I know how we make money.

00:30:46.679 --> 00:30:50.750
Every time you do something, even if it's
harmful, you get paid.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:57.340
So the only solution to this is a critical
mass of humanity saying, "Enough."

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.539
Everyone to take action.

00:30:59.539 --> 00:31:04.090
That's not going to come from institutions,
it's not even going to come from academia,

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:06.720
it's going to come through collective consciousness.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:12.429
I don't know why in my mind I thought, "If
a hundred million people," and that's why

00:31:12.429 --> 00:31:18.420
I'm here at Google, if a hundred million people
committed to personal transformation, not

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:24.520
even social transformation, personal transformation,
the world would be transformed because we

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.679
are the world.

00:31:26.679 --> 00:31:29.179
What's happening out there is a projection
of our consciousness.

00:31:29.179 --> 00:31:33.730
There's no social transformation in the absence
of personal transformation.

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:40.570
So that's where I'm hanging my bets and if
it doesn't happen I'll be gone anyway.

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:41.919
[laughter]

00:31:41.919 --> 00:31:48.780
&gt;&gt;male #2: So your comment about quantum healing
reminded me of something that I read about,

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:52.309
a phenomena that I read about, that I wanted
to hear your thoughts on.

00:31:52.309 --> 00:31:58.879
I read a book a couple years ago called Measuring
the Immeasurable and it was about how people

00:31:58.879 --> 00:32:05.169
could influence each other through some phenomena
that's not measurable in current scientific

00:32:05.169 --> 00:32:06.169
methods.

00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:10.919
So what they had is they had people in different
rooms where if, especially if they knew each

00:32:10.919 --> 00:32:15.529
other, if the person thought about the other
person during a given moment of time you could

00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:23.049
actually measure response on the epidermis,
like you could measure nervous activity.

00:32:23.049 --> 00:32:26.419
So humans were somehow influencing each other.

00:32:26.419 --> 00:32:33.230
And so this was like one of the first pieces
of scientific evidence that there's some sort

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:39.410
of connection between humans that goes beyond
the physical or the verbal or whatever.

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:43.570
So I was wondering is this, first of all,
is this somehow related to what you mean when

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:45.299
you talk about quantum healing?

00:32:45.299 --> 00:32:50.220
And also are you aware of this phenomena and
do you believe in it, do you know of more

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.220
evidence of this?

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.279
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Okay so there are two
questions: first of all quantum healing.

00:32:53.279 --> 00:32:58.799
No quantum healing is very simple idea it
means that when you get to your baseline status,

00:32:58.799 --> 00:33:03.750
your pure awareness, your body goes into homeostasis
which is self regulation.

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:11.049
We were all born with self regulation as a
given and that's in medical language we call

00:33:11.049 --> 00:33:12.789
that homeostasis.

00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:17.429
It's a dynamic state of non-change within
the change.

00:33:17.429 --> 00:33:19.019
So we all have that capacity.

00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:20.019
That's quantum healing.

00:33:20.019 --> 00:33:25.890
What you're talking about is something called
non-local correlation and it has a vast body

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:32.549
of literature on it and if you stay tuned
in the next two weeks on YouTube you'll find

00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:37.749
actually my interview with a guy who used
to be a spy for the U.S.

00:33:37.749 --> 00:33:40.899
Government, Russell Targ, who had the U.S.

00:33:40.899 --> 00:33:48.740
Government including the CIA sponsored research
on this and on non-local remote viewing and

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:49.999
remote correlation.

00:33:49.999 --> 00:33:54.799
But this is, here's an experiment we did at
our own center.

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:57.450
We did evoked responses.

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:02.890
So we have two people who are emotionally
connected, they're in love or they're mother

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:07.669
and daughter or whatever, they have a close
emotional bond.

00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:14.000
We separate them and then we tell them that
we're going to take you into deep meditation

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.080
and in that meditation we'll introduce the
thought that will remain connected.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.909
So we'll introduce and then we put them in
separate rooms and we surround them with what

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:27.179
is called a Faraday chamber.

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:34.980
Faraday chamber is a lead shield that does
not prevent a signal going in or out so your

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.730
cell phone won't work in the Faraday chamber.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:39.599
Now we do something called an evoked potential.

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:44.679
We take a flashlight and we shine it in one
person's eyes and their brain shows the response

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:45.679
to the light.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.490
It's called an evoked potential.

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:54.909
Low and behold the other brain in the other
room in a Faraday chamber shows the same response

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:59.280
at the same time as if those two brains were
the same brain.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:05.180
Now because it's non-local, it's outside of
space time, it doesn't matter where these

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.730
two people are, one could be in New York,
on could be in Los Angeles or one could be

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:12.750
in New York the other could be on the moon,
it does not matter.

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:17.950
Distance and space time doesn't apply to non-local
reality.

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:19.780
That's what the Zell, Zelling --

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:20.780
&gt;&gt;presenter: Zeilinger

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.950
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Zeilinger experiment
is about right now.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:30.440
That there's a domain in the universe that's
called non-local, outside of space time, where

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:37.920
everything is not only connected, because
connection means a signal, it's correlated

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:45.079
instantly and that correlation is unmitigated,
means the robustness of that correlation does

00:35:45.079 --> 00:35:50.220
not diminish with distance and space time
or even past and future.

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:55.990
So it's unmitigated, it's unmediated, there's
no signal involved, and it's instantaneous.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:36:02.750
This is what Einstein objected to and he called
this spooky action at a distance and he died

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:07.970
unhappy thinking about this because the mathematics
for this was already existent.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:11.329
Now Zeilinger and others are actually proving
that this is true.

00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:13.450
&gt;&gt;male #2: That's amazing.

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:14.510
Thank you.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.880
&gt;&gt;presenter: So let's take one from this side.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.640
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hi Deepak, it's such an honor
and privilege to have you here.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.640
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Nice to meet you.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.400
&gt;&gt;female #1: And actually I spent a lot of
time in your center in Southern California

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.500
and especially working with Dr. Simon.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.619
So my sincere condolences on his passing.

00:36:28.619 --> 00:36:33.569
And I guess for me, with his passing, and
how much he personally helped me I was just

00:36:33.569 --> 00:36:39.640
wondering on how you personally in terms of
spiritual solutions worked through everything

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.369
that happened with him and how did you come
to resolution?

00:36:41.369 --> 00:36:45.329
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Well there were lots
of things that went through my mind because

00:36:45.329 --> 00:36:50.530
he lived an amazing life and so for him to
get brain cancer, and he was a neurologist

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:51.610
by the way.

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:56.430
So here's a neurologist who diagnoses his
own brain cancer and then dies from it in

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.020
less than 20 months.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:05.400
And it was very difficult for me to reconcile
with this because of all the things we teach.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.640
And so this is what I discovered, now I'm
not saying there's a direct causal relationship

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:13.290
but this is what I discovered and I'm glad
you asked the question.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:19.030
When David was a child he received radiation
to his head and neck for tonsils.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:22.890
This is what happens with our medical profession
we think something works.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:27.770
Then I found out that in those days they were
treating asthma to burn out the mucous in

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:29.820
the lungs with radiation.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:36.300
That if you went to get a shoe size you would
actually get an x-ray of your foot.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:44.049
So I, in my mind, now have chosen to believe
that that radiation had a lot to do with it,

00:37:44.049 --> 00:37:48.160
a misguided system that looks things in isolation.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:53.640
For all these years we didn't know that but
now we do in hindsight and David was a victim

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.030
of that.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:38:01.430
Secondly, I of course went through the grieving
process which I still am.

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:05.900
In the beginning there's denial and anger
but then you must grieve.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:12.160
And then thirdly I learned so much from him
that those memories keep him in my awareness.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.329
So there you are.

00:38:13.329 --> 00:38:14.859
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thank you.

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:16.390
&gt;&gt;female #2: Hi there.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:21.170
When you were speaking about contracted awareness
versus expanded awareness it just struck me

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:26.960
that maybe at a place like Google people,
that feeling of stress or the feeling of contracted

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:30.890
awareness is kind of what actually drives
us to be productive and efficient and to work

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:31.890
fast.

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:35.680
And I was just wondering if you had any words
of advice of how to try to kind of achieve

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.599
that more enhanced awareness but still be
kind of efficient and productive rather than

00:38:40.599 --> 00:38:41.599
--

00:38:41.599 --> 00:38:45.590
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: I'd say start your day,
and you're gonna do a meditation class anyway

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:46.590
right?

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:51.710
But start your day with five minutes of silence
asking very fundamental questions: Who am

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:52.710
I?

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.069
You don't need to know the answers.

00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:57.720
What do I want?

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:02.030
How is this day going, what's the best way
this day would go for me?

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:07.510
And have a vision of how you want that day
to be.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:09.910
And then ask yourself some deeper questions.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:13.900
How can I create more joy for me and joy for
the rest of the world?

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.780
'Cause you have the technology to do it.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:22.609
That should drive you and that will drive
business in the future.

00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:28.230
The number one trend in the world is well
being right now, the number one trend.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:34.140
But well being is not just physical well being
it's also spiritual well being, it's financial

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:40.020
well being, it's career well being, it is
social well being, it's community well being.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:48.400
If you take the holistic picture of well being
you're in the best place to make that happen.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:53.290
From all the statistics I have if you ask
people in the world how many people actually

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:57.970
enjoy what they do, only 20 percent, only
20 percent.

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:00.950
The rest of the 80 percent don't enjoy their
work.

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:02.970
That's a very dismal figure.

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:07.700
More people die in our civilization on Monday
morning at nine o'clock than any other time.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.700
[laughter]

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:13.599
Of heart attacks which is an extraordinary
accomplishment for which only the human species

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:14.760
can take credit.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.760
[laughter]

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:19.210
No other animal [chuckles] has this ability.

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:23.630
So knowing that how can we improve our career
well being?

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.440
How can we improve our financial well being?

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:31.310
These are very important things and that comes
from shifting awareness.

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.470
So happy to work with you on that.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:36.820
Just letting you know.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:37.820
[laughter]

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:38.820
&gt;&gt;presenter: [laughs]

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.350
It's fantastic, actually.

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:44.680
&gt;&gt;male #3: So Google's a company based on
search.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:49.570
Made quite a lot of money and changed a lot
of lives by facilitating something where somebody

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:52.080
can go and search for something that they
are looking for, it's a choice.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.089
And now I guess to all of us here today who
made a choice to be here for whatever reasons

00:40:56.089 --> 00:41:03.579
based on your name, what we've seen of your
history, and I think that indicates a certain

00:41:03.579 --> 00:41:08.530
I don't know collective consciousness about
a willingness to be open to messages, a willingness

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:11.940
to look at spirituality and things like that.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.829
What about all of the people who would never
dream of doing that?

00:41:14.829 --> 00:41:17.980
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: We can't worry about
that.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:23.960
There are people, everyone's at his particular
stage of development, spiritual or in their

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.539
awareness, and you can't worry about that.

00:41:25.539 --> 00:41:35.180
What I like is that we have a relationship
now with YouTube, which is a Google offspring

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:40.190
I think now, and we're creating something
called the Chopra Well and we are going to

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:48.030
be offering techniques for well being, techniques
for improving your financial and career well

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.850
being.

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:55.240
As soon as I finish this I'm going to do a
Hangout in your YouTube office right here

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.820
in this building.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.030
And I think that's a sign of the times.

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:01.650
This would not have happened 20 years ago.

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:06.500
So there's something happening and I think
whether it's the Arab Spring or the Occupy

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:12.360
Wall Street Movement or the Anti-Corruption
Movement with Anna Hazare in India.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:17.559
This would not be happening in the absence
of the social networks that we have.

00:42:17.559 --> 00:42:24.859
And so from search engine which you have a
big advantage of because you can access any

00:42:24.859 --> 00:42:30.000
information, we need to move beyond that just
searching the engine and harnessing collective

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.069
creativity, collective intents.

00:42:33.069 --> 00:42:41.640
There's a phrase, "Love without action is
meaningless and action without love is irrelevant."

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:48.059
But love in action, that's our series here
in New York, it can create miracles.

00:42:48.059 --> 00:42:51.430
So maybe you should adopt that as your mantra,
love in action.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:52.930
&gt;&gt;male #3: Thank you.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:58.579
&gt;&gt;female #3: I'm understanding what you're
saying as expanded awareness.

00:42:58.579 --> 00:43:03.890
It's just presence and presence with yourself
and connection with others, mindfulness.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:09.549
And you talk a lot about how information and
awareness go hand in hand and how technology

00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:14.730
can help us with our expanded awareness but
what are the limits of technology in expanded

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:15.730
awareness?

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:21.010
I mean for me sometimes I feel like the information
and the amount of information that technology

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:28.020
enables prevents me from being present and
mindful and leaves me more interested in the

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:33.869
social networks that you mention that can
help us be aware than actually being aware

00:43:33.869 --> 00:43:36.510
of what I'm doing and the people I love are
doing.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:37.510
So what are the limits?

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:40.480
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Again this is a very
important question.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:49.580
So here are the simple answers to your question:
number one technology's unstoppable.

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:55.760
It's like the next evolutionary impulse in
the evolution of human beings so you don't

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.069
even think about stopping it.

00:43:57.069 --> 00:43:58.069
&gt;&gt;female #3: Yeah.

00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:59.069
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Okay?

00:43:59.069 --> 00:44:00.069
It's unstoppable.

00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:05.490
The capacity of technology is doubling almost
every year and information much more than

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:06.720
that.

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:12.539
So in 10 years the capacities that we have
will be a million times more than we have,

00:44:12.539 --> 00:44:17.819
in 20 years maybe a billion times, you can't
even imagine.

00:44:17.819 --> 00:44:19.920
So that's a fact.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:26.090
Anybody who doesn't embrace technology they're
going to be not adapted and according to Darwinian

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:31.130
principles which says those that don't adapt
nature lets them go, natural selection.

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:32.210
&gt;&gt;female #3: Um-hum.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:37.059
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: So technology's unstoppable,
we need to embrace it.

00:44:37.059 --> 00:44:44.299
Now here's the main thing to understand: technology's
neutral, it's neither divine nor [chuckles]

00:44:44.299 --> 00:44:45.299
diabolical.

00:44:45.299 --> 00:44:48.490
It depends on us how we wanna use it.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:50.980
That means our state of awareness.

00:44:50.980 --> 00:45:00.849
So I always keep in mind that technology for
me is a means to expand consciousness so I'm

00:45:00.849 --> 00:45:03.329
very selective about how I use it.

00:45:03.329 --> 00:45:06.670
And there are periods when you totally shut
it off.

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:15.329
So if you're having your meals, if you're
with your children or engaging in company

00:45:15.329 --> 00:45:17.819
you put it away.

00:45:17.819 --> 00:45:22.109
This is another thing we're learning through
neuroscience that your brain cannot multitask,

00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:26.869
it can only do one thing at a time at least
consciously.

00:45:26.869 --> 00:45:31.160
Unconsciously it's doing a lot of things:
regulating your body, etcetera.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:38.109
So here's what I think and I owe Daniel Siegel
who is a great friend of mine in the neuroplasticity

00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:39.119
business.

00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:45.970
He says that there are different kinds of
time: there's sleep time, there's playtime

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:53.849
which is recreation time, there's relationship
time, there is exercise time, there's mindful

00:45:53.849 --> 00:46:00.589
awareness time, and then there's focused work
time and you don't mix them.

00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:05.950
So when you are engaging in technology just
engage in that, when you're not don't and

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:08.020
then you'll not be so overwhelmed.

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:13.500
&gt;&gt;female #3: Do you feel like through your
research and through your experience talking

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:18.940
about expanded awareness that like a major
hindrance to it now or are just people being

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:22.140
able to enter into being mindful?

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:26.299
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: It's always selective.

00:46:26.299 --> 00:46:31.542
One of the problems with my audiences they've
already decided that they [chuckles] want

00:46:31.542 --> 00:46:35.180
to expand their awareness and if they haven't
they're not in the room.

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.210
&gt;&gt;female #3: Yeah.

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:37.250
Okay thank you.

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:40.960
&gt;&gt;presenter: And by the way Dr. Dan Siegel
actually did come and give a Tech Talk in

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:45.320
Seattle at Google a few months ago so his
talk is online if anyone wants to watch it

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.320
I --

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.320
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Yeah he's --

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.320
&gt;&gt;presenter: highly recommend it.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:53.319
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: I would say his works
The Mindful Brain and on mindfulness are very

00:46:53.319 --> 00:46:54.440
brilliant and very contemporary.

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.440
&gt;&gt;presenter: I agree.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.289
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: He takes them out of
the religious --

00:46:57.289 --> 00:46:58.289
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yes --

00:46:58.289 --> 00:46:59.289
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: connotation.

00:46:59.289 --> 00:47:00.289
&gt;&gt;presenter: very much.

00:47:00.289 --> 00:47:02.380
So I think we have time for approximately
one more question.

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.550
&gt;&gt;female #4: Thank you.

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:10.829
You hear stories about people who kind of
experience death, they stop breathing and

00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:14.690
for all intents and purposes they've died
and then they come back to life.

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:18.839
And you hear their stories of what that felt
like and the peace that they feel.

00:47:18.839 --> 00:47:22.650
Is that kind of, I'm interested in hearing
your thoughts on that.

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:23.710
Is that like the pure awareness?

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:25.830
Is that kind of the next level?

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:27.740
Have you heard of stories of this?

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:34.100
What are your thoughts on kind of the next
level when people have these experiences?

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:38.569
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: First of all, there are
lots of very interesting videos on that on

00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:40.569
YouTube so check them out.

00:47:40.569 --> 00:47:45.809
Secondly, there are two schools of thought:
one school of thought is that's the experience

00:47:45.809 --> 00:47:53.549
of pure awareness and that everyone actually
to some extent has that experience as a near

00:47:53.549 --> 00:47:56.770
death or post death experience.

00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:00.020
There are other schools of thought that say
that's brain damage.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:09.089
Now I actually have had conversations regarding
this, some of them are also online, with skeptics

00:48:09.089 --> 00:48:13.190
and with people who actually say, "No, that's
the real experience.

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:15.579
That's real consciousness."

00:48:15.579 --> 00:48:23.250
And the problem is right now, and this called
the hard problem in sciences, and it's the

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:28.730
most unanswered question in science today,
how do you get an experience of, right now

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:31.440
you are experiencing yourself in your body
aren't you?

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.440
[pause]

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:37.750
Aren't you experiencing, is everyone here
experiencing themselves in their body?

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:38.750
[pause]

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:42.640
Well there's no proof that there is someone
there.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:47.670
We cannot scientifically explain an in body
experience.

00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:53.329
So try to debunk out of body experiences is
kind of, should be the next step when we can't

00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:55.580
even explain an in body experience.

00:48:55.580 --> 00:49:01.849
So the real research in science today, the
unanswered question in science is: where is

00:49:01.849 --> 00:49:03.089
experience happening?

00:49:03.089 --> 00:49:08.650
If I ask everyone right now to imagine a sunset
on the ocean, do it.

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:09.829
Can you see a picture?

00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:10.829
[pause]

00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:12.720
Where is that picture?

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:18.000
If I go inside your brain there are no pictures;
there are just electrochemical impulses.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.770
So that in science is called the hard problem.

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:22.390
We cannot explain consciousness.

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:24.750
We're looking for it in the brain, we can't
find it.

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:27.590
We're looking for in the body, we can't find
it.

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:33.680
And maybe we can't because we're asking the
wrong question.

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:39.059
Consciousness is not in your body, it's outside
of space time where the real action is.

00:49:39.059 --> 00:49:45.130
And so that picture you saw is in the transcendence
space, that's where we experience everything:

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:48.309
sensations, images, thoughts, feelings.

00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:54.849
So my personal bias is that the near death
experiences are totally legitimate, there's

00:49:54.849 --> 00:50:01.560
a multi-hospital center trial going on in
New York City right now in 19 hospitals, where

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:06.520
people are looking at what happens after death
or near death and they're coming up with the

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:13.789
same experiences: a white light, a tunnel,
feeling of peace, and all the other things

00:50:13.789 --> 00:50:16.920
that religious traditions have spoken about.

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.130
[pause]

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:23.609
&gt;&gt;presenter: So we're just about out of time
but I wanted to give anyone offsite a chance

00:50:23.609 --> 00:50:24.609
to ask questions.

00:50:24.609 --> 00:50:29.460
I know we can't see you so if you unmute and
were to ask a question then maybe we have

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:33.069
time for an answer.

00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:34.500
[pause]

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:38.569
Okay, sounds like nobody offsite has any questions.

00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:40.270
So with that let's wrap up.

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:43.020
Next, Dr. Chopra will be signing books.

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:46.070
There is books being sold in the back, back
here.

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:49.900
And before you go I want to remind you once
again of the go/pgny site.

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:54.799
Check out all the fun things you could be
doing for personal growth this month in New

00:50:54.799 --> 00:50:55.799
York.

00:50:55.799 --> 00:50:57.730
Thank you Dr. Chopra for joining us.

00:50:57.730 --> 00:50:58.730
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deepak Chopra: Thank you.

00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:59.730
Thank you.

00:50:59.730 --> 00:50:59.731
[applause]
