00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.910
When it comes to movies, the most important
characters are generally those that are considered

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.910
to be the leads.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.700
Whether they be the titular character; such
as characters like Superman, Batman, Bridget

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.930
Jones or Mary Poppins, or characters who are
clearly the star; like Marty McFly, Freddy

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.160
Krueger, Annie Wilkes or Ellen Ripley - it's
generally very obvious which character is

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.170
the most important in any given movie.But
that's not always the case.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.690
Looking back on certain movies, characters
who weren't given the top billing are often

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.419
a lot more important than you might think.

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.670
Whether they were integral to the plot, or
were merely being introduced for a bigger

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.440
purpose that you weren't aware of at the time,
you might be surprised at just how important

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.080
certain characters are - even, in some cases,
some incredibly minor ones - and that's what

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.080
this video is all about.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.650
Here are ten characters in famous movies who
were more important than you realized.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.600
Phil Coulson in The Avengers
The Avengers are the backbone of the Marvel

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.610
Cinematic Universe and their movies are the
biggest attractions for the franchise's audience,

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.320
so it's easy to think that the likes of Captain
America as their leader, Tony Stark as their

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.420
financial backer, or Thor and Hulk as their
big guns - all of whom have had titular movies

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.290
- are the most important characters in the
franchise.You might also think that Nick Fury

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.860
is the most important character, due to him
spearheading the initiative to bring the Avengers

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.060
together - but remember that he actually failed.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.560
It was actually the death of Phil Coulson
- a relatively minor character in the MCU

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.130
movies - that made them start operating as
a coherant unit.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.630
When you consider that Coulson was only meant
to be a one-time character after his first

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.620
appearance in Iron Man - and he wasn't even
meant to be given a first name in the franchise

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.500
- that's pretty impressive on the part of
actor Clark Gregg.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.910
Nebula in Guardians of the Galaxy
Guardians of the Galaxy was all about the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:35.910
titular team.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.350
Gamora, Drax, Groot, Rocket and, in particular,
Star-Lord stole the show.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.710
And you'd be forgiven for thinking that they'll
be the most important characters going forward

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.659
- but that's not the case at all.Karen Gillan's
Nebula wasn't even the secondary villain - Ronan

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.410
and Thanos were the two most important villains
in the movie - and Nebula could easily have

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.200
been considered by audiences to be gone for
good, given her exit scene at the end of the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.200
movie.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.200
But that's far from the case.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.580
Not only will she switch sides to join the
titular team in the 2017 sequel, but she could

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.490
also be a key character in the Infinity War
movie saga.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.240
In the comic books, it was her that removed
the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos' possession

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.349
and returned reality to how it was before
- don't be surprised to see that happen on

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.349
the big screen.

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.700
Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars
When you think of the original Star Wars movie,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.520
the most important characters you tend to
think of are undoubtedly the likes of Luke

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.640
Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia - but
where would any of them be without Alec Guinness'

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.290
Obi-Wan Kenobi?It's not like he was a nothing
character, but you rarely look at him as vital

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.650
to the entire plot - but he certainly was.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.990
Here's a list of a few things that wouldn't
have happened without him.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.040
Luke would never have joined the Rebels and
saved the galaxy.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.819
Leia would never have had anyone to go to
for help and, thus, the Rebel plans would’ve

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:39.819
been discovered.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.680
Luke would never have left Tatooine and probably
would’ve been killed.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.590
The droids would’ve been caught and disassembled.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.800
Han, and by association Chewie, would have
been hunted down and frozen in carbonite by

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.440
Jabba much sooner.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.800
Basically, the whole movie breaks down without
Obi-Wan.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.950
Blind Al in Deadpool
Just like in the comic books, Ryan Reynolds'

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.950
Deadpool shares a house with an elderly lady
called Blind Al in 2016's live action movie

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.950
based on the character.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.870
In the movie, Al is a minor character, only
appearing in a small number of humorous scenes

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.319
and, unlike in the comic books, Deadpool is
relatively nice to her.But Al is a much more

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.000
important character in the wider world of
Deadpool lore.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.940
Not only did Wade Wilson let her go, after
having been paid to kill her, in his pre-Deadpool

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.850
days, but she also acts as his guide, with
the intention of keeping him on a somewhat

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.210
heroic path and helping him to better himself.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.130
Moreover - and rather excitingly - she actually
potentially ties the Deadpool movie and, subsequently,

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.129
the entire X-Men movie franchise, to the MCU,
as she was an old girlfriend of Captain America's

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.830
back in the days of World War II!

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.590
The Clock Tower Lady in Back to the Future
Okay, now let's get into some really minor

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.170
characters whose impact on their respective
movies was actually pretty huge, starting

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.100
with the "Clock Tower Lady" in 1985's brilliant
Back to the Future.Played by Elsa Raven, she

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.140
was the lady who interrupted Marty McFly and
Jennifer's kiss outside the Hill Valley clock

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.140
tower to tell them how lightning had struck
it back in 1955, giving Marty a flyer with

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.670
the exact date and time the strike occurred.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.011
If it wasn't for her, Marty would have got
permanently stuck in 1955 and would only have

00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:07.819
been able to reach 1985 again via the natural
passage of time.

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.160
Terry in Back to the Future Part II
In 1989's Back to the Future Part II, Terry

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.410
- played by Charles Fleischer - is the guy
in 2015 trying to collect a donation from

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.410
Marty.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.100
His only scene in the movie sees him commenting
on how he'd like to go back in time to bet

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.240
on the Cubs winning that year's World Series
at 100-1.That one comment starts the whole

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.091
Sports Almanac plot and is the reason Doc,
and later Marty, go to 1885 in Part III, which

00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:35.180
results in Clara Clayton being saved from
falling into a ravine and Jules and Verne

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.180
Brown existing.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.479
If it wasn't for Terry, Doc would have disassembled
his time machine after he and Marty had returned

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:41.559
from 2015.

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:45.069
The Neighbour Kid in Home Alone
The entire plot of the first Home Alone film

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:49.430
revolves around Macauley Culkin's Kevin McCallister
being left at home alone when his family go

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.809
on holiday to Paris - but it wouldn't have
happened if it wasn't for a very minor character.When

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:57.250
the McCallisters are running late on the morning
of their flight, a young neighbour comes over

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.129
to watch them leave, annoying the driver of
one of the vans taking them to the airport

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.300
and telling the family to bring him back something
French.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.249
While he's nosily going through their luggage
in the back of one of the vans, he gets mistaken

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:10.529
for Kevin during a headcount, which is what
results in him being left home alone.

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.969
The Guy in Peter McCallister's Coat in Home
Alone 2 : Lost in New York

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:17.979
In the Home Alone sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost
in New York, there was a character who was

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.880
even less prominent than the neighbour kid
in the previous movie who was equally as important

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.680
to the movie's plot.In the airport scene,
when Kevin gets separated from his family,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.029
Macauley Culkin identifies a man as his father,
Peter, because he's wearing a coat identical

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.029
to his.

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:34.860
If it wasn't for that man - who didn't even
have any lines and barely had any noteworthy

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.569
screen-time, Kevin wouldn't have boared the
plane to New York and the entire movie wouldn't

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:39.749
have happened.

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:42.419
The War Department Clerk in Saving Private
Ryan

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.669
In 1998's superb Saving Private Ryan, the
entire plot of the movie is kicked off by

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.530
one woman typing up condolence letters in
an office.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.159
She has only around a minute of screen time
and, although she speaks, her voice isn't

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:57.259
heard at all - but she's integral to the whole
story.Through sheer coincidence, the clerk

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:00.870
- played Valerie Colgan - types up the three
brothers' letters at once and brings them

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.339
to the attention of her superior.

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:05.919
In spite of her tiny part, it is her actions
that inspire the government to arrange for

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.620
the fourth brother - the titular Private James
Ryan - to be brought home.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.619
Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad
No matter how you look at it, Harley Quinn

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:16.399
was undoubtedly one of the most important
characters in the Suicide Squad movie, but

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:18.399
did you truly realise just how important?

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:22.839
We doubt it very much.Harley's inclusion is
the main reason that two other massive characters

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:26.559
in Batman and The Joker were able to be included,
which is a huge deal.

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:31.279
Also, as a crazy sociopath bordering on the
line between hero and villain, she's a bona

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:34.319
fide rival to Fox's hugely popular Deadpool.

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:37.879
She's also a marketing gold-mine, given the
merchandise and costumes she will sell.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:41.600
And, most importantly, she's opened the door
for more female leads in comic book movies,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.069
which have been sadly and sorely lacking up
until now.

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:48.589

you realized.
