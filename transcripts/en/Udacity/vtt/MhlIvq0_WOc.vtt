00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In the first case the answer is 0 because they're the same.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In the second case we have data identical to this. The answer is 0.25.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In this case it's the same, and in this case it's 0.

00:00:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Expected variance is the average of these numbers or 0.125.
