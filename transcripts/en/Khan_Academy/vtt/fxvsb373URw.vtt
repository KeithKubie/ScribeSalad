00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.240
- [Narrator] What I
wanna do in this video is

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.750
think about how exchange
rates can affect trade,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.370
and actually we can even
think a little bit about

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.500
how they might be able
to affect each other,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.720
although we'll go into
a lot more depth in that

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.530
in future videos.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.950
So let's just imagine a
situation where the Chinese Yuan,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.950
the Chinese Yuan depreciates
versus the dollar,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.250
depreciates versus the
US dollar to be clear,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.473
US dollar.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.890
To visualize what we're talking about,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.790
let's draw the supply and demand,

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.600
or the exchange market
for the Chinese Yuan.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.050
So our horizontal axis would be quantity,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.130
quantity of Yuan,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.220
and then our vertical axis
would be the price of a Yuan

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.570
in terms of dollars,

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.570
so dollars per Yuan.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.250
And we've seen this before.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.760
This right here would
be the supply of Yuan,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.980
so these would be the
people who are holding Yuan

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.760
but might be willing to
exchange them into dollars,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.320
and then this would be
the demand for Yuan,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.720
these are the people
who are holding dollars

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.910
who might be interested in
exchanging them for Yuan.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.760
There will be some
equilibrium exchange rate,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.640
let's call that E sub 1,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.780
and let's call this,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.940
it's an equilibrium
quantity per time period,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.830
let's say call that Q sub 1.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.200
And just to be clear, this is
our supply curve for the Yuan,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.620
and this is our demand curve for the Yuan.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.630
So a situation where the
Chinese Yuan depreciates

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.590
versus the dollar.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.800
There is two ways really
that that could happen.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.730
One, you could have
the demand for the Yuan

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.530
shift to the left, or you
could have the supply of Yuan

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.640
shift to the right.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.882
The demand shifting to the
left would mean for some reason

00:01:53.882 --> 00:01:58.080
people who hold dollars are
less interested in getting Yuan,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.240
and supply shifting to
the right would mean

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.910
people who hold Yuan are all of a sudden

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.820
more interested in getting dollars.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.550
So let's just do the latter one.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.630
So let's say the supply
shifts to the right.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.490
I just want a scenario where we have

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.400
the Chinese Yuan depreciating
against the US dollar.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.980
And so you see very clearly in this world,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.320
if our demand does not shift,

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.710
we get to this next equilibrium
exchange rate, E sub 2,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.100
and there's also a different
equilibrium quantity.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.080
But you can see the Chinese
Yuan has depreciated

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.913
versus the dollar.

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:31.913
If E sub 1, maybe E sub 1 is
15 cents per Chinese Yuan,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.100
and maybe E sub 2 is 10
cents per Chinese Yuan.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.520
But now that we understand

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.410
and we can visualize
what we're talking about,

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.520
what would be the impact on trade.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.670
I'm gonna think about it in two ways.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.500
What is going to happen in China,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.930
let's think about China first.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.100
So in China, or we're
gonna be thinking about

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.930
the Chinese consumers.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.840
Well Chinese consumers, they hold Yuan,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.950
and they might buy some American goods.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.720
What would happen to the
cost of those American goods?

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.660
Well assuming that the American suppliers

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.300
offer their products in a fixed
dollar price, so let's say

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.290
you are General Motors,
an American car company,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.530
and there's a car that's
manufactured in the United States

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.600
and it costs $20,000.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.110
Well in a world where the
Chinese Yuan depreciates

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.950
versus the dollar, the
amount of Yuan to equal

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.790
20,000 US dollars has now increased.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.860
You need more Yuan per dollar,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.030
because you're in a world where there is

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.960
fewer dollars per Yuan.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.740
So American goods,

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.170
American goods,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.823
more expensive in China,

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.980
expensive in China.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.070
And so what might that do to the behavior,

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.510
how might people decide
to trade off between

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.030
American and Chinese, let's
say in this example, cars.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.390
Well if American goods,
and in this example, cars

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.200
become relatively more expensive,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.540
then they're likely to
buy fewer American cars.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.590
So if we're talking about
all American products,

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.503
we could say American,

00:04:11.883 --> 00:04:16.883
American imports into China,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.053
into China,

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.280
will go down, because they're going to be

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.480
relatively more expensive.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.560
Now what about in the United States,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.920
in the United States,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.680
what is going to happen.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.300
Well, assuming the Chinese goods
are offered by the supplier

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.700
at a fixed Yuan price,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.430
well now you need fewer dollars per Yuan.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.290
So Chinese goods,

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.820
Chinese goods,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.390
are going to be less expensive,

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.753
less expensive,

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.060
to American buyers,

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.600
so less expensive in the US,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.360
'cause each dollar is gonna buy more Yuan

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.730
and assuming that the goods
all have a fixed price in Yuan,

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.207
and so you could say Chinese imports into,

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.580
imports into the US are going to go up.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.970
And what's interesting
is that you might have

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.270
a little bit of a negative
self-correcting feedback loop,

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.810
because what's likely to happen if

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.380
American imports into China go down.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.500
Well that means that fewer
Chinese folks are going to be

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.469
interested in converting
their Yuan into US dollars

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:29.060
in order to buy goods,

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.560
because they're not buying
as many American goods,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.140
and so that might have the effect of

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.140
shifting the supply
curve back to the left.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.950
Similarly, in a world where

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.780
Chinese imports to the
United States go up,

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.380
well now all of a sudden
more Americans will be

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.260
interested in converting
their dollars into Yuan,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.920
and so that might shift the
demand curve to the right.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.740
So that might, either of
these could have the effect of

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.160
maybe helping the Chinese
Yuan appreciate a bit.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.950
Now in previous videos, we've talked about

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.630
many factors that could shift
the supply or demand curve

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.620
for a currency to the right or left,

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.170
but it would be interesting to think about

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.860
what would be the effects
of interest rate changes

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.670
in each country.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.250
Now we can link it not just to

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.790
what would happen to the
supply and demand curve,

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.770
but we could think about
how that might affect trade.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.313
Let's imagine a situation
where the US government,

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.540
government, increases borrowing,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.260
and we've talked about
this in previous videos.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.100
That will likely lead to
increased interest rates,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.860
'cause you have a big borrower here,

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.300
you could even have a crowding out effect

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.180
because of the increased interest rates,

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.940
fewer private borrowers
in the US might borrow,

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.110
but this would increase
likely, doesn't always,

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.640
increase interest rates,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.690
interest rates,

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.610
in the US.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.730
Now if you have increased rates in the US,

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.660
what might happen for folks in China.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.840
Well they might say hey,

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.240
we are more interested in
holding dollars 'cause we could,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.410
in a dollar bank account,

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.820
all of a sudden we get more interest.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.650
So that could have the
effect that we saw earlier,

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.483
where it could say,

00:07:06.483 --> 00:07:10.130
hey more Yuan holders are interested in

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.010
converting into the US dollars,

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.790
so it would shift the
supply of Yuan to the right,

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.400
which would have the impact of

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.320
depreciating the Chinese Yuan,

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.480
which is where we started this video.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.900
So you could see something like
the US government borrowing,

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.730
which increases interest rates,

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.230
could actually have an impact on trade.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.670
It could actually make American goods

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.410
less competitive in China,

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.910
and Chinese goods more
competitive in the United States.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.220
And I just did a scenario
where the supply curve

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.330
shifts to the right,

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.510
but you could also
imagine a situation where

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.220
government borrowing increasing

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.870
the interest rate in the United States

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.680
could even change the demand curve.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.710
Remember, the demand curve's
gonna be determined by

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.810
the sentiment from dollar holders,

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.980
and how much they wanna
convert to the Yuan.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.190
But if interest rates in
the United States go up,

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.240
well now they might say hey,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.160
I might wanna save in the
United States as opposed to

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.860
investing in China or
converting my money to Yuan,

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.570
and saving in Chinese bank accounts.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.240
So I'll leave you there.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.390
The big thing to appreciate here is that

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.920
exchange rates and trade are very linked,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.990
and that things like government borrowing

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.240
can affect interest rates,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.680
which can affect exchange rates,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.903
which can affect trade.
