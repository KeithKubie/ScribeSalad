00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.796
Now that you've gotten some practice with multiplying rational expressions,

00:00:03.796 --> 00:00:07.661
let's move on to dividing rational expressions. And instead of diving right into

00:00:07.661 --> 00:00:11.504
dividing rational expressions, let's start with what we know, dividing

00:00:11.504 --> 00:00:15.607
fractions. If we want to divide by a fraction, we really multiply it by the

00:00:15.607 --> 00:00:20.400
reciprocal of that fraction. So three-sevenths divided by two-sevenths would be

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.303
three-sevenths times seven-halves. We cancel the factors in the numerator,

00:00:25.303 --> 00:00:29.633
denominator which leaves us with three halves. We divide rational expressions

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:33.710
the same way that we divide fractions. We're going to change division to

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.004
multiplication and multiply by the reciprocal. So try doing this rational

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:42.227
expression problem. Change the division to multiplication and multiply by the

00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:47.070
reciprocal of this fraction. Make sure you find the cube of 2t before you

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.153
multiply. When you think you've got it, write your answer as a fraction here.
