Okay. Who's another

here, but, honestly,

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.936
Bill Cosby going to trial?
That's a huge victory.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.938
There are so many women
who have come forward

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:48.074

were never listened to.

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:50.543
And if he gets to experience
even a small fraction

did, I will be happy.

it's a little Schadenfreude,

I will also be happy hearing

Well, if we can't lock up Cosby
behind bars,
