00:00:00.223 --> 00:00:02.220
- [Instructor] When we first
learn about American history

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.771
it sometimes seems like it might have been

00:00:03.771 --> 00:00:06.030
a very easy or somewhat obvious transition

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.043
from the Articles of Confederation

00:00:08.043 --> 00:00:11.069
to the Constitution but it was not.

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:12.968
It was a very vigorous debate.

00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:14.736
As we've talked about in previous videos

00:00:14.736 --> 00:00:17.787
the Articles of Confederation
proves to be too weak

00:00:17.787 --> 00:00:19.692
in terms of a central government.

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:21.465
You have events like Shays' Rebellion

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:23.020
which really highlights this

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.058
and then as we go into 1787

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:27.964
you have a Constitutional Convention,

00:00:27.964 --> 00:00:30.543
at first to maybe revise the
Articles of Confederation

00:00:30.543 --> 00:00:33.930
but eventually they draft a
completely new constitution,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.223
the constitution that we have today

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:37.802
and after it was drafted,

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:38.833
after that convention,

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:41.721
we get into his period of late 1787

00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:45.606
and 1788 where you have
this very vigorous debate

00:00:45.606 --> 00:00:48.752
between those who want to
ratify the constitution

00:00:48.752 --> 00:00:50.199
often known as the Federalists

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.307
led by folks like Alexander Hamilton,

00:00:53.307 --> 00:00:55.236
James Madison, John Jay,

00:00:55.236 --> 00:00:57.264
famous for writing the Federalist Papers

00:00:57.264 --> 00:00:59.382
which they published in this timeframe

00:00:59.382 --> 00:01:01.678
and you also have the anti-Federalists

00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:03.374
or who will eventually be known

00:01:03.374 --> 00:01:06.648
as the anti-Federalists who
are against the ratification

00:01:06.648 --> 00:01:09.662
and the adoption of the constitution

00:01:09.662 --> 00:01:11.675
and their writings
which are also published

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:12.989
in this same time period

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:16.572
are known as now the
anti-Federalist Papers

00:01:17.504 --> 00:01:19.026
and what I have here is an excerpt

00:01:19.026 --> 00:01:21.008
from what is perhaps the most famous

00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:23.039
of the anti-Federalist Papers,

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.447
this is from Brutus I,

00:01:24.447 --> 00:01:27.656
published on the 18th of October 1787,

00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:30.306
so right in this time
period right over here,

00:01:30.306 --> 00:01:33.566
right after the Constitutional
Convention had ended

00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:36.149
and the states were deciding
whether to ratify it.

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.179
And Brutus is the pen name of the author.

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.298
It's believed to be either Robert Yates,

00:01:41.298 --> 00:01:44.282
Melancton Smith or John
Williams from New York

00:01:44.282 --> 00:01:46.300
but the reason why they
picked the name Brutus

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.568
is from history.

00:01:47.568 --> 00:01:48.962
Brutus is the Roman senator

00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:52.147
who was involved in
assassinating Julius Caesar

00:01:52.147 --> 00:01:55.250
keeping him from
overthrowing the Republic,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.971
so in some ways they view themselves

00:01:56.971 --> 00:02:00.941
as people who are protecting
the Republic from tyranny.

00:02:00.941 --> 00:02:01.984
Now, as I read this,

00:02:01.984 --> 00:02:04.150
keep in mind some of the
ideas that we've looked at

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.258
in other videos,

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:06.995
the different types of democracy,

00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:08.701
a participatory democracy

00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:12.331
where the citizens are
close to the governance,

00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:13.661
to the decision making.

00:02:13.661 --> 00:02:14.917
You have a pluralist democracy

00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:17.719
where you have a vigorous debate

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.357
between many, many different views.

00:02:20.357 --> 00:02:22.261
And you have an idea of an elite democracy

00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:25.523
where the people are still sovereign

00:02:25.523 --> 00:02:27.952
but they're being represented
by a smaller, limited group

00:02:27.952 --> 00:02:30.075
of I guess you could say elite,

00:02:30.075 --> 00:02:32.249
maybe more wealthy, more educated folks

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.505
who are trying or should be acting

00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:36.593
in the interests of the citizens.

00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:37.885
So, keep those in mind

00:02:37.885 --> 00:02:39.788
and think about what type of democracy

00:02:39.788 --> 00:02:41.214
the author here favors

00:02:41.214 --> 00:02:43.991
and what they might be afraid of.

00:02:43.991 --> 00:02:46.142
And so, Brutus wrote,

00:02:46.142 --> 00:02:48.962
to the Citizens of the State of New York.

00:02:48.962 --> 00:02:51.388
The first question that
presents itself on the subject

00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:53.800
is whether the 13 United States

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.403
should be reduced to one great republic,

00:02:57.403 --> 00:02:59.412
governed by one legislature

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:02.356
and under the direction of
one executive and judicial

00:03:02.356 --> 00:03:06.289
or whether they should continue
13 confederated republics

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:09.259
under the direction and control
of a supreme federal head

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:12.834
for certain defined
national purposes only?

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:14.142
So, they're starting with this argument

00:03:14.142 --> 00:03:15.342
that his new constitution

00:03:15.342 --> 00:03:19.465
is really creating just
one supreme government

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:22.596
instead of a confederation
of sovereign republics

00:03:22.596 --> 00:03:26.692
that coordinate for certain,
defined national purposes.

00:03:26.692 --> 00:03:27.591
It goes on to write,

00:03:27.591 --> 00:03:29.444
this government is to possess absolute

00:03:29.444 --> 00:03:32.052
and uncontrollable power,

00:03:32.052 --> 00:03:34.181
legislative, executive and judicial

00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:38.355
with respect to every
object to which it extends.

00:03:38.355 --> 00:03:40.422
The powers of the general legislature,

00:03:40.422 --> 00:03:42.510
so they're talking about
what will eventually be

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.932
the US Congress as proposed
by the constitution

00:03:44.932 --> 00:03:48.182
extend to every case that
is of the least importance,

00:03:48.182 --> 00:03:50.177
there is nothing valuable to human nature,

00:03:50.177 --> 00:03:51.795
nothing dear to freemen,

00:03:51.795 --> 00:03:53.857
but what is within its power.

00:03:53.857 --> 00:03:55.344
It has the authority to make laws

00:03:55.344 --> 00:03:57.053
which will affect the lives, the liberty,

00:03:57.053 --> 00:03:59.637
and property of every
man in the United States,

00:03:59.637 --> 00:04:02.194
nor can the constitution
or laws of any state

00:04:02.194 --> 00:04:05.092
in any way prevent or impede

00:04:05.092 --> 00:04:08.470
the full and complete
execution of every power given.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.104
So, once again, saying
hey, this is a takeover,

00:04:11.104 --> 00:04:13.596
these 13 states are
really becoming one state

00:04:13.596 --> 00:04:14.839
under the constitution.

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:17.041
This central government has so much power

00:04:17.041 --> 00:04:18.802
that it kind of makes the states

00:04:18.802 --> 00:04:19.941
a little bit irrelevant

00:04:19.941 --> 00:04:21.413
because they can't do something outside

00:04:21.413 --> 00:04:25.077
of what the central government
thinks they should so,

00:04:25.077 --> 00:04:27.108
so then having established this argument

00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:28.360
and once again, this is just an excerpt,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.754
I encourage you to read all of Brutus I,

00:04:30.754 --> 00:04:31.806
it's quite fascinating,

00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:35.902
the author then argues
why this is a bad idea

00:04:35.902 --> 00:04:37.077
to have this takeover

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:39.020
and have 13 sovereign states

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.353
turned into essentially one.

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:45.703
Let us now proceed to inquire

00:04:45.703 --> 00:04:48.475
as I at first proposed whether it be best

00:04:48.475 --> 00:04:50.758
the 13 United States should be reduced

00:04:50.758 --> 00:04:53.928
to one great republic or not.

00:04:53.928 --> 00:04:57.303
History furnishes no
example of a free republic,

00:04:57.303 --> 00:05:00.349
anything like the extent
of the United States.

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.103
The Grecian republics
were of small extent,

00:05:03.103 --> 00:05:05.457
so also was that of the Romans.

00:05:05.457 --> 00:05:06.920
Both of these, it is true,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.738
in process of time
extended their conquests

00:05:09.738 --> 00:05:12.174
over large territories of country

00:05:12.174 --> 00:05:14.373
and the consequence was
that their governments

00:05:14.373 --> 00:05:17.050
were changed from that of free governments

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.193
to those of the most tyrannical

00:05:19.193 --> 00:05:21.938
that ever existed in the world.

00:05:21.938 --> 00:05:22.790
So, he's saying hey, look,

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.819
there's really no precedent for this.

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.757
When you just had the
Athenians governing themselves

00:05:27.757 --> 00:05:30.054
in a participatory model, yes,

00:05:30.054 --> 00:05:32.200
a republic seemed to work

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.867
but then, once it started to extend

00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:38.012
its influence over surrounding
cities, surrounding regions,

00:05:38.012 --> 00:05:39.697
it became more tyrannical

00:05:39.697 --> 00:05:41.665
and the Romans even more so.

00:05:41.665 --> 00:05:42.877
The territory of the United States

00:05:42.877 --> 00:05:44.961
is a vast extent.

00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:48.228
It now contains near
three millions of souls

00:05:48.228 --> 00:05:49.298
and is capable of containing

00:05:49.298 --> 00:05:51.932
much more than 10 times that number.

00:05:51.932 --> 00:05:53.916
These might not seem like big numbers now,

00:05:53.916 --> 00:05:56.998
the United States is today
over 100 times bigger

00:05:56.998 --> 00:05:59.266
but this was already quite a bit larger

00:05:59.266 --> 00:06:02.060
than say just ancient Athens.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.013
Is it practicable for a country,
so large and so numerous

00:06:06.013 --> 00:06:07.371
as they will soon become

00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:10.762
to elect a representation that will speak

00:06:10.762 --> 00:06:13.061
their sentiments without their becoming

00:06:13.061 --> 00:06:15.667
so numerous as to be incapable

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.627
of transacting public business?

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:19.294
It certainly is not.

00:06:20.523 --> 00:06:21.956
So, this is really interesting.

00:06:21.956 --> 00:06:23.849
So, to the founding fathers,

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:24.686
the idea of a republic

00:06:24.686 --> 00:06:26.734
was really a representative democracy

00:06:26.734 --> 00:06:28.380
and Brutus here is questioning, look,

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.677
if you're governing over
such a vast territory,

00:06:31.677 --> 00:06:33.386
can you have a representation

00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:37.019
that will truly speak the
sentiments of the people

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:40.524
and if you do have true
representation of the people,

00:06:40.524 --> 00:06:42.715
well, are you going to have
so many representatives

00:06:42.715 --> 00:06:43.579
and so many interests

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:46.082
that they're not going
to be able to govern?

00:06:46.082 --> 00:06:50.366
So, he's saying hey,
this is gonna pluralist

00:06:50.366 --> 00:06:53.496
and he does not view
pluralism as a good thing.

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:54.682
He's saying hey, there's
going to be so many views.

00:06:54.682 --> 00:06:57.053
This is going to be ungovernable.

00:06:57.053 --> 00:06:59.517
In a republic, the manners, sentiments

00:06:59.517 --> 00:07:02.153
and interests of the
people should be similar.

00:07:02.153 --> 00:07:03.564
So, this is worth underlining again

00:07:03.564 --> 00:07:04.854
'cause this is a statement

00:07:04.854 --> 00:07:07.476
directly against the notion of pluralism.

00:07:07.476 --> 00:07:09.813
He says that in order
for a republic to work,

00:07:09.813 --> 00:07:12.866
you have to have people of
similar sentiments and interests,

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:14.274
not different views.

00:07:14.274 --> 00:07:16.096
If this be not the cases,

00:07:16.096 --> 00:07:19.158
there will be a constant
clashing of opinions

00:07:19.158 --> 00:07:21.078
and the representatives of one part

00:07:21.078 --> 00:07:24.355
will be continually striving
against those of the other.

00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:27.486
So, clearly did not think
much of a pluralist democracy.

00:07:27.486 --> 00:07:29.628
This will retard the
operations of government

00:07:29.628 --> 00:07:31.018
and prevent such conclusions

00:07:31.018 --> 00:07:34.297
as will promote the public good.

00:07:34.297 --> 00:07:37.756
So, he sees pluralism as
a recipe for indecision

00:07:37.756 --> 00:07:40.218
and not being able to pass good laws

00:07:40.218 --> 00:07:42.733
or do things in the public interest.

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:44.924
He goes on to say,

00:07:44.924 --> 00:07:47.629
in so extensive a republic,

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:49.701
the great officers of government

00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:54.044
would soon become above
the control of the people

00:07:54.044 --> 00:07:56.369
and abuse their power to the purpose

00:07:56.369 --> 00:07:59.642
of aggrandizing themselves
and oppressing them.

00:07:59.642 --> 00:08:01.467
So, here it looks like like the author

00:08:01.467 --> 00:08:03.287
is afraid of, you could kind of say,

00:08:03.287 --> 00:08:04.500
an elite democracy,

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.376
that it really wouldn't
even be a republic,

00:08:06.376 --> 00:08:08.230
that these people are
going to start acting

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.536
in their own interests.

00:08:09.536 --> 00:08:11.238
If you have to have representatives

00:08:11.238 --> 00:08:13.032
that represent such a large territory,

00:08:13.032 --> 00:08:15.479
they're going to be
detached from the people

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:16.638
that they're representing

00:08:16.638 --> 00:08:18.034
and then are just going to think

00:08:18.034 --> 00:08:20.347
about their own aggrandization

00:08:20.347 --> 00:08:22.234
and they will actually oppress the people

00:08:22.234 --> 00:08:24.374
that they're supposed to represent.

00:08:24.374 --> 00:08:27.247
These are some of the
reasons by which it appears

00:08:27.247 --> 00:08:30.390
that a free republic cannot long subsist

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.848
over a country of the great
extent of these states.

00:08:33.848 --> 00:08:35.273
If then this new constitution

00:08:35.273 --> 00:08:38.508
is calculated to consolidate
the 13 states into one,

00:08:38.508 --> 00:08:42.472
as it evidently is, it
ought not to be adopted.

00:08:42.472 --> 00:08:43.909
So, Brutus is making this argument

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:45.695
that look, you can't have a republic

00:08:45.695 --> 00:08:47.261
over such a vast territory,

00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:50.121
arguably the states are a
little bit more attractable

00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:51.357
although even at this point

00:08:51.357 --> 00:08:53.716
some of the large states are quite large

00:08:53.716 --> 00:08:54.950
but they would have a better chance

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.816
of being a free republic than merging

00:08:57.816 --> 00:08:59.120
all of the 13 states

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.368
into what would effectively
be one republic.
