00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
Hi everyone! My name is Tamara Chambers,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.200
and this is "Tamara's Never Seen!"

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.720
And today, I am watching, "Cool Runnings."

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.860
This came out on the Disney Channel I believe in 1993.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.640
Or was it just a Disney movie?

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.920
I don't really know. I could look it up.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.570
I was only 2 years old when this came out.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.100
I actually haven't even really heard of this film before.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.560
Doug was like, "have you seen 'Cool Runnings?'"

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.040
"What... is that? Nope. No."

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.680
Looks like it wasn't an original Disney Channel movie.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.300
It looks like it was just like a main...

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.140
theater release film. It really seems like it was. [laughing]

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.600
I've got my lucky egg!

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.680
I'm not gonna break, because it's not hard boiled.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.220
I am very excited to talk about "Cool Runnings!"

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.140
Let's do it!

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:55.840
♪ ♪

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.140
[splat]

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.680
Okay, I absolutely loved this movie.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.480
It started out, and it looked like it was gonna be a little dated, and a little cheesy,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.560
and it totally was, and it was totally okay.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.580
I think that they did a really good job of storytelling, a really good job with the characters.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.980
I really loved the main four guys.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.869
I was watching it alone and throughout watching it,

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.140
I would just say to myself, like, "Oh, I'm loving this!" [laughs]

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.500
This is how I always am.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.699
I haven't looked yet if it's real or not? Like, how well they got it right.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.380
Before the video's up, I will, I'll do some some fact-checking.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.760
And we'll find out together. You all probably know already.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.060
The story is about a man who wants to run track for the Olympics for Jamaica and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.500
him and two others trip in the finals to get into the Olympics and so,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.580
desperate to get into the Olympics, they start a bobsled team.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.960
John Candy plays a bobsled coach,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.080
who, in his glory days, earned two gold medals himself for bobsledding.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.840
He just sits there and drinks Red Stripes and bets on things and plays pool in Jamaica.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.620
Sounds like a dream life, honestly,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.640
but I think it really works well. He's excellent in it.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.320
The movie opens up on our lead, training for the race.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.860
And I got my first, like, chuckle of the film before the opening credits stopped rolling.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.980
So it was a good omen starting out.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.680
You see him running by, and one of the ladies in his town goes,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.980
"Handsome as a lion, that one! I could watch that backside all day!" [laughing]

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.100
It's like, yeah, nice. She knows what's up.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.420
Sanka is great, I think he was really funny.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.880
I loved the "Sanka are you dead?" 
"Yeah, man."

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.520
Same, somehow.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.520
Like I said, him getting into the Olympics for track gets ruined,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.240
but then he hears about John Candy's character being there,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.400
and goes and tries to make something of bobsledding.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.660
I really enjoy that it's based off of a true story, and I want it to be mostly true. I'm hoping it's mostly true.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.720
I feel like Disney is gonna crush my spirits when I find out that it's not mostly true.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.340
I just continuously loved Sanka's character, and I loved when he found out that bobsledding was in winter,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.620
and he's like, "As in ice? As in ice?

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.680
"Winter as in ice. As in igloos and Eskimos and penguins... that kind of ice? As in ice?"

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.300
That was me when I got to Chicago, so yeah.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.580
Yes.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.180
So the film has a lot of montages.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.940
There's the montage of trying to get John Candy to coach them,

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.860
then there's a montage training them,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.300
and then there's a montage raising money, and it's very Disney montage. Here we go!

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.620
We got to get to the actual race portion, so let's just get this stuff out of the way!

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.620
I love that they keep so positive and there's a lot of lessons being learned throughout.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.120
They only have five thousand dollars for their sled.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.360
Somebody gets them an old training sled, and so they get this piece of junk,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.140
and the lead character is still so optimistic.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.960
It's like it's beautiful and so excited just to be there and so grateful and it's just,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.380
it's so endearing.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.460
Also some of the lessons that they taught.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.720
People were making fun of them for their sled, and for their outfits,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.480
and just for never having been... be... being there [laughing]

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.400
and, and for various other things,

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.980
racist things, and...

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.780
one of them was like, "Why?"

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.900
and the tough broody one was like, "Well, we're different. People always are afraid of different."

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.860
And it was just a really quick thing. They could have really dove into that aspect of it,

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.920
if that's what happened,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.680
they could have really dove into that but it was just like a...

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.380
"We're also dealing with this crap!" Kinda like, throw away. Like it's in there a little bit.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.420
It was. I loved it. I loved it.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.590
I think that the writing was...

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.810
thoughtful,and it's so cheesy, and it feels like a Disney film, but it feels...

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.820
I don't know, "genuine", still.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.900
There's also a moment where Yul Brenner thinks that he's gonna get out of Jamaica and out of the town.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.060
He's shaming all of them, and he's like, "I'm gonna live here",

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.840
and he pulled out a picture of the Buckingham Palace.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.600
He doesn't know that it's the Buckingham Palace.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.180
And they're all like, "The Queen lives there, man. Like, you're not gonna live there."

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.560
And it really breaks his spirit for a moment,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.330
and then Junior comes over, who Yul has been picking on the whole time,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.100
and Junior's like, "No, we need people like this, man. Find your castle."

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.240
And gives them the thing back, and I was like, crying, it was so thoughtful and sweet and cute.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.240
Then I just put, "Oh, now we're line dancing in a cowboy bar. There's the Disney I know!"

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.600
This happens to turn into one of my favorite scenes in the whole film though.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.240
The Germans are picking on them, because Disney always has to have a bad guy,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.840
and in this film, it's the German team for some reason.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.380
And they're just super rude to them because they're like, the popular bobsled team.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.020
But Junior's like, very down on himself, and he's also facing like some things with his father

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.780
And Yul Brenner goes in and he's like, "No, man.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.240
"No! You gotta look at yourself in the mirror, and you gotta say this back to yourself,

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.320
"I see pride, I see power, and I see a badass mother who don't take crap from nobody!"

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.960
Yes, I loved this part!

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.120
And I also love when it comes back into the end when the father comes and confronts him,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.700
and he finally stands up for himself.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.340
The friendship that they develop, it's like they were obviously gonna be friends,

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.920
they're the bobsled team, so they start off as enemies, they become friends.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.820
It's very Disney, but it's just... it really made me happy. [laughing]

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.580
It really worked well!

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.060
Then we get a very Disney cowboy bar fight.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.560
Another... like, it's just good feeling after good feeling after good feeling.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.560
Even in the end, when it's not a good feeling, it's a great feeling.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.800
They qualify for the finals, and then you see the three different races,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.000
and they do terrible, and then do great, and then they're doing really great, and then their

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:52.420
terrible $5,000 bobsled falls apart, and they pick it up and then carry it across, and it was so good.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.240
I imagine that part is real.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.400
That's what inspired the film is that this Jamaican bobsled team, unlikely,

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.160
makes it to the finals. It's in the Olympics, their thing falls apart, and then they carry it across.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.160
I imagine if there's any truth to this, it's that.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.340
The bad guys become respectful friends, the Germans,

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.180
and Junior's father is there, wearing a Jamaican shirt, cheering them on.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.960
And they make it to the finish line.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.700
John Candy feels a sense of pride for having done something good,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.287
somehow redeeming himself for cheating all those years ago.

00:07:24.287 --> 00:07:29.040
Gets wrapped up very abruptly, and it wrapped up super Disney,

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:35.360
But I loved it! It was so feel-good! I love feel-good movies!

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.480
Oh my, I'm such a sucker for feel-good films, and this was definitely one of them.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.420
I didn't care that it was dated. I just, I just loved it.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.800
Lipstick on my egg.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.900
It's a real lucky egg.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.960
"It's a feature Disney film, not much in it actually happened in real life."

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.040
Oh, no!

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.220
"The team was recruited from the Jamaican army." They weren't track stars.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:07.720
Oh, "The movie also depicts the Jamaican bobsledders as outcasts, but in real life, they were welcomed warmly at the 1988 Olympics."

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.160
Well, they didn't carry it to the finish line.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:16.000
"Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme, get on up, it's bobsled time" was made up. That's disappointing.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.900
"You will relate so hard to the Calgary Airport scene."

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.040
Yes, Marissa.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:26.500
"You will find yourself far more moved by the ending that you would expect from a 90s comedy."

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.900
Yes. I...

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:34.420
wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much. A lot of people said that it was gonna be dated, which it totally is, but,

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.640
for some reason it just struck a chord, and I really enjoyed it.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.200
[laughing] "I'm not smoking, I'm breathing."

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.860
Yup! Chicago winter!

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.940
"Just prepare for a lot of Jamaican stereotypes and probably John Candy's best dramatic work."

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.060
I don't know what else I've seen John Candy in. I know that I have seen him in something else...

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.200
but I don't know what it was.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.040
And then, yes, there were a lot of Jamaican stereotypes. It was very...

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.460
Disney Jamaica.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.740
It wasn't, like, authentic Jamaica. It was very Disney Jamaica.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.460
Is it great?

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:11.940
"You'll want to do the non-sarcastic slow clap that people do at the end of inspirational sports movies.'

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.580
The slow clap in this was so insane.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:22.260
There's like hundreds of people just going like this very intensely into the camera, and it's a lot, and I loved it.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.160
I had a blast watching this.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.160
Thank you so much for watching this.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.160

So check out "Tamara's Never Seen" next week. I'll see y'all then. Bye!
