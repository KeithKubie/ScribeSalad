00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.481
The inflation rate in that country is so high that

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:08.541
even with adjusted wages, most workers can

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:15.448
barely pay for food, most workers can barely pay for food and shelter

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:16.510
and then no error.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.783
This one actually looks right.

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:21.687
So, the inflation rate in a country is so high, that

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:28.562
even with adjusted wages, most workers can barely pay for food and shelter.

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:29.952
Yeah, that feels right.

00:00:29.952 --> 00:00:31.461
I don't really see any real mistakes.

00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:32.416
It makes complete sense.

00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:38.953
The rate of inflation is so high, that most workers can barely get by.

00:00:38.953 --> 00:00:40.049
Uh, that makes a lot of sense.

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:43.151
I'll go with no error here.
