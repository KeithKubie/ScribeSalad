00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.070
 Now we'll use Green's Rhythm 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.200
 For solving some linear yojas. 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.950
 But, before showing the example I was one 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.960
 I want to make clear about Green's theorem. 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.310
 In the examples we have seen before, we used such a size, 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.970
 And the interior of the shape is always running in us 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:19.820
 The road was left. 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.940
 For all the examples I have turned clockwise and so on 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.800
 The size was always on our left-- that is, if we imagine it 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.120
 That's the way we are walking in that direction, but the size will always remain on our left. 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.910
 And in that case we can use Green's theorem. 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.880
 So, if we want to find linear yoga in this way, 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.010
 A closed linear yoga, but we marked him in this way 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.520
 Can do 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.900
 In some textbooks, it is f f (dot) of c 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:50.620
 The way is also marked. It actually indicates the size of the letter R
