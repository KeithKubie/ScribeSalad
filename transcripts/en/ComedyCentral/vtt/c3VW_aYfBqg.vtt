00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:07.340
-Okay, sir, here we are.
-Wait a minute.

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:09.876
-Where's the sliders?
-There are no sliders, sir.

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.512
We are not at a
chain restaurant.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:15.648
-We are at a psychologist's
office. -What?!

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.784
-Yes, sir. Sir, no.
-No way. No, no.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:19.085
-Sir, sit down. Listen.
-Mike.

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:20.920
-Sit down, Mike, sit down.
-Okay, okay.

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:23.790
Sir, people are saying you are
mentally unfit for the office,

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:25.725
and we both know
that's not true.

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:27.794
I'm incredibly mentally fit.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:30.129
My doctor said
I had the most neurons

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.998
of any person he had ever met.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.866
-I wish I had as many neurons.
-So many neurons.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.436
-You know, you can talk about
yourself the entire time. -Whoa.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.004
-I can talk about myself?
-Yeah.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:39.872
Yeah, you talk about yourself.

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:43.543
I'm totally sane, and I'm the
president of the United States.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.678 line:0%
Mr. Trump, I feel I need to
disclose to you

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:47.413 line:0%
that I'm the founder
of an organization

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:48.948 line:0%
called Duty to Warn.

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:51.451
-I don't care.
-Well, I think you should know

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.753
that our association
advocates your removal

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:55.388
under the 25th amendment

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:57.390
because we believe you're not
psychologically fit.

00:00:57.423 --> 00:01:00.426
Wrong, totally wrong.

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:03.763
You make a lot of grandiose and
paranoid-sounding statements,

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:06.866
-like you had the biggest
inauguration crowd. -Oh, yeah.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.168
And that Barack Obama
bugged your offices.

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.003
He's spying on everybody.

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:12.672
So here's my question:

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:15.208
do you really believe
those things you say?

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.710
No.

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:19.145
Yes.

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.114
Did I get it right?

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:25.184
It seems like you have an
unusual need for approval.

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:27.620
People must see Trump everywhere

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:29.722
because I grew up in Queens,

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:31.824
and then we went into Manhattan.

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:34.327
Everyone else in Manhattan
was rich,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.995
<i> and they went to the parties.</i>

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:37.964
<i> They went to Studio 54,</i>

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:40.433
<i> and they did coke off of
 Twiggy's asshole.</i>

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.401
I didn't get to do any of that.

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:44.804
I had to go to Studio 54
and stand in line.

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.873
One time, I met Andy Warhol

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:49.942
<i> and I thought that he was just
 a sheep skin rug.</i>

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:51.844
<i> I was always left out.</i>

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:53.546
<i> A doughy boy from Queens,</i>

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.216
with big, juicy, kissy-lips.

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:59.819
Well, I'm glad you can own some
of that insecurity.

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:01.420
Is it okay
that I've been farting

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:03.055
in the sofa the whole time?

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:05.024
-That's okay, let's move on.
-Yeah.

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:06.526
Tell me a little
about your mother.

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:09.195
Mommy had the best hair,
toughest hair.

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:11.664
<i> You could throw a rock at it,
 it would bounce right off.</i>

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:14.333
<i> She was a tough woman.
 Very tough.</i>

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:16.869
But what are we doing when
we're hiding from Mommy?

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:19.005
You know, when Mom's
out of the keefu,

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:22.041
<i> and I'm around the corner
 trying to get my pug yanked</i>

00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:25.411
<i> by whatever girl I went to
 school with in some alley,</i>

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:27.380
<i> and then you come home and you
 see Mommy and you go,</i>

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:29.815
<i> "I did a dirty thing
 and Mommy can't know.‚Äù</i>

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:32.351
And I control Mommy then.

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:34.754
It does seem like control
is a large part of this.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:36.722
I'm not gonna change,
I'll say that.

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:38.391
That might be part
of the problem.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:39.859
I'm a tough guy.

00:02:39.892 --> 00:02:42.428
And my father was a tough guy.

00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:43.996
Yeah, tell me more about that.

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.165
The guy was so tough,
he used to say,

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:48.067
"You got to be a killer.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.403
<i> In order to be king,
 you got to be a killer.</i>

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.438
<i> You got to be be a king.
 You got to be a killer.</i>

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:54.173
<i> You got to be the king.
 You got to be the killer.</i>

00:02:54.206 --> 00:02:55.608
<i> Got to be the king.</i>

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:58.010
I know, Daddy.
I know, Daddy.

00:02:58.043 --> 00:03:00.046
I know I need to.

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.014
The killer.

00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:04.917
(echoing):
The killer.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.886
(groaning)

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:14.093
(echoing):
What's wrong with you?

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:16.028
I felt something.

00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:18.030
Mr. Trump, where did you just go
just now?

00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:20.199
My dad was saying
I'm the killer and the king.

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:22.935
And then I pinched myself
to feel pain.

00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:24.537
Look, Mr. Trump,

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.772
I really need to confront you
with a few things.

00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:29.575
I don't see that you really have
control over your impulses.

00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:31.110
Wrong.

00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:35.615
I think you suffer from three
serious personality disorders.

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:37.550
-Narcissistic.
-Who, me?

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:39.185
-Antisocial.
-Shut up.

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:41.220
-And paranoid.
-Who told you?

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:43.189
And to make matters worse,
I think you have grandiose

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:44.957
and persecutory delusions.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.892
Are you saying that my behavior

00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:48.594
is out of my own control

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:50.129
because I'm so divorced

00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:52.398
-from my own personality?
-Exactly.

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:55.067
So that means I'm not
responsible for what I do?

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.336
-No, that's not what I'm saying.
-Wow! Thanks, Doc.

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.538
That's perfect diagnosis.

00:03:59.571 --> 00:04:01.607
Check'll be in the mail.
Yeah, right.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.442
Mike, I'm crazy.

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:05.411
-I'm not responsible, Mike.
-For what?

00:04:05.444 --> 00:04:07.413
-What are you talking about?
-Mike, I'm not responsible!

00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:09.749
-Oh!
-I'm not responsible, Mike.

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:12.285
It's not my fault.
I'm just crazy.

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:14.820
-It's not my fault.
I'm nuts! -PENCE: Come back.

00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:16.922
-I'm not responsible
for what I do. -Sir. Sir.

00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:19.225
-Sir. Sir, please... -This lady,
give me your groceries.

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:21.327
-No, sir, please don't. No, no.
-Give me your groceries.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.029
I'm nuts, I'm crazy,
I don't care.

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:24.597
-Kid, give me your little bunny.
-(shrieks)

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.399
Give me that bunny.
Child care.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.467
Child, I don't give a shit!

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.269
Goddamn bunny.

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:32.305
Hey, lady, nice purse.

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:34.240
Yeah, give me your purse,
give me your purse.

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:35.975
-Give me your purse.
-Sir. Sir, no, please.

00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:38.210
-Here you go.
-I lost my mind!

00:04:38.243 --> 00:04:40.880
Wow, I'm crazy!
I love it.

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.849
Whoa, wait a minute.

00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:48.521
-He's got a gun!
-I'm crazy!

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:51.057
I'm crazy! I'm crazy!

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.091
