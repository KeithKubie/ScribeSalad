00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:02.790
- [Instructor] We're
told that six identical

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.600
potato core cubes were
isolated from a potato.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.680
The initial weight of
each cube was recorded.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.640
Each cube was then placed
in one of six open beakers,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.840
each containing a
different sucrose solution.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.510
The cubes remained in
the beakers for 24 hours

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.080
at a constant temperature
of 23 degrees Celsius.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.670
After 24 hours, the cubes were removed

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.810
from the beakers, blotted, and reweighed.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.830
The percent change in mass,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.490
due to a net gain or loss of water,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.500
was calculated for each cube,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.460
and the results are shown
in the graph to the right,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.370
so, this graph right over here.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.990
A straight line is drawn

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.957
on the graph to help estimate results

00:00:43.957 --> 00:00:47.453
from other sucrose
concentrations not tested.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.220
Using the straight line on the graph,

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.530
calculate the water potential, in bars,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.400
of the potato core cubes
at 23 degrees Celsius.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.220
Give your answer to one decimal place.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.660
So, pause this video and see
if you can work that out.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.020
All right, so, first, let's just make sure

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.100
we're understanding what's going on here.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.640
So, there was a potato.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.330
We took six cubes from that potato

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.650
and we stuck those six cubes

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.960
into six different sucrose
molarity solutions,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.000
and so, this data point right over here,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.470
this was the situation where
we took one of the cubes,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.250
so, this was a sucrose solution.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.670
This was a solution, actually,
that contained no sucrose,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.140
and so, when we put the
cube in that solution,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.930
we saw a net gain of mass.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.170
It looks like it's about 22% gain in mass,

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.310
and so, that would have happened

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.190
because water would have
flowed into the cube.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.570
Now, at the other
extreme, right over here,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.650
this is a solution that
has a lot of sucrose.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.140
It had a very high sucrose concentration,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.350
and when we put a cube in there,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.630
we see that the mass of
that cube went down by 25%,

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.590
and that would have been

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.590
because of the net outflow
of water from that cube.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.330
So, how do we figure
out the water potential

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.910
of the core cubes at 23 degrees Celsius?

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.940
Well, we could think about a situation

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.980
where there's some sucrose
concentration where,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.900
if the cube and the sucrose solution

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.320
have the same water potential,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.700
then you're not going to have
any net inflow or outflow,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.370
and so, where do we see that on the graph?

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.750
Well, what we'd wanna
do, we have that line

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.780
where they're trying
to fit the data points,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.610
and so, where would we expect
to see 0% change in mass?

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.560
So, we would go right over
here to 0% change in mass.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.510
We would go to the line right over there,

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.090
and then, we see that this line would say

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.710
that there's a 0% change in mass.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.820
See, if this is 0.4 right over here,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.770
this is 0.5 right over here,

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.770
so, this is about a 0.44
molar sucrose solution,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.500
0.44 molar solution.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.000
So, if we can figure
out the water potential

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.930
of this 0.44 molar sucrose solution,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:18.970
well, that's also going to be

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.480
the water potential of the potato cubes.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.200
Well, how do we do that?

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.810
Well, we've seen the equation before

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.140
where we introduced ourselves

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.900
to the idea of water potential,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.980
that water potential,
using the Greek letter psi,

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.200
is going to be equal
to the solute potential

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.680
plus the pressure potential.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.530
Now, we're dealing with
all open containers.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.370
We don't have anything that's some piston

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.960
or something that's pressing
down on these containers,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.380
and so, because of that,

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.370
the pressure potential is
going to be equal to zero,

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.210
and so, we just have to figure
out the solute potential.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.690
So, the solute potential,
we have introduced ourselves

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.670
to this formula in previous videos.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.670
It's negative i times C times R times T.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.660
This i right over here, this
is our ionization constant.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.720
This is, since we're dealing
with sucrose solutions,

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.900
it says okay, if I took
sucrose and put it into water,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.700
every one of those sucrose molecules,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.670
does it stay one molecule,
or does it disassociate?

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.420
Well, sucrose doesn't disassociate at all.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.130
It just stays one molecule,
so, this would be one.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.020
If we were dealing with,
say, sodium chloride,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.410
each sodium chloride
molecule would disassociate

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.360
into a sodium ion and a chloride ion,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.500
and so, then, this would be two,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.980
but this was one for sucrose.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.480
C is the molarity of our solution,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.690
and so, we estimated that to be 0.44,

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.590
so, let me write this down.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.870
Our solute water potential is going

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.260
to be equal to negative one times 0.4,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.260
0.44, I should say, and
that's going to be moles.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.410
I'll write out all the units.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.810
Moles per liter times,
it's sometimes called

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.250
the pressure constant in this context,

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.680
but this is also the
universal gas constant,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.420
and if you were doing
something like the AP exam,

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.260
they would give you what this is.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.823
So, this is 0.0831 liters times bars,

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.900
all of that over mole Kelvin.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.820
If you're used to seeing
other values of this,

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.180
it's probably because they're dealing

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.700
with other units right over here,

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.550
but this is the universal gas constant.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.490
And then, we have to multiply that times

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.750
the temperature that we're
dealing with in Kelvin.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.420
Now, it's 23 degrees Celsius.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.080
To convert to Kelvin, we just add to 273,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.080
so, 273 plus 23 is going
to be 296, 296 Kelvin,

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.740
and so, this is going to be equal to,

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.090
we have a negative here, and
we could look at the units.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.820
We have the liter canceling out liters,

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.360
moles canceling out with moles,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.090
Kelvin canceling out with Kelvin,

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.030
so, we're going to get something
in bars, which makes sense.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.740
That is the unit for our water potential.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.463
And then, we get the calculator out.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.630
So, we have 0.44 times
0.831 times 296, 296,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.630
is equal to, and they want us

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.640
to round our answer to one decimal place,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.990
so, approximately 10.8,

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.860
and we already had that
negative out front,

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.503
so, negative 10.8 bars, and we're done.
