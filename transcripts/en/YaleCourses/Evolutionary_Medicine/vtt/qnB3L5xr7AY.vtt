00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.760
Drug addiction is a disease and it's a mental disease,

2
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.880
the leading explanations or hijacking and prior self medication.

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.540
Most people think of it as hijacking the innate reward and pain suppression

4
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:21.410
systems are involved in generating this kind of vulnerability.

5
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.900
So one way of looking at drug addiction is,

6
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:30.080
is hijacking the reward system that we have built into us to shape our own

7
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:30.914
behavior.

8
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.970
Another possibility is that it is the consequence of the history of selected

9
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:40.280
self medication with plant compounds.

10
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.610
There is genetic variation in susceptibility to addiction,

11
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.860
which means that it could be responding to selection in contemporary
populations.

12
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.820
Let's take a look at the innate reward systems to see how evolution may have set

13
00:00:56.821 --> 00:01:01.821
us up to be vulnerable to hijacking are two kinds of rewards systems and there

14
00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:06.060
are two types of pleasure sensations.
One rewards,

15
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:09.150
anticipation and the other one rewards satisfaction.

16
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.410
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

17
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.410
<v 0>anticipation is rewarded by the dopamine urging pathways that control appetite,</v>

18
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.460
epic editive behavior

19
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.900
satisfaction is rewarded by the opioid pathways that control consumptive

20
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:25.490
behaviors and suppress pain.

21
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.533
<v 1>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.870
<v 0>Dopaminergic pathways are targeted by psycho stimulants like cocaine and</v>

23
00:01:31.871 --> 00:01:36.790
methamphetamine speed.
They counteract frustration,
depression,

24
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.750
and despair.

25
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.510
Opioid pathways are targeted by opium and heroin.
They counteract hunger,

26
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.950
thirst,
and pain.

27
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.950
Both systems are based on feed forward and negative feedback circuits of

28
00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:55.270
homeostasis.
The topo been urgent.

29
00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.290
Reward system is centered on the nucleus accumbens and it receives inputs from

30
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:08.370
the medial prefrontal cortex from the anterior singular cortex,

31
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.880
from the orbital frontal Cortex,
and from the hippocampus.

32
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.380
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

33
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.090
<v 0>it is centered on transcription factor Delta Foss B that's expressed in the</v>

34
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:23.170
ventral tegmental area of the nucleus accumbens in the in the nucleus accumbens

35
00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:25.660
and the in part of the prefrontal cortex.

36
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.253
<v 1>Okay.</v>

37
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.430
<v 0>Addictive drugs rewire this reward circuitry and enhance expression of Delta</v>

38
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.050
Foss B and that produces a feeling of pleasure.

39
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.880
The opioid rewards system elicits the pleasure of satisfaction,

40
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:43.970
whether that's caused by food consumption or by pain relief.

41
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.260
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.260
<v 0>The pituitary gland can produce neuropeptides called endorphins that act like</v>

43
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:55.220
opioids inhibiting pain signals in producing a feeling of euphoria.

44
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.270
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.910
<v 0>Endorphins can be released as part of the fight or flight response in</v>

46
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:02.950
anticipation of possible pain.

47
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.100
How has the reward system hijacked?
Well,

48
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.020
opioids like morphine and heroin activate the receptors that mediate natural

49
00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:13.920
endorphin signaling.

50
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.190
Cocaine inhibits stole from me and re uptake transports stimulating dopaminergic

51
00:03:20.191 --> 00:03:24.750
rewards and nicotine binds to asset teal Coleen receptors,

52
00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:25.231
the trigger,

53
00:03:25.231 --> 00:03:28.770
the release of dopamine in the ventral tegmental and adrenaline and the

54
00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:29.630
adrenaline Mandala.

55
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.920
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

56
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.590
<v 0>alcohol enhances the binding of glutamate.</v>

57
00:03:34.591 --> 00:03:39.591
Triggering is an expression of Delta Foss B and the activity of nicotine urging

58
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.100
nicotinic acid [inaudible] Coleen receptors that triggers the release of

59
00:03:44.101 --> 00:03:44.934
dopamine,

60
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.390
so you can see that many of these drugs are triggering receptors that result in

61
00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:55.200
the release of dopamine.

62
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.500
Amphetamines have many effects including enhancing the expression of Delta Foss

63
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.910
B which is a central player.

64
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.980
They all set in motion events that lead to the sensation of pleasure,

65
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.950
the cessation of pain or both.

66
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.710
Another hypothesis for why drug addiction exists is that we have an evolutionary

67
00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:22.590
history of self medicating with plant compounds.

68
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.870
Both primates and insects that are infected with pathogens consume plants

69
00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:30.300
containing compounds that have curative effects.

70
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.530
The self medication hypothesis posits that humans have long been exposed by

71
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.540
plant compounds with curative properties,

72
00:04:39.541 --> 00:04:43.620
have sought them out when infected and have evolved to reward system that

73
00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:47.640
motivates them to seek out such planned compounds when if it went infected.

74
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.380
There was some preliminary evidence that suggest that tobacco smoke can reduce

75
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:55.050
worm burden,
but much more work is needed.

76
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.530
Humans very genetically in their susceptibility to addiction.

77
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.180
There are genotypes that are much more susceptible than others.

78
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.280
Addictive substances are sensed by the receptors and processed by the enzymes

79
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.900
that also deal with drugs.

80
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.360
Humans therefore very genetically and their susceptibility to drug addiction

81
00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:24.090
just as they do when their ability to process drugs,

82
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.100
the heritability of susceptibility to addictive agencies.
Hi,

83
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.440
here's an example.

84
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.290
This is the heritability of susceptibility,
for example,
to hello synogen.

85
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.170
It's about 0.4 to sedatives.

86
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.350
It's about 0.55 and to cocaine it's about 0.7 so that means that there is a lot

87
00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:54.990
of genetic variation out there in the population for susceptibility to teach

88
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.780
these sorts of drugs.
This mean that people are more susceptible to cocaine.

89
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:04.310
It means that there's more variation for susceptibility to cocaine addiction.

90
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.460
So to summarize,
drug addiction results from ingesting substances,

91
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.720
the trigger systems that evolve to shape adaptive behaviors through the reward

92
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:17.150
of pleasure and the suppression of pain.

93
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.000
Such exposure may be an evolutionary novelty or an experience with an

94
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:24.050
evolutionary history.

95
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.480
Addiction illustrates the principle that every adaptive system contains a

96
00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:33.500
vulnerability that can permit the expression of a disease,

97
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.320
such vulnerabilities,
often very genetically among individuals.
