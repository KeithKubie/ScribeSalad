00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.960
I've rewritten Stokes'
theorem right over here.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.070
What I want to focus
on in this video

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.680
is the question of
orientation because there

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.360
are two different orientations
for our boundary curve.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.080
We could go in that
direction like that,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.140
or we could go in the
opposite direction.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.050
We could be going like that.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.110
And there are also two
different orientations

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.510
for this normal vector.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.840
The normal vector might
pop out like that,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.580
or it could actually go
into the surface like that.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.466
So we have to make sure that
our orientations are consistent,

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.840
and what I want
to do is give you

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.570
two different ways
of thinking about it.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.480
And you might think
of others, but these

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.850
are the ones that work for me.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.080
In order for Stokes'
theorem to hold,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.400
we have to make sure
that we're not actually

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.410
picking the negative of one
or the other orientations.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.510
And so the easiest way
for me to remember--

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.420
it is if our normal
vector is-- let's say,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.890
it goes in that direction.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.540
And if you have some
hypothetical person traversing

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.450
the boundary of our surface,
and their direction is pointed.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.620
And their head is pointed
in the same direction

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.520
as the normal vector-- so
this is the normal vector.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.980
So their head is pointed
in the exact same direction

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.990
as the normal vector-- or you
could say maybe their body

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.060
or, really, their head--

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.120
So that's them.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.670
Then the direction that you
would have to actually traverse

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.360
the boundary is the direction
that would allow this person

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.460
to keep the surface
to their left.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.770
So over here, he would have
to go in this direction

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.180
in order to keep the
surface to his left.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.950
So he would have to
go just like that.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.110
If we oriented the
surface differently-- so

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.650
let me redraw the
surface right over

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.440
here and draw similar surface.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.940
So if we had a surface-- so
this surface looks very similar.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.830
This is a very similar
looking surface

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.103
that I'm drawing
right over here just

00:01:51.103 --> 00:01:53.189
to give a idea of
some of the contours.

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.730
But if we said that the normal
vector for this surface, if we

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.190
orient it in the opposite
way-- so if we said

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.260
that the normal vector here
was actually pointing downward

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.380
like that, then
we would have to,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.370
in order for Stokes'
theorem to hold,

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.110
we would have to
traverse the boundary

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.280
in a different direction
because, once again, if I draw

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.870
my little character
right over here,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.850
his head is pointed in the
direction of the normal vector.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.730
He is now upside down.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.430
So let me draw him.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.667
So this is him running
right over here.

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:24.750
I could draw a better job.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.100
This is him running
right over here.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.500
Now, in order to keep--
and from his point of view,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.870
this would kind of look
like a some type of a pool

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.890
or a ditch of some kind.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.980
It would actually go down.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.500
Here, it looks
like a hill to him.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.300
But since he's
upside down, in order

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.900
for him to keep the
boundary to his left,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.050
he would have to now go
in the other direction.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.810
So depending on the orientation
of your normal vector, which

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.500
is really the orientation
of your actual surface,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.157
will dictate how you need
to traverse the path.

00:02:57.157 --> 00:02:59.240
Now, another way to think
about it-- and this idea

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.310
was introduced by one of
the viewers on YouTube,

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.160
but it's a valid way
of thinking about it--

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.390
is to imagine that the
surface is a bottle cap.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.130
And so let me draw some
type of a bottle over here.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.870
So I'll draw.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.300
Let me draw a bottle.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.230
You could imagine some type
of a glass soda bottle.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.970
So what we really care about
is the cap of the bottle--

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.950
so make it feel like it's glass.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.670
So there, that's our bottle,
And let me draw its cap.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.340
Let me draw the
cap of the bottle

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.290
because that's
what we care about.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.630
We can kind of imagine
that being the surface.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.066
So this is the
cap of our bottle,

00:03:42.066 --> 00:03:43.690
and you just need to
think about, well,

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.210
which way would I have
to twist the cap in order

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.535
to make the cap move up, in
order to take the cap off.

00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:51.910
And you could think of the
normal vector as the direction

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.430
that the cap would move, and
the twisting is the direction

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.300
that you would have
to traverse the path.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.756
So you would have to
twist the bottle that way,

00:04:01.756 --> 00:04:03.380
or you could think
about the other way.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.046
If you twisted the
bottle the other way,

00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:06.320
then the cap would move down.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.770
So the normal vector
is the direction

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.250
that the cap would
move, and the direction

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.800
that you would traverse
the boundary is

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.238
how you would actually twist it.

00:04:15.238 --> 00:04:17.279
So either of these are
ways of thinking about it,

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.320
but they're important to
keep in mind, especially

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.480
once the shapes start
getting a little bit more

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.600
convoluted and oriented
in strange ways.
