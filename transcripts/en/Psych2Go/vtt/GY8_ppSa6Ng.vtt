Hi guys, its Imogen here.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.780
I'm the manager of the exciting Psych2Go magazine.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.429
And with all of your love and ongoing support,
we've managed to just release the 12th edition

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.300
of the Psych2Go magazine and Iâ€™ve got a
copy of it here to show you.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:30.010
So, the 12th magazine is on Obsessive-compulsive
Personality Disorder and it's the fourth magazine

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.590
in our many series on personality disorders.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.640
The quality of the physical copies is just
really good and the arts and articles are

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.870
just amazing.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.800
So here's an example of some of the artwork
in our magazine.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.180
And because we're so excited about this edition
of our magazine, we've decided to give away

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.780
digital copies for free.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.770
The link to get your free digital copy is
in the description.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:14.259

input "Issue12" with no spaces at checkout

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:21.750
and you'll get 100% off or if you prefer physical
copies like personally I do, I much prefer

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.520
the physical copies of things, you can also
buy them from our store.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.709
As well as our store, we've also got a Patreon
which is how you can pre-order future issues

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:40.039
of the magazine and also how you can support us
so we can pay our staff and also produce these

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.420
high quality copies of the magazine.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:51.439
So, this magazine is 84 pages long and it's
got some of the best articles and the best

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.990
artwork out there.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.579
