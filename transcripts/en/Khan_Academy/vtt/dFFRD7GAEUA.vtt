00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.249
- [Voiceover] Serious
question, grammarians.

00:00:02.249 --> 00:00:06.255
What's the difference between me and you?

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:09.683
Well, in order to get, I mean
I don't mean that, you know,

00:00:09.683 --> 00:00:12.599
in a snarky way, I mean that
in like a conceptual way.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.339
What's the difference, in
terms of these two pronouns,

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:16.442
what separates them?

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:18.287
Well, one's about me and one's about you,

00:00:18.287 --> 00:00:21.387
but that seems kind of like
a pretty easy distinction

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:23.606
that's right there on
the face of it, right.

00:00:24.626 --> 00:00:28.144
English, like other
languages, has this thing

00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:30.945
that grammarians call person.

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:33.301
Obviously, we all know what a person is,

00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:36.785
it's a human being, but person
as a grammatical concept

00:00:36.785 --> 00:00:40.927
is a way of distinguishing between me,

00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:43.290
you and everybody else.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.664
In fact, we have special terms for this.

00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:56.664
So, any group containing
me is the first person.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.583
Any group containing you
is the second person,

00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:04.787
and everybody else falls
into the third person.

00:01:06.737 --> 00:01:10.676
So, whenever I talk about, you
know, third person singular,

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:13.642
or first person plural,
all I'm really doing

00:01:13.642 --> 00:01:16.390
is going back to these
columns of, am I involved,

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.463
are you involved, or is
everybody else involved?

00:01:19.453 --> 00:01:24.020
Right, so both me and us

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.830
or I and we

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.536
are first person pronouns,

00:01:30.536 --> 00:01:32.246
because they're about me

00:01:32.246 --> 00:01:34.503
or a group that contains me.

00:01:34.503 --> 00:01:37.899
Likewise, you is the second person.

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.408
That's kind of it, both
singular and plural.

00:01:41.408 --> 00:01:46.308
Everybody else, that's
he, she, they, them,

00:01:46.308 --> 00:01:51.308
everybody, it, nothing,

00:01:53.082 --> 00:01:55.964
everything that is
neither me nor you falls

00:01:55.964 --> 00:01:58.801
into the everybody else
third person category.

00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:01.825
So, let's say you were giving someone

00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:04.508
advice in a kind of sideways way,

00:02:04.508 --> 00:02:09.508
like, one ought not to place

00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:14.138
one's hands

00:02:16.308 --> 00:02:18.008
on a hot stove.

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:25.201
Alright, the temptation
might be, in some cases,

00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:27.872
you might forget what
pronoun you started out with.

00:02:27.872 --> 00:02:32.248
One is a third person pronoun

00:02:32.248 --> 00:02:34.398
and the temptation might

00:02:34.398 --> 00:02:36.700
sometimes be, you know,
you forget about it,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.030
sounds like you're
saying, a piece of advice,

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.030
one ought not to place

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.689
your hands

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.569
on a hot stove.

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.560
Well, you know, I mean this
is still not a good idea

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.895
to put your hands on a hot stove,

00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:01.459
but you have to remember
which, what you're

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.491
trying to connect here.

00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:05.314
This is a third person pronoun

00:03:05.314 --> 00:03:09.210
and this is a second person pronoun,

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.271
and the two of them do not match up,

00:03:11.271 --> 00:03:13.760
they do not, as we say in grammar,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.650
agree, sad face.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.993
So, what you need to take care to do

00:03:19.993 --> 00:03:21.615
is to make sure that if
you're, if you start off

00:03:21.615 --> 00:03:23.577
talking about one, even if you're being

00:03:23.577 --> 00:03:26.051
kind of silly and pompous,
you've got to stick with one.

00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:28.932
If you start out talking about you,

00:03:28.932 --> 00:03:32.964
you got to stick with you,

00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:34.955
or I guess I could have
changed this back to one

00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:37.810
but I wanted to pop with the pink.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.564
Because if you don't do
this, then you run the risk

00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:45.766
of being confusing and unclear.

00:03:45.766 --> 00:03:47.459
So, you have to make sure that

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.061
if you start off using
one grammatical person,

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:51.417
you have to maintain use
of that grammatical person

00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:55.691
for as long as you're talking
about the same notion,

00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:57.867
the same idea, the same person.

00:03:57.867 --> 00:03:59.893
I used to take harmony singing classes

00:03:59.893 --> 00:04:02.720
at the Old Town School
of Folk Music in Chicago

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.989
and I had this instructor
who said that the best way

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.369
to sing harmony was to
remember to stay in your lane

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:15.580
and I think that's a good way to conceive

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.458
how to think about grammatical person

00:04:20.458 --> 00:04:23.615
is if you start in one lane,

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:28.230
don't cross over by the
end of the sentence.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.198
Begin, begin your sentence in
the same lane as you started.

00:04:34.698 --> 00:04:38.055
You can learn anything, David out.
