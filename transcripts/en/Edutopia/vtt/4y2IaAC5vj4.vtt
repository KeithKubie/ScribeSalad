00:00:02.956 --> 00:00:05.986
&gt;&gt;Steve: My name is Steve Mattice,
I'm a math and science teacher here

00:00:05.986 --> 00:00:07.246
at Roosevelt Middle School.

00:00:07.546 --> 00:00:09.906
I have been teaching for
about seven years now.

00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:12.436
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Steve had a problem.

00:00:12.916 --> 00:00:15.646
His classroom was too
small for the 36 students

00:00:15.646 --> 00:00:17.286
who poured in and out every period.

00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:21.756
And too cramped to accommodate the
student-to-student collaboration he

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:23.346
knew encouraged deeper learning.

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.696
&gt;&gt;Steve: They're extending
this knowledge

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:28.926
when they're working together,
they're happier and more positive

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:31.256
and more likely to participate.

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:33.136
I've got a lot of kids
and a lot of desks.

00:00:33.546 --> 00:00:38.536
Things pile up very quickly, kids
can sort of pile up quickly in here.

00:00:38.536 --> 00:00:41.686
And the maneuverability of this
room is not always fantastic.

00:00:42.406 --> 00:00:45.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Then he met the folks
at the "Third Teacher Plus,"

00:00:45.806 --> 00:00:49.386
whose job it is to help educators
re-imagine their learning spaces.

00:00:49.446 --> 00:00:51.606
See how they all took
on the challenge

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:55.456
of remaking Steve's classroom to be
a home for exploration, creativity

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:56.686
and better communication.

00:00:58.386 --> 00:01:00.426
&gt;&gt;Christian: Teachers around the
country will totally identify

00:01:00.806 --> 00:01:04.436
with this classroom, an incredible
number of kids and limited space.

00:01:05.606 --> 00:01:07.126
So one of the things
we're going to be looking

00:01:07.206 --> 00:01:09.226
at is how does Steve move
around the classroom.

00:01:09.826 --> 00:01:12.596
&gt;&gt;I'm Christian Long, and I was
a high school English teacher

00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:13.796
for about 15 years.

00:01:14.236 --> 00:01:17.246
As a member of the "Third Teacher
Plus," our job is to create spaces

00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:18.056
that allow the people

00:01:18.056 --> 00:01:20.056
to be remarkable students,
remarkable educators.

00:01:20.656 --> 00:01:22.886
&gt;&gt;Melanie: When people
think design a lot of times,

00:01:22.886 --> 00:01:25.856
they think veneer,
they think decorating.

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:29.566
Yeah, we want it to look
better, but unless we can change

00:01:29.716 --> 00:01:32.586
and facilitate a really
productive classroom,

00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:34.226
then we're not really
making a difference.

00:01:34.926 --> 00:01:37.426
&gt;&gt;I'm Melanie Kale, and I'm a
Design and Learning Strategist

00:01:37.426 --> 00:01:38.566
at the "Third Teacher Plus."

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:43.426
We're going into a classroom
identifying things that work,

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:44.956
and things that could work better.

00:01:45.156 --> 00:01:47.776
Taking a thousand dollars,
a designer's eye,

00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:49.636
a lot of community resources.

00:01:49.636 --> 00:01:52.976
We try to match the physical
classroom environment

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:54.686
to teaching and learning goals.

00:01:55.446 --> 00:01:58.976
In one weekend, we
hopefully realize them.

00:02:11.116 --> 00:02:13.006
&gt;&gt;Christian: So, Steven, tell us
a little about this classroom,

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.236
how it works, how it's laid out.

00:02:14.346 --> 00:02:17.116
&gt;&gt;Steve: There's very little room
to sort of move through the middle,

00:02:17.256 --> 00:02:20.146
so I kind of stay on the outskirts
when I do have to move around.

00:02:20.146 --> 00:02:24.736
I've got 36 kids, plus
backpacks, books, jackets.

00:02:24.956 --> 00:02:27.236
There's so much stuff
just within the aisles.

00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:30.786
Just trying to get through is almost
like trying to get through rush hour.

00:02:30.786 --> 00:02:34.136
&gt;&gt;Melanie: In your world here, what
is crucial that you have up here

00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:35.956
to be successful in class?

00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:37.406
&gt;&gt;Steve: I use the ELMO
or the overhead a lot.

00:02:37.696 --> 00:02:39.296
Just for more direct teaching.

00:02:39.296 --> 00:02:42.576
The ELMO is a document camera
that connects to a projector

00:02:42.576 --> 00:02:46.196
and projects anything that I'm
writing up onto the screen.

00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:48.086
It's not a big workspace.

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:52.956
Like obviously, I've got a
stool here to sort of make-do.

00:02:52.956 --> 00:02:54.396
I do "McGuiver" this stuff.

00:02:54.396 --> 00:02:56.396
&gt;&gt;Christian: What we're hoping
to do here with Steven's class is

00:02:56.396 --> 00:02:58.766
to really support this
idea of collaboration.

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:02.116
He's got to focus on teams, so
you see these groupings of four.

00:03:02.116 --> 00:03:04.396
But at the same time,
there's very little room

00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:05.906
from grouping to grouping.

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:14.876
&gt;&gt;Melanie: So the workshop
we ran on Monday,

00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:18.396
the goal is to get a
pulse on the students.

00:03:18.676 --> 00:03:20.706
See how they collaborate
with one another,

00:03:20.886 --> 00:03:23.846
see how they interact
with other adults.

00:03:24.686 --> 00:03:27.706
A lot of times words don't
encapsulate what we're thinking.

00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:31.966
So we created a gallery wall for
them to facilitate visual listening.

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:35.106
The visual listening wall
has hundreds of photos.

00:03:35.106 --> 00:03:38.896
It can be any size, and we
give them dots to vote with.

00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:43.226
It allows us to quickly take the
pulse of what their eye is drawn to,

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:45.746
place they want to learn in, a
place they want to hang out in,

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:47.316
a place that just looks cool.

00:03:47.316 --> 00:03:48.876
&gt;&gt;Let's hear about it.

00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:50.926
&gt;&gt;Student: We'd be like
learning from each other,

00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:54.966
or as like not just learning based
on one thing like from a book.

00:03:55.716 --> 00:03:57.496
&gt;&gt;Melanie: And what we noticed
with them is they like sitting

00:03:57.496 --> 00:03:59.976
in their groups of four,
but they want to feel

00:03:59.976 --> 00:04:01.266
like they're a part of a whole.

00:04:01.566 --> 00:04:04.856
So in this class, we're
considering the perimeter,

00:04:04.856 --> 00:04:07.016
we're considering how we
can add more mobility.

00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:11.686
While we might not have a plan right
this moment, we know our priorities.

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:18.896
To help make teachers better
designers, we ask teachers

00:04:18.896 --> 00:04:20.776
to invite critical
friends into their room.

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:23.866
That might mean another teacher in
the same department, another teacher

00:04:23.866 --> 00:04:27.266
in a different department,
or their architect friend

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:28.096
from down the street.

00:04:28.096 --> 00:04:30.896
We do this thing called
a solution session

00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:36.436
to create really concrete areas that
we can prioritize and make happen.

00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:39.336
This session is really
about putting some specifics

00:04:39.336 --> 00:04:42.896
on what we think can really make a
difference for your everyday life.

00:04:42.946 --> 00:04:45.346
And on Monday morning, you have
to have a classroom to teach in.

00:04:46.066 --> 00:04:46.986
We set up a big board.

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:48.656
It kind of becomes our shared brain.

00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:51.536
It's a place where we can visualize
all the things that we're thinking.

00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:55.836
We identified a handful of key areas
that we were going to focus on:

00:04:55.916 --> 00:05:01.816
Display; Storage; Furniture;
Teaching Zone; Personality.

00:05:02.336 --> 00:05:04.056
And we picked those spatial areas

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:07.526
so that we can create
concrete solutions around them.

00:05:07.526 --> 00:05:11.176
We asked Steven to
help us identify things

00:05:11.176 --> 00:05:13.116
that he thinks are going
to make a big impact.

00:05:13.116 --> 00:05:14.116
&gt;&gt;Student: First things that kind

00:05:14.116 --> 00:05:18.176
of caught my eye were the
teacher desk as a DJ Dashboard.

00:05:18.776 --> 00:05:21.776
The positioning of the desks,
I think, could be re-imagined.

00:05:22.036 --> 00:05:25.026
Pull the doors off the cabinets.

00:05:25.026 --> 00:05:26.916
Activate the back wall.

00:05:27.046 --> 00:05:28.896
The things that the
designers are going to do

00:05:28.896 --> 00:05:30.996
in this class have
sort of opened my eyes.

00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:34.176
The insights that they've
shared have made me think

00:05:34.176 --> 00:05:37.366
about things I wouldn't
ever have thought about.
