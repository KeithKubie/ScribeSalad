00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.310
Believe it or not, the way you perceive taste is

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.780
in fact determined genetically a lot of times because it

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.600
has to do with your taste bud receptors. But not

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.050
all traits can easily be distinguished as visible or hidden.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.300
&gt;&gt; That's true, and sometimes it can be really

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.050
hard to tell. Let's take Andy here for example.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.610
&gt;&gt; Hi Andy.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:18.880
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.395
&gt;&gt; You see these beautiful big blue eyes?

00:00:21.395 --> 00:00:23.270
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.850
So the presence of these big blue eyes are obviously a visible trait.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.010
&gt;&gt; But there's something about Andy that you

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.030
may not suspect, and we can't see on

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.770
the outside. If we had an x-ray machine,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.660
and we looked inside the mid-section of his body,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.290
we would be able to see that his

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.580
organs are actually flipped the opposite direction from most

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.340
people. This is a syndrome called Situs Inversus,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.330
where all of the organs are flipped, left-right to

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.610
be the opposite symmetry.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.100
&gt;&gt; Now you'd never know this about Andy because this

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.130
is a trait that's not easily visible by the unaided eye.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.240
&gt;&gt; So why don't you actually think about two

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.750
traits you have, one that's visible and one that's

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.420
hidden, and enter them text boxes here. And if

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.950
you can, try to limit your respnses to one word.
