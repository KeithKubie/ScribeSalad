1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,190
The Joe Rogan experience.
I did have,

2
00:00:03,191 --> 00:00:05,310
I did a good practical joke
at that place one time.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,070
There's this comedian named James Sibley.
Great Guy. Very funny southern dude. Uh,

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,050
we were sharing a condo somewhere,
I think in myrtle beach. And uh,

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,710
as a joke,

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,810
I thought it'd be funny when he's leaving
to put a condom wrapper in his bag

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,860
and I go,
ha,

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,530
tell him how you so fast.
So I did that.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,210
Right. And they did this happen to
you? Okay. No. Okay. So he goes away.

10
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:40,380
I don't see him for a year or two,
maybe three. And he's divorced now.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,190
Well, the first thing he did, this is
Atlanta punchline he walked up to is like,

12
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:47,070
you motherfucker, you know what you did
to me. You want me got get divorced.

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,610
Like it was as long thing. I was like
two, I am so sorry. I was stupid.

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,070
It was just done. I already had,
I wouldn't even planned out.

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,340
It was sitting right there. I just do it
in there. Huh? Maybe he'll find it when,

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,090
as he's packing to go home. I didn't,
I didn't think yourself, you know,

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,230
so I felt really bad about it. He goes,
I'm going to get you back. And I'm like,

18
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,740
okay. And that stupid green room they
have in that corner at the punchline,

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,150
right where you're sitting in there,

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,720
there's no access to a bathroom
or if you just poke your head out,

21
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:15,540
everybody can see you like who's
in there? What's going on? Right.

22
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,640
So I'm sitting in there,
he goes, all right,

23
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:21,690
here's what I'm going to do when you go
on stage, because he was opening for me.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,470
I'm going to put mustard all over
the door, knobs in here. Okay.

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,440
And you're going to be in such a hurry
to get out of there and go back to your

26
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:30,540
stupid merge title that
you're not even gonna.

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,540
Remember that I told you there's mustard
all over this door knob and you're just

28
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:35,850
going to grab mustard on your head.

29
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,470
It wasn't as good as me getting him with
a condom, obviously. But he was right.

30
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,020
Like I go on stage.
He told you he was going to do,

31
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:46,380
he told me he was going to do
it. I said, a cat's out the bag.

32
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:50,190
Jen's not going to happen. And of course
I grabbed it right away. I was like, okay.

33
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,650
Are you still close with them? Do
you know? Yeah. Well not, I mean,

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,500
as close as I can be, but
uh, we're good. We're fine.

35
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,260
Did you have to talk to his wife?
No. He's got a new life now.

36
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,920
I'm not going to be one. If it
was, it was the first step. Maybe.

37
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:06,750
So first spend the first name.
That's right. Yeah. You're
welcome. You're welcome.

38
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,830
New Eyes. Glass is half full.
Okay. Settle the fuck down.

39
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:15,570
Everybody welcome. New White.
Yeah. Yeah. It was like God's
plan. That's right. Yeah.

40
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,090
And where are we? I was like,
come on man. And a lot of ways,

41
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,130
what if God was one of us? He is. It's
me. It's not a song. He is. It is.

42
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,690
Who Sang that song? Jane Osborne, I
think. Yeah. You know what's really funny?

43
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,040
Am I right? Yeah. I was born
pretty close. Pretty close.

44
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:35,340
You're not impressed with the speed of
that. I was very quick. Thank you DJ.
