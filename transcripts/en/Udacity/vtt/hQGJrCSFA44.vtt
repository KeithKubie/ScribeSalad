00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
This course is about really challenging computer problems,

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.410
and the area of computer science that deals with these challenging problems

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.360
is called theoretical computer science, or more specifically, complexity theory.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.880
In complexity theory, we ask the question of how hard

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.300
certain problems are to solve for a computer.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.850
So how much time you really need to solve that problem.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.990
And at the end of this course, we'll even talk about deceptively simple problems

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.800
that are impossible to solve for computers, and that area is called computability.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.580
I will assume that you know some basics about algorithms, programming, and mathematics.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.500
After taking this course, you will have an understanding

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.840
of how to recognize, and actually, also solve, very challenging problems.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.550
Plus, theoretical computer science is a very rich and active field of research

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.760
and this course will prepare you to dig deeper

00:00:47.760 --> 99:59:59.000
once you are infected by the fascinations of this field.
