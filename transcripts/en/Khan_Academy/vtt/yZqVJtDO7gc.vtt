00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.800
What I want to do in this
video is really digest the idea

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.140
that if we have some fraction,
as long as we multiply

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.740
the numerator and the
denominator of the fraction

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.020
by the same number,
then we're going

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.390
to have an equivalent fraction.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.850
So let's think about that.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.625
Let's say we multiply the
denominator here by 2.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.950
I'm claiming that as long as
we multiply the numerator by 2,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.260
we are going to get an
equivalent fraction.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.830
So here, the denominator was 6.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.105
So here, our
denominator will be 12.

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:34.990
If our numerator here
is 4, well, we've

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.320
got to multiply by 2 again,
multiply our numerator by 2,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.430
to get 8.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.990
So I'm claiming that 8/12
is the same fraction as 4/6.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:52.210
And to visualize that,
let me redraw this whole.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.160
But instead of having
6 equal sections,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.360
we now have 12 equal sections.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.580
So each of the six
we can turn into 2.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.670
That's essentially what
multiplying by 2 does.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.010
We now have twice as
many equal sections.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.593
Now that we have twice as many
equal sections-- literally one,

00:01:11.593 --> 00:01:15.860
two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11 12--

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.370
how many of them are
actually shaded in yellow?

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.760
Well, one, two three, four
five, six, seven, eight-- 8/12.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.220
And there's no magic here.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.540
If we have twice
as many sections,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.890
we're going to have to shade
in twice as many of them

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.660
in order to have the same
fraction of the whole.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.080
And it goes the other way, too.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.140
This isn't just true
with multiplication.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.020
It's also true that if
we divide the numerator

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.470
and the denominator
by the same quantity,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.967
we are going to have
an equivalent fraction.

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:46.550
So that's another
way of saying, well,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.910
what happens if I
were to divide by 2?

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.470
So if I were to divide by
2-- so let me divide by 2--

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.400
I'm going to have 1/2 the
number of equal sections.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.500
Or I will only have
three equal sections.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.360
And I'm claiming if I do the
same thing in the numerator,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.560
that this is going to
represent the same fraction.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.289
So 4 divided by 2 is 2.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.940
So I'm claiming that
2/3 is the same fraction

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.060
as 4/6 is the same
fraction as 8/12.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.180
Well, let's visualize that.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.130
So here, this is
6 equal sections.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.000
But now, we're going to have
only three equal sections.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.600
So we can merge some of
these equal sections.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.890
So we can merge these
two right over here.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.760
And we can merge these
two right over here.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.150
And then, we can merge
these two right over here.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.310
So our whole is
still the same whole.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.060
But now, we only have
three equal sections.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.850
And two of them are
actually shaded in.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.990
So these are all
equivalent fractions.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.450
So the big takeaway here
is start with a fraction.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.190
If you multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.660
by the same quantity,
you're going

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.150
to have an equivalent fraction.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.410
If you divide the numerator
and the denominator

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.500
by the same
quantity, you're also

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.730
going to have an
equivalent fraction.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.810
So with that in our brains,
let's tackle a little bit

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.420
of an equivalent
fractions problem.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.300
Let's think about-- if
someone says, OK, I have 5/25,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:28.740
and I want to write that as some
value, let's call that value t,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.410
over 100, what would t be?

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.560
Well, we can see
in the denominator

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.387
to go from 25 to 100,
you had to multiply by 4.

00:03:42.387 --> 00:03:43.970
So if you want an
equivalent fraction,

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.830
you have to multiply the
numerator by 4 as well.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.110
So t will need to
be equal to 20.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.130
So t is equal to 20.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:03.480
5/25 is the same
thing as 20/100.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.250
But what if someone says, well,
5/25 is equivalent to blank,

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.860
let's say question mark, over 5?

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.020
Well now what would you do?

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.561
Actually, let's do
it the other way--

00:04:16.561 --> 00:04:21.870
is equal to 1 over
question mark.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.460
Well, you could say, look, to
get our numerator from 5 to 1,

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.830
we have to divide by 5.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.530
We have to divide by
5 to go from 5 to 1.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.970
And so similarly, we have to
divide the denominator by 5.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.220
So if you divide the denominator
by 5, 25 divided by 5

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.390
is going to get you 5.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.530
So these are all
equivalent fractions.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.604
1/5 is equivalent to 5/25,
which is equal to 20/100.
