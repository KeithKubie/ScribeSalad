00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.620
Partly thanks to new technology, we've become obsessed by the idea of finding an amazing character

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.260
called, "The Right Person"!

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.620
Back in the olden days you made do; you just got together with because their land was next to yours,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.000
and you're plow perfectly complimented their oxen; it was all pretty practical.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.920
But now, we're romantics with laptops out to find the ideal fit:

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.280
someone who's beautiful, who totally understands us.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.920
Unfortunately, it's pretty hard.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.360
So many people aren't quite right, but still we keep going; they must be out there.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.680
That's what the stories have told us since childhood.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.260
But perfection is, at best, for angels only.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.280
A perfect seeming partner might appear compatible in so many ways,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.440
but still we might come to blows over the color of the curtains, tea versus coffee, or children's names.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:06.900
The real challenge of relationships isn't to find the perfect match, it's to negotiate the differences without panic or nastiness,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.020
and stop blowing up perfectly good relationships for mistaken dreams and flawless scenarios.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.020
Learning to give up on perfection may be just about the most romantic move any of us could make.
