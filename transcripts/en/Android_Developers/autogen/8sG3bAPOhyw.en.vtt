hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.560
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
Android team at Google today I'm going

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
Android team at Google today I'm going
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.230
Android team at Google today I'm going
to show a demo that's a little bit more

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240
to show a demo that's a little bit more
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.930
to show a demo that's a little bit more
about motivating some of the techniques

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940
about motivating some of the techniques
 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.010
about motivating some of the techniques
i've talked about in previous two

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020
i've talked about in previous two
 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.260
i've talked about in previous two
heights episodes i'll walk through some

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
heights episodes i'll walk through some
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.730
heights episodes i'll walk through some
code but it's going to be a pretty

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740
code but it's going to be a pretty
 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.130
code but it's going to be a pretty
pretty blistering pace because frankly a

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
pretty blistering pace because frankly a
 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.080
pretty blistering pace because frankly a
lot of the techniques in the code are

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
lot of the techniques in the code are
 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.400
lot of the techniques in the code are
ones that we've already talked about in

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410
ones that we've already talked about in
 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.740
ones that we've already talked about in
the show what i wanted to do with this

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750
the show what i wanted to do with this
 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.080
the show what i wanted to do with this
application is instead motivate some of

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
application is instead motivate some of
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.010
application is instead motivate some of
the techniques that i've talked about

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020
the techniques that i've talked about
 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.440
the techniques that i've talked about
specifically around cartoon animation so

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450
specifically around cartoon animation so
 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.760
specifically around cartoon animation so
it's a little bit hard when you click on

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770
it's a little bit hard when you click on
 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.400
it's a little bit hard when you click on
a button and you see it fall down to the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410
a button and you see it fall down to the
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.660
a button and you see it fall down to the
bottom of the screen and squish at the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
bottom of the screen and squish at the
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.010
bottom of the screen and squish at the
bottom to understand why you would want

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
bottom to understand why you would want
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.700
bottom to understand why you would want
to do that in your application and

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710
to do that in your application and
 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.600
to do that in your application and
frankly most applications probably

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610
frankly most applications probably
 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.860
frankly most applications probably
shouldn't do that maybe it would be a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
shouldn't do that maybe it would be a
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.869
shouldn't do that maybe it would be a
little disturbing or silly but there are

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
little disturbing or silly but there are
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.119
little disturbing or silly but there are
some applications that really want to be

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
some applications that really want to be
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.130
some applications that really want to be
more engaging to the user and it's worth

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
more engaging to the user and it's worth
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.160
more engaging to the user and it's worth
understanding a type of application that

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170
understanding a type of application that
 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.720
understanding a type of application that
might want to use that to be more

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730
might want to use that to be more
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.459
might want to use that to be more
playful and engaging in general more

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469
playful and engaging in general more
 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.229
playful and engaging in general more
interactive with the user so i wanted to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
interactive with the user so i wanted to
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.240
interactive with the user so i wanted to
show how to use some of these techniques

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250
show how to use some of these techniques
 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.490
show how to use some of these techniques
that we've talked about in previous

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500
that we've talked about in previous
 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.620
that we've talked about in previous
episodes as well as in the talk at

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630

Google i/o 2013 called
a moving experience to show how you want

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830
a moving experience to show how you want
 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.289
a moving experience to show how you want
to use some of these cartoon animation

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
to use some of these cartoon animation
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.210
to use some of these cartoon animation
techniques and put them all together in

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
techniques and put them all together in
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.480
techniques and put them all together in
some larger example to give that more

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
some larger example to give that more
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.340
some larger example to give that more
engaging feeling to the user we're going

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
engaging feeling to the user we're going
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.469
engaging feeling to the user we're going
to be showing things about anticipation

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479
to be showing things about anticipation
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.560
to be showing things about anticipation
about overshoot about exaggeration and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
about overshoot about exaggeration and
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.300
about overshoot about exaggeration and
in general just being a little bit more

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
in general just being a little bit more
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.450
in general just being a little bit more
fun engaging and playful so let's take a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460
fun engaging and playful so let's take a
 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.210
fun engaging and playful so let's take a
look at the demo so here we go we get

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220
look at the demo so here we go we get
 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.010
look at the demo so here we go we get
into the application and we've got this

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
into the application and we've got this
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.190
into the application and we've got this
button that is bouncing it's ready to go

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
button that is bouncing it's ready to go
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.350
button that is bouncing it's ready to go
it wants us to engage so even though

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
it wants us to engage so even though
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.580
it wants us to engage so even though
we're not interacting with the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590
we're not interacting with the
 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.350
we're not interacting with the
application that's not a reason why the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
application that's not a reason why the
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.359
application that's not a reason why the
application can't be interacting with us

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
application can't be interacting with us
 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.219
application can't be interacting with us
so it's trying to attract our attention

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
so it's trying to attract our attention
 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.020
so it's trying to attract our attention
here and then eventually we'll fall for

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
here and then eventually we'll fall for
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.850
here and then eventually we'll fall for
it we'll press on the button this is a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860
it we'll press on the button this is a
 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.920
it we'll press on the button this is a
technique that we showed in some earlier

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930
technique that we showed in some earlier
 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.770
technique that we showed in some earlier
episodes about anticipation where when

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780
episodes about anticipation where when
 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.209
episodes about anticipation where when
we click on the button maybe it doesn't

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219
we click on the button maybe it doesn't
 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.740
we click on the button maybe it doesn't
just have to change color maybe you can

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
just have to change color maybe you can
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.690
just have to change color maybe you can
actually physically interact with the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
actually physically interact with the
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.490
actually physically interact with the
user and actually press in or press out

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500
user and actually press in or press out
 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.109
user and actually press in or press out
to show that there's a physical

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119
to show that there's a physical
 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.459
to show that there's a physical
interaction with the button actually

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
interaction with the button actually
 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.550
interaction with the button actually
going down

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560
going down
 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.589
going down
as the user presses on it so we press

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599
as the user presses on it so we press
 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.630
as the user presses on it so we press
the button and then when we let go watch

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640
the button and then when we let go watch
 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.229
the button and then when we let go watch
carefully

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239
carefully
 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.940
carefully
it's going to launch out and then just

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950
it's going to launch out and then just
 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.460
it's going to launch out and then just
keep going so it launches out toward the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470
keep going so it launches out toward the
 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.670
keep going so it launches out toward the
user and then we get into this other

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680
user and then we get into this other
 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.839
user and then we get into this other
activity and this is actually a separate

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849
activity and this is actually a separate
 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.729
activity and this is actually a separate
activity again this is a technique I

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739
activity again this is a technique I
 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.229
activity again this is a technique I
talked about in a previous episode about

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239
talked about in a previous episode about
 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.420
talked about in a previous episode about
custom activity animations we're not

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430
custom activity animations we're not
 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.100
custom activity animations we're not
running a window animation here which

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110
running a window animation here which
 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.600
running a window animation here which
has a standard way of running where

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610
has a standard way of running where
 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.850
has a standard way of running where
things scale and fade in instead we're

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860
things scale and fade in instead we're
 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.589
things scale and fade in instead we're
disabling that and we're running a

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599
disabling that and we're running a
 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.030
disabling that and we're running a
custom activity animation by

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040
custom activity animation by
 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.400
custom activity animation by
automatically launching the sub activity

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410
automatically launching the sub activity
 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.259
automatically launching the sub activity
with a white background so it's fully

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269
with a white background so it's fully
 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.789
with a white background so it's fully
opaque but it's the same opaque

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799
opaque but it's the same opaque
 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.559
opaque but it's the same opaque
background as the one we came from but

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569
background as the one we came from but
 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.240
background as the one we came from but
first we basically animate the stuff to

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250
first we basically animate the stuff to
 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.920
first we basically animate the stuff to
get out of the way and then the sub

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930
get out of the way and then the sub
 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.660
get out of the way and then the sub
activity launches with that same plain

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670
activity launches with that same plain
 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.250
activity launches with that same plain
white background and then the contents

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260
white background and then the contents
 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.590
white background and then the contents
in that activity animate they scale in

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600
in that activity animate they scale in
 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.479
in that activity animate they scale in
so we have the sort of continuous motion

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489
so we have the sort of continuous motion
 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.460
so we have the sort of continuous motion
from the previous activity of launching

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470
from the previous activity of launching
 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.710
from the previous activity of launching
fading and going past the user and then

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720
fading and going past the user and then
 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.509
fading and going past the user and then
the new content coming in with this

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519
the new content coming in with this
 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.789
the new content coming in with this
custom activity animation so now we're

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799
custom activity animation so now we're
 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.050
custom activity animation so now we're
on the first screen here and we have

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060
on the first screen here and we have
 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.280
on the first screen here and we have
some things that look vaguely like

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290
some things that look vaguely like
 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.570
some things that look vaguely like

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880
notice when I press on the buttons again
 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.580
notice when I press on the buttons again
it's that same interactive thing I press

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590
it's that same interactive thing I press
 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.780
it's that same interactive thing I press
on the button the button actually goes

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790
on the button the button actually goes
 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.270
on the button the button actually goes
into the screen away from the user and

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280
into the screen away from the user and
 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.580
into the screen away from the user and
then comes back out the springs and

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590
then comes back out the springs and
 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.190
then comes back out the springs and
overshoots showing that interactive

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200
overshoots showing that interactive
 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.069
overshoots showing that interactive
model of engaging the user through

model of engaging the user through
 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.210
model of engaging the user through
actually interacting through the

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220
actually interacting through the
 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.960
actually interacting through the
physical presses and releases on the

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970
physical presses and releases on the
 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.449
physical presses and releases on the
screen so as I release the button you're

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459
screen so as I release the button you're
 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.410
screen so as I release the button you're
going to say the same thing you did on

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420
going to say the same thing you did on
 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.910
going to say the same thing you did on
the previous screen which is the button

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920
the previous screen which is the button
 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.199
the previous screen which is the button
is going to launch out at the user and

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209
is going to launch out at the user and
 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.420
is going to launch out at the user and
then animate into place at the top of

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430
then animate into place at the top of
 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.009
then animate into place at the top of
the screen now you notice an other

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019
the screen now you notice an other
 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.080
the screen now you notice an other
element on all of these screens is the

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090
element on all of these screens is the
 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.490
element on all of these screens is the
text is going to animate out we have

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500
text is going to animate out we have
 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.420
text is going to animate out we have
this sort of flow of the application

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430
this sort of flow of the application
 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.780
this sort of flow of the application
going from right to left and we do this

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790
going from right to left and we do this
 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.430
going from right to left and we do this
with a little bit of anticipation on the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440
with a little bit of anticipation on the
 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.110
with a little bit of anticipation on the
on the text again a technique that we

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120
on the text again a technique that we
 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.000
on the text again a technique that we
saw in a previous demo where the text

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010
saw in a previous demo where the text
 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.680
saw in a previous demo where the text
will actually skew to the right and then

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690
will actually skew to the right and then
 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.000
will actually skew to the right and then
shift to the left this is like

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010
shift to the left this is like
 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.890
shift to the left this is like
traditional cartoon animations where

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900
traditional cartoon animations where
 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.960
traditional cartoon animations where
someone's going to run but

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970
someone's going to run but
 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.310
someone's going to run but
before they run they're going to rear

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320
before they run they're going to rear
 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.990
before they run they're going to rear
back and get ready which really helps

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000
back and get ready which really helps
 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.520
back and get ready which really helps
the user understand exactly what's about

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530
the user understand exactly what's about
 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.400
the user understand exactly what's about
to happen not just during the action but

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410
to happen not just during the action but
 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.770
to happen not just during the action but
actually before the action we anticipate

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780
actually before the action we anticipate
 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.360
actually before the action we anticipate
the text is going to anticipate the

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370
the text is going to anticipate the
 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.040
the text is going to anticipate the
animation and then it's going to shift

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050
animation and then it's going to shift
 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.080
animation and then it's going to shift
quickly off the screen and then finally

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090
quickly off the screen and then finally
 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.250
quickly off the screen and then finally
of course you want to ask for the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260
of course you want to ask for the
 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.190
of course you want to ask for the
child's credit card number because

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200
child's credit card number because
 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.230
child's credit card number because
that's where the real money is right so

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240
that's where the real money is right so
 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.090
that's where the real money is right so
that's it we can step through it again

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100
that's it we can step through it again
 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.950
that's it we can step through it again
you see the button you see the sort of

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960
you see the button you see the sort of
 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.260
you see the button you see the sort of
engaging playful thing you launch into

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270
engaging playful thing you launch into
 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.330
engaging playful thing you launch into
the sub activity here pressing the

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340
the sub activity here pressing the
 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.040
the sub activity here pressing the
buttons that buttons are interacting the

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050
buttons that buttons are interacting the
 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.110
buttons that buttons are interacting the
text is skewing sort of all this playful

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120
text is skewing sort of all this playful
 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.000
text is skewing sort of all this playful
stuff let's take a very quick look at

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010
stuff let's take a very quick look at
 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.830
stuff let's take a very quick look at
the code there's a lot of code here but

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840
the code there's a lot of code here but
 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.420
the code there's a lot of code here but
again the techniques are similar to

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430
again the techniques are similar to
 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.310
again the techniques are similar to
techniques that we saw in these previous

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320
techniques that we saw in these previous
 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.690
techniques that we saw in these previous
dev bytes episode so it's not worth

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700
dev bytes episode so it's not worth
 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.940
dev bytes episode so it's not worth
belaboring these too much so we have

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950
belaboring these too much so we have
 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.520
belaboring these too much so we have
tune game this is the main activity

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530
tune game this is the main activity
 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.650
tune game this is the main activity
we're listening for touches on the

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660
we're listening for touches on the
 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.920
we're listening for touches on the
button and when we get one we're going

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930
button and when we get one we're going
 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.070
button and when we get one we're going
to we're going to animate the scale so

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080
to we're going to animate the scale so
 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.930
to we're going to animate the scale so
the button scales into the screen away

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940
the button scales into the screen away
 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.700
the button scales into the screen away
from the user and when they release

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710
from the user and when they release
 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.060
from the user and when they release
we're going to trap that here and we're

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070
we're going to trap that here and we're
 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.360
we're going to trap that here and we're
going to launch we're going to animate

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370
going to launch we're going to animate
 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.640
going to launch we're going to animate
back to the regular scale thing but then

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650
back to the regular scale thing but then
 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.110
back to the regular scale thing but then
we're also going to perform the click

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120
we're also going to perform the click
 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.640
we're also going to perform the click
operation which is going to go into the

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650
operation which is going to go into the
 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.180
operation which is going to go into the
sub activity so that is down here so

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190
sub activity so that is down here so
 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.010
sub activity so that is down here so
when we play we're going to animate

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020
when we play we're going to animate
 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.350
when we play we're going to animate
we're going to keep scaling the button

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360
we're going to keep scaling the button
 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.270
we're going to keep scaling the button
out from where it was so it's going to

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280
out from where it was so it's going to
 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.830
out from where it was so it's going to
scale and it's also going to fade out at

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840
scale and it's also going to fade out at
 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.240
scale and it's also going to fade out at
the same time and come out toward the

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250
the same time and come out toward the
 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.100
the same time and come out toward the
user and then when it's done we're going

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110
user and then when it's done we're going
 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.350
user and then when it's done we're going
to launch the the sub activity this new

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360
to launch the the sub activity this new
 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.120
to launch the the sub activity this new
intent we're going to start the activity

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130
intent we're going to start the activity
 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.290
intent we're going to start the activity
we're going to override the pending

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300
we're going to override the pending
 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.790
we're going to override the pending
transition I don't want window

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800
transition I don't want window
 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.200
transition I don't want window
animations here I'm already doing my

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210
animations here I'm already doing my
 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.600
animations here I'm already doing my
custom activity animation so you get the

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610
custom activity animation so you get the
 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.100
custom activity animation so you get the
window animations out of the way with

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110
window animations out of the way with
 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.159
window animations out of the way with
overriding pending transitions with zero

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169
overriding pending transitions with zero
 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.659
overriding pending transitions with zero
and then it launches the sub activity

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669
and then it launches the sub activity
 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.250
and then it launches the sub activity
which is this player set up activity

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260
which is this player set up activity
 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.530
which is this player set up activity
here player set up activity has various

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540
here player set up activity has various
 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.000
here player set up activity has various
elements a lot of code in here not worth

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010
elements a lot of code in here not worth
 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.890
elements a lot of code in here not worth
going into again same techniques all

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900
going into again same techniques all
 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.600
going into again same techniques all
over the place in here we have the

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610
over the place in here we have the
 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.040
over the place in here we have the
button press listener so when you click

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050
button press listener so when you click
 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.450
button press listener so when you click
on one of these things it's going to

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460
on one of these things it's going to
 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.010
on one of these things it's going to
scale in when you release it's going to

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020
scale in when you release it's going to
 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.959
scale in when you release it's going to
scale back out

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:26.969
scale back out
 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:29.899
scale back out
to where it was and then when the button

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909
to where it was and then when the button
 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:32.029
to where it was and then when the button
is clicked it's going to animate into

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039
is clicked it's going to animate into
 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.489
is clicked it's going to animate into
place up at the top of the screen now I

00:06:34.489 --> 00:06:34.499
place up at the top of the screen now I
 

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:36.109
place up at the top of the screen now I
didn't simply want to pop that view out

00:06:36.109 --> 00:06:36.119
didn't simply want to pop that view out
 

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:37.789
didn't simply want to pop that view out
from where it was because the layout

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:37.799
from where it was because the layout
 

00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:39.199
from where it was because the layout
would have been affected by that instead

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:39.209
would have been affected by that instead
 

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:41.509
would have been affected by that instead
I'm going to set that invisible ability

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:41.519
I'm going to set that invisible ability
 

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:44.419
I'm going to set that invisible ability
there in its previous state and then I'm

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:44.429
there in its previous state and then I'm
 

00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:45.979
there in its previous state and then I'm
going to create a copy of that button

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:45.989
going to create a copy of that button
 

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:48.199
going to create a copy of that button
and animate that in a parent container

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:48.209
and animate that in a parent container
 

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:50.449
and animate that in a parent container
as I move that in sort of this virtual

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:50.459
as I move that in sort of this virtual
 

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:52.159
as I move that in sort of this virtual
curve of scaling out and then scaling

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169
curve of scaling out and then scaling
 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:54.799
curve of scaling out and then scaling
back down into place at the top of the

00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:54.809
back down into place at the top of the
 

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:57.919
back down into place at the top of the
screen where it's going to live then the

00:06:57.919 --> 00:06:57.929
screen where it's going to live then the
 

00:06:57.929 --> 00:07:01.399
screen where it's going to live then the
the text skewing animation again we've

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:01.409
the text skewing animation again we've
 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:04.639
the text skewing animation again we've
seen this in previous demos that happens

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:04.649
seen this in previous demos that happens
 

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:07.339
seen this in previous demos that happens
in this custom text view subclass I have

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:07.349
in this custom text view subclass I have
 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:09.409
in this custom text view subclass I have
here called skew able textview we're

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:09.419
here called skew able textview we're
 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:10.909
here called skew able textview we're
going to animate the skew property of

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919
going to animate the skew property of
 

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:12.499
going to animate the skew property of
the text as it skews to the right and

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:12.509
the text as it skews to the right and
 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:15.889
the text as it skews to the right and
then shifts over to the left and that

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:15.899
then shifts over to the left and that
 

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:17.569
then shifts over to the left and that
happens by simply animating the skew

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:17.579
happens by simply animating the skew
 

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:20.299
happens by simply animating the skew
value invalidating appropriately also

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:20.309
value invalidating appropriately also
 

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:22.159
value invalidating appropriately also
invalidate the parent around the area of

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:22.169
invalidate the parent around the area of
 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:24.499
invalidate the parent around the area of
the skew so we actually erase and redraw

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:24.509
the skew so we actually erase and redraw
 

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:28.369
the skew so we actually erase and redraw
the appropriate area and that's the

00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:28.379
the appropriate area and that's the
 

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:30.589
the appropriate area and that's the
utility method for doing that and that's

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599
utility method for doing that and that's
 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:32.299
utility method for doing that and that's
about it there's a lot of code in here

00:07:32.299 --> 00:07:32.309
about it there's a lot of code in here
 

00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:34.819
about it there's a lot of code in here
but again we went over the actual

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:34.829
but again we went over the actual
 

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:36.739
but again we went over the actual
techniques of the the code in detail in

00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:36.749
techniques of the the code in detail in
 

00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:38.899
techniques of the the code in detail in
the previous dev bytes episode so be

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:38.909
the previous dev bytes episode so be
 

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:40.609

sure to check those out as well as the
 

00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:42.350
sure to check those out as well as the
code for this application that should be

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360
code for this application that should be
 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.179
