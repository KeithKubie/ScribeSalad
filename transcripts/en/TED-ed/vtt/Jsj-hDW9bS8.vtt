00:00:06.664 --> 00:00:13.144
On May 27th, 1941, the German battleship
Bismarck sank in a fierce firefight,

00:00:13.144 --> 00:00:18.454
leaving only 118 of her 
2,200 crew members alive.

00:00:18.454 --> 00:00:21.534
But when a British destroyer came to
collect the prisoners,

00:00:21.534 --> 00:00:24.884
they found an unexpected survivor -

00:00:24.884 --> 00:00:28.244
a black and white
cat clinging to a floating plank.

00:00:28.244 --> 00:00:32.264
For the next several months this cat
hunted rats and raised British morale -

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:36.264
until a sudden torpedo strike shattered
the hull and sank the ship.

00:00:36.264 --> 00:00:39.644
But, miraculously, not the cat.

00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:41.894
Nicknamed Unsinkable Sam,

00:00:41.894 --> 00:00:44.474
he rode to Gibraltar with the rescued crew

00:00:44.474 --> 00:00:47.614
and served as a ship cat on three more vessels –

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:53.424
one of which also sank - before
retiring to the Belfast Home for Sailors.

00:00:53.424 --> 00:00:56.544
Many may not think of cats as serviceable
sailors,

00:00:56.544 --> 00:00:59.324
or cooperative companions 
of any kind.

00:00:59.324 --> 00:01:02.994
But cats have been working alongside
humans for thousands of years - 

00:01:02.994 --> 00:01:05.764
helping us just as often as we help them.

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:10.224
So how did these solitary creatures go 
from wild predator to naval officer

00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:12.874
to sofa sidekick?

00:01:12.874 --> 00:01:14.574
The domestication of the modern house cat

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:18.444
can be traced back to more than
10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent,

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:20.944
at the start of the Neolithic era.

00:01:20.944 --> 00:01:23.294
People were learning to bend nature
to their will,

00:01:23.294 --> 00:01:26.484
producing much more food than
farmers could eat at one time.

00:01:26.484 --> 00:01:31.814
These Neolithic farmers stored their excess
grain in large pits and short, clay silos.

00:01:31.814 --> 00:01:34.834
But these stores of food attracted
hordes of rodents,

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:38.924
as well as their predator,
Felis silvestris lybica -

00:01:38.924 --> 00:01:42.624
the wildcat found across North Africa
and Southwest Asia.

00:01:42.624 --> 00:01:45.994
These wildcats were fast, fierce,
carnivorous hunters.

00:01:45.994 --> 00:01:50.724
And they were remarkably similar in size
and appearance to today’s domestic cats.

00:01:50.724 --> 00:01:54.224
The main differences being that ancient
wildcats were more muscular,

00:01:54.224 --> 00:01:59.944
had striped coats, and were less social
towards other cats and humans.

00:01:59.944 --> 00:02:03.084
The abundance of prey in rodent-infested 
granaries

00:02:03.084 --> 00:02:06.174
drew in these typically solitary animals. 

00:02:06.174 --> 00:02:08.779
And as the wildcats learned to tolerate the 
presence of humans

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.574
and other cats during mealtime,

00:02:10.574 --> 00:02:15.924
we think that farmers likewise tolerated
the cats in exchange for free pest control.

00:02:15.924 --> 00:02:21.284
The relationship was so beneficial that
the cats migrated with Neolithic farmers

00:02:21.284 --> 00:02:25.124
from Anatolia into Europe
and the Mediterranean.

00:02:25.124 --> 00:02:27.714
Vermin were a major
scourge of the seven seas.

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:30.354
They ate provisions and
gnawed at lines of rope,

00:02:30.354 --> 00:02:34.464
so cats had long since become
essential sailing companions.

00:02:34.464 --> 00:02:38.344
Around the same time these Anatolian
globe trotting cats set sail,

00:02:38.344 --> 00:02:41.754
the Egyptians domesticated 
their own local cats.

00:02:41.754 --> 00:02:46.194
Revered for their ability to dispatch
venomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats,

00:02:46.194 --> 00:02:50.894
domestic cats became important
to Egyptian religious culture.

00:02:50.894 --> 00:02:55.654
They gained immortality in frescos,
hieroglyphs, statues, and even tombs,

00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:58.774
mummified alongside their owners.

00:02:58.774 --> 00:03:01.314
Egyptian ship cats cruised the Nile,

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:04.444
holding poisonous river snakes at bay. 

00:03:04.444 --> 00:03:06.774
And after graduating to larger vessels,

00:03:06.774 --> 00:03:10.654
they too began to migrate
from port to port.

00:03:10.654 --> 00:03:14.954
During the time of the Roman Empire,
ships traveling between India and Egypt

00:03:14.954 --> 00:03:20.744
carried the lineage of the
central Asian wildcat F. s. ornata.

00:03:20.744 --> 00:03:25.774
Centuries later, in the Middle Ages, 
Egyptian cats voyaged up to the Baltic Sea

00:03:25.774 --> 00:03:28.524
on the ships of Viking seafarers.

00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:31.804
And both the Near Eastern 
and North African wildcats

00:03:31.804 --> 00:03:35.794
– probably tamed at this point -- 
continued to travel across Europe,

00:03:35.794 --> 00:03:40.094
eventually setting sail for
Australia and the Americas.

00:03:40.104 --> 00:03:42.164
Today, most house cats have descended

00:03:42.164 --> 00:03:46.834
from either the Near Eastern
or the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica.

00:03:46.834 --> 00:03:50.444
But close analysis of the genomes and
coat patterns of modern cats

00:03:50.444 --> 00:03:52.564
tells us that unlike dogs,

00:03:52.564 --> 00:03:55.364
which have undergone 
centuries of selective breeding,

00:03:55.364 --> 00:03:59.124
modern cats are genetically
very similar to ancient cats.

00:03:59.124 --> 00:04:01.964
And apart from making them
more social and docile,

00:04:01.964 --> 00:04:05.684
we’ve done little to alter
their natural behaviors.

00:04:05.684 --> 00:04:11.394
In other words, cats today are more or
less as they’ve always been: Wild animals.

00:04:11.394 --> 00:04:14.844
Fierce hunters. Creatures that don’t
see us as their keepers.

00:04:14.844 --> 00:04:18.844
And given our long history together,
they might not be wrong.
