00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.410
We often talk about how traditional computing
is reaching its limit--there’s a threshold

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.009
we can’t move past without making some seriously
big changes to the way we structure computers.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.280
One of those exciting ways is by making physical
computers a little more like human brains.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.430
We introduced this concept in more detail
here, but a quick recap: this kind of computing

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.130
is called neuromorphic computing, which means
designing and engineering computer chips that

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.910
use the same physics of computation used by
our own nervous system.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.969
This is different from an artificial neural
network , which is a program run on a normal

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.010
computer that mimics the logic of how a human
brain thinks.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.420
Neuromorphic computing (the hardware version)
and neural networks (the software version)

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.239
can work together because as we make progress
in both fields, neuromorphic hardware will

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.649
probably be the best option to run neural
networks on...but for this video, we’re

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.129
going to focus on neuromorphic computing and
the really exciting strides that have been

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.100
made in this field in the past year.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.280
See, traditional computers ‘think’ in
binary.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.500
Everything is either a 1 or 0, a yes or a
no.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.970
You only have two options, so the code we
use and the questions we ask these kinds of

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.619
computers must be structured in a very rigid
way.

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.799
Neuromorphic computing works a little more
flexibly.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.259
Instead of using an electric signal to mean
one or zero, designers of these new chips

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.159
want to make their computer’s neurons talk
to each other the way biological neurons do.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.750
To do this, you need a kind of precise electric
current which flows across a synapse, or the

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.539
space between neurons.

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.460
Depending on the number and kind of ion, the
receiving computer neuron is activated in

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.369
some way--giving you a lot more computational
options than just your basic yes and no.

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.991
This ability to transmit a gradient of understanding
from neuron to neuron and to have them all

00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:50.859
working together simultaneously means that
neuromorphic chips could eventually be more

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:56.250
energy efficient than our normal computers--especially
for really complicated tasks.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.420
To realize this exciting potential, we need
new materials because what we’re using in

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.999
our computers today isn’t gonna cut it.

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:06.899
The physical properties of something like
silicon, for example, make it hard to control

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.110
the current between artificial neurons...it
just kind of bleeds all over the chip with

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.739
no organization.

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.379
So a new design from an MIT team uses different
materials-- single-crystalline silicon and

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.660
silicon germanium layered--on top of one another.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.980
Apply an electric field to this new device?

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.060
You get a well-controlled flow of ions.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.099
A team in Korea is investigating other materials.

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.960
They used tantalum oxide to give them precise
control over the flow of ions...AND it’s

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.220
even more durable Another team in Colorado
is implementing magnets to precisely control

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.470
the way the computer neurons communicate.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.860
These advances in the actual architecture
of neuromorphic systems are all working toward

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.090
getting us to a place where the neurons on
these chips can ‘learn’ as they compute.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.670
Software neural networks have been able to
do this for a while, but it’s a new advancement

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.840
for physical neuromorphic devices--and these
experiments are showing promising results.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.019
Another leap in performance has been made
by a team at the University of Manchester,

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.159
who have taken a different approach.

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.470
Their system is called SpiNNaker, which stands
for Spiking Neural Network Architecture.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.370
While other experiments look to change the
experiments we use, the Manchester team uses

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.450
traditional digital parts, like cores and
routers--connecting and communicating with

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.599
each other in innovative ways.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.751
UK researchers have shown that they can use
SpiNNaker to simulate the behavior of the

00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:29.310
human cortex.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.580
The hope is that a computer that behaves like
a brain will give us enough computing power

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.049
to simulate something as complicated as the
brain, helping us understand diseases like

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.230
Alzheimer’s.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.450
The news is that SpiNNaker has now matched
the results we’d get from a traditional

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.450
supercomputer.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.349
This is huge because neural networks offer
the possibility of higher speed and more complexity

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.610
for less energy cost, and with this new finding
we see that they’re edging closer to the

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.239
best performance we’ve been able to achieve
so far.

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.239
.

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.170
Overall, we’re working toward having a better
understanding of how the brain works in the

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.950
first place, improving the artificial materials
we use to mimic biological systems, and creating

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.939
hardware architectures that work with and
optimize neural algorithms.

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.750
Changing computer hardware to behave more
like the human brain is one of a few options

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.430
we have for continuing to improve computer
performance, and to get computers to learn

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.970
and adapt the way humans do.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.770
While scientists make computers that work
like brains, put your brain to use by building

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.240
your very own website!

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.090

They can fulfill all your website needs.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.530
They offer dot com and dot net domain names,
and intuitive website builders.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.210
They have over three hundred domain extensions

online and visit domain dot com.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.000
