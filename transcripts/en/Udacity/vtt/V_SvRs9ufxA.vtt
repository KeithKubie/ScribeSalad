00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.620
Now let's look at what we can
do with a camera like this.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.620
So, again,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.060
we know that if somebody gave me this
information I would have a camera.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.220
And basically what I'm doing is,
to create this burn image,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.180
remember our lectures on doing
things like convolution.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.530
If I'm convolving with
a stock function like this,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.890
blurring is basically equivalent to
convolution and this would be my output.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.668
The size of this kind of suggests
the size of the step function that we,

00:00:24.668 --> 00:00:25.577
you would have.

00:00:25.577 --> 00:00:27.631
And of course what basically comes down,
and

00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:30.725
there's a concept of a sinc function,
which basically says that.

00:00:30.725 --> 00:00:33.158
And sinc function for
those of you curious,

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:36.466
basically is showing
the information about a signal.

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.662
And it basically says a sinc
function is a general form here and

00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:43.000
basically is a sine wave that
decays with an amplitude 1 over x.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.640
So as we move away,
it gets smaller and smaller.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.660
This is one of the standard ways of
actually computing discrete Fourier

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.330
transforms and

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.820
it's one of the pairs that captures
the magnitude of a signal like this.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.910
So this is, of course, one of the sinc
functions for a signal like this.
