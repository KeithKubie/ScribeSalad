00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi! In the previous units, you've seen how to do simulations of systems that develop in time

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but where we've got some more dimensions--the x, y and z of space.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This unit introduces differential equations that govern time and space.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We'll use the computer to model combustion and the propagation of heat

00:00:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to predict the cause of a wildfire.
