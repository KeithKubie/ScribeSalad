00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.870
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.120
So this is our plan.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.910
I'm going to talk a
bit about writing.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.240
We're going to practice some
writing with the examples

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.090
that you uploaded and then
some other examples that

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.064
are not yours.

00:00:39.064 --> 00:00:40.980
And then I'll talk a
little bit about hosting.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.480
And then if we have time--
I don't know if we will--

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.850
at the end, we'll do a little
bit of hosting practice.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.470
But part of the
hosting practice will

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.761
come with the writing practice.

00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:50.220
It's hard to separate them.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.630
I'm going to talk for like
maybe 10 minutes about writing.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.210
And then we'll just get
right into the practice.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.800
I'm going to overload you with
a bunch of guidelines or rules

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.517
or however you want
to think about it.

00:01:01.517 --> 00:01:03.850
Don't worry about remembering
them or writing them down.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.379
But we'll come
back to them all as

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.712
we do the practice, because
that's really how you learn,

00:01:07.712 --> 00:01:10.080
is by doing.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.480
This is one way to write.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.020
It's kind of how I
approach writing.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.010
You start with an idea.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.120
You're like, hey, it'd be great
have a video about whatever, x.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.969
And then the explosion
phase is the,

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.260
I'm going to think about
everything that could possibly

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.379
relate to this idea.

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:27.670
I'm going to write it all down.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.180
I think you saw an example
of that with Elizabeth's snot

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.900
brainstorm.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.180
Brainstorm is
another word for it.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.170
And then from there,
you sort of go outward

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.030
and then you distill
it down to the essence,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.040
like what is the actual point of
the video, who, what, how, why.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.249
Where is sometimes
important, but not usually.

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.790
And then the stuff that we're
going to talk about today, this

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.810
is the writing piece of it.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.030
So when you write
a script, you want

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.550
to pay attention to structure.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.225
So what do you talk about first?

00:01:57.225 --> 00:01:58.100
What's in the middle?

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.850
How do you end it?

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.790
That kind of thing.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.570
Tone-- are you going for funny?

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.770
Are you going for dry?

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.350
Are you going for informal?

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.810
Are you going for formal?

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.909
Jargon-- you want to
generally try to avoid jargon,

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.450
especially if you're shooting
for high school, middle school,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.260
that range.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.940
By the way, it's ironic that
I'm using the word jargon.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.252
Jargon is a technical language,
which jargon is itself

00:02:23.252 --> 00:02:23.960
a technical word.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.860
So that's sort of an
ironic thing there.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.500
Visuals-- you always want to
write the script, because video

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.647
is a weird medium.

00:02:30.647 --> 00:02:32.230
I mean, you've got
the image, and then

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.740
you've got the
soundtrack, and you

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.870
want to make sure
that they are related

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.230
and don't duplicate each other.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.430
So that is a trick
that we'll get into.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.950
I was reading some
of your examples

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.682
and there are particular
sentences where this is

00:02:47.682 --> 00:02:48.890
going to be really important.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.220
So if I don't talk about
that on my own, remind me.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.050
Metaphors and jokes-- it's
really hard to be funny.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.496
So if you think you can,
and you want to try,

00:03:00.496 --> 00:03:01.620
then I would say go for it.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.830
But generally, I
try to avoid jokes.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.370
Metaphors are
similar, it's kind of

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.330
hard to write a good metaphor.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.863
Do we all know what a
metaphor is, by the way?

00:03:08.863 --> 00:03:11.238
PROFESSOR: I showed them the
[INAUDIBLE] video yesterday.

00:03:11.238 --> 00:03:13.760
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK, cool.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.900
So those are sort of-- the stuff
on the left is in every video,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.570
you've got to pay attention to.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.040
The stuff on the right, the
metaphors and the jokes,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.210
are sort of advanced.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.710
Anyway, then once you sort of
get your first draft together,

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.710
you explode, you distill
that into your essence,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.612
then you condense it, and
you write your script.

00:03:28.612 --> 00:03:29.820
And this doesn't happen once.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.180
This happens many, many times.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.400
Typically, a script will
go through between 4

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.460
and like 12 revisions before
we actually shoot it, up to

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.252
and including-- we're rewriting
five minutes before we shoot.

00:03:42.252 --> 00:03:44.210
Because you say it out
loud, and something just

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.200
doesn't sound
right, and you feel

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.090
like you have to change it.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.540
So this is generally how
my writing process works.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.360
Other people do it
completely differently.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.600
This is sort of an MIT approach.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.260
It's very sort of
structured and logical,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.680
but it doesn't have
to be this way.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.221
If you don't want
to write like this,

00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:01.960
you absolutely don't have to.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.750
The first writing guideline,
this is in addition to the flow

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.700
chart, is-- and I
think you guys talked

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.610
about this a little bit
already-- know your audience

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.910
and write for them.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.024
And I have this note down
there, not necessarily to them.

00:04:15.024 --> 00:04:17.399
So most of the videos that
you're going to be working for

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.589
are aimed at people
younger than you than you,

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:23.340
and sometimes people a
lot younger than you.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.260
I mean, maybe even down to like
6th, 7th grade, middle school.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.910
So you want to write to
their level of education,

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.370
but not necessarily
talk as if you were

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.130
talking to a middle schooler.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.608
Does anyone know what I
mean by that distinction?

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.740
I'll cold call if
people don't speak up.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.230
AUDIENCE: Like, don't baby talk?

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.188
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Exactly.

00:04:50.188 --> 00:04:50.810
Yeah, exactly.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:51.590
Don't baby talk.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.190
So give me an example of like--
pick a sentence, any sentence.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.410
You can read it off the
intellectual property form

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.576
in front of you if you want.

00:04:59.576 --> 00:05:02.664
But give me the non--
just the regular version.

00:05:02.664 --> 00:05:04.080
And give me the
baby talk version,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.080
just so we have a sense.

00:05:11.855 --> 00:05:12.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:27.044 --> 00:05:28.710
GEORGE ZAIDAN: No,
that's exactly right.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.960
And you guys notice that
it's funny when he does that.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.260
There's just
something ridiculous

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.829
about-- you call it baby talk
or talking down to your audience

00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:39.120
or something-- that you
immediately don't pay attention

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.280
to what he's saying.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.960
You pay attention to
how he's saying it.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.900
And you've lost your
audience immediately.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.460
So that's a really
important distinction.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.210
By the way, this holds
true if you're just

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.760
interacting with kids anyway.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.080
Most kids are smarter than
we give them credit for.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.720
And people baby talk
kids all the time.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.510
But if you just
straight talk to them,

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.926
you'll be surprised at the
kind of responses that you get.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.900
Rule number two--
or guideline, sorry,

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.880
number two-- is write it
like you would say it,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.430
because you will be saying it.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.170
What I mean here is
your script is a draft.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.832
And it will always be a draft.

00:06:15.832 --> 00:06:17.290
You will never have
a final script,

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.800
because nobody's going
to log on to the internet

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.770
and read your scripts.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.300
What they're going to do is
hear you say the words that

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.440
are on your script.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.274
So even if a sentence
is great on paper

00:06:27.274 --> 00:06:29.440
and you read it in your
head and it sounds awesome--

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.520
if when you say it out
loud it, it sounds weird

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.960
or it's hard to
understand or whatever,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.140
then it doesn't matter how
great it looked on paper.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.917
It's not an effective sentence.

00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:41.250
This is the most important
thing we'll talk about today.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.250
We'll come back to that
when we do the practice.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.150
This is another version
of the previous slide.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.940
When you-- and you
guys are all know this

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.830
because you read
scientific journal articles

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.290
and stuff-- when you read that
kind of text, it's very dense.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.680
It's extremely well structured
and logically laid out.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.010
It has a lot of jargon.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.930
It's very precise.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.870
There's very little ambiguity.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.890
And it's understated,
and it's elegant.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:14.130
Meaning like-- usually people
take the fewest possible words

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.630
to say something, and that means
using long and complex words.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.330
And it is beautiful to read.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.762
It's great English.

00:07:21.762 --> 00:07:24.220
But if you try and read it out
loud and you do it on video,

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.100
again, you'll lose your
audience instantly.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.530
It's just as bad as baby talk.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:33.156
When you talk-- people talk
in-- people are very repetitive.

00:07:33.156 --> 00:07:33.780
They say, "uh."

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.640
They say, "um."

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.020
They-- uh-- like I just did.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.220
They don't really
use fancy words.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.480
If their audience
doesn't understand,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.120
they stop and they
try another approach.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.590
It's a lot more free-form,
a lot more inconsistent,

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.790
a lot fluffier.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.000
And that's what you
want to shoot for,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.940
because you will be on
screen talking to the camera

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.990
as if that camera
is another person.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.079
And so that's the write
it like you say it.

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:02.620
That's what I mean when I say
write it like you would say it.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.599
Another-- and I think this
is the last guideline-- is

00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:10.890
you really want to be accurate.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.740
Because, obviously,
you don't want

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.610
to say things that are
wrong in your videos.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.050
But accuracy is not the
same thing as detail.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.330
So this is the difference
between going back

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.160
to the last slide.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.510
Being very, very,
very precise usually

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.600
requires a lot of detail.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.480
If you want to say
exactly what you mean,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.169
it probably will take you a
couple sentences to say it.

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:35.432
But if you want to
be accurate, that

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:36.890
is going to-- and
especially if you

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:38.330
want to be accurate
for a short five minute

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.590
video-- that's going to mean
leaving information out.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.669
And that's OK.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:47.240
The test that I like
to subject scripts to

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.090
is, can an eighth
grader understand it?

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.140
If so, great.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.010
And can a PhD In the subject
matter of that script

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.860
read the script.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.540
And if their reaction is, wow,
this is surprisingly accurate,

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.650
then you've done a good job.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.130
And that's all.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.550
That's it for my rules.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.270
Hopefully that was
less than 10 minutes.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.760
What I want to do now is put
these rules in to practice.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.730
We're going to start with a
quote that is not one of yours.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.640
And then we'll move
into your scripts.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.610
So I'm going to go ahead
and-- let me pick one.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.141
Let's do the first one.

00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:36.640
OK.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.910
So let's see.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.744
Everyone take a second
and just read this.

00:09:54.831 --> 00:09:56.080
So you'll notice the citation.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.480
This is from a paper.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.690
It's written English.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.740
Can someone just shout
out some of the rules

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.420
that would make this bad for
speaking and reading aloud?

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.060
In fact, why don't we-- let's
actually read this aloud just

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.180
to see how it sounds.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.880
So anthropogenic CO2
emissions are contributing

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.820
to global climate change
and could negatively

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.990
impact our way of life if
serious action is further

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.220
delayed.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:22.720
OK.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.880
So what rules are
we breaking, or what

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.005
guidelines are we breaking?

00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:31.750
AUDIENCE: I think just
hearing it out loud,

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.940
it seems kind of-- life if you
were presenting it to someone,

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:35.980
it'd be a long sentence.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.180
And it's very statement.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.540
It's not conversational.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.420
It's not like you're-- you know,
it's not written like you would

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:43.920
speak.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.890
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Exactly.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.282
What else?

00:10:47.282 --> 00:10:49.602
AUDIENCE: The word
anthropogenic is

00:10:49.602 --> 00:10:51.402
difficult to hear and remember.

00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:52.360
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Exactly.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.800
It's also jargon.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.090
It means human-made.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.930
AUDIENCE: It's a very
passive sentence.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.200
GEORGE ZAIDAN: It
is a very passive--

00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.780
what you mean by that?

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.477
Explain.

00:11:00.477 --> 00:11:02.310
AUDIENCE: Well, if
further delayed-- I mean,

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.945
what you really mean is
this could be troublesome.

00:11:04.945 --> 00:11:05.515
This is bad.

00:11:05.515 --> 00:11:06.015
Right?

00:11:06.015 --> 00:11:07.010
Or it could be bad.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:07.510
Right?

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.301
But their way of stating
as further delayed

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:12.510
isn't very-- it's
not a very active way

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.925
of saying the same thing.

00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:17.050
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So here's
another interesting thing.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.155
Negatively impact-- those
are not difficult words.

00:11:20.155 --> 00:11:21.780
It's easy to understand
what they mean,

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.050
but let's think about
that for a second.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.760
So what doesn't negatively
impact our way of life

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.209
mean in colloquial language?

00:11:29.209 --> 00:11:31.500
What would you say to someone
if you were going to say,

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.554
in 100 years climate
change will do what?

00:11:35.554 --> 00:11:36.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.110
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.730
Will it negatively
impact our way of life?

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:39.980
No, it's going to kill us all.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:45.290
That's sort of the real-life
subtext of this sentence.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:46.228
What else?

00:11:54.196 --> 00:11:56.188
AUDIENCE: The are a lot
of complicated grammar

00:11:56.188 --> 00:11:59.040
structures-- are
contributed, is delayed.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.740
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Mm-hmm.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.940
You have to-- I mean, you wait
till the end of the sentence

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.250
before you get the payoff.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.120
Right?

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.900
You don't understand what
the point of the sentence

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.527
is until you get to "negatively
impact our way of life

00:12:12.527 --> 00:12:14.110
if serious action
is further delayed."

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.859
And really, you don't
understand-- I mean,

00:12:15.859 --> 00:12:17.310
the point is we need to act now.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.810
That's what this
sentence is saying.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.000
If we act later, we're screwed.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.510
And you don't get that until,
"if serious action is further

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.010
delayed."

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.814
So yeah, the payoff really
comes at the very, very end.

00:12:26.814 --> 00:12:30.246
AUDIENCE: It's a fun exercise to
eliminate all of the adjectives

00:12:30.246 --> 00:12:33.260
and look at the nouns and verbs.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:33.860
Right?

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.776
Just take a second and
see if you can do that.

00:12:35.776 --> 00:12:38.690
It actually makes
it really simple.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:49.780
Emissions are contributing
to change and impact--

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.467
like picking out all of the
things that suddenly simplifies

00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:54.915
everything-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:54.915 --> 00:12:56.456
There's a lot of
descriptors in there

00:12:56.456 --> 00:12:58.600
that are very distracting.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.750
So now that we've
done this, let's

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.352
rephrase it as if we were
saying it to someone on camera.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.762
PROFESSOR: Or what if just
to someone in general?

00:13:10.762 --> 00:13:12.720
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK, yeah,
to someone in general.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.640
Say it to me.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.532
Anyone.

00:13:16.532 --> 00:13:21.396
AUDIENCE: If we don't
act now, [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:21.396 --> 00:13:22.270
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Right.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.815
Another version.

00:13:24.815 --> 00:13:28.285
AUDIENCE: Man-made CO2
emissions are hurting us.

00:13:28.285 --> 00:13:29.255
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK.

00:13:29.255 --> 00:13:31.195
Another.

00:13:31.195 --> 00:13:32.650
Yeah.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.470
AUDIENCE: Humans
create CO2 emissions.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.220
We must act now or suffer.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.360
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I like that.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.900
We must act now or suffer.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:41.790
That's good.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:42.626
Anyone else?

00:13:50.393 --> 00:13:51.934
Someone who hasn't
said anything yet.

00:14:08.895 --> 00:14:12.110
AUDIENCE: If we don't
stop emitting CO2,

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:15.027
life will look very
different soon.

00:14:15.027 --> 00:14:15.860
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Good.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:16.359
OK.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.340
So the point I'm trying to make
by having five or six of you

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.040
say it each a different way
is that there is no one right

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.410
way to write a script.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.450
There are lots of interesting,
engaging, dramatic ways

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.180
to say the same thing.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.770
And we are going to
get into that now

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.350
with your examples, which
we're going to spend

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.885
considerably more time on.

00:14:41.885 --> 00:14:43.497
PROFESSOR: Before
you move on, George.

00:14:43.497 --> 00:14:44.288
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yes?

00:14:44.288 --> 00:14:48.920
PROFESSOR: So it's always an
Interesting challenge balancing

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.974
avoiding being too
jargon-y and ending up

00:14:52.974 --> 00:14:53.890
baiting your audience.

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:54.070
Right?

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.660
Like, there's no reason why you
can't say that words, climate

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.912
change.

00:14:57.912 --> 00:15:02.421
Even though those are technical
terms. [INAUDIBLE] What was it?

00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:02.920
Anthro--

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.420
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Anthropogenic.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.920
PROFESSOR: Anthropogenic.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.130
I mean, we talk about this
with [INAUDIBLE] scripts

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:07.730
all the time.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:11.764
The way you deliver
a word, for instance,

00:15:11.764 --> 00:15:14.252
can help a lot with conveying.

00:15:14.252 --> 00:15:15.845
What was the word-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:15.845 --> 00:15:17.220
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I
mean if you want

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.687
to-- if you're going to use that
same word four or five times

00:15:20.687 --> 00:15:22.770
throughout the script, and
it's an important word,

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.180
and it relates to a
demo or something--

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.580
if there's some reason
for you to use jargon,

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.860
it's OK to define it.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.170
As long as you just
define it like you

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.880
would to another person.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.256
Like you say anthropogenic
means human-made.

00:15:37.256 --> 00:15:38.880
And then you go on
and use it later on.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.690
That's fine.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:41.450
You don't want to do that
like six times in the video

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.820
and define six different
words, because then you

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.660
overload your audience.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.430
But that's true.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.500
There is-- if you
find yourself having

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.150
to say human-made,
man-made, woman-made.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:53.190
Like if you are stretching
to try and find alternatives

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:57.150
to word five or six times that
you could just define and get

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.870
it over with, that's fine.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.570
I wouldn't limit that
probably to like one or two

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.020
words a video, or
one or two words

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.835
per like three,
four minute video.

00:16:05.835 --> 00:16:08.210
PROFESSOR: And the other reason
why it's really important

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:11.826
to actually do the exercise of
reading your script out lout,

00:16:11.826 --> 00:16:14.909
or even just flipping
your script over and not

00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:16.950
looking at it and trying
to describe the contents

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.136
to the person next to you,
is that-- a very bad habit

00:16:20.136 --> 00:16:22.945
of mine, which I am
constantly finding

00:16:22.945 --> 00:16:25.310
I am annoyed toward
it a lot-- is

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.660
that I get very newscaster-y.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.610
So I may end up having a
script that sounds good

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.120
when you say it out loud.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.320
But it sounds like
you're a reporter talking

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.250
about the latest news
update [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.128
CO2 emission-- can you
go back to that quote?

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.470
Yeah, like the middle
part isn't actually

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.630
that crazy to say out loud.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.605
It's contributing to
global climate change

00:16:51.605 --> 00:16:53.910
and could negatively
impact our way of life.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:54.410
Right?

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.370
Like that doesn't sound
too crazy to say out loud.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:02.030
But it sounds like someone is
saying that in the context of,

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.069
I'm here at the
MIT Course One lab

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.990
where researchers
are finding a way

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.759
to prevent global climate
change from negatively impacting

00:17:09.759 --> 00:17:10.349
our life.

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:10.849
Right?

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.480
It doesn't sound
like I'm just talking

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:18.650
[INAUDIBLE] like a lot of
men in admissions are harming

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.460
[INAUDIBLE] life or
something like that.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.060
I also-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.190
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.504
The way you write
influences the way

00:17:25.504 --> 00:17:27.170
you're going to
naturally say something.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.919
And you could say this
sentence both ways.

00:17:28.919 --> 00:17:31.530
So you could say it, you know,
anthropogenic CO2 emissions

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.400
are contributing to
global climate change

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.970
and could negatively
impact our way of life

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:37.890
if serious action
is further delayed.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.860
That sounds like the
7 o'clock news, right?

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.670
You could say you
could say it like this.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.590
Look, anthropogenic
CO2 emissions

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.391
are contributing to
global climate change.

00:17:46.391 --> 00:17:48.390
And that could really
negatively impact our life

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:49.860
if we don't do
something right now.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.660
I mean, it's basically
the same line,

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.110
but it's said two
completely different ways.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:59.790
And it's much harder to say
a line like this naturally,

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.140
but it's possible.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.960
So the way you
write can impact how

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.240
you end up saying something.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.281
And that's important too.

00:18:06.281 --> 00:18:09.010
We will-- whoever of
you ends up shooting

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.510
with us in the last
week of January,

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:13.310
we are going to guaranteed
say, no, try that again.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.840
It sounds too new newscaster-y.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.720
And this is a style choice,
but for Science Out Loud, it's

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.380
not news.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.870
We don't want it to come
across like, here at MIT,

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.370
we're talking to
you about whatever.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.953
Because MIT already
has a news office.

00:18:24.953 --> 00:18:27.130
They do that well.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.420
Our goal is different.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:33.370
And so making that style choice
consciously from the beginning

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:34.787
is important.

00:18:34.787 --> 00:18:36.620
But if you want to write
like a newscaster--

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.370
I mean, if you're
writing for a news show,

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.420
if the point of
the show is news,

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.141
then that could
be perfectly fine.

00:18:44.141 --> 00:18:44.640
Good?

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.848
PROFESSOR: Were you going
to show the Ira Glass clip?

00:18:46.848 --> 00:18:47.800
Later for hosting.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.550
Yep.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.930
It might actually be
fine to show that now

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.880
while we're talking about it.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.814
Let we find it.

00:18:55.814 --> 00:18:56.480
Yep, here we go.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.660
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Oh, yeah.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.635
There we go.

00:19:07.635 --> 00:19:09.275
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:09.275 --> 00:19:11.150
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Do you
guys know who Ira Glass

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.599
is-- This American Life?

00:19:14.599 --> 00:19:15.640
He's a radio personality.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.660
He's been doing this
for many, many years.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.362
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:21.362 --> 00:19:23.320
IRA GLASS: I'm going to
play you a clip of tape

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.190
from my eighth year.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:29.267
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:29.267 --> 00:19:31.350
IRA GLASS: [ON RECORDING]
It's not such a long way

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.380
from the local grocery store
to the international debate

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.650
over whether sorghum and meat
production are causing corn

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.070
to decline in Latin America.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.610
There's a general
air of prosperity

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:45.620
here, partly thanks to
Mexican imports of US grains,

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.410
which helps boost
our farm economy.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.530
Mexico is now one of our
biggest grain customers,

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.910
buying a half billion to $1
billion worth every year,

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:56.950
including corn to
feed its people

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.952
and sorghum to
feed its livestock.

00:19:58.952 --> 00:20:00.160
Like what am I talking about?

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.285
Like, I don't even understand--
like, I wrote this.

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:05.530
I don't even
understand what it is.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:08.810
OK, also, like every part
of this is ill conceived.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.060
OK?

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.396
The writing is horrible.

00:20:12.396 --> 00:20:14.270
You can't even follow
what I'm talking about.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.894
And then the performance like--
OK, just a little tip if you're

00:20:16.894 --> 00:20:19.260
performing for broadcast,
you don't underline

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.130
every third word for
emphasis, because it

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.795
sounds really unnatural.

00:20:23.795 --> 00:20:26.420
What you want to do is you want
to talk the way people normally

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.920
talk.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.440
[ON RECORDING] This helps
cut our own trade deficit

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.460
and benefits everyone
in the US economy.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.590
But in Mexico, this
policy has lead

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:40.150
to fewer tortillas for the
poor and unappetizing tortillas

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.190
for everyone else.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.950
Again, like this is
the most moronic kind

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.620
of like-- it doesn't
mean anything.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.350
And it's hard.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.885
It's actually kind of an
interesting story, which

00:20:47.885 --> 00:20:49.135
I'll say to you in a sentence.

00:20:49.135 --> 00:20:52.220
Which is, because Mexico
produces a lot of stuff

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.720
that they ship to the United
States-- tomatoes and all sorts

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.330
of really wonderful
food that we eat here--

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.020
they don't make enough
corn for their own people.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:00.890
That's the story.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:04.200
So for us to get
really great tomatoes,

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.130
or semi-great
tomatoes, year round,

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.360
basically, Mexicans eat worse.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.200
That's the story.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.380
And it's kind of an
interesting idea.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:10.880
Right?

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.940
Like that's actually
sort of like a cool idea

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.430
executed in the
worst possible way.

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.100
So he's talking about
two things there.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.805
The first is how
he wrote the story,

00:21:19.805 --> 00:21:21.680
and the second is how
he delivered the story.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.180
Right?

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.370
So in the second part of
the clip where he tells you

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.349
the point of the story
in like two sentences

00:21:27.349 --> 00:21:29.390
and you can actually
understand what he's saying,

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:30.450
that's a writing issue.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.400
And then the point that he
makes about, don't underline

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.470
every third word, once
you hear that-- like,

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.200
if you listen to the local news
or even the national news--

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.324
I mean, once you hear that,
you can't un-hear that.

00:21:42.324 --> 00:21:46.440
It's incredible how
pervasive that tone is.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.000
Because it makes
people sound very

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.910
important and official
when they choose

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.740
certain words to underline
and deliver correctly.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:58.420
And, you know, that is something
that is fine for the news,

00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.660
because it has a purpose.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.790
But it's just-- I mean,
I think it's terrible.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.980
And Ira Glass does too.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.442
If you listen to-- his show
is called This American Life.

00:22:10.442 --> 00:22:12.150
And if you could just
listen to the first

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:13.750
like three, four
minutes of any show,

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.450
it's a great example
of really good hosting.

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:20.840
Marketplace is another show
that has a similar style

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.380
and feel to it that's
good to listen to.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:28.190
And then everything-- I think
eight minutes past the hour

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.510
or something-- NPR--
or every hour--

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.880
NPR goes back to their
local news stations.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.200
So you can hear the difference
between newscaster-y delivery

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.040
and natural delivery.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.290
It's a really good exercise.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.600
Like I say, once you hear
it, you can't un-hear it.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.490
So let's go back to writing.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.040
What we're going
to do now is I'm

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.940
going to have-- I
picked, I think,

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.310
three or four scripts at random.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.870
And I'm going to have whoever
wrote the script come up here

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:57.600
and read it.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.990
And then we're going to do a
group critique of the script.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.530
This is a humbling experience.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:06.276
We are going to say-- we're
going to point out ways

00:23:06.276 --> 00:23:07.650
that your script
has been better.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.290
But that's OK.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.140
That's how you get better.

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:15.180
And it's an experience
that we will go through

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.030
again and again.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.950
Well, I won't-- because
I won't be here,

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.200
but you will with Elizabeth
again and again throughout

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.540
the rest of the course,
and especially in January.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.030
Because we are going to be
very anal about, does this

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:30.480
make sense, does this convey
the idea we wanted to convey,

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.720
does it do it effectively?

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.410
So this is, I think, going to be
your first experience of that.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.252
So who wrote that?

00:23:36.252 --> 00:23:38.085
And by the way, I picked
random-- all right,

00:23:38.085 --> 00:23:41.290
come on up-- I picked random
sections of the script

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.870
to talk through.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:47.060
Do you want him to put on a mic?

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.580
Do you want him to wear a mic?

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:49.150
Yes?

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:49.600
Does it matter?

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:49.990
AUDIENCE: It doesn't matter.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:51.170
OK.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:51.560
GEORGE ZAIDAN: All
right, come on.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.360
What's your name again?

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:52.820
AUDIENCE: David.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:53.695
GEORGE ZAIDAN: David.

00:23:53.695 --> 00:23:54.560
Nice to meet you.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.490
I'm sorry you're going first.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:56.990
All right.

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:58.330
So stand up there.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:01.510
You can read the text here.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:04.280
Deliver it like you would
like you would deliver it

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.340
if you were being recorded,
which you are being recorded.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.800
And I'm going to
sit in your place.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.008
And we're all going to have
a conversation about it.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:19.677
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I was
sitting next to my roommate.

00:24:19.677 --> 00:24:21.885
So I was actually kind of
shy about reading out loud.

00:24:21.885 --> 00:24:23.520
So actually, I tried
to read out loud.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.730
But I read it semi-internally.

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:29.649
So maybe that's why some of
this would sound a bit odd.

00:24:29.649 --> 00:24:30.690
GEORGE ZAIDAN: That's OK.

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:31.490
No judgment yet.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:32.809
Let's get it out there.

00:24:32.809 --> 00:24:33.434
PROFESSOR: Yet?

00:24:33.434 --> 00:24:34.856
No judgement ever.

00:24:34.856 --> 00:24:37.409
This is a safe space.

00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:37.950
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:41.280
So my topic's about why
do some people handle

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.840
cold better than others.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.760
So why I was
interested is that, why

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.060
is it that some people are
more fearful about the cold,

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.434
that they'd rather die than
be caught outside without all

00:24:49.434 --> 00:24:51.430
the winter gear, mask
and all, while others can

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.370
wear one layer for morning jog.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.010
Actually, I say
yesterday morning.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:57.869
And what makes all
the difference?

00:24:57.869 --> 00:24:59.910
So the understand this,
we first need to find out

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.780
how our body reacts to cold.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.110
The first point is that
the changes that way it

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.752
burns energy more efficient.

00:25:05.752 --> 00:25:07.210
We actually burn
more carbohydrates

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.770
through our metabolic system
to generate more heat.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:13.667
Imagine a giant furnace
within our bodies.

00:25:13.667 --> 00:25:15.083
As winter starts
to come, we throw

00:25:15.083 --> 00:25:17.699
more bits of carbohydrates
and start energy

00:25:17.699 --> 00:25:19.740
to burn, and create more
heat to warm our bodies.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.589
Then we cue pictures of
furnace and burning stuff.

00:25:22.589 --> 00:25:23.630
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK, great.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:24.299
OK.

00:25:24.299 --> 00:25:25.590
You can come back and sit down.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.950
Thank you.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:26.449
Excellent.

00:25:31.589 --> 00:25:33.380
I want to point out
something that actually

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.070
has nothing to do with writing.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.980
When you were--
very similar to how

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.636
there is a newscaster-y tone
to deliver things, especially

00:25:42.636 --> 00:25:44.260
when you're reading
off a teleprompter,

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.080
there is also a
reading tone to deliver

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.100
things, versus reading something
out loud versus saying it

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:49.840
to someone.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.300
And when you got to the end
of your first paragraph--

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.020
so you said, without all the
winter gear on, mask and all,

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.530
while others can wear one
layer for a morning jog--

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.620
I saw that yesterday actually.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.220
Did anyone else
notice how when he

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.320
switched from
reading to talking,

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.120
you instantly
snapped to attention?

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.290
Because, I mean, here
his focus is there.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.780
And then when he
switches over to,

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.110
I saw that yesterday, by the
way, he looks at you all.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:18.020
He makes that connection with
you, and you respond instantly.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:18.720
Right?

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.942
So that's something
that is maybe better

00:26:20.942 --> 00:26:22.400
when we when we
talk about hosting,

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.040
but since you did
it right there,

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.610
I wanted to point it out.

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:32.660
OK, so now in one
sentence, someone

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.960
summarize the sort of
main point of this part

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.947
of the script for me.

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:41.802
Without re-reading
it-- sorry that

00:26:41.802 --> 00:26:43.260
was a crucial piece
of information.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.740
Don't read it again.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.060
AUDIENCE: Carbohydrates
generate heat.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.101
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK, how?

00:26:52.101 --> 00:26:54.350
AUDIENCE: Carbohydrates are
the fuel to generate heat.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:57.849
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK, that's
a little more specific.

00:26:57.849 --> 00:26:59.640
Does someone else have
a different sentence

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.010
they were thinking of?

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:00.831
Yeah.

00:27:00.831 --> 00:27:03.122
AUDIENCE: Our bodies process
carbohydrates differently,

00:27:03.122 --> 00:27:06.550
so we react to
differently to the cold.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.549
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK, cool.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:16.850
What technique is
used here to explain

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:19.920
how we process carbohydrates?

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.032
AUDIENCE: Metaphor?

00:27:26.032 --> 00:27:26.990
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Explain.

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:28.140
Where?

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:32.660
AUDIENCE: The giant
furnace within our bodies.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.295
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Does it work?

00:27:34.295 --> 00:27:34.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.660
I think it makes you
understand something

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.605
that's technical and scientific
in a more relatable way.

00:27:42.605 --> 00:27:44.480
GEORGE ZAIDAN: What do
you mean by relatable?

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.155
AUDIENCE: Well if you have
an oil furnace at home

00:27:49.155 --> 00:27:52.850
and you're used to that thing
cranking out in the winter,

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.350
then you can kind
of relate to that.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:55.224
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Right.

00:27:55.224 --> 00:27:59.410
So your body is an incredibly
complex piece of machinery.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:03.000
It is basically
unlike anything else

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.280
that we're used to in our world.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.964
But a furnace, an oil
furnace, or even a fireplace,

00:28:08.964 --> 00:28:10.630
or whatever, something
that burns stuff,

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.900
is something that your audience
pretty much you can count on

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.010
will have seen that.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.530
So relating this very
complex piece of machinery

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:21.710
to something that's much
simpler is a great way

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:27.292
to clue your audience in
immediately on what's going on.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.550
We can talk about
metaphors more later

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:36.470
and what the tricky
parts of metaphors are,

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:39.040
but what else here
makes this effective?

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:43.630
What else makes
you want to listen?

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:46.520
Makes you interested
to know more?

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.460
What techniques?

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.810
AUDIENCE: Asking the question?

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:50.690
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.910
So the first paragraph
is all questions.

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:56.570
That's all it is. it's just
sentences of questions.

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.430
So why is that useful?

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.690
Why does that help?

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:08.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] they
have to know the answer.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:11.549
They [INAUDIBLE] so when
the [INAUDIBLE] speaks,

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:12.774
they will want to continue.

00:29:12.774 --> 00:29:14.440
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah,
exactly, and that's

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.410
a really common technique.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.409
You start with the question
with-- you start off

00:29:17.409 --> 00:29:20.400
the video, excuse me, with
either one or more questions.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.697
What else is effective here?

00:29:24.992 --> 00:29:26.200
Do you want to say something?

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.380
AUDIENCE: I mean the
questions themselves work.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.965
It's not that pose--
you could have

00:29:30.965 --> 00:29:35.650
posed much bigger questions
like why do I get cold?

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:38.490
That's not a really
compelling question,

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:41.020
but it's a-- the
second question,

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.133
why is it that some people
are so fearful in the cold

00:29:44.133 --> 00:29:47.060
that they would rather be
caught dead than go outside?

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.750
And when you said like
I just say this outside,

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.920
I see it outside
all the time too,

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.357
so the questions
themselves immediately

00:29:56.357 --> 00:29:58.005
jump into relating
to the viewer.

00:29:58.005 --> 00:29:59.380
GEORGE ZAIDAN:
And it's something

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:05.740
that is a common-- we didn't
talk about-- your idea should

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.370
be good, right?

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.530
But having a good idea
is an important part

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:12.769
of making an interesting
and readable script,

00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:14.810
and this is something that
we've all experienced.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:16.268
I mean you walk
around MIT, and you

00:30:16.268 --> 00:30:19.410
see people walking around with
shorts in the weather outside.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:21.990
It's like 12 degrees
outside or whatever.

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:24.200
And you think, my god,
they must be insane.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.830
But no, maybe they actually
don't feel cold like we do.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:31.410
And that is something that
is one of those things

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:33.859
that you see a lot, and you
don't really process it,

00:30:33.859 --> 00:30:35.650
but when you really
stop to think about it,

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.440
you're like wow, that
is really bizarre.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.740
I want to know more.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.030
So you're right.

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:42.210
It's not just asking questions
in and of themselves,

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:43.626
but it's what are
those questions,

00:30:43.626 --> 00:30:47.120
and do they point you
somewhere interesting?

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.380
What else is effective here?

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.036
AUDIENCE: There's
a "we" right there

00:30:51.036 --> 00:30:52.679
that I feel its
absolutely essential.

00:30:52.679 --> 00:30:53.720
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Which one?

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.740
AUDIENCE: Right in the
very middle of the page,

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.724
there's-- middle,
middle, middle.

00:30:58.724 --> 00:31:00.140
GEORGE ZAIDAN: To
understand this,

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.750
we first need to find out how
our body reacts to the cold.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.780
AUDIENCE: That "we" I
think is so essential,

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.490
because if it were a you
or a me it wouldn't work,

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:12.319
but the "we" is very
appropriately engaging.

00:31:12.319 --> 00:31:13.610
GEORGE ZAIDAN: What does it do?

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:15.366
AUDIENCE: I means that
you and I together

00:31:15.366 --> 00:31:17.200
are going to figure this out.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.700
I'm not going to
tell you, but we're

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.250
going to explore this together.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.807
And that's the perfect
tone for this piece.

00:31:22.807 --> 00:31:24.640
GEORGE ZAIDAN: You are
leading your audience

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.440
on an adventure
of understanding.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.510
You're the guide,
because you're on camera,

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:30.880
but you're bringing
them with you-- versus

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.710
I'm just going to open
your head and dump

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:33.840
this information in
your head, and then

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.470
you're going to know it.

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:35.530
That's not what this.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.380
This is an odyssey
of exploration

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.860
that we're going
to go on together.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.566
Anything else that we want
to point out is effective?

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:48.810
OK.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:49.896
What could be improved?

00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:00.415
AUDIENCE: I think the pacing
makes it easier for the host

00:32:00.415 --> 00:32:03.810
to read, so just have less
commas but more maybe periods,

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:07.170
and just split it up
into shorter sentences.

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:12.280
So you don't have to keep
[INAUDIBLE] for a long time.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.370
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah the
sentences do get kind of long.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:19.390
The last paragraph
is just two sentences

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:23.140
and then the middle question
in the first paragraph

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.610
is a very long sentence.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:26.700
So I agree.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.980
That's one of the
default patterns

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:32.042
that you fall into when
you're writing something.

00:32:32.042 --> 00:32:34.000
When you're thinking of
something in your head,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.630
you tend to think in sort
of long, unbroken streams

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:40.600
of thought, and that tends to
manifest itself on the page.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.114
Whereas when you
talk, it may not

00:32:44.114 --> 00:32:46.030
be sentences in the
traditional sense of-- OK,

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.910
I'm going to stop talking
now-- there's a period.

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:49.284
And now I'm going
to start again.

00:32:49.284 --> 00:32:52.540
But you do have pauses
in your speech that

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.640
let your audience
understand what's going on,

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.690
and you can count
those as sentences.

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:59.240
What else?

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.106
AUDIENCE: Maybe
putting the metaphor

00:33:01.106 --> 00:33:06.580
before the
scientific-- picturing

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:10.801
the giant furnace [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:10.801 --> 00:33:15.200
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So
give us a version

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.155
of how you would
imagine that would go.

00:33:17.155 --> 00:33:18.530
AUDIENCE: Imagine
a giant furnace

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:22.760
in the winter, burning coal
and charcoal to generate heat.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.250
Now imagine the body,
the metabolic system

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.082
as that giant furnace.

00:33:27.082 --> 00:33:29.312
And then the coal and
charcoal as the carbohydrates

00:33:29.312 --> 00:33:29.860
in your food.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:30.380
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah, great.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.840
That's an excellent point.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.740
So the way this
script is written,

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:43.070
the simple technical answer that
has no metaphor comes first,

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.450
and then you have the metaphor.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:45.850
But the way that--
remind me of your name?

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:46.490
AUDIENCE: Kenneth.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:47.448
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Kenneth.

00:33:47.448 --> 00:33:50.004
The way that Kenneth
said it is, OK-- we're

00:33:50.004 --> 00:33:50.920
going to start simple.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.950
We're going to start
with something you know,

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:53.300
a giant furnace.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.230
Got that in your head?

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:55.030
Great.

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.432
Now imagine that your body
is that furnace, and instead

00:33:57.432 --> 00:33:59.890
of coal, you've got sugar, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:04.520
And you the metaphor like that,
and that's sort of a principle

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.210
of start small, start easy,
start with something you know,

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.920
and then build layer
by layer on that.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.090
And that is something that
is not one of my rules,

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:15.186
but easily could be.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.092
Everywhere except the very
first sentence of the video,

00:34:22.092 --> 00:34:23.550
it's a great
technique to make sure

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:27.151
that your audience is caught
up with you all the time.

00:34:27.151 --> 00:34:28.900
And I say everywhere
except the first bit,

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.840
because the exception
is that if you

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.070
want to start with
a compelling hook,

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.000
you might start
completely out of order,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.250
and then come back to
something later in the video

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.166
just for the purposes
of hooking your audience

00:34:40.166 --> 00:34:43.370
and getting them through
the first 10 seconds.

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:46.409
But other than that,
that sort of expansion--

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:48.239
I sort of look at
it as a funnel.

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:51.449
You start really simple,
and then work your way out

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:53.296
to complicated.

00:34:53.296 --> 00:34:54.232
What else?

00:34:56.898 --> 00:34:58.606
AUDIENCE: I'm not
really sure whether you

00:34:58.606 --> 00:35:01.479
need the middle sentence.

00:35:01.479 --> 00:35:02.520
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Which one?

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.020
This one?

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.074
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:04.074 --> 00:35:05.240
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Let's try it.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.120
So give us a read-- read
the last few lines here,

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.500
and then why don't you go
into Kenneth's version of it.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.190
So read the last
couple of lines here,

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:17.160
and then go into the furnace,
and we'll see how it sounds.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.200
AUDIENCE: Well Alice
can wear one layer

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.990
or more layers for
the morning job-- what

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:22.540
makes all the difference?

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:26.720
[INAUDIBLE] What makes
all the difference?

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.010
Imagine a giant furnace
within out bodies.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:31.175
Our bodies changes and
burns energy [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:31.175 --> 00:35:32.050
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Great.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:32.840
That's perfect.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.550
So I would agree with you-- I
think you're absolutely right.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.300
I don't think we need
the middle sentence,

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.980
because you're
asking a question,

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.930
and then you go right
into this image.

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:43.680
And it's clear that
you're not immediately

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.920
answering the question,
because imagine a giant furnace

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:52.090
is not the answer to what
makes the difference, right?

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:55.120
But it's clear that, from your
tone, the way you said it-- so

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.990
you say-- what's the difference?

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:58.910
Well, imagine your body
is a giant furnace.

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:04.040
So the way that you say
something can-- essentially,

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.715
you're saying this sentence
in the tone of your voice.

00:36:06.715 --> 00:36:08.840
So you don't actually need
to say that sentence out

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.660
loud great.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.440
Anything else we can
eliminate by the way?

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.176
What can we cut?

00:36:23.044 --> 00:36:25.210
AUDIENCE: I think you
already mentioned it,

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:28.580
but the second
sentence-- I think

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.720
you can say that a
little less wordy.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.812
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Give it a shot.

00:36:33.812 --> 00:36:35.520
AUDIENCE: So why do
people hate the cold?

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:43.735
That they'd rather die than
be caught outside without all

00:36:43.735 --> 00:36:46.267
their winter clothes on.

00:36:46.267 --> 00:36:47.850
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So
the way you're doing

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:49.780
it is to sort of
piecemeal try and chop out

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:50.716
certain words, right?

00:36:50.716 --> 00:36:51.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.048
GEORGE ZAIDAN: But
take a step back, look

00:36:53.048 --> 00:36:56.530
at the meaning of the
sentence, reformulate it,

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:59.850
and just say as if you
were saying it to me.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:03.310
Actually, do say it to me.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:05.030
AUDIENCE: So why do
we hate the cold?

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:06.770
Why do some people
have to bundle up

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:10.501
and others don't have to wear
as much clothes, or something

00:37:10.501 --> 00:37:11.000
like that.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.166
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah, I think
you're on to something.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.660
You walk around on a
cold winter's day--

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.360
why are some people bundled up
and some people wearing shorts?

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.210
What's the deal?

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:23.540
That's a much shorter way of
saying, essentially, that.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:27.150
There is a
theatricality in the way

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:30.670
that the first
paragraph is written

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:34.130
that you lose by changing
it to the shorter version,

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:38.690
but that comes from the
benefit of you're getting

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:40.620
into the material faster.

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.734
But there is a trade-off there.

00:37:42.734 --> 00:37:45.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
You can also

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:48.685
accomplish all you say and
include the extra detail

00:37:48.685 --> 00:37:49.575
with your images.

00:37:49.575 --> 00:37:52.120
So if you show an example
of someone bundled up

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.190
with all the layers,
and then a jogger

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.240
with barely anything
other than shorts,

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.083
then you have all the content
that was in that sentence,

00:37:59.083 --> 00:38:01.052
but you're using the
rest of the medium

00:38:01.052 --> 00:38:02.260
that you haven't worked with.

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.130
GEORGE ZAIDAN: You
reminded me of the thing

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:03.980
that I was going to talk about.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:04.479
Thank you.

00:38:04.479 --> 00:38:06.780
That's exactly what I
wanted to talk about.

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.640
Yeah, so this is really
really, really easy

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.200
to forget when you're writing
a script-- is that there's

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.860
going to be a whole other
layer of information that

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:20.190
is available to your audience
in the final product.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:24.290
So to the extent that you
can, I would absolutely

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:26.710
encourage use of
visuals that are

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.660
complimentary to the script.

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:34.580
So the way that I-- I don't have
the slides for this, but let's

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.950
say that you wanted
to show a synapse.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:39.470
You guys know what a synapse is?

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:45.370
The part in your brain
where neurotransmitters go?

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:59.070
So you've got this,
this, and then-- OK.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.360
So this is one nerve.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.440
This is another nerve.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.440
This is just the space
in between the nerves.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.060
And these dots are
chemicals that this nerve

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.710
is transmitting to this nerve.

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:14.320
These sort of like
Poseidon spears

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:19.010
are receptors for
these chemicals.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:22.980
Now the way that I said that--
if you were to write down

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.136
what I just said-- these
dots, this nerve, this space,

00:39:26.136 --> 00:39:28.010
but this area is the
space between the nerve,

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:30.010
you'd have absolutely no
idea what I was talking

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:32.010
about without the image.

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:34.312
Whereas if you didn't
have this image,

00:39:34.312 --> 00:39:36.020
and you were just
writing a script trying

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.070
to explain what a synapse
is, you would have to say,

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:42.080
a synapse is the space
between two nerves.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:48.000
One nerve releases chemicals
that cross that space

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.640
and get captured by
receptors on the other nerve,

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.730
and that's how data is
transmitted from one nerve

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:57.090
to another.

00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:59.930
So if you were writing a script
without the visuals in mind,

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.720
you can very easily
fall into the trap

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.350
of doing what I
just did in writing

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:05.750
a script that stands alone.

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:08.710
Whereas if you're
thinking images,

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.520
it's going to be mostly
like, look at this.

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.230
Check this out.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.020
This spaghetti shaped
thing, those dots,

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.560
that kind of
language, and that's

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:20.056
totally OK and even encouraged
when you're doing a video.

00:40:20.056 --> 00:40:21.430
And that's exactly
what you said.

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:25.550
Another example is to
basically talk in general terms

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:29.090
and put specific visuals
that compliment the script.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.430
You were going to say something?

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:32.586
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
just that it's not

00:40:32.586 --> 00:40:35.306
just that someone can
wear less clothes,

00:40:35.306 --> 00:40:38.060
it's that they're comfortable
wearing less clothes.

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.130
And to me that's an
important concept

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:43.030
that we can't use in
that first paragraph.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:45.040
Because my husband's
like this, where

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.955
he can be wearing
half the clothes,

00:40:46.955 --> 00:40:48.052
and he's happy that way.

00:40:48.052 --> 00:40:50.260
It's one thing to wear less
clothes and be miserable,

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:53.850
but it's another thing to be
comfortable with that choice,

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:54.493
right?

00:40:54.493 --> 00:40:57.044
I see students on campus
without shoes, and I'm like,

00:40:57.044 --> 00:40:58.400
what's going on?

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:03.080
But the fact that they-- it's
one thing to wear less clothes

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.551
and be shivering, and
cold, and miserable,

00:41:05.551 --> 00:41:07.092
but it's another to
have less clothes

00:41:07.092 --> 00:41:09.020
and actually be OK with that.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.940
GEORGE ZAIDAN: And following
that even further--

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.550
I just had a
question in my mind.

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:17.640
Let's say you took two people.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.610
One who can wear shorts
in the dead of winter,

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:21.690
and one who has to be
completely bundled up.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:24.510
If you transport them into the
Antarctic or the Arctic where

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:25.510
it's-- I don't know.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:27.900
Pick a really cold
temperature, subzero.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:34.070
And just let them stand there
naked for like 20 days-- who

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.820
dies first?

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:39.390
Is it the person's
comfort, or are they

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:45.070
actually better adapted
to survive in the cold?

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:47.200
Which is a really
interesting distinction,

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.131
because if someone's
comfortable in the cold,

00:41:49.131 --> 00:41:51.380
but they're still going to
die at the exact same time,

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:56.060
then yeah, comfort is great,
but we haven't, as a species,

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.440
adapted to better
overcome the cold.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.090
Whereas if it's really
your body is substantially

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:06.640
different in a way that could
help the human race survive

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.586
the next Ice Age, that's cool.

00:42:09.586 --> 00:42:11.127
So that's a really
interesting point.

00:42:11.127 --> 00:42:14.414
AUDIENCE: And that's taking
the familiar and making

00:42:14.414 --> 00:42:16.240
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.510
It's taking an
instance that you see

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:21.192
and a question that maybe
you very fleetingly have,

00:42:21.192 --> 00:42:24.310
which is how is that
some people don't have

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:29.172
to put on a huge winter
jacket and can walk outside

00:42:29.172 --> 00:42:29.880
in the snow fine?

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.940
Whereas I have to layer up?

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.526
It's taking that
familiar question

00:42:33.526 --> 00:42:38.650
and slowly building
out to this pretty epic

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:43.643
concept of-- are certain people
within our human race better

00:42:43.643 --> 00:42:45.960
adapted for total catastrophe?

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:49.103
AUDIENCE: I'm not saying that
you have to go that route,

00:42:49.103 --> 00:42:52.570
but I think that
that's why watch

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:55.370
some of these viral videos,
because it takes the familiar

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:58.160
and makes it unfamiliar.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.566
AUDIENCE: It also-- I
mean, not to totally go

00:43:00.566 --> 00:43:02.510
a different route--
but a question

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:06.834
that this could go into is
are skinny people versus

00:43:06.834 --> 00:43:08.250
fat people-- does
it have anything

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:10.920
to do with your physical being?

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.716
Or is it your
chemical being that

00:43:12.716 --> 00:43:16.280
makes you be able to handle
the situation better,

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.540
and can you change that?

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.680
Or is it just how you're built?

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.240
AUDIENCE: But if you
tighten this first part up,

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.370
it leaves you the
room to explore

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:26.330
the really cool questions.

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:30.147
We could easily cut all
this text down into half

00:43:30.147 --> 00:43:31.460
it's length.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.790
Why do some people handle
the cold better than others?

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:38.010
How is it that this person
who's wearing shorts in winter

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:42.270
is fine, whereas this person
is wearing five jackets?

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:43.670
What's making the difference?

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:47.630
Well, imagine a giant furnace.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:49.850
That furnace is actually us.

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:51.950
You're taking out the
whole middle chunk.

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:55.187
I also think you can highlight
the unexpected nature

00:43:55.187 --> 00:43:57.119
of the furnace metaphor right?

00:43:57.119 --> 00:43:58.910
You're taking the
familiar ones, and you're

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:00.190
entering the unfamiliar.

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:02.350
Imagine a furnace--
everyone can picture that--

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:06.800
but the crazy thing is that
our bodies are furnaces.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:10.120
We kind of did that
with the [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.956
And then the whole end--
and winter starts to come

00:44:13.956 --> 00:44:15.580
and we throw more
bits of carbohydrates

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:18.290
and stored energy.

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:22.140
Carbohydrates and stored energy
are similar enough things

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.864
that you can distill it
down into one phrase.

00:44:24.864 --> 00:44:26.250
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Sugars.

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:27.530
AUDIENCE: Sugars, yeah.

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.030
But by tightening all
of this intro stuff

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:33.930
up into two concepts,
it leaves you

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:38.920
the rest of the episode to
explore the cooler questions.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.900
GEORGE ZAIDAN: And then you
can go with-- the metaphor,

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.350
you can take as far as you want.

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:47.660
You can say, OK, well,
are some people's furnaces

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:48.560
more efficient?

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.179
Do some burn different
types of sugar?

00:44:51.179 --> 00:44:52.720
Whatever the answer
ends up being-- I

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.720
don't actually know
what the answer is.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.160
I really want to know,
but whatever that is,

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.290
you can develop the
metaphor or not, depending

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.980
on whether it fits
and really explore

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:08.150
this question that's fundamental
to the nature of our survival,

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:09.960
because there will
be another Ice Age.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:10.750
It's coming.

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:11.750
We just don't know when.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:20.850
So we took this experience
that we've all had,

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:24.890
and we turned it into an
existential crisis, which

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:26.430
is great.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:28.150
So thank you.

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:32.130
Next, I was going to do two
examples from each script,

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:35.130
but I think we should just move
on, because we're running short

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:36.580
on time.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:37.950
Whose script is this?

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:39.540
All right, come on up.

00:45:50.015 --> 00:45:51.390
All right, so you
know the drill.

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:53.330
Give us a read.

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:55.270
AUDIENCE: Once upon a
time, in the year 2009

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:57.170
actually, Stephen
Hawking held a party

00:45:57.170 --> 00:46:00.360
with all the usual stuff--
wines, hors d'oeuvres,

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.939
and yet no one turned up!

00:46:01.939 --> 00:46:03.480
And you'd have
thought he'd be upset,

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.700
but in fact, he was
actually quite happy,

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.637
because it just proven
his own belief that it

00:46:07.637 --> 00:46:09.220
was impossible to
travel back in time.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.160
He had, in fact, sent
out the invitations

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:15.460
for the party to time travelers
after the party had-- I already

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:16.710
mentioned it.

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:18.170
A lack of partygoers
actually meant

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:20.740
that time travel was
probably impossible,

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.355
or just that people thought
that Stephen Hawking was lame

00:46:23.355 --> 00:46:25.440
and didn't really want
to go to his party.

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:30.430
So was time travel
really not possible?

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:31.130
Yeah.

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:32.588
GEORGE ZAIDAN:
Great, come on back.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.947
So what is effective
in this script?

00:46:38.947 --> 00:46:40.863
Introduction, really--
It's not a full script.

00:46:45.874 --> 00:46:47.290
Yeah, you have to
raise your hand.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:49.640
Just yell it out.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.690
AUDIENCE: Well he introduces
a character who we know,

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:57.170
but he's doing this party
thing that's just like us.

00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:59.720
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So we all
love Stephen Hawking.

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:03.190
If you don't, leave immediately.

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:06.800
So right off the bat,
Stephen Hawking is invoked,

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.317
and that's great.

00:47:08.317 --> 00:47:10.150
Now we know exactly who
we're talking about.

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:13.220
We're all on the same page, and
we all love Stephen Hawking.

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:16.060
At least your audience
for this video

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:18.540
is most likely going to know
and love Stephen Hawking?

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:19.867
Not everyone does.

00:47:19.867 --> 00:47:21.450
AUDIENCE: And even
if they don't, it's

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:23.780
still a cool enough premise.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:27.760
This one's doing the opposite--
taking something unfamiliar,

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.955
and you're going to spend
the adventure familiarizing

00:47:30.955 --> 00:47:32.350
yourself with it.

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:36.070
That someone had
a party intending

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:41.116
to have no one show up, because
he was proving time travel.

00:47:41.116 --> 00:47:42.740
It's like this pop
culture fascination.

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:45.720
It's very Hollywood science.

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:50.546
It's the reason why so many of
the special effects that you

00:47:50.546 --> 00:47:53.130
have on TV and so much
of the science that does

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:55.820
end up broadcasting
on major networks.

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:59.450
They're all about
astrophysics stuff,

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:01.821
and it's because it's
commercializable?

00:48:01.821 --> 00:48:03.070
GEORGE ZAIDAN: It's just cool.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:08.930
Who here has watched Cosmos?

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:10.710
New or old?

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:11.280
New?

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:11.780
Both?

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:16.260
At one point in one
of the episodes,

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.510
either Carl Sagan, or Neil
deGrasse Tyson, or probably

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:22.730
both say that we have this
inbuilt fascination looking up

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:25.910
at the stars and wondering what
our place is in the universe,

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:27.490
and that is absolutely true.

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:32.070
And shows and movies capitalize
on that all the time.

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:36.040
Interstellar, Gravity, are
two of the most recent ones,

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:39.420
but we've always looked
up, and wondered,

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:42.670
and written stories about it.

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:43.444
What else works?

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:54.940
So what's instantly
different about this script?

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:58.180
This introduction versus
the last introduction?

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:05.030
AUDIENCE: Something visual
that [INAUDIBLE] something

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:06.721
very visual.

00:49:06.721 --> 00:49:10.540
In my mind, I'm thinking of
this sad face, smiley face.

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:11.780
It's going to be quite funny.

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.930
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Take
that even further.

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:18.910
It's visual, but
it's also-- When

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:20.920
Kenneth got up here
and started talking

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.740
to you, what was he doing?

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:26.060
AUDIENCE: He was
[INAUDIBLE] face?

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.300
GEORGE ZAIDAN: He
was what, sorry?

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.880
Yeah, he was expressive, right?

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.970
AUDIENCE: He used his
[INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:34.340
GEORGE ZAIDAN: But
even before that.

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:35.820
"Once upon a time," what's that?

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.850
Once upon a time.

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:38.970
It's a story.

00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:40.160
You're telling a story.

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:45.940
And eventually, in this
intro-- this is also a story

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.860
that you're telling,
but once upon a time

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:54.580
is right off the bat, everybody
knows that's story time.

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.381
And just like we're hard-wired
to sort of look up at the stars

00:49:57.381 --> 00:49:58.880
and wonder where
we came from, we're

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.880
hard-wired to love stories.

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.880
When you start a sentence
with once upon a time,

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.956
you're listening.

00:50:03.956 --> 00:50:06.860
AUDIENCE: But that doesn't
necessarily mean you should.

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.289
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:08.289 --> 00:50:10.830
AUDIENCE: Again, take everything
we say with a grain of salt.

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:14.190
It's not the tools that you
use that make things work,

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:17.089
it's the reason why
you use the tools.

00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:19.630
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So you don't have
to say once upon a time here

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:22.140
to know that it's a story.

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.400
Because even if you
didn't say, you'd say,

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.560
in 2009, Stephen
Hawking held a party.

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.620
No one showed up,
but he was thrilled.

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:29.120
Why?

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.980
Because he'd just
proved time travel.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:32.790
Let me explain to
you how that works.

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:33.900
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.160
I didn't say once
upon a time, but even

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.410
though I didn't say it,
my first two sentences

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:43.690
are still this like, click--
I'm going to tell you a story.

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:44.910
What else is effective?

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:47.697
Actually effective or
what you would improve.

00:50:47.697 --> 00:50:49.155
AUDIENCE: I think
the last sentence

00:50:49.155 --> 00:50:52.150
kind of throws a loop in.

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:57.050
I'm unsure about what the
body of it is going to be,

00:50:57.050 --> 00:51:00.370
because you take this really
smart guy like Stephen Hawking.

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:04.320
He just proved that you
can't travel back in time.

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.020
So is this going to
explain why that's true?

00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:12.980
Or it's just the
next breakthrough

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:15.300
where it actually is true.

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.970
I'm kind of unsure what's
going to happen next.

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:19.720
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Anybody
else a little bit--

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:22.060
are you saying that as
something that works

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.560
or something that
could be improved?

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.807
AUDIENCE: To clarify, i guess.

00:51:25.807 --> 00:51:27.640
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Was
anybody else a little bit

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.450
hazy on where the
script is going,

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:32.020
or what's been said already?

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.540
Yeah?

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:38.690
So when I read this, I
was a little bit confused.

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:40.690
So what's the answer
to this question?

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:42.840
Tell me in a couple sentences.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.469
AUDIENCE: And what
happens after?

00:51:44.469 --> 00:51:46.260
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Summarize
your script for me

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.510
in two or three sentences.

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:50.456
AUDIENCE: After that, we talk
about what time travel is

00:51:50.456 --> 00:51:53.000
and how it's maybe
possible to time travel,

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:59.280
and why, theoretically, it's
not possible to do it yet.

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.210
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:03.400
Maybe we just haven't
explored enough yet.

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:07.790
We don't understand enough of
the [INAUDIBLE] time travel.

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:10.230
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So the bottom
line, main point of the video

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:13.992
is we're not sure if
time travel is possible?

00:52:13.992 --> 00:52:15.908
AUDIENCE: That currently
it points to the fact

00:52:15.908 --> 00:52:16.800
that we are unable.

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:20.250
GEORGE ZAIDAN: But most
science says that it's not

00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:21.256
going to be possible?

00:52:21.256 --> 00:52:21.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:26.180
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So we think it's
not going to be possible ever?

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.180
AUDIENCE: But yet
we're still asking.

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:30.300
We're questioning [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:33.444
AUDIENCE: I think to fix
that, instead of maybe prove

00:52:33.444 --> 00:52:34.860
by-- I don't know--
you could just

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:39.076
take a less qualifying word
like the possibility that he has

00:52:39.076 --> 00:52:42.100
disproven it, or something
that gives him some sort of air

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:45.144
that there is the possibility
that it isn't true.

00:52:45.144 --> 00:52:46.030
I don't know.

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:49.840
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So
let me ask you--

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:54.770
without going back to
this intro, tell me again

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:57.470
the underlying theory
behind the party,

00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:59.990
and what it proves
that no one showed up?

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:03.020
Or doesn't prove, or
we think, or whatever.

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:07.490
AUDIENCE: Prior to this,
Hawking has said [INAUDIBLE],

00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:11.185
but he believes that
it's not possible.

00:53:11.185 --> 00:53:12.650
So he set up this
extra experiment.

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:14.650
GEORGE ZAIDAN: He believes that
time travel is not possible?

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:16.860
AUDIENCE: So he set up
this extra experiment.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.260
He hosted the party.

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:21.604
It fails on [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:21.604 --> 00:53:25.605
Then he sent out
invitations after the party

00:53:25.605 --> 00:53:27.090
to time travellers.

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:30.812
So he even included specific
coordinates and specific date

00:53:30.812 --> 00:53:32.160
and time.

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.665
So when no one showed
up, [INAUDIBLE] so it's

00:53:34.665 --> 00:53:36.030
not possible.

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:37.960
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I see, OK.

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:38.550
Now I get it.

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:41.970
So when you read the
script the first time--

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:43.460
whose understanding
of the script

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:46.560
changed based on hearing
that explanation.

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:49.910
I must say that I actually know
this point, but reading this

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:52.290
I didn't understand,
until I [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:55.650
And it actually happens to
be a Big Bang Theory joke.

00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:58.080
A Big Bang Theory joke
where they sat together,

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:01.030
and they said, let's
swear to this day

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:03.240
that we will come back
to this exact same moment

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.810
if we do invent a time machine.

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:07.240
And then they wrote this
letter and swore on it,

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.240
and they waiter for one
second and no one came.

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.250
And they were really sad.

00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:14.070
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So that's
another version of the same?

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:20.240
So now I totally get this.

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:24.320
Let's think about other
creative ways to--

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.070
AUDIENCE: I don't.

00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:25.770
GEORGE ZAIDAN: You don't.

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:26.750
I still don't get it.

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:28.680
I'm sorry, but I
still don't get it.

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:32.430
I don't understand the concept
that he sent invitations

00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:34.351
after the party and
no one showed up?

00:54:34.351 --> 00:54:36.850
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So someone else
explain it in a different way

00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:38.740
than has already been explained.

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:42.700
AUDIENCE: So it's like if
I were to swear to myself

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:47.286
right now that in the future,
if I do invent a time machine,

00:54:47.286 --> 00:54:48.660
I will come back
to the time when

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.600
I'm writing this right now.

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.930
So theoretically
speaking, that would

00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:56.670
mean that as I'm writing
this, my future self

00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:57.696
will come right now.

00:54:57.696 --> 00:54:59.820
GEORGE ZAIDAN: But actually,
now that you say that,

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.580
that brings up a really
interesting point.

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.519
Your version just
proves that you're not

00:55:04.519 --> 00:55:05.810
going to invent a time machine.

00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:09.370
But Kenneth's version
proves that no one--

00:55:09.370 --> 00:55:11.815
AUDIENCE: All the time
travelers possible that he sent

00:55:11.815 --> 00:55:12.985
would not be able to--

00:55:12.985 --> 00:55:13.860
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Sorry.

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:15.568
So Kenneth's version
proves that everyone

00:55:15.568 --> 00:55:17.459
that Stephen Hawking
sends an invite to

00:55:17.459 --> 00:55:18.750
will not invent a time machine.

00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:21.570
It doesn't necessarily
prove that no one will ever

00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:24.780
invent a time machine.

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:26.335
It's just an interesting point.

00:55:26.335 --> 00:55:28.418
AUDIENCE: There was also
a time travel [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:28.418 --> 00:55:30.647
in the '90s on East Campus.

00:55:30.647 --> 00:55:31.980
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So this happened?

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:33.470
AUDIENCE: At MIT.

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:37.750
So that's just another
thing that you should note.

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:40.880
Other people have tried to do
it, and that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:47.574
But also, it's nicer that
MIT students [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:47.574 --> 00:55:49.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:50.131 --> 00:55:52.130
AUDIENCE: That's a good
example, but we're still

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:54.430
missing what the
big-- we're coming up

00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:59.480
with examples and accessories
when we don't have

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:02.470
the core point of the video.

00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:06.330
And I think I really feel
like taking the last question,

00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:09.970
completely scrapping it,
and trying to figure out

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:11.869
how to best set up the
rest of the episode

00:56:11.869 --> 00:56:13.410
is what's going to
help you the most.

00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:18.100
When you explained all
that stuff to me, I

00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:20.390
Totally read your intro
completely different.

00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:24.540
And the question that I
came up with in my head

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:26.640
before you asked your
question-- so you

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:27.960
read through the whole thing.

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.376
You said, or maybe
Stephen Hawking

00:56:29.376 --> 00:56:33.240
was too lame-- my initial
question as an audience member

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:36.900
was, OK, well then
how did he prove that?

00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:38.550
Like how did that
party prove it?

00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:41.940
And if it did prove it, why
are we still asking ourselves

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:45.650
if time travel is possible?

00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:47.910
I guess that's how
I initially reacted,

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:50.960
and that sets up a very,
very different episode

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.930
than the question that's
up there right now.

00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:55.430
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I
also want to give--

00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:58.820
so this kind of
discussion is exactly

00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:02.850
the kind of discussion that
happens with every script

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:05.340
that we do for Science Out Loud.

00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:08.770
And I know it seems
like we're piling on,

00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:13.950
but I really want to give
you props for taking a chance

00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:15.750
and doing this sort
of creative intro,

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:18.560
because we're going with this,
I think is really interesting.

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:23.480
So your two questions at the
end are-- what were they again?

00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:24.300
It was?

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:28.490
AUDIENCE: It was how did
this actually prove it?

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:31.180
And if it's proven, why are
we still asking ourselves?

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:32.013
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah.

00:57:32.013 --> 00:57:33.600
So if we could have
an infinite party,

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:36.600
where we send out infinity
invitations to everybody

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:39.980
on the planet in the
future, would that

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:42.230
prove-- and then no one
shows up at this party--

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:46.990
would that prove that
time travel is impossible?

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:48.890
So let me back up.

00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:52.024
I'm going from the Big Bang
example, which is-- or no,

00:57:52.024 --> 00:57:52.940
actually your example.

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:55.280
Which is you
proving to yourself.

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:58.027
You say, all right, if I
invent a time machine then

00:57:58.027 --> 00:58:00.360
I swear to myself I'm going
to come back to this moment.

00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:04.080
I don't come back, so I
didn't invent a time machine.

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.900
Then to Kenneth's
version-- Stephen Hawking

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.930
sends an invitation to
let's say 20 people.

00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:09.850
No one shows up?

00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:12.239
That means those 20 people
didn't come back in time.

00:58:12.239 --> 00:58:14.530
AUDIENCE: Actually, it was
more like an open invitation

00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:17.282
to the future.

00:58:17.282 --> 00:58:17.990
It's [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:21.485 --> 00:58:23.970
The fact that he had the party.

00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:26.455
So in the future,
[INAUDIBLE] time

00:58:26.455 --> 00:58:31.940
travel anyone who would
[INAUDIBLE] know of this party.

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:35.650
GEORGE ZAIDAN: But
conceivably, you could-- I

00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:37.010
get what you're saying.

00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:39.990
I think, as a
thought experiment--

00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:42.282
you're going to miss
somebody in your invite,

00:58:42.282 --> 00:58:44.240
if you send out a finite
number of invitations,

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:48.940
no matter how broad
your spectrum is.

00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:52.490
But I mean you could pick
something in-between where

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:55.940
you send out a million
invites, but there are still

00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:57.720
7 billion people on the planet.

00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:02.030
So then the question
is, if you send out

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:05.110
if you've sent an invitation to
not just everybody who's alive

00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:07.570
right now, but
everybody who will ever

00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:10.330
be born from this moment
forward-- everybody,

00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:12.950
whatever number of billion or
hundreds of billion of people

00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:14.140
that is.

00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:17.110
Theoretically, if someone
invents a time machine

00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:20.040
and decides to go to your party,
they would come back in time

00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.760
and go to your party.

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:26.360
So then if you set that story up
with the audience-- and that's

00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:27.290
a long set up.

00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:29.080
You've got three
separate scenarios--

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.490
between one and three, you
could do two scenarios.

00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:34.277
It's a long set up, but
the story element of it

00:59:34.277 --> 00:59:36.110
means that your audience
will probably stick

00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:38.560
with you, especially because
it's an unusual story.

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:41.210
It's like a weird
thing, and there's

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:43.600
confusion at the beginning.

00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:45.570
You're saying, like,
hold on, I didn't get it.

00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:48.150
Your audience is going to be
in that space for the first 30

00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:49.330
seconds of the video.

00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:51.616
And there's a fine line
between I don't get it--

00:59:51.616 --> 00:59:52.990
I'm going to turn
off this video,

00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:54.490
and I don't get
it-- I'm interested;

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:56.370
I want to keep watching.

00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:58.550
But if you can stay on the
line of I'm interested;

00:59:58.550 --> 00:59:59.950
I'm going to keep
watching, the I

00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:02.800
don't get it can be
an OK thing to do.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.180
And then after that, you get
into Elizabeth's question

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:09.180
of what does this thought
experiment actually mean?

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.750
And does it does
it prove anything

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:15.454
and how do we know, which I
think is a fascinating video.

01:00:15.454 --> 01:00:18.365
Conceptually, I think
it's really hard,

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:20.400
the double negative.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:26.100
To either choose to say is
time travel possible or not

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:29.920
the opposite, which is
time travel not-- it's

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.952
just harder to conceptualize.

01:00:31.952 --> 01:00:34.160
So when you do go
down this road,

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.134
I would just see if you could
take the affirmative approach,

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:41.920
which is time travel possible.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.239
AUDIENCE: I would wait to
ask that question though,

01:00:45.239 --> 01:00:47.734
because that's actually not
the question that's relevant.

01:00:47.734 --> 01:00:51.790
The question is how
did that prove it?

01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:56.840
Then the next question is why
are we still looking, and then

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:59.574
the immediate question
that [INAUDIBLE] is time

01:00:59.574 --> 01:01:00.240
travel possible?

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.860
That sets the core
question, but it

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:07.982
doesn't show up at-- it's
too big to [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:13.664 --> 01:01:14.872
GEORGE ZAIDAN: This is great.

01:01:14.872 --> 01:01:16.716
This is a fascinating
discussion.

01:01:16.716 --> 01:01:18.980
Good job.

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:22.210
Anything else before
we move on here?

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:24.390
AUDIENCE: So there was
a bit of discussion

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:26.455
where there was a detail
on how many people

01:01:26.455 --> 01:01:28.580
Stephen Hawking actually
sent out an invitation to,

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.030
but that kind of
detail doesn't really

01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:34.070
affect the knowledge that
you're trying to disseminate.

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:38.020
Is it OK if we were to--
because it's not really

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:41.790
an official history
point, so I'm not sure

01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:44.340
whether I'll be allowed
to deviate from it.

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:46.380
GEORGE ZAIDAN:
That's a great point.

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:49.110
In writing your scripts, you
will generate more material

01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:49.850
than you'll use.

01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:53.250
And probably going through--
I had the three scenarios.

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:55.730
Probably the middle scenario
is just not worth doing,

01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:57.590
because it takes
up a lot of time,

01:01:57.590 --> 01:01:59.850
there are a lot of
subtleties to it--

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:01.660
how many invitations
exactly, who

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:03.410
gets the invitations,
et cetera, et cetera

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:06.580
that is not important for the
subject matter of the video.

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:10.230
So being able to edit yourself
or edit others on that stuff

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.910
is really good.

01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:12.285
So yeah, absolutely,
great point.

01:02:12.285 --> 01:02:14.326
AUDIENCE: You can also
gloss over it pretty fast.

01:02:14.326 --> 01:02:16.500
You can be like,
OK, so when you're

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.720
explaining the actual
details of the party,

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.320
you say he sent out an open
invitation, no one came,

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.990
so the conclusion was that no
one invented a time machine.

01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:29.920
Well I guess you could say
maybe someone in Antarctica

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.030
wasn't aware of
the open invitation

01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:33.800
so that's why they didn't come.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:37.840
So what if we could ensure that
every single human being on

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.310
will ever exist in the future
somehow got this invitation?

01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:43.390
Then will the argument
still hold up?

01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:48.070
Then you're glossing over
each incremental example

01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:52.150
and addressing the crux
of the loophole that's

01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:54.654
in that scenario.

01:02:54.654 --> 01:02:57.546
AUDIENCE: Also, I
wanted to mention humor.

01:02:57.546 --> 01:03:02.690
So saying that Hawking was too
lame-- while the other humorous

01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:04.486
parts are very
effective, that one

01:03:04.486 --> 01:03:07.332
may be kind of edgy,
especially for people

01:03:07.332 --> 01:03:09.672
who don't know who Hawking is.

01:03:09.672 --> 01:03:11.988
Maybe like, uh-oh,
this person is lame,

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:15.146
and people who do
know him will--

01:03:15.146 --> 01:03:16.520
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So
that reminds me

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.644
of your earlier point--
which is that this actually

01:03:18.644 --> 01:03:19.752
happened at MIT.

01:03:19.752 --> 01:03:21.210
[INAUDIBLE] time
[INAUDIBLE] going.

01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:23.220
And one of the things
that we try and do

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:27.470
with the Science Out Loud videos
is establish a relevant MIT

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:28.390
connection.

01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:30.767
And so that would be a
great way to do that,

01:03:30.767 --> 01:03:33.100
and then you get around the
whole Stephen Hawking thing.

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:34.930
AUDIENCE: I like the
humor point, though.

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:36.990
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I do too.

01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:40.680
AUDIENCE: The word lame
maybe is not as PC.

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
completely forgot.

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:46.841
AUDIENCE: But the whole concept
of what other possibility--

01:03:46.841 --> 01:03:48.590
GEORGE ZAIDAN: But
maybe Stephen Hawking's

01:03:48.590 --> 01:03:51.490
rival just didn't want
to show up to spite him.

01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:54.130
Maybe he's like, well, I've
invented a time machine,

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:55.720
but I'm not going to let you
know about it, because I'm

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.950
too cool for you or whatever.

01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:59.290
There are ways to get
that exact same humor

01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:00.705
thing without using lame.

01:04:00.705 --> 01:04:03.250
But I like it.

01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:06.210
I like it too.

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:09.030
Anything else?

01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:11.700
Cool.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.413
Whose is this?

01:04:13.413 --> 01:04:14.766
All right, come on up.

01:04:25.146 --> 01:04:27.520
AUDIENCE: So as long as people
have lived on this planet,

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.565
there have been boats.

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:30.690
Many of the model boats
shown in this museum-- this

01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:36.089
is at the ship museum at
MIT-- are over 100 years old,

01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:38.255
but evidence suggests that
the oldest ones date back

01:04:38.255 --> 01:04:42.720
to log boats, almost
10,000 years ago.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.626
But now, when we look
onto the hardware,

01:04:44.626 --> 01:04:46.000
it is clear that
we have advanced

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.800
since the times
of hollowed trees.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.300
Today, there are
all types of ships,

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:52.850
such as container ships, oil
tankers, and cruise ships,

01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:53.860
among others.

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:55.068
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Great, thanks.

01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:01.340
OK, what works?

01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:06.070
Actually, we're not going
to-- just comments in general?

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:09.330
Good, bad, whatever.

01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:10.340
Yes?

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:12.290
AUDIENCE: It feels a
lot like a documentary.

01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:14.200
GEORGE ZAIDAN: What
do you mean by that?

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:19.040
AUDIENCE: The image I get
walking through a museum

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.660
and look around
us-- I don't know.

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:23.640
That's the feel I get.

01:05:25.305 --> 01:05:26.430
GEORGE ZAIDAN: [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:32.270
AUDIENCE: Uh, what's
you're question?

01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:37.710
AUDIENCE: So what three was--
it kind of gets to that.

01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:39.110
So I think you're right.

01:05:39.110 --> 01:05:44.344
There is a lot of words before
I get to what I'm presenting.

01:05:44.344 --> 01:05:45.760
GEORGE ZAIDAN:
Tell us what it is.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.410
AUDIENCE: So it's about
subdivision in ships.

01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:53.378
So if you take something
that floats, like a shoebox,

01:05:53.378 --> 01:05:56.300
and you put a hole
in it, it'll sink.

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:59.650
But if you divide that shoebox
into watertight sections,

01:05:59.650 --> 01:06:04.380
this one compartment might
not cause it to sink.

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:08.225
And how we've been asked
to-- the time where

01:06:08.225 --> 01:06:10.190
a ship can be
extensively damaged

01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:14.877
and can still stay afloat
and people won't die.

01:06:14.877 --> 01:06:16.460
GEORGE ZAIDAN: What
you just did right

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:18.935
there is a fantastic
pitch for a video.

01:06:18.935 --> 01:06:21.060
Like the way that you
explained it to us right now.

01:06:25.494 --> 01:06:27.160
You get into the
subject matter quickly.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:31.120
Use you use something that we're
all familiar with, shoebox.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.500
You start simple
and you expand out.

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:36.260
You start with a shoebox,
expand out to a ship.

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:39.830
And you have the potential
for an example that

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:42.600
is super relatable, like
that Italian cruise-- was

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.660
it an Italian cruise
ship that didn't sink,

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:48.767
but it turned sideways-- you
could use something like that.

01:06:48.767 --> 01:06:50.600
I'm sure there's a more
appropriate example.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:55.060
But you just add that, and you
have the perfect pitch and also

01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:58.479
a great introduction
to a video too.

01:06:58.479 --> 01:07:01.020
AUDIENCE: I also really liked
what he says in the second part

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.370
where he says he's a coast
guard marine inspector

01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:05.260
and naval architect,
a ship designer,

01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.460
and he [INAUDIBLE]
sleep over the subject.

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.360
So that to me
sounds pretty cool.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:13.270
First of all, those
are awesome jobs,

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:15.230
and also, you are
saying that you

01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:16.930
have an emotional connection.

01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:19.380
You're an expert in [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:21.450
GEORGE ZAIDAN: And the
other thing is that we

01:07:21.450 --> 01:07:24.550
don't-- Science Out Loud doesn't
put random people on camera.

01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:26.140
Whoever we put on
camera is going

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.940
to have some connection
to the material,

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:30.140
whether it's this is my
lab that we're working in,

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:34.580
or I am a member of the Coast
Guard or whatever it is.

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:40.602
And highlighting that in a
way that is not newscaster-y.

01:07:40.602 --> 01:07:42.060
That's hard to do,
but highlighting

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:49.788
that can really draw the
audience into the material.

01:07:49.788 --> 01:07:54.402
AUDIENCE: A lot better
than poached eggs.

01:07:54.402 --> 01:07:55.277
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:05.660
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So honestly, if I
were you, I would cut the intro

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:10.210
and go with what you just said.

01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:12.550
The other nice thing
about what you said

01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:15.640
is that you can do it
with a shoe box in front--

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:17.729
it's a demo you can do.

01:08:17.729 --> 01:08:20.420
So it has a visual that goes
along with it really easily.

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:22.050
AUDIENCE: And since
you're actually

01:08:22.050 --> 01:08:25.930
doing that, there's potential
for a really big visual reveal,

01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:28.250
where we have you
frame with the shoebox,

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:31.165
and then cut you to wide
shot, and reveal you

01:08:31.165 --> 01:08:32.290
in front of an actual ship.

01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:36.460
So there's a lot of potential
to play with the visuals there.

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:39.040
Where you don't have
to say all the boats

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.930
here-- we don't even
have to go in the museum,

01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:47.609
we can actually go
to wherever you work.

01:08:47.609 --> 01:08:51.170
But I agree with
George that-- when

01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:53.120
you were talking about
the shoebox stuff,

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.800
I didn't even realize that
that was a question that I had,

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.200
but then you made me
think, just like how

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.490
David made me think
about the whole

01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:03.630
why do some people feel
colder than others.

01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:07.300
How does a giant ship not sink
if there's a little hole in it?

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.450
Whereas on a toy boat,
if there's a hole,

01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:12.186
then it's just catastrophe.

01:09:12.186 --> 01:09:13.560
GEORGE ZAIDAN:
Another question I

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:17.510
have about ships is that--
you see a giant cruise liner,

01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:20.810
and a, what percentage
of it is underwater?

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:23.000
Is it 10% or is it 50%?

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.470
And b, how the hell does
that thing not just tip over?

01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:28.729
AUDIENCE: We actually
just asked that yesterday.

01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:29.910
So you're wondering?

01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:35.550
Yeah there is a
lot of draft on it,

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:39.090
so the distance below the
waterline is substantial,

01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:43.120
so it's not uncommon to be 40
to 60 feet under the water.

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:47.220
But they fin stabilizers which
they use when a lot of people

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:48.172
are on board.

01:09:48.172 --> 01:09:50.720
They're just pretty much wings
that go on the side of a ship.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.216
And with that, they're able
to adjust their attitude

01:09:53.216 --> 01:09:55.220
to provide a more
comfortable draft.

01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:55.920
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Are
they like wings

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.330
like as big as a airplane wing?

01:09:57.330 --> 01:09:58.614
Or is it shorter?

01:09:58.614 --> 01:10:00.270
AUDIENCE: They're a
little bit shorter,

01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:03.749
and they're kind of stubbier,
but they have pretty good--

01:10:03.749 --> 01:10:06.290
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So if you took
a cruise ship out of the water,

01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:10.050
it would look like a
deformed penguin kind of?

01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:13.540
AUDIENCE: I guess you could
think like [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:17.040
Most have-- newer
ones all have them.

01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:22.310
GEORGE ZAIDAN: This is
again that idea explosion

01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:26.920
phase, where you're talking
about compartmentalization,

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:28.360
and that's the
core of the video.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:31.642
But there may be
other things that-- I

01:10:31.642 --> 01:10:33.350
don't know if this
would actually make it

01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:36.000
into your video or not, but that
is something that you wonder

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.291
when you look at a cruise ship.

01:10:37.291 --> 01:10:39.779
Like how does that thing
possibly stay afloat?

01:10:39.779 --> 01:10:41.070
Is most of the mass underwater?

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:48.095
AUDIENCE: I can't really
say quantitatively.

01:10:48.095 --> 01:10:51.720
I'm not sure, but I know that
that's one of the big parts

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:57.820
of it, is having appendages that
are able to reduce the roll.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:02.450
So if you have a
cylinder, and it's water,

01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:05.360
and you're trying to pitch
it or just have it roll,

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:08.420
it's going to go forever, but
if you put these two wings on,

01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:11.425
the inertia of
actually rolling it

01:11:11.425 --> 01:11:14.467
is a lot harder, because it
has these arms sticking out.

01:11:14.467 --> 01:11:16.050
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I
think you've actually

01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:17.980
got material for two
separate videos in there.

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:20.657
I think the compartmentalization
is one really--

01:11:20.657 --> 01:11:21.740
it could be a short video.

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:24.050
It doesn't have to be long.

01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:29.090
And then there's this whole
other-- boats, and ship

01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:30.600
building, and how
do these things,

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.100
how do these giant--
because they've

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.490
gotten big enough now
that you can have 2,000

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:37.057
or 3,000 people on a ship.

01:11:37.057 --> 01:11:38.390
How do these things stay afloat?

01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:40.330
It'd be really cool, I think.

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:43.110
AUDIENCE: From an educational
context point of view.

01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:45.430
With the K-12 videos program
in its old iteration,

01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:48.300
where people made
their own episodes,

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.800
there were like 10
episodes on buoyancy.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:54.350
I don't know why people are so
obsessed with explaining it,

01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:57.270
but I think it's because it's
a topic that maybe people

01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:58.861
struggled with in school.

01:11:58.861 --> 01:12:00.360
AUDIENCE: No, it's
a framework test.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:04.550
So, second graders-- it's
the essential question that

01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:05.870
is asked in the curriculum.

01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:06.870
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Buoyancy?

01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:08.078
AUDIENCE: Yes, sink or float.

01:12:08.078 --> 01:12:09.470
What sinks, what
floats, and why?

01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:12.510
And it's a questions
that's intended to get

01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:14.700
them thinking scientifically.

01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.990
And so that big
buoyancy question

01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:18.900
is-- when I was learning
to be a teacher,

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:23.300
that was the core question, even
in schools that had no science

01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:25.910
curriculum whatsoever.

01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:28.341
At that age, that's
when they begin

01:12:28.341 --> 01:12:30.340
asking scientific questions,
and that experiment

01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:32.950
is something you need to
do, no matter where you are.

01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:34.860
You have a small bucket.

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:36.985
Any kid can do it,
regardless of what class.

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:38.443
I taught in some
inner city schools

01:12:38.443 --> 01:12:40.680
where there no resources,
but you can still

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:41.790
do that experiment.

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:45.290
AUDIENCE: Do they figure
out at that age-- do they

01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:49.324
why a sinkable object like
steel would float, or something?

01:12:49.324 --> 01:12:50.990
AUDIENCE: Well the
idea is that students

01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:54.940
can construct themselves with
themselves by experiment.

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:57.180
So the teacher, if
it's a great teacher,

01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:00.140
will put a bucket of water
and a whole bunch of objects.

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:02.450
And encourage
students to eventually

01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:04.770
come up with some truths
themselves about what sinks

01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:08.150
and what floats through
hands-on experimentation.

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:12.250
And that's sort the crux of the
most early science exploration

01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:16.200
in our curriculum, which is
why there's so much on sink

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.685
and float, and that's why
the kids were all-- they

01:13:18.685 --> 01:13:21.110
all were interested in
that when you talk to them,

01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:22.826
because it was
drilled into them,

01:13:22.826 --> 01:13:25.760
at least in our educational
system, the idea of sinking

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:32.130
and floating and a very
elementary concept that

01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:33.981
is the beginning of
their scientific roots.

01:13:33.981 --> 01:13:35.730
AUDIENCE: But the
reason why I bring it up

01:13:35.730 --> 01:13:38.770
is that there are 100 videos
on sinking and floating,

01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:41.610
and they're all the
exact same thing.

01:13:41.610 --> 01:13:44.180
And every lesson
on buoyancy-- you

01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:47.520
learn it in more
detail in high school.

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.540
It's still on the same thing.

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.070
And this is
presenting it in a way

01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:52.600
that's very, very different.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.784
And I hesitated to
bring it up at all,

01:13:54.784 --> 01:13:56.825
because I don't want you
to look at those videos,

01:13:56.825 --> 01:13:58.700
and I don't want you to
look at the standards

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:01.460
and accidentally
default to that style.

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:04.630
I think you should totally keep
going the way you're going.

01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:06.820
I only wanted to
bring it up, because I

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:09.235
think that there is
definitely an appetite for it

01:14:09.235 --> 01:14:10.950
in an educational context.

01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:13.520
I also wanted to
bring up that-- it's

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:16.250
funny-- I wish we could have
the raw footage from all

01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:20.390
the classes just to [INAUDIBLE],
because when you explain

01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:24.400
the technical components
of the wings and stuff--

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.590
we could've used that footage.

01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:29.240
And it's very different from
when you read this aloud.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.760
And the script also
doesn't sound like you

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:34.610
at all, when you talk.

01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:37.450
And it's a very
difficult thing to do.

01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:39.300
I sympathise with
you guys completely.

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:42.540
It's really hard to
become self-aware

01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:44.730
of your natural talking style.

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:48.010
And so some of it
will be just-- maybe

01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:49.760
you want to record a
conversation that you

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.480
have with someone else.

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:54.085
That might not be the
best thing for everyone.

01:14:54.085 --> 01:14:55.960
GEORGE ZAIDAN: One of
the things you could do

01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:00.730
is instead of recording yourself
on camera, record just audio.

01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:02.410
Because the visual
part of it-- like

01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:04.701
if you're conscious that
there's a lens looking at you,

01:15:04.701 --> 01:15:05.949
it's very hard to be natural.

01:15:05.949 --> 01:15:07.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and
I'm not very good

01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:10.020
in front of a lens or anything.

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:12.020
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Getting
rid of that misconception

01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:12.978
is a whole other thing.

01:15:12.978 --> 01:15:15.220
We'll get into it in a
second, but it's much easier

01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.780
to just be yourself if
you just have a mic,

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:19.530
and you're not really--
you sort of forget

01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:20.446
that the mic is there.

01:15:20.446 --> 01:15:22.300
You're not looking into
a lens or whatever.

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:26.910
So having that, it's easier
to record yourself and hear

01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:28.660
what you really sound
like if you just use

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:32.260
audio, versus video as well.

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:36.285
AUDIENCE: So say you're
trying to simplify something,

01:15:36.285 --> 01:15:39.340
a complicated concept, so
you're talking to [INAUDIBLE],

01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:43.830
and there's a lot of
different technical reasons

01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:49.410
that you have these
fin stabilizers.

01:15:49.410 --> 01:15:55.620
So just being able to
say that this is stopping

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:58.690
the ship from
rolling, it's true,

01:15:58.690 --> 01:16:01.210
but there's other aspects to it.

01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:04.130
So this gets into
the accuracy portion.

01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:08.340
Like you could have a naval
architect go on K through 12

01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:11.090
and be like, yeah, but
there's more to it than that.

01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:13.012
So at what point are
you oversimplifying.

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:23.700
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I think there's
no harm in alluding to the fact

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:26.480
that there are that
you are just at the tip

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:27.980
of the iceberg of information.

01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.907
So you could say
something like-- the way

01:16:29.907 --> 01:16:32.240
you said it was if you take
a cylinder, put it in water,

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.255
and spin it, it'll spin.

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:35.630
You take a cylinder, attach
some wings, put it in water--

01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:37.430
it's much harder to spin it.

01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:39.425
That is all 100%
accurate and true,

01:16:39.425 --> 01:16:41.550
but you don't get into any
of the technical reasons

01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:43.410
as to why that's the case.

01:16:43.410 --> 01:16:44.429
That's one way to do it.

01:16:44.429 --> 01:16:45.970
The other way to do
it is if you want

01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:47.712
to start talking about whys.

01:16:47.712 --> 01:16:50.170
And I don't know what the whys
are, so you have to help me,

01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:54.215
but you can start off
your senses with-- look,

01:16:54.215 --> 01:16:56.090
this is a really simple
way of explaining it,

01:16:56.090 --> 01:16:58.780
but basically, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:00.810
So you just sort of
allude to the fact

01:17:00.810 --> 01:17:04.410
that I'm giving you the
super simple version of it.

01:17:04.410 --> 01:17:07.350
It's much more complicated
than this in real life.

01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:10.030
And you can even explain
what those complications are.

01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:13.700
So if you had wings with
a bunch of holes in them,

01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:17.250
they wouldn't be as
effective as solid wings,

01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:18.520
because x, y, or z.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:22.140
Or if your ship's
wings need to be

01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:24.720
able to do this and that
for whatever reason--

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.911
you can allude to stuff
without actually explaining it,

01:17:27.911 --> 01:17:29.910
and that's OK, because
you do that in real life.

01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:32.330
If you're sitting across
the table from someone

01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:35.050
and explaining something to
them, the first time you do it,

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:39.590
you're not going to be like--
roman numeral I, part a,

01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:41.847
subsection b-- you're not
going to go super in-depth.

01:17:41.847 --> 01:17:44.180
You're going to be like look,
here's the important thing

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:45.302
to get right now.

01:17:45.302 --> 01:17:46.510
Here are some of the details.

01:17:46.510 --> 01:17:50.134
We can about the details later,
but this is the crucial thing.

01:17:50.134 --> 01:17:52.519
AUDIENCE: So more of the
result and not everything

01:17:52.519 --> 01:17:54.771
that got to that result?

01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:56.521
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I don't
know that I would--

01:17:56.521 --> 01:17:59.167
AUDIENCE: Or if it's
a little too tricky,

01:17:59.167 --> 01:18:03.170
then mention it, but focus
on what the main reason

01:18:03.170 --> 01:18:03.920
why they're there.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:04.753
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah.

01:18:04.753 --> 01:18:08.780
I think just being conscious
of the fact that what you're

01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:11.640
presenting isn't all
of the information,

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.370
it is an accurate portion
of the information.

01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:16.064
AUDIENCE: And
that's actually what

01:18:16.064 --> 01:18:17.393
we want with Science Out Loud.

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:19.268
And keep in mind, it's
a very different style

01:18:19.268 --> 01:18:20.777
than some of the
other videos that i

01:18:20.777 --> 01:18:22.610
was talking about on
the first day of class.

01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:24.520
But we want to pique curiosity.

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:27.520
We want people to finish
watching the video

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.650
and ask themselves
those questions

01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:32.147
and try to figure
it out on their own

01:18:32.147 --> 01:18:33.480
and explore the other resources.

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.021
And that's a very
different objective

01:18:35.021 --> 01:18:38.717
than say a lecture video
or a technical video.

01:18:38.717 --> 01:18:39.800
So just keep that in mind.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.802
Again, whatever best practices
we're establishing here

01:18:42.802 --> 01:18:44.260
aren't necessarily
ones that you'll

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:48.110
carry over to every
single educational video.

01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:51.440
We encompass such a
huge variety, right?

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.090
But I think that's true of
even the most technical video.

01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:58.450
And again, this goes back to the
whole rabbit hole witness test.

01:18:58.450 --> 01:19:02.060
Once you find yourself
clarifying more and more

01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:03.880
to the point where
you found yourself

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:07.630
on a topic that is tangential
to the main point of your video

01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:09.620
or the main point
of your lesson,

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:13.520
then it's time to backtrack
a little bit, and that's OK.

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:15.690
No video under an hour.

01:19:15.690 --> 01:19:18.850
No semester-long class
is going to answer

01:19:18.850 --> 01:19:20.650
every single question
that's related

01:19:20.650 --> 01:19:24.570
to the topic of the class.

01:19:24.570 --> 01:19:26.765
AUDIENCE: But this gets
back to what we were

01:19:26.765 --> 01:19:28.030
talking about the [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:31.610
By going deeply and
narrowing your focus actually

01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:34.820
allows you to allude to a
lot of much larger topics

01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:36.230
superficially.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:38.700
And people get it more
quickly the more narrow

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:40.470
you are in your examples.

01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:43.530
And think if there were a
truth in here, that's the truth

01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:46.877
to sort of apply-- is that
the more specific and narrow

01:19:46.877 --> 01:19:48.460
you can be without
getting [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:50.710
in that extra
information, the easier it

01:19:50.710 --> 01:19:52.830
is to allude to that
extra information

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:54.610
without it-- like
a story flow, you

01:19:54.610 --> 01:19:56.680
want it always more forward.

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:59.840
And if this information
is so little

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:03.350
that it doesn't prevent
the forward motion

01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:06.720
of your storyline, then
you know you're doing

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.199
a good job of including that.

01:20:08.199 --> 01:20:09.990
What you don't want is
for this information

01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:13.027
to take you backwards
or sideways.

01:20:13.027 --> 01:20:15.360
AUDIENCE: I mean I guess I
should rephrase that it's not

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.443
necessarily a rabbit hole.

01:20:16.443 --> 01:20:19.400
You don't want to
branch out too much.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:23.650
You want accuracy, specificity
to a certain degree.

01:20:23.650 --> 01:20:28.270
You could very well do a
video on why do boats float,

01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:30.586
but that wouldn't
really be a good video.

01:20:30.586 --> 01:20:32.210
It wouldn't be a very
compelling video.

01:20:32.210 --> 01:20:35.480
So you're going to make a video
about the wings on a boat.

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:38.750
You're going to hit the bigger
topic of how things float,

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:41.242
but that's not the thing that's
driving your video forward.

01:20:41.242 --> 01:20:42.700
AUDIENCE: And that's
why your topic

01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:48.410
is perfectly narrow
of imagining three

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:51.890
differently smooshed shoeboxes.

01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:55.230
Why does this one versus
this one-- and it's

01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:57.590
a narrow enough topic,
and concrete enough

01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:59.900
that it will allow you to
get to some of those bigger

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:03.100
sink or float buoyancy
design issues.

01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:08.052
But using this very small way
of getting access to that.

01:21:08.052 --> 01:21:09.510
GEORGE ZAIDAN: By
the way, I wanted

01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:13.660
to come back to something
that is a tad tangential,

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:15.570
ironically.

01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:19.660
You said, maybe it's better
then to just tell the results

01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:21.080
and leave out the process.

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.460
And I said no, maybe not.

01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:26.870
The reason that I said
no is because sometimes,

01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:29.190
taking your audience through
the experimentation that

01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:31.085
was done to get to
a result is just

01:21:31.085 --> 01:21:32.710
as interesting or
even more interesting

01:21:32.710 --> 01:21:33.930
as the result itself.

01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:38.619
So the Stephen Hawking example--
the time travel experiment

01:21:38.619 --> 01:21:40.660
and the intricacies of
the time travel experiment

01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:42.680
are just as interesting,
to me, anyway,

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:45.901
as the result of that
experiment, whatever it is.

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:48.150
So that's why I would just
caution against using that.

01:21:48.150 --> 01:21:53.720
Sometimes-- how did
people first invent

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:55.256
compartmentalizing boats?

01:21:55.256 --> 01:21:57.130
I'm not saying that is
an interesting answer.

01:21:57.130 --> 01:21:57.790
It may not be.

01:21:57.790 --> 01:22:01.250
But sometimes that process is
just as interesting as the fact

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:04.237
that there are compartmentalized
boats and why they work.

01:22:04.237 --> 01:22:05.820
AUDIENCE: One thing
that I mentioned--

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.530
I don't know if
it's worth exploring

01:22:07.530 --> 01:22:12.720
is the whole reason why
[INAUDIBLE] was like I know

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:17.890
that floating is obviously
a big teaching point,

01:22:17.890 --> 01:22:21.530
but if you open with
why the Titanic sank,

01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:26.680
which has exactly to do
with compartmentalization,

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:29.610
is that something that
would be a better hook?

01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:34.080
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I honestly
like your shoebox better.

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.140
I'll tell you why--
because it's more visual.

01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:38.496
Sorry, it's more visual
because it has you in it.

01:22:38.496 --> 01:22:39.120
There's a demo.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.828
There's a thing that
someone can look at,

01:22:40.828 --> 01:22:42.570
and it's directly accessible.

01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:45.200
With the Titanic,
yeah, it's an example

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.040
that everyone knows,
and you could maybe

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:50.110
use stock footage of the
movie Titanic or whatever.

01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:53.960
But it's one degree
of complexity--

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:56.110
it starts at a higher
level of complexity

01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:57.892
than your shoebox example.

01:22:57.892 --> 01:22:59.614
AUDIENCE: Well I'm
saying you could do--

01:22:59.614 --> 01:23:01.405
GEORGE ZAIDAN: First
shoebox, then Titanic?

01:23:01.405 --> 01:23:04.390
AUDIENCE: No, how the Titanic
did their compartmentalization

01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:06.525
with a shoebox.

01:23:06.525 --> 01:23:08.150
So they didn't finish
their [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:10.260
to the deck, which you
could actually easily

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:12.848
build with a shoebox,
and then just see

01:23:12.848 --> 01:23:14.394
how it progressively floats.

01:23:14.394 --> 01:23:16.310
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So the
problem with the Titanic

01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:18.320
was that their
compartments did not extend

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:19.660
all the way through the hull?

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:21.629
AUDIENCE: All the way
up the [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:22.420
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Why?

01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:23.086
That seems dumb.

01:23:23.086 --> 01:23:24.600
AUDIENCE: I have no idea.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.100
AUDIENCE: But then
the video becomes

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:28.930
about why did the
Titanic sink, instead of

01:23:28.930 --> 01:23:34.542
about how do I prevent boats
from sinking as a Coast Guard.

01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:36.000
AUDIENCE: I think
it's distracting.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.290
I think it's
distracting, and I think

01:23:38.290 --> 01:23:43.370
that the simplicity
of this shoebox

01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:46.240
allows you to gain
access to the concepts

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:49.600
more easily, without getting the
story of the Titanic entangled

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.870
into it.

01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:54.340
AUDIENCE: The other thing
is, if you are not at MIT

01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:56.250
studying naval
architecture or whatever,

01:23:56.250 --> 01:24:00.600
and if you weren't actually
an engineer, just maybe

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.100
Vsauce or hand Hank
Green, then I'd

01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:04.170
say, yeah, talk about
why the Titanic sunk.

01:24:04.170 --> 01:24:06.320
But it's a story that's
already been told.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.570
And it's a story that
can be told by anyone.

01:24:08.570 --> 01:24:10.640
You have this
opportunity to tell us

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.135
a story from a perspective
that not many very people can,

01:24:13.135 --> 01:24:14.760
and that's what I
was trying to get out

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:17.350
on the first day about being
able to take yourself out

01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:19.890
of the perspective that
you're used to having.

01:24:19.890 --> 01:24:23.370
I think that is an opportunity
to capitalize upon, for sure.

01:24:23.370 --> 01:24:25.740
So it's not that I think
that the Titanic thing is

01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:28.490
a bad hook, necessarily--
just that the one you have

01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:30.090
is so much better.

01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:33.286
And one that not
other people can do.

01:24:33.286 --> 01:24:34.660
AUDIENCE: Can I
also say that you

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:37.330
had mentioned about process.

01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:41.620
In my lab, the work that
I see predominately-- I

01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:44.350
would actually argue that it's
extremely hard for scientists

01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:50.350
to share a process in
an interesting way.

01:24:50.350 --> 01:24:53.860
That scientists, typically--
and I am generalizing,

01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:56.950
and this is not really fair, but
because we spend so much time

01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:58.750
day-to-day going
through a process,

01:24:58.750 --> 01:25:00.660
you want to share
it chronologically,

01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:03.200
and that's where your default
is to go from start to finish,

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:07.080
telling people what you
did in painstaking detail,

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:08.290
and that's boring.

01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:10.670
And so that's really,
really hard-- if any of you

01:25:10.670 --> 01:25:14.570
end up doing a process where
you're sharing your process,

01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:18.290
it's really hard to figure
out the bigger picture

01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:22.900
within the process so
that an outsider actually

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:25.120
finds your process
interesting, as opposed

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.550
to just sharing the I did
this, then I did this,

01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:29.470
then I did this.

01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:31.400
Explaining why I did
what I did each way

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.650
is what people care about.

01:25:32.650 --> 01:25:34.316
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Well
the interesting part

01:25:34.316 --> 01:25:40.330
is the moment of ingenuity that
led to an experiment designed

01:25:40.330 --> 01:25:41.820
the way it was designed.

01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:43.660
Not the day-to-day--

01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:46.170
AUDIENCE: Exactly, and I
feel like because people

01:25:46.170 --> 01:25:48.740
in their labs are like
someone needs to listen to me.

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:49.680
I did this.

01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.799
It didn't work, and I spent
hours and hours working on this

01:25:52.799 --> 01:25:53.590
and it didn't work.

01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:56.290
They feel like they want
to share that with people,

01:25:56.290 --> 01:25:59.030
but people don't
actually care about that.

01:25:59.030 --> 01:26:00.760
They care about the
why you designed

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:03.300
the experiment that way,
and why it didn't work,

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.700
as opposed to the
what you actually did,

01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:09.070
the who cares kind of concept.

01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:13.870
AUDIENCE: Actually, I agree
with you on the Titanic idea,

01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:18.190
but you mentioned that you could
build these compartments out

01:26:18.190 --> 01:26:21.185
of shoeboxes, and I think
that at least the kids that we

01:26:21.185 --> 01:26:22.560
talked to yesterday--
they really

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.851
like the idea of destruction.

01:26:24.851 --> 01:26:27.860
Something burning,
being crushed.

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:30.010
So if you could kind of
talk about those concepts

01:26:30.010 --> 01:26:34.150
and in the end, you
sink some random ship.

01:26:34.150 --> 01:26:37.180
That would kind of show,
first of all, that it's cool,

01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:40.850
but also it shows that what
you;re talking about is

01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:41.350
important.

01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:42.210
AUDIENCE: Don't get me wrong.

01:26:42.210 --> 01:26:43.710
You can totally
bring up the Titanic

01:26:43.710 --> 01:26:47.080
at the end as the bigger
picture application.

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.460
That's awesome.

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:51.650
It's just the hook
isn't the place for it,

01:26:51.650 --> 01:26:53.600
I think personally.

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:56.010
GEORGE ZAIDAN: It's
been done before.

01:26:56.010 --> 01:26:57.035
I agree with you.

01:26:57.035 --> 01:26:57.910
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Great.

01:26:57.910 --> 01:27:01.630
Anything else on this script?

01:27:01.630 --> 01:27:03.081
Going once, going twice--

01:27:03.081 --> 01:27:04.830
AUDIENCE: Before you
go onto the next one,

01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:06.411
I do just want to
mention-- sorry.

01:27:06.411 --> 01:27:08.160
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I'm
just kidding, go ahead.

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.326
AUDIENCE: I do want to
mention that you guys came up

01:27:10.326 --> 01:27:12.170
with really fascinating topics.

01:27:12.170 --> 01:27:15.120
I mean George and I were
talking about it this morning.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:20.160
So I mean even though
we're critiquing things,

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.530
the topic at the
core, I think there's

01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:25.600
a lot of potential for it.

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.970
So just a word of encouragement.

01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:30.470
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah,
I would totally

01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:32.855
watch all of these videos.

01:27:32.855 --> 01:27:34.980
AUDIENCE: I don't know
where we're going quite yet,

01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:36.360
but we've been
going for a while.

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.020
I suspect people might
need a bathroom break.

01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:38.590
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Oh
yeah, good idea.

01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:39.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
need a bathroom break.

01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.573
AUDIENCE: So maybe we
should, before we dive

01:27:41.573 --> 01:27:44.540
into the next one give people a
chance to stretch and do that.

01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:48.710
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah,
OK, who wrote this?

01:27:55.186 --> 01:27:56.186
GUEST SPEAKER: I'm cold.

01:28:00.510 --> 01:28:01.560
AUDIENCE: I'm warm.

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:02.816
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I'm
pretty warm, yeah.

01:28:02.816 --> 01:28:04.940
AUDIENCE: I think it's
where you're sitting partly.

01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:08.332
The first day I was under
a vent and it was freezing.

01:28:08.332 --> 01:28:10.040
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK,
whenever you're ready.

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:12.130
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

01:28:12.130 --> 01:28:14.670
Few things strike more
dread than hearing

01:28:14.670 --> 01:28:17.610
you have to get braces.

01:28:17.610 --> 01:28:20.130
Whether it's worrying about
how much it will hurt,

01:28:20.130 --> 01:28:24.200
what happens if a wire pops
out, how you're going to talk,

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:27.360
or how much your friends
will make fun of you,

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.970
it's kind of an
awkward experience.

01:28:29.970 --> 01:28:32.600
So why even get braces
in the first place?

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.314
Cut to pictures of famous
stars who have had braces

01:28:35.314 --> 01:28:36.022
with a voiceover.

01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:40.689
Should I keep--

01:28:40.689 --> 01:28:42.480
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yep,
just the next sentence.

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:43.150
GUEST SPEAKER:
Studies have shown

01:28:43.150 --> 01:28:45.480
that having a beautiful
smile with even white teeth

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.950
conveys health and youth, and
makes people like you even

01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:50.280
a little bit more.

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.590
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Cool, thanks.

01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:55.530
Who were the famous stars
that you are thinking of here?

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:56.930
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:23.324
AUDIENCE: But this
video's about you.

01:29:23.324 --> 01:29:24.990
AUDIENCE: Well the
way that I structured

01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:27.830
it is to have as
little of me in it

01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:31.770
as possible, which is why I
had so much of the [INAUDIBLE].

01:29:31.770 --> 01:29:33.690
There would only be
one or two choices.

01:29:33.690 --> 01:29:35.870
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Just
out of curiosity, why?

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:39.127
Why did you structure
it that way?

01:29:39.127 --> 01:29:40.710
AUDIENCE: I like the
animation aspect.

01:29:40.710 --> 01:29:44.410
I also know I don't
look good on camera.

01:29:47.450 --> 01:29:52.190
AUDIENCE: No one knows that
they don't look at my camera.

01:29:52.190 --> 01:29:53.870
AUDIENCE: I feel
like this is the fear

01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:57.097
that every person comes into
a Science Out Loud episode

01:29:57.097 --> 01:29:58.680
with is like, we
want to animate this,

01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:00.950
because I don't want to
explain it on a camera.

01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:03.200
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Or I can't
say this long of a paragraph

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:04.030
without stumbling.

01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:05.780
AUDIENCE: Or we'll
take their script away,

01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:08.040
and they'll be like
I need to have it.

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.650
I can't do it.

01:30:09.650 --> 01:30:11.930
That is so not true.

01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:15.220
You can't actually prove
that you can't do it.

01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:18.530
And we want your
faces to be on camera,

01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:22.660
and we can talk about
this more, but I

01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:25.817
think that if you do
too much of the pictures

01:30:25.817 --> 01:30:27.400
and the voiceovers
and the animations,

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:31.320
then we go back to
that Siri litmus test.

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:35.630
Or if we swap you out for
anyone else to do this video,

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:37.420
it's not going to
make a big difference.

01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:39.086
And I don't know if
you're OK with that,

01:30:39.086 --> 01:30:41.570
but I certainly feel like
you have compelling enough

01:30:41.570 --> 01:30:42.380
of a perspective.

01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:46.330
Didn't you say you used to work
for an orthodontics company?

01:30:46.330 --> 01:30:49.890
Yeah, that is a really
unique perspective,

01:30:49.890 --> 01:30:53.897
both from the industry--
and my mom's a dentist.

01:30:53.897 --> 01:30:56.230
So I used to work at her
office, and I had braces twice.

01:30:56.230 --> 01:31:00.717
And I know for sure that there's
so much fascinating information

01:31:00.717 --> 01:31:03.300
about that that you would know
from that perspective that most

01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:03.860
people don't.

01:31:06.488 --> 01:31:09.920
You can make a video that
a lot of people can't.

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:13.800
And I would hesitate
to let you go

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:19.000
on thinking that your
video should be that way.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.500
GEORGE ZAIDAN: And
that's not to say

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:25.800
that like it's just going to
be you on camera or any of you.

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:27.800
That's not to say
the entire video

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:31.380
is going to be from here
to here, 100% of the time,

01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:33.730
talking.

01:31:33.730 --> 01:31:37.107
We know that that doesn't
make for compelling video.

01:31:37.107 --> 01:31:39.440
You want to have the person
doing something, interacting

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:42.540
with their environment, being in
an interesting place, whatever.

01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:49.030
There are lots of ways to
compliment the fact that--

01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:50.390
let me back up a second.

01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:53.180
The human-to-human--
ideally, you

01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:54.710
want to transmit information.

01:31:54.710 --> 01:31:56.810
One person sits down
and talks to another,

01:31:56.810 --> 01:32:00.892
that's like the idealized
way to engage someone, convey

01:32:00.892 --> 01:32:02.850
information, talk about
an interesting subject,

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:05.840
whatever it is.

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:07.340
Obviously, video
gives you the power

01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:10.710
to do that to a wide audience
at once, and it's remote,

01:32:10.710 --> 01:32:12.310
but there is
something about seeing

01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:16.850
someone's face, and
expressions, and intonations,

01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:20.890
and something that really
draws you into the material.

01:32:20.890 --> 01:32:23.640
But that having
been said, you don't

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:25.500
want to just stay
on that person's

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:29.230
face for the whole video
and not show anything else.

01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:32.790
But that's our job, as
producers and directors,

01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:36.230
is to figure out where it makes
sense to just do a simple head

01:32:36.230 --> 01:32:38.740
shot of someone talking
versus where it makes sense

01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:40.161
to cut away for an animation.

01:32:40.161 --> 01:32:41.910
If you're talking about
like teeth moving,

01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:44.810
that might be a
perfect place to do it.

01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:47.030
Versus where to do
a demo or whatever

01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:50.160
it is to keep visual variety and
interest throughout the video.

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:53.220
But yes?

01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:55.230
AUDIENCE: That was a
tangent-- an important one.

01:32:55.230 --> 01:32:57.438
AUDIENCE: No, I think it's
actually really important.

01:32:57.438 --> 01:33:00.320
AUDIENCE: Well, it's also
a segue into [INAUDIBLE].

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:02.466
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:33:02.466 --> 01:33:05.764
I have all these graduate
fellows who work for me.

01:33:05.764 --> 01:33:09.093
We do workshops all over campus
and our biggest credibility,

01:33:09.093 --> 01:33:11.830
and why we can give our
workshops,and why people care,

01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:14.640
and listen to them is because
we give workshops on how

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:17.850
to succeed with the National
Science Foundation awards from

01:33:17.850 --> 01:33:20.620
people who have
actually earned them.

01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:21.400
We're authentic.

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.180
I did this.

01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:24.300
I'm going to tell you what
I did to be successful.

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:26.027
That's what you have
that's so powerful.

01:33:26.027 --> 01:33:26.610
I'm a student.

01:33:26.610 --> 01:33:29.310
I'm studying this with this
really great institute,

01:33:29.310 --> 01:33:32.480
and I'm going to share with you
how I think about something.

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:36.010
That's like the most authentic
you can be, is being you.

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:43.030
It would be a shame to go to
someone who's inauthentic,

01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:46.195
like someone we don't know
like a movie star, when

01:33:46.195 --> 01:33:50.683
you have this incredible
credibility by just being you.

01:33:50.683 --> 01:33:52.251
That's so powerful.

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:57.380
GEORGE ZAIDAN: OK.

01:33:57.380 --> 01:33:59.190
AUDIENCE: Sorry, you
guys are so cool.

01:33:59.190 --> 01:34:01.230
GEORGE ZAIDAN: No,
you're absolutely right.

01:34:01.230 --> 01:34:02.150
That is correct.

01:34:05.125 --> 01:34:07.000
AUDIENCE: But now it's
about how to structure

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.570
the script in which you can feel
most comfortable being that.

01:34:10.570 --> 01:34:16.082
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah
There was something

01:34:16.082 --> 01:34:17.790
I wanted to say about
this, but I forgot.

01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:18.956
Maybe it'll come back to me.

01:34:18.956 --> 01:34:22.190
Anyway, comments on
the script before we

01:34:22.190 --> 01:34:26.510
get into the hosting side?

01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:28.752
AUDIENCE: I like the
first paragraph especially

01:34:28.752 --> 01:34:30.460
GEORGE ZAIDAN: What
do you like about it?

01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:32.960
AUDIENCE: I felt that
whe she was saying it's

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:35.781
as if-- I imagine her saying
this to a bunch of girls

01:34:35.781 --> 01:34:38.904
in front with braces.

01:34:38.904 --> 01:34:41.342
Telling them a story
about her life and saying,

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:43.341
oh, I used to have braces,
and I didn't like it.

01:34:43.341 --> 01:34:45.970
So why do you want to get
braces? [INAUDIBLE] as to

01:34:45.970 --> 01:34:48.290
why it's important or why not.

01:34:48.290 --> 01:34:52.170
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah, she
gives very specific examples

01:34:52.170 --> 01:34:55.544
about realistic fears that
people will have about braces,

01:34:55.544 --> 01:34:56.710
and that makes it relatable.

01:34:56.710 --> 01:34:58.550
It's going to hurt.

01:34:58.550 --> 01:35:00.930
You know you've got these like
metal wires in your mouth.

01:35:00.930 --> 01:35:02.860
What happens if they
poke you in the gum?

01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:05.990
How you going to talk with
all this stuff in your face?

01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:07.960
People are going
to make fun of you.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:10.580
Those are actual,
real fears that you

01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.320
get when you've had braces.

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:16.830
So, pointing them out
like that is effective.

01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:17.916
What else?

01:35:17.916 --> 01:35:19.541
AUDIENCE: Just to
check, is the content

01:35:19.541 --> 01:35:21.874
of the question or the video
why you get braces or is it

01:35:21.874 --> 01:35:23.189
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:24.817
AUDIENCE: The
actual video itself

01:35:24.817 --> 01:35:28.608
is about what happens
when the braces move

01:35:28.608 --> 01:35:32.018
your teeth on a cellular level.

01:35:32.018 --> 01:35:33.476
AUDIENCE: What
happens [INAUDIBLE]?

01:35:38.581 --> 01:35:40.580
AUDIENCE: As the force
is applied to your tooth,

01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:46.910
there are two different
types of cells, one of which

01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:49.570
actually dissolves some
of the bone in your jaw

01:35:49.570 --> 01:35:52.588
to make a little bit more room,
and another one that actually

01:35:52.588 --> 01:35:55.689
builds the bone to be able
to hold the bone in place.

01:35:55.689 --> 01:35:56.480
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Wow.

01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:57.240
I had no idea.

01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:59.090
That's cool.

01:35:59.090 --> 01:36:02.934
AUDIENCE: And that's
like the shoebox thing.

01:36:02.934 --> 01:36:04.350
GEORGE ZAIDAN:
That's the reaction

01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:05.970
you want from an audience.

01:36:05.970 --> 01:36:08.230
What I just did--
I wasn't faking it.

01:36:08.230 --> 01:36:09.670
That's an authentic reaction.

01:36:09.670 --> 01:36:11.415
That's the reaction
that you want.

01:36:11.415 --> 01:36:13.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean
later on in the script

01:36:13.290 --> 01:36:17.590
I say it's actually
dissolving your jaw.

01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:19.520
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I
had a question--

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:25.180
so the braces are only
attached to your teeth, right?

01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:27.230
So normally when you
want to move something--

01:36:27.230 --> 01:36:31.130
like I want to move this
table-- my foot's on the floor,

01:36:31.130 --> 01:36:34.520
and I push against my
foot to pull the table,

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:39.580
whereas with braces, I'm not
holding some external object

01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:43.667
to pull teeth in a certain
direction, so how is that by--

01:36:43.667 --> 01:36:44.541
AUDIENCE: Headgear.

01:36:44.541 --> 01:36:44.980
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Huh?

01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:45.470
AUDIENCE: Headgear.

01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:46.720
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Headgear, yeah.

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.890
But most people
don't-- I don't know.

01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:51.066
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but I think people--

01:36:51.066 --> 01:36:52.440
when you get
braces, usually it's

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:55.530
just the metal and the
wire on your tooth.

01:36:55.530 --> 01:36:57.990
But there's no
external support there.

01:36:57.990 --> 01:36:59.640
So how does it move your teeth?

01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:01.320
AUDIENCE: So that's
a physics question,

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:03.170
and we went over this yesterday.

01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:06.790
Because there are
different aspects.

01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:08.290
There's the sort
of what's happening

01:37:08.290 --> 01:37:10.890
on the cellular level,
which is one approach.

01:37:10.890 --> 01:37:15.350
You can also do it from the
material science-- basically

01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:18.250
what moves your
teeth the wire itself

01:37:18.250 --> 01:37:22.566
and its shape that's
constantly applying pressure.

01:37:22.566 --> 01:37:24.774
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Is that why
you get your wire changed?

01:37:24.774 --> 01:37:25.740
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:28.440
AUDIENCE: I mean imagine
being one person who

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.440
has two boxes on
either side of them,

01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:33.590
and they want to bring
them closer together.

01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:36.280
The external force is the person
itself pulling them together.

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:39.040
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah, but
the tension in the wire--

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:39.640
that's the--

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:40.750
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:43.901
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] when I
had braces they had my molars--

01:37:43.901 --> 01:37:46.400
I don't know if they're using
that now to the points or not,

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:48.095
but you had the metal--

01:37:48.095 --> 01:37:49.110
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:37:49.110 --> 01:37:51.045
AUDIENCE: They put a
whole band around your--

01:37:51.045 --> 01:37:52.170
they don't do that anymore.

01:37:52.170 --> 01:37:54.630
AUDIENCE: They don't--
back in my day.

01:37:54.630 --> 01:37:55.284
[LAUGHTER]

01:37:55.284 --> 01:37:57.200
AUDIENCE: They have much
better adhesives now,

01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:00.700
so that was another-- the
chemistry of the epoxy

01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:03.594
that actually-- I mean
there's a lot of science that

01:38:03.594 --> 01:38:04.510
goes into your braces.

01:38:04.510 --> 01:38:06.550
AUDIENCE: And when
you think about it--

01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:08.500
I would have this discussion
with my mother all the time,

01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:09.958
because I had to
have braces twice.

01:38:09.958 --> 01:38:11.360
And I was like, mom.

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:14.110
Braces, when you think about
it, they're like barbaric.

01:38:14.110 --> 01:38:16.210
I can't believe we're
living in the 21st century,

01:38:16.210 --> 01:38:22.120
and I pay money for a person
to glue metal to my mouth

01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:25.470
and take wires to
yank my teeth together

01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:27.190
because I have too
much gap in-between.

01:38:27.190 --> 01:38:29.620
That's so barbaric when
you think about it,

01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:31.860
that your jaw is dissolving.

01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:36.150
But barbaric in a way that's
fascinating to watch on video,

01:38:36.150 --> 01:38:38.880
and I feel like
that's such a more

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:46.000
high-stakes drama-driven hook
than you're worrying if braces

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.820
will hurt or how you'll look.

01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:50.278
AUDIENCE: It's interesting too,
because the bottom question

01:38:50.278 --> 01:38:56.150
gets at the anthropological
question of what is beauty.

01:38:56.150 --> 01:38:59.289
But really, I think
it's much more.

01:38:59.289 --> 01:39:01.580
If we're going to get back
to the evolutionary question

01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:03.795
of what makes someone
cold versus hot, and will

01:39:03.795 --> 01:39:06.080
they die soon or
not-- if all of us

01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:11.040
has evolved to the point
where 80% of tweens

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.070
end up getting braces, what's
wrong with our society,

01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:16.620
and why do we have to
keep fixing these teeth?

01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:18.869
Is it actually going
to make us die sooner

01:39:18.869 --> 01:39:20.410
if you don't fix
your teeth, or is it

01:39:20.410 --> 01:39:22.420
just because we look prettier?

01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:23.910
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Is it cosmetic?

01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:25.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:26.882
I know that I will
at some point have

01:39:26.882 --> 01:39:29.090
to deal with some more
significant dental issues that

01:39:29.090 --> 01:39:31.700
are actually about
my functioning.

01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:35.610
But proportion of this is
actually-- I don't know.

01:39:35.610 --> 01:39:38.056
And I don't know if that's
a question you're even

01:39:38.056 --> 01:39:41.630
going to get into, but why
do so many teenagers end up

01:39:41.630 --> 01:39:42.560
getting braces.

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:49.710
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So that and
Elizabeth's point are related.

01:39:49.710 --> 01:39:53.770
When she was describing
the barbarity of you

01:39:53.770 --> 01:39:56.270
get these metal blocks
and a wire in your mouth

01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:58.270
and all sorts of stuff--
what technique is that?

01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.910
What is that?

01:39:58.910 --> 01:40:00.030
It's not a metaphor.

01:40:00.030 --> 01:40:03.400
What is she doing there?

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:05.230
Yeah, so she's
inducing emotional pain

01:40:05.230 --> 01:40:07.870
by asking you to put yourself
in her shoes and getting this.

01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:12.030
But specifically when she
says, OK, you get braces.

01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:14.020
You're going to go
and have someone--

01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:17.710
you're going to pay
them to glue metal stuff

01:40:17.710 --> 01:40:20.095
to every one of your teeth,
then take a wire that is not

01:40:20.095 --> 01:40:22.720
in the shape of your mouth, bend
it so that it fits your mouth,

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:25.500
and then it forces your
teeth to move around.

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:27.640
Like what is that
that she's doing?

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:29.990
Who here has seen
Robin Williams' comedy

01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:31.220
sketch on golf?

01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:33.810
Anyone?

01:40:33.810 --> 01:40:34.630
Oh, you have?

01:40:34.630 --> 01:40:37.360
It has a lot of bad language
in it, but it is hilarious.

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.000
And I can't do it
here for that reason,

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.630
but you should watch it tonight.

01:40:41.630 --> 01:40:45.800
He basically says,
look, golf-- you

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:50.380
take a stick with a really tiny
metal thing on the end of it,

01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:52.230
and you have a small ball.

01:40:52.230 --> 01:40:55.250
And the goal is, without
touching the ball,

01:40:55.250 --> 01:40:58.200
to beat it with
the stick until you

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:01.680
get close enough to a
tiny hole in the ground

01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:04.150
that you can take
another stick and then

01:41:04.150 --> 01:41:08.882
gently tap the ball into the
hole, not once, but 18 times.

01:41:08.882 --> 01:41:10.840
That's the same technique
as Elizabeth's using,

01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:12.000
what is that?

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.150
Why is that interesting?

01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:18.050
Why does that make us listen?

01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:18.956
Yeah?

01:41:18.956 --> 01:41:20.330
AUDIENCE: Well
it's was humorous,

01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:23.870
because you get used to the
jargon and different terms,

01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:27.180
but it's the sort of thing if
you're trying to describe it

01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:29.830
to someone who has no clue
what you're talking about.

01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:31.680
it just sounds so
utterly ridiculous.

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:32.638
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Exactly.

01:41:32.638 --> 01:41:35.740
So the humor, actually, I'd
argue is a secondary component.

01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:37.620
Really, the crux of
it is what you said

01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:39.080
about being used to something.

01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:41.800
It is taking something
that's familiar

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:46.490
and describing it from a
completely different vantage

01:41:46.490 --> 01:41:49.880
point, and you can only
do that with things

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:52.210
that are familiar enough
that people are so used

01:41:52.210 --> 01:41:54.920
to them that they just don't
think about it-- braces,

01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:55.420
oh yeah.

01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:57.540
Braces, whatever.

01:41:57.540 --> 01:41:59.620
But when you shift
that perspective,

01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:01.270
you do inject humor.

01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:03.190
You can inject drama.

01:42:03.190 --> 01:42:07.750
You can inject--
mainly humor and drama.

01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:08.697
Humor and drama.

01:42:08.697 --> 01:42:11.280
And you force people to sort of
step out of their comfort zone

01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:13.420
and consider something
that-- they just

01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:18.390
look at it in a totally
different way, which

01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:20.550
is an alternative opening.

01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:22.840
So that's another thing
that you could consider.

01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:24.700
If I were to tell
you-- and the way to do

01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:26.765
it would be to do
it as a reveal.

01:42:26.765 --> 01:42:28.140
If I were to tell
you that you're

01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:30.990
going to go to someone's
place of business,

01:42:30.990 --> 01:42:34.200
pay them money to fill your
mouth with a bunch of metal

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:39.290
and plastic and chemicals,
would you do it?

01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:40.102
And then like, no.

01:42:40.102 --> 01:42:41.310
But people do that every day.

01:42:41.310 --> 01:42:42.910
It's called getting braces.

01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:45.200
The way I just did
it was not very good,

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:48.340
but you get the general idea.

01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:49.816
Other comments?

01:42:49.816 --> 01:42:51.964
AUDIENCE: I also
liked-- I was actually

01:42:51.964 --> 01:42:53.952
with Andrea when
she was pitching

01:42:53.952 --> 01:42:55.620
her idea to sixth graders.

01:42:55.620 --> 01:43:00.690
And her first question
was do you have braces?

01:43:00.690 --> 01:43:04.940
And this one girl who did-- she
was really excited about that.

01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:06.156
Like yes, this is about me.

01:43:06.156 --> 01:43:08.780
And then the next question was,
well, do you know what they do?

01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:11.890
And she started pitching
all these ideas.

01:43:11.890 --> 01:43:15.339
This is what I think they
do, but then the answer

01:43:15.339 --> 01:43:16.130
was very different.

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.745
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Sorry--
the girl thought

01:43:22.745 --> 01:43:24.370
they did something
completely different

01:43:24.370 --> 01:43:25.328
than they actually did?

01:43:25.328 --> 01:43:27.070
What did she think they did?

01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:30.860
She just kind of said pushing
teeth, whatever-- just a really

01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:31.560
basic answer.

01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:33.770
But then Andrea
was saying there's

01:43:33.770 --> 01:43:36.050
so much they actually do.

01:43:36.050 --> 01:43:38.260
And I thought that
was a really good way

01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:40.310
to get into it, because
they got really excited,

01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:43.630
and they started talking about
their experience with braces.

01:43:43.630 --> 01:43:45.890
So here it's kind
of-- if you say maybe

01:43:45.890 --> 01:43:48.130
instead of whether
it's worrying,

01:43:48.130 --> 01:43:51.180
you could say do you worry
about how much it will hurt?

01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:53.840
All these things.

01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:57.460
Get the audience thinking
maybe offering their own ideas,

01:43:57.460 --> 01:44:02.387
but also it connects them to--
this is something that I have.

01:44:02.387 --> 01:44:03.220
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah.

01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:06.230
So that approach--
generally, I would call it

01:44:06.230 --> 01:44:08.240
the preconceived
notion approach.

01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:12.510
So you basically guess or
know what your audience thinks

01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:16.569
about something, and usually
that is either entirely wrong,

01:44:16.569 --> 01:44:18.860
or parts of it are wrong, or
not complete, or whatever.

01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:22.580
And you say you start the video
by saying you probably think

01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:25.620
that x, but actually y.

01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:27.510
Or z or whatever.

01:44:27.510 --> 01:44:32.510
And so that is another-- it's
very different than the fill

01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:34.810
your mouth with a bunch of
metal and wires and stuff,

01:44:34.810 --> 01:44:37.410
but it can be just as engaging
and interesting, depending

01:44:37.410 --> 01:44:40.130
on what the subject matter is.

01:44:40.130 --> 01:44:42.090
The only difference--
and this is

01:44:42.090 --> 01:44:45.010
where you've got to be careful--
is that when you're actually

01:44:45.010 --> 01:44:46.930
in a room interacting
with people,

01:44:46.930 --> 01:44:49.920
going back and forth with
the Socratic method is great,

01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:52.300
and it is a perfect way
to get into the topic,

01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:55.260
but you can't do
that with video.

01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:57.100
And so you what you
don't want to do

01:44:57.100 --> 01:45:04.420
is make that two dimensional
conversation one dimension

01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:07.420
by sort of just stripping
the away the kids' answers

01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:09.040
and just putting
in the questions.

01:45:14.730 --> 01:45:19.360
It's kind of like trying to fit
a square peg into a round hole,

01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:23.177
or the other way around in
the sense that it's designed

01:45:23.177 --> 01:45:25.468
for one medium, and you're
trying to use it in another.

01:45:25.468 --> 01:45:28.250
[? SEAM ?] And I know that's
not a great way of explaining

01:45:28.250 --> 01:45:31.001
why it doesn't fully work,
and I don't necessarily

01:45:31.001 --> 01:45:32.334
have a better way of explaining.

01:45:32.334 --> 01:45:35.690
AUDIENCE: Isn't that why
Dora and why Blues Clues

01:45:35.690 --> 01:45:37.606
are held the way
that they are, where

01:45:37.606 --> 01:45:39.400
it's like a rhetorical
question, but they

01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:41.220
leave space for the
kids to-- my son

01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:42.678
watches and answers
the television.

01:45:42.678 --> 01:45:45.010
AUDIENCE: And that's the
educational best practices

01:45:45.010 --> 01:45:46.732
for educational videos
that I was talking about

01:45:46.732 --> 01:45:48.357
on the first day--
that you acknowledge

01:45:48.357 --> 01:45:50.930
your audience, that you
give room for interaction.

01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:55.330
I will say, going
out of your comment,

01:45:55.330 --> 01:45:58.670
and sort of addressing
the kids where they are--

01:45:58.670 --> 01:46:02.760
don't forget about
George's point of talking

01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:06.060
for the audience, not to them.

01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:11.490
Because the overall point I
would say about the wording

01:46:11.490 --> 01:46:18.960
and the set-up of this opening
is that a sixth grade kid would

01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:21.730
be interested in
this, but I'm not sure

01:46:21.730 --> 01:46:25.850
that their parent would
necessarily be relate.

01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:29.240
And maybe it's just the way
the questions are posed,

01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:32.730
or the types of
questions that are asked,

01:46:32.730 --> 01:46:36.650
but there's a risk of
falling into this tone

01:46:36.650 --> 01:46:37.925
of like after-school special.

01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:42.030
I don't know.

01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:44.370
George, do you have
tangible feedback

01:46:44.370 --> 01:46:45.820
that you can give about that?

01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:49.044
I can't identify
exactly what it is.

01:46:49.044 --> 01:46:50.085
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Let's see.

01:46:53.637 --> 01:46:55.470
AUDIENCE: Maybe the
question of why even get

01:46:55.470 --> 01:46:59.360
braces-- how that follows
this list of examples

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:02.145
of how much it'll hurt and
depending on the delivery,

01:47:02.145 --> 01:47:04.680
it can really change
how this reads.

01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:07.300
So why even get braces
leads me to think

01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:09.560
that this is the type
of video that they'll

01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:11.302
show at a dentist's office.

01:47:11.302 --> 01:47:13.260
AUDIENCE: I feel maybe
what you're getting back

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:21.290
to is the-- this is the first
example that we've seen where

01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:26.160
she's directly talking to you,
whereas the other ones, it's

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:30.055
more of either the voice
is different in all

01:47:30.055 --> 01:47:30.680
the other ones.

01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:32.900
This is the first one where
she's talking directly

01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:36.350
to the audience,
and it's abstract.

01:47:39.050 --> 01:47:43.540
You were using yourself
to say, this is what I do.

01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:47.140
This is a boat, and this
is back to me, my voice.

01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:50.130
And you were talking about
time travel and Stephen Hawking

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:55.140
as this third voice.

01:47:55.140 --> 01:47:57.410
But this is the
first time we've seen

01:47:57.410 --> 01:48:02.590
sort of an abstract you
in there that makes it,

01:48:02.590 --> 01:48:05.209
I think, a little
fuzzy in that way.

01:48:05.209 --> 01:48:07.000
GEORGE ZAIDAN: And I'm
not necessarily sure

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.520
that it would help to just
switch out the you with a we,

01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:18.390
because it is a we, but it's
also sort of a royal-feeling we

01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:21.910
rather than a-- we're
going to do this.

01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:24.050
Royal, by the way,
I don't want to-- I

01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:26.370
realize I'm lacing this
with jargon, but royal

01:48:26.370 --> 01:48:32.506
we means basically just I.
You say we, but you mean I.

01:48:32.506 --> 01:48:33.260
So I don't know.

01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:35.135
I think this is a really
interesting problem.

01:48:35.135 --> 01:48:39.350
Does anyone have
thoughts on how to reward

01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:43.610
without going the sort of
dramatic dentist route?

01:48:43.610 --> 01:48:46.000
Because I think
this is interesting.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:46.846
Yeah?

01:48:46.846 --> 01:48:50.850
AUDIENCE: We mentioned
the personal aspect of it.

01:48:50.850 --> 01:48:53.278
If you had braces, and
you suffered from this

01:48:53.278 --> 01:48:55.166
and that kind of [INAUDIBLE].

01:48:55.166 --> 01:48:59.455
So we can say how [INAUDIBLE],
because I experienced it

01:48:59.455 --> 01:49:02.084
just as you might be
experiencing it right now.

01:49:02.084 --> 01:49:03.500
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I
kind of think I'd

01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:06.560
be even better if-- I know
you don't have braces now,

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:10.070
but I would almost want
the host of the video

01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:14.834
to either actually
have braces or I

01:49:14.834 --> 01:49:16.500
don't know if it's
even possible to like

01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:17.900
put fake braces in your mouth.

01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:20.040
Like temporary braces
that you could just

01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:22.170
have in there for a
day and to just start

01:49:22.170 --> 01:49:23.580
with something like--

01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:25.997
AUDIENCE: They did it on Ugly
Betty for all their seasons.

01:49:25.997 --> 01:49:27.288
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Did they really?

01:49:27.288 --> 01:49:28.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah, they did.

01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:29.830
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I thought
she actually had braces.

01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:30.371
I don't know.

01:49:30.371 --> 01:49:32.440
Anyway.

01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:35.451
But to start with something
like see the metal stuff

01:49:35.451 --> 01:49:35.950
in my teeth?

01:49:35.950 --> 01:49:36.930
This is called braces.

01:49:36.930 --> 01:49:42.232
And you have this--
it's a piece of metal.

01:49:42.232 --> 01:49:43.190
It's glued to my teeth.

01:49:43.190 --> 01:49:45.810
This wire is bent, and it's
forcing my teeth around.

01:49:45.810 --> 01:49:48.840
So you're kind of doing this
sort of dramatic dentist

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:52.800
approach, but not as storified.

01:49:52.800 --> 01:50:00.040
And you are sort of sideways
hitting these points.

01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:05.960
Like I've got all the stuff in
my mouth-- is it going to hurt?

01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:08.380
What happens if
this wire pops out?

01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:11.350
Clearly I have a bit of
trouble talking or whatever

01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:16.920
the issues are, but you do it in
a way that is-- because you're

01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:19.480
pointing at something,
because it's kind of a demo,

01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:22.010
it's more conversational,
more relatable. i don't know.

01:50:22.010 --> 01:50:23.010
That's my thought on it.

01:50:23.010 --> 01:50:23.968
What do you guys think?

01:50:23.968 --> 01:50:25.540
AUDIENCE: I was
thinking maybe-- you

01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:29.620
know how infomercials
always ask you have you ever

01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:32.300
had this problem, and then
they go into the details.

01:50:32.300 --> 01:50:35.460
So maybe start off with
have you ever had braces

01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:36.910
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:38.784
AUDIENCE: How much it
hurts when [INAUDIBLE].

01:50:41.421 --> 01:50:44.171
So it relates back to them.

01:50:44.171 --> 01:50:46.420
AUDIENCE: Were the braces
your second time having them

01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:48.930
or your first-- it
was your first time.

01:50:48.930 --> 01:50:52.950
AUDIENCE: You could
show crazy teeth.

01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:54.752
AUDIENCE: David Bowie's teeth?

01:50:54.752 --> 01:50:55.960
AUDIENCE: Any English person.

01:50:58.904 --> 01:51:02.310
If think maybe we've all seen
the bubba teeth enough times

01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:04.210
that we know what they
are when we see them.

01:51:04.210 --> 01:51:07.860
But maybe many Europe
creators haven't seen then,

01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:10.423
and you could start talking with
this horrible mouth of teeth

01:51:10.423 --> 01:51:12.688
and then pull them out.

01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:19.335
AUDIENCE: I feel like this
backing out a lot from what

01:51:19.335 --> 01:51:20.251
we were talking about.

01:51:20.251 --> 01:51:24.430
But my big question is why we
even have the first section,

01:51:24.430 --> 01:51:28.780
because to my understanding, the
video is about how braces work,

01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:30.836
but in this first section.

01:51:30.836 --> 01:51:32.460
It's more about why
would you get them,

01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:34.543
but I kind of get the
feeling that the video isn't

01:51:34.543 --> 01:51:38.570
really about why you get them,
it's just how they do that.

01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:40.507
I don't know.

01:51:40.507 --> 01:51:42.090
AUDIENCE: Going off
that, I was trying

01:51:42.090 --> 01:51:46.045
to do figure out what my
main concerns with this

01:51:46.045 --> 01:51:49.584
were, and I didn't have a mental
grasp on it until you mentioned

01:51:49.584 --> 01:51:50.450
[INAUDIBLE].

01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:52.620
Because I haven't had braces.

01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:55.800
I don't plan on getting
braces, so I felt really,

01:51:55.800 --> 01:52:00.805
alienated by the you in this,
because I would probably,

01:52:00.805 --> 01:52:03.370
realistically, turn this
video off because I'm not

01:52:03.370 --> 01:52:06.610
interested in why people get
graces, because that's not

01:52:06.610 --> 01:52:07.470
relevant to my life.

01:52:07.470 --> 01:52:10.250
But if you posed the
question have you ever

01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:14.250
thought about exactly
what braces do,

01:52:14.250 --> 01:52:17.210
that's a much more interesting
to me and to probably

01:52:17.210 --> 01:52:18.210
a broader audience.

01:52:18.210 --> 01:52:21.660
And [INAUDIBLE] your
tone with whatever intro

01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:23.760
you decide to [INAUDIBLE],
because that seems

01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:26.420
to be what your video's going
to be about, especially if you

01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:29.710
phrase it like braces
are much more scientific

01:52:29.710 --> 01:52:30.970
than we think they are.

01:52:30.970 --> 01:52:35.120
They're not just magically
mushing your teeth

01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:37.480
into the correct
place-- there's actually

01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:39.160
a lot of things going
on in your mouth

01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:40.410
that people don't think about.

01:52:40.410 --> 01:52:43.900
And thousands of people
have braces every day.

01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:46.764
AUDIENCE: And the other
thing is I don't actually

01:52:46.764 --> 01:52:48.180
think that the
point of your video

01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:50.810
should be how braces
work, beside that's

01:52:50.810 --> 01:52:54.590
an instructional video
that Invisalign could make

01:52:54.590 --> 01:52:56.290
and has made, so many times.

01:52:56.290 --> 01:53:00.190
I've seen them so many times.

01:53:00.190 --> 01:53:03.560
There's no spark or wonder or
curiosity in that whatsoever.

01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:05.020
And I'm not saying
that every video

01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:07.000
has to be Neil deGrasse
Tyson contemplating

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.830
on the philosophies of
our existence or whatever.

01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:14.930
But when you think about it, you
can be born with bubba teeth,

01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:18.030
and we have the
ability to know how

01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:22.530
to craft bones in our bodies--
your teeth are the only exposed

01:53:22.530 --> 01:53:23.860
bone in your entire body.

01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:30.070
And we have figured out a way
to alter that, in such a way

01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:31.820
that we can still
continue to use them.

01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:33.280
So it's not like
you break a bone

01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:39.380
and try to align a crooked
finger or something.

01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:45.290
We've loop-holed around
bubba teeth and the bones

01:53:45.290 --> 01:53:49.360
that we have been born
with, and can actually

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:51.980
dissolve the osteoblast
or osteoplast

01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:55.020
or get them to dissolve
bone and restructure it.

01:53:55.020 --> 01:53:57.205
And we can manipulate,
essentially--

01:53:58.884 --> 01:54:00.300
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I
think what you're

01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:04.350
saying is braces shouldn't
work, just by reasonable--

01:54:04.350 --> 01:54:06.421
AUDIENCE: Or not even
that they shouldn't work,

01:54:06.421 --> 01:54:08.462
but we shouldn't be able
to do the things that we

01:54:08.462 --> 01:54:09.253
can do with braces.

01:54:11.944 --> 01:54:13.307
Braces shouldn't exist.

01:54:13.307 --> 01:54:15.640
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Well I don't
know that they should exist.

01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:23.800
The fact that you can basically
blunt trauma move teeth around

01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:26.450
and then your body
gets them to stay where

01:54:26.450 --> 01:54:29.420
you put them is really weird.

01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:34.350
That's something that
is-- I don't know about

01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:36.910
if you were to break
an arm and what

01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:39.640
the difference is between a
braces and a cast, for example.

01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:42.370
That might be another analogy,
or simile, or whatever.

01:54:42.370 --> 01:54:45.830
But it is bizarre.

01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:48.700
When you said the thing
about one type of cell

01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:57.030
dissolves the bone, and then
the other one re-bonifies it

01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:59.670
in the right place.

01:54:59.670 --> 01:55:03.560
To me, that's the
weirdest and coolest part

01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:05.170
of the braces thing.

01:55:05.170 --> 01:55:10.660
And so incidentally, why
does your body even do that?

01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:12.660
I mean it's not something
that your body came up

01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:15.010
with in response to braces.

01:55:15.010 --> 01:55:17.300
This is an ability that it has.

01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:19.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah, this is
in your entire skeleton.

01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:22.920
GEORGE ZAIDAN: So what happens
in our natural experience

01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:25.610
where our mouth would
need to do that?

01:55:25.610 --> 01:55:27.267
Get a tooth knocked out or what?

01:55:30.610 --> 01:55:33.760
Why can we do that?

01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:37.127
Is it only gums or is it
elsewhere in our body too?

01:55:37.127 --> 01:55:38.585
AUDIENCE: It's in
your entire body,

01:55:38.585 --> 01:55:42.980
because you very rarely have
two hard substances butting up

01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:43.930
against each other.

01:55:43.930 --> 01:55:45.858
They have usually
some covering that's

01:55:45.858 --> 01:55:51.010
mediating that relationship.

01:55:51.010 --> 01:55:54.320
And then if something
happens to permanently mean

01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:59.750
that these two pieces
of hard substance

01:55:59.750 --> 01:56:02.450
now have to be in this
orientation as opposed

01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:03.200
to this one.

01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:05.646
How do you get it
to stay that way.

01:56:05.646 --> 01:56:08.020
AUDIENCE: So this is more
about how the body heals itself

01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:10.920
than it is about braces.

01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:12.220
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah.

01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:13.720
The word isn't even heal.

01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:16.340
It's more like how your
body deals with something

01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:18.040
it can't change anymore.

01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:20.840
Because healing implies
that it puts it back the way

01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:23.240
it was, which is
not what it's doing.

01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:27.110
It's like we are
brute-changing our bodies,

01:56:27.110 --> 01:56:28.730
and it's adapting
to what we're doing.

01:56:28.730 --> 01:56:30.022
Did you raise your hand?

01:56:30.022 --> 01:56:34.364
AUDIENCE: Actually, I think
that some experiment [INAUDIBLE]

01:56:34.364 --> 01:56:35.780
basically to make
yourself taller,

01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:39.320
what they do is they break
the bones in your legs.

01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:41.010
AUDIENCE: Of your [INAUDIBLE]?

01:56:41.010 --> 01:56:42.635
GEORGE ZAIDAN: To
make yourself taller.

01:56:44.621 --> 01:56:46.292
AUDIENCE: So maybe
for one year, they

01:56:46.292 --> 01:56:47.750
keep breaking the
bone in your leg.

01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:51.594
Then they stretch it slightly,
like a few millimeters.

01:56:51.594 --> 01:56:53.510
AUDIENCE: How many inches
can they [INAUDIBLE]

01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:54.344
out of you that way?

01:56:54.344 --> 01:56:56.759
AUDIENCE: I think it's like
an inch or an inch and a half.

01:56:56.759 --> 01:56:58.410
AUDIENCE: Is it
really worth one inch?

01:56:58.410 --> 01:57:00.130
AUDIENCE: It's really painful.

01:57:00.130 --> 01:57:01.588
AUDIENCE: So they
keep breaking it,

01:57:01.588 --> 01:57:07.490
and then you have to [INAUDIBLE]
the distance apart [INAUDIBLE]

01:57:07.490 --> 01:57:08.950
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:10.840
The point of the video though.

01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:12.770
This is going back to
Jamie's point of you

01:57:12.770 --> 01:57:15.300
hone in on something very
specific like braces,

01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:17.160
but the point of the
video is not really

01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:19.867
just this is what happens
when you get braces--

01:57:19.867 --> 01:57:21.950
it points to this bigger
thing that we're actually

01:57:21.950 --> 01:57:24.877
manipulating natural processes
that happen in our bodies that

01:57:24.877 --> 01:57:25.460
are important.

01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:28.980
Like your bones have to break
down and remodel all the time.

01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:31.030
That is actually an
essential process

01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:36.910
of dissolving old bone and
osteoblasts forming new bone.

01:57:36.910 --> 01:57:41.150
If that doesn't happen,
your body can't exist.

01:57:41.150 --> 01:57:42.930
That's actually an
essential process,

01:57:42.930 --> 01:57:45.640
and with braces, you're
manipulating that.

01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:47.710
You're tricking
your body in a way

01:57:47.710 --> 01:57:50.880
to adapt to these blunt
forces that you otherwise

01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:52.090
wouldn't be able to do.

01:57:52.090 --> 01:57:54.020
GEORGE ZAIDAN: We had no
idea when we invented braces

01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:55.330
that that's what was happening.

01:57:55.330 --> 01:57:56.621
This was discovered afterwards?

01:57:56.621 --> 01:57:58.870
Or did we know?

01:57:58.870 --> 01:58:00.850
AUDIENCE: And I
think taking those--

01:58:00.850 --> 01:58:02.350
what you were
saying earlier about

01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:06.180
how can we do this and
what you were just saying.

01:58:06.180 --> 01:58:09.630
We're manipulating
a natural thing.

01:58:09.630 --> 01:58:11.211
I think part of
what you can do is

01:58:11.211 --> 01:58:13.460
like-- I was talking to you
about how your teeth slip.

01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:15.590
You teeth want to go back
to its natural state.

01:58:15.590 --> 01:58:17.090
They don't want to be straight.

01:58:17.090 --> 01:58:19.300
They want to be whatever
you're born with.

01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:21.810
And how that-- I don't
know if it's possible.

01:58:21.810 --> 01:58:25.220
You might be able to
take that angle-- we're

01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:27.760
made as how we're made and
we're to manipulate this,

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:31.500
but in the end, we just want
to go back to the [INAUDIBLE].

01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:36.560
And how this is process of using
braces as kind of-- at first

01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:39.796
it can seem like it's
barbaric, but it's trying

01:58:39.796 --> 01:58:41.169
to manipulate this process.

01:58:41.169 --> 01:58:41.710
I don't know.

01:58:41.710 --> 01:58:43.710
AUDIENCE: This is such
an interesting challenge,

01:58:43.710 --> 01:58:46.810
because we were talking about
this yesterday-- how Andrea

01:58:46.810 --> 01:58:50.520
is struggling with
the opposite issue

01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:53.320
that almost all the
rest of your scripts

01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:56.250
are struggling with which is
she has the very concrete thing,

01:58:56.250 --> 01:58:58.460
but she's not sure about
the big question is.

01:58:58.460 --> 01:59:01.850
That this is the example
for that big question.

01:59:01.850 --> 01:59:04.580
And we're struggling right
now to help her figure out

01:59:04.580 --> 01:59:07.590
was is that question that
allows her to use what she knows

01:59:07.590 --> 01:59:09.370
about braces as a cool
way of illustrating

01:59:09.370 --> 01:59:11.200
some very cool concept.

01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:13.360
And I feel like most
of you are actually

01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:16.060
struggling with the opposite--
you have some cool concept,

01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:17.960
and you're trying
to figure out what's

01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:21.990
the specific story I'm going
to tell to illustrate that.

01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:24.510
And so we've actually got like
a reverse engineering problem

01:59:24.510 --> 01:59:28.250
here, which is we don't know
what the question is that she

01:59:28.250 --> 01:59:29.790
wants to ask that
allows her to tell

01:59:29.790 --> 01:59:33.170
this cool story
about braces in a way

01:59:33.170 --> 01:59:36.380
that that example is a perfect
example for this larger

01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:37.760
concept.

01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:40.280
And the problem right
now is that there

01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:43.974
are a bunch of different
questions we could ask.

01:59:43.974 --> 01:59:45.390
AUDIENCE: But it's
a good exercise

01:59:45.390 --> 01:59:47.680
to throw-out all these bigger
questions, because that

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:50.430
gets you out of the
after-school special.

01:59:50.430 --> 01:59:53.430
That gets you out of
why do we get braces?

01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:55.270
You put up with this
trauma so that you

01:59:55.270 --> 02:00:00.660
have a healthy, shiny smile, and
then thumbs up and end credits.

02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:03.340
You don't want to have a
video that's like that.

02:00:03.340 --> 02:00:05.090
GEORGE ZAIDAN: To
play devil's advocate.

02:00:05.090 --> 02:00:06.870
AUDIENCE: You don't
want to have a video!

02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:07.828
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I agree.

02:00:07.828 --> 02:00:08.560
No, no, I agree.

02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:09.270
I agree with you.

02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:10.100
I agree with you.

02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:13.050
But you can play
off that expectation

02:00:13.050 --> 02:00:15.020
in fun and interesting
ways, like I

02:00:15.020 --> 02:00:17.060
would be perfectly
happy to start a video

02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:19.199
as a parody of an infomercial.

02:00:19.199 --> 02:00:20.740
AUDIENCE: Like a
parody is different.

02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:22.615
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Parody
of an infomercial, yes.

02:00:22.615 --> 02:00:24.000
Yes, yes, yes.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.672
I mean to do the infomercial
and then reveal it's a parody.

02:00:27.672 --> 02:00:29.130
AUDIENCE: But you
wouldn't actually

02:00:29.130 --> 02:00:33.480
go out with the intention of
the infomercial as your tone.

02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:35.310
No, but we'd shoot
it and deliver it

02:00:35.310 --> 02:00:39.390
as an honest-to-God
infomercial for the first 20

02:00:39.390 --> 02:00:42.076
seconds or whatever, until you
establish that you're joking.

02:00:42.076 --> 02:00:43.100
AUDIENCE: No more
than 20 seconds

02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:44.740
or else you'll bore the
crap out of your audience.

02:00:44.740 --> 02:00:45.600
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah.

02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:47.850
And you actually have to go
a bit over the top of what

02:00:47.850 --> 02:00:52.880
the normal tone would be to sort
of signal that you're-- yeah.

02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:54.022
Yeah?

02:00:54.022 --> 02:00:56.878
AUDIENCE: So when I
first heard Andrea

02:00:56.878 --> 02:00:59.840
say that your jaw dissolves.

02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:01.590
That kind of brings
up a lot of images.

02:01:01.590 --> 02:01:03.990
There are so many
movies where there's

02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:06.822
a focus on teeth
destroying mankind.

02:01:06.822 --> 02:01:08.910
So there's Jaws,
there's Piranhas,

02:01:08.910 --> 02:01:13.460
there's just random people
with teeth walking around,

02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:15.312
and that's kind of
their main feature.

02:01:15.312 --> 02:01:16.520
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Zombie movies.

02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:20.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and we watched
a video about what makes things

02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:22.240
creepy, and one of
the images was just

02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:25.710
a teddy bear with teeth,
and that was horrifying.

02:01:25.710 --> 02:01:29.590
So I think the idea-- so it's
just making the familiar thing

02:01:29.590 --> 02:01:30.400
unfamiliar.

02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:35.340
So you can even get away from
the idea of getting braces.

02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:36.870
This is something
we do, but rather

02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:42.590
start with this monstrous
thing that we dissolve our jaw.

02:01:42.590 --> 02:01:44.390
And that's a really cool image.

02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:46.090
And maybe you put
it on a teddy bear.

02:01:46.090 --> 02:01:49.900
You don't even have to
associate it with human kind.

02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:52.040
And then at the end, you
come back to the familiar.

02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:55.810
This is what we do, let
the viewer think back

02:01:55.810 --> 02:01:58.090
and say, oh, wow.

02:01:58.090 --> 02:02:01.700
This is me doing really well
cool things inside me body.

02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:05.360
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I think figuring
out other examples where

02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:08.700
essentially bone is
dissolved and basically

02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:10.960
listing all of
those out-- seeing

02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:13.500
what the differences are,
what the commonalities are.

02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:16.460
And then from there,
I think you will

02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:21.520
have a better sense of what the
overall story or big question

02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:27.410
of the video is, whether it's
infomercial parody, horror

02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:32.150
at the dentist, bub teeth,
teddy bear with a creepy smile.

02:02:32.150 --> 02:02:38.180
Whatever it ends up being, I
think you're absolutely right.

02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:42.580
The challenge is you have
one concrete example.

02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:46.280
One really interesting,
good, concrete example.

02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:48.820
And the question is how
to get to it in a way that

02:02:48.820 --> 02:02:52.230
is authentic and engaging.

02:02:52.230 --> 02:02:54.984
AUDIENCE: The body morphing
concept is very interesting.

02:02:54.984 --> 02:02:56.650
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Oh,
that's the other one.

02:02:56.650 --> 02:02:58.774
Breaking your legs
to get taller.

02:02:58.774 --> 02:03:07.410
AUDIENCE: And because it's a
everyday example of something

02:03:07.410 --> 02:03:09.966
that's actually
really bizarre of us

02:03:09.966 --> 02:03:13.280
physically altering
our own image

02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:15.310
for one reason or another.

02:03:15.310 --> 02:03:19.990
And people have experimented
with-- in certain countries,

02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:22.320
big feet are not attractive.

02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:24.820
And trying to swaddle their
feet in order to protect women's

02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:27.550
feet from getting too big.

02:03:27.550 --> 02:03:29.030
And thinking of
what are the ways

02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:33.480
we have either for
beauty or for function

02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:38.680
found ways to manipulate
our physical appearance

02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:41.382
at a structural
or cellular level.

02:03:41.382 --> 02:03:44.180
Not just on a going
to the plastic surgeon

02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:47.960
and getting them to fix
my nose [INAUDIBLE].

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:49.950
GEORGE ZAIDAN: In
a weird way, some

02:03:49.950 --> 02:03:54.790
of the body modifications that
we associate with extremism

02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:56.170
are the easiest.

02:03:56.170 --> 02:03:59.650
You get a piercing,
you're just driving a nail

02:03:59.650 --> 02:04:01.520
through your ear,
so what, big deal.

02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:04.940
Braces, which everybody
thinks are like-- everyone

02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:08.200
gets braces-- are actually
this incredibly complicated

02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:09.780
biochemical process
that's happening

02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:13.840
that's a team effort between
the hunk of metal in your teeth

02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:17.410
and your body to reshape the
only exposed bones that you

02:04:17.410 --> 02:04:20.044
have on you.

02:04:20.044 --> 02:04:22.460
AUDIENCE: And it's more than
just brute force pulling them

02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:24.890
together, but you're
actually affecting

02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:27.570
the biochemical
interactions that

02:04:27.570 --> 02:04:30.340
are happening within your body.

02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:31.840
AUDIENCE: Maybe
start off with that,

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:35.728
like say the common
misconception of how

02:04:35.728 --> 02:04:37.120
braces work.

02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:39.120
AUDIENCE: But until you
know where you're going,

02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:40.932
that doesn't help.

02:04:40.932 --> 02:04:43.390
So I wonder if, since it kind
of feels like we're circling,

02:04:43.390 --> 02:04:48.050
that maybe what we need to do
is either have Andrea or all

02:04:48.050 --> 02:04:53.290
of us come up with a whole
couple of our questions

02:04:53.290 --> 02:04:55.419
that the braces could
be the answer to.

02:04:55.419 --> 02:04:56.960
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I
think also coming up

02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:59.376
with a list of other examples
that are similar and simple.

02:04:59.376 --> 02:05:01.470
AUDIENCE: And then maybe
tomorrow we circle back

02:05:01.470 --> 02:05:06.120
and see if we can
better explore this,

02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:09.240
because I don't know that right
now we're going to get there.

02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:11.200
AUDIENCE: I mean we
have a lot of options

02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:12.560
that you can toy with.

02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:15.690
The point of the conversation
is that the point of the video

02:05:15.690 --> 02:05:18.530
shouldn't be this
is how braces work.

02:05:18.530 --> 02:05:22.410
It's a tool that you use
to reach the bigger point.

02:05:22.410 --> 02:05:25.450
And the bigger point has
not been established yet,

02:05:25.450 --> 02:05:29.841
but there are lots of
possibilities that hopefully

02:05:29.841 --> 02:05:30.840
we've been throwing out.

02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:33.010
And this thread of
body modification

02:05:33.010 --> 02:05:34.910
is a different thread
than the old making

02:05:34.910 --> 02:05:37.926
the familiar unfamiliar,
and I'm not sure

02:05:37.926 --> 02:05:40.050
that you can address all
of them in a single video.

02:05:40.050 --> 02:05:40.380
GEORGE ZAIDAN: No, you can't.

02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:42.700
AUDIENCE: But they're all
possible options They're all

02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:45.070
equally viable options.

02:05:45.070 --> 02:05:47.540
I would say that on a practical
level, how that relates

02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:49.650
to the script that
you've written here--

02:05:49.650 --> 02:05:51.700
I mean the studies
have shown that having

02:05:51.700 --> 02:05:57.940
a beautiful smile-- that's
a sentence that's explaining

02:05:57.940 --> 02:06:01.489
why we get braces, but that's
not necessarily a point

02:06:01.489 --> 02:06:03.530
that I think you should
eliminate from the video,

02:06:03.530 --> 02:06:06.250
it's just a point that
can come much, much later.

02:06:08.285 --> 02:06:09.660
GEORGE ZAIDAN:
I'd actually argue

02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:16.690
that that's its own video,
because the whole-- this

02:06:16.690 --> 02:06:23.160
is kind of this like
philosophical point that raises

02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:25.580
so many interesting
questions like well

02:06:25.580 --> 02:06:28.190
how important is a smile
to the rest of your face.

02:06:28.190 --> 02:06:31.830
Is symmetry important?

02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:34.460
Does it really actually
make people like you more

02:06:34.460 --> 02:06:37.884
if your teeth are
whiter-- so that, for me--

02:06:37.884 --> 02:06:39.860
AUDIENCE: It's almost
like a psychology video.

02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:41.651
GEORGE ZAIDAN: It's a
whole separate video.

02:06:41.651 --> 02:06:42.690
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

02:06:42.690 --> 02:06:44.856
AUDIENCE: Time has done a
whole bunch of different--

02:06:44.856 --> 02:06:47.454
I think Time Magazine has
done a whole series on beauty

02:06:47.454 --> 02:06:52.490
and the physical nature
of beauty and all that.

02:06:52.490 --> 02:06:55.330
I think tons of popular
magazine have really

02:06:55.330 --> 02:06:57.200
tried to explore this topic.

02:06:57.200 --> 02:06:59.120
I always get nervous
when we say studies too,

02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:03.890
because the critical scientist
in all of us is like who?

02:07:03.890 --> 02:07:05.280
How legit are they?

02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:07.010
And are they at
Harvard, or are they

02:07:07.010 --> 02:07:10.100
at Podunk somewhere and the
only person in the universe

02:07:10.100 --> 02:07:11.380
who thinks this.

02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:13.610
So that's just something
that I always think about.

02:07:13.610 --> 02:07:17.086
AUDIENCE: But just saying that
that sentence-- you can neither

02:07:17.086 --> 02:07:19.502
get rid of it entirely in the
open-- I would get rid of it

02:07:19.502 --> 02:07:20.502
entirely in the opening.

02:07:20.502 --> 02:07:24.954
AUDIENCE: I think that if
it were me at this point,

02:07:24.954 --> 02:07:26.370
I would want to
actually-- this is

02:07:26.370 --> 02:07:27.870
what I tell a lot
of people who come

02:07:27.870 --> 02:07:31.240
in my lab for a variety of a
different communication tasks--

02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:35.945
is to actually minimize
this and not not look at it,

02:07:35.945 --> 02:07:39.200
and see if you can come up with
an idea that this fits under,

02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:41.820
and then come back to this
idea and see if you can somehow

02:07:41.820 --> 02:07:42.970
repurpose it.

02:07:42.970 --> 02:07:45.460
But the idea of trying
to repurpose this

02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:47.596
without that bigger
concept is not really

02:07:47.596 --> 02:07:50.230
going to allow your
mind to get there.

02:07:50.230 --> 02:07:51.480
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Yeah, actually.

02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:53.188
And that leads me to
another point, which

02:07:53.188 --> 02:07:56.500
is everyone who's gone today and
almost certainly the people who

02:07:56.500 --> 02:08:00.870
have not been subjected to
this horrifying treatment--

02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:02.610
you will all need to
completely rewrite

02:08:02.610 --> 02:08:04.040
your next draft from scratch.

02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:05.730
So when we say redraft
a script, we're

02:08:05.730 --> 02:08:07.771
not saying like change a
few words here or there.

02:08:07.771 --> 02:08:10.630
We're saying start with
a blank word document

02:08:10.630 --> 02:08:12.630
and start from scratch,
because otherwise you're

02:08:12.630 --> 02:08:14.780
going to end up with
all the same issues

02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:16.110
that we talked about.

02:08:16.110 --> 02:08:18.890
AUDIENCE: But if you end up
loving a phrase that you used,

02:08:18.890 --> 02:08:21.624
you can do what you call
lifting a line, which

02:08:21.624 --> 02:08:23.845
is to just copy and paste
that line once you've got

02:08:23.845 --> 02:08:25.840
your new structure in place.

02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:28.260
And that keeps you from
sticking to something

02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:29.760
that doesn't really
work, and trying

02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:33.160
to step it into something
that works a little better.

02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:34.949
It keeps your mind
open that way.

02:08:34.949 --> 02:08:37.490
GEORGE ZAIDAN: If there's a line
that really sticks with you,

02:08:37.490 --> 02:08:39.970
oftentimes you will just, of
your own will, rewrite it.

02:08:39.970 --> 02:08:42.330
You don't even need
to copy and paste it.

02:08:42.330 --> 02:08:45.750
AUDIENCE: We won't get a chance
to hit everyone's scripts

02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:48.450
today, by George
can stay until five,

02:08:48.450 --> 02:08:50.600
and I can stick around as well.

02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:55.320
It's about 3:30, so we
should probably do a hosting.

02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:57.386
AUDIENCE: I have to
apologize, because I

02:08:57.386 --> 02:09:00.800
have to leave every day at
3:30, and so I am sorry.

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:01.927
This is my moment to leave.

02:09:01.927 --> 02:09:04.510
But if any of you need to reach
me or want to connect with me,

02:09:04.510 --> 02:09:05.010
email.

02:09:05.010 --> 02:09:06.640
I will totally get
back to you tonight.

02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:08.848
But I am sorry that this
always the moment of the day

02:09:08.848 --> 02:09:10.394
where I have to leave.

02:09:10.394 --> 02:09:11.060
So awesome work.

02:09:14.710 --> 02:09:18.130
AUDIENCE: This is also a
totally normal process.

02:09:18.130 --> 02:09:21.959
George, your script
was terrible.

02:09:21.959 --> 02:09:24.250
No, we went back and forth
actually three or four times

02:09:24.250 --> 02:09:27.220
where she kept being like this
is all fascinating information,

02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:29.300
but what is the
point of your script?

02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:33.400
And as the writer, you
are the worst person

02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:36.561
to like objectively assess what
the point of your script is.

02:09:36.561 --> 02:09:38.560
So having other people
talk about it is helpful.

02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:42.310
AUDIENCE: And it's a lot easier
to edit someone else's work

02:09:42.310 --> 02:09:44.722
that exists than to come
up with it on your own.

02:09:44.722 --> 02:09:45.680
So it's totally normal.

02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:48.310
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I think we did
eight revisions of my script,

02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:49.730
and I'm a professional writer.

02:09:52.570 --> 02:09:54.792
AUDIENCE: What about
defining the point

02:09:54.792 --> 02:09:56.430
before you get started.

02:09:56.430 --> 02:09:58.870
Particularly if
you're doing a series,

02:09:58.870 --> 02:10:00.996
you probably want
some common theme,

02:10:00.996 --> 02:10:04.590
and then each episode
has a particular point.

02:10:04.590 --> 02:10:05.770
Or I don't know.

02:10:05.770 --> 02:10:09.250
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Oftentimes
you have a point in your mind

02:10:09.250 --> 02:10:12.740
when you start writing, but
then as the script comes out,

02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:14.400
maybe there's a better point.

02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:19.640
Maybe discussions like these
you discover that you know what?

02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:22.942
Actually, this point
that I was thinking

02:10:22.942 --> 02:10:25.400
of when I wrote the script
isn't what I want to talk about.

02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:27.760
This other point really is.

02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:29.480
And that usually
happens, no matter

02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:32.520
how diligent you are about
picking the best point that you

02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:35.217
can before you start writing.

02:10:35.217 --> 02:10:37.050
And again, it's a
slightly different process

02:10:37.050 --> 02:10:39.290
for like purely technical
instructional video--

02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:40.509
like Lynda videos.

02:10:40.509 --> 02:10:42.550
Because I remember you
had emailed me about that.

02:10:42.550 --> 02:10:44.591
I don't know if you guys
have checked it out yet,

02:10:44.591 --> 02:10:47.553
but we're not going to technical
how to use Final Cut Pro, how

02:10:47.553 --> 02:10:49.580
to use iMovie-- but
you can go on Lynda.com

02:10:49.580 --> 02:10:51.410
and all MIT students
have access to it.

02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:53.720
And they're just purely
technical videos.

02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:57.190
I listed all the helpful
ones in the syllabus.

02:10:57.190 --> 02:11:01.220
But the objective of that is
basically open your brain,

02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:03.180
dump the information
in, and close the brain.

02:11:03.180 --> 02:11:06.230
And I mean that in
a very positive way.

02:11:06.230 --> 02:11:10.140
They are very, very
good videos, but that's

02:11:10.140 --> 02:11:13.410
a totally different objective
than maybe doing a whole series

02:11:13.410 --> 02:11:16.315
on time travel, because
there's so much you

02:11:16.315 --> 02:11:18.040
can talk about that right.

02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:20.560
The objective of a
series on time travel

02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:23.700
to pique curiosity
among people can also

02:11:23.700 --> 02:11:26.710
include informing them and
transferring knowledge to them,

02:11:26.710 --> 02:11:30.980
but it's going to be a very
different scripting process.

02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:33.450
I hesitate to say a very
different scripting process,

02:11:33.450 --> 02:11:37.420
but the priorities that
you're going to have

02:11:37.420 --> 02:11:40.820
are going to be a little bit
different than a Lynda series

02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:42.370
for example.
