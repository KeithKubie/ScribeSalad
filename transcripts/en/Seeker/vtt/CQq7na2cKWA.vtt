00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.590
Sexting is all the rage.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.496
And which age group
is doing it the most?

00:00:04.496 --> 00:00:04.995
Teenagers.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.780
Hey everyone.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.010
Laci Green here for D News.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.660
I have a funny feeling
that parents are slowly

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.669
beginning to realize
that sexting should

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.460
be on the list of things
that are discussed

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.620
with their teenagers.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.820
Recently, the massive
Snapchat hacking,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.580
which exposed personal
data of most of its users,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.580
got a lot of people talking
about sexting and privacy.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.150
And now the Journal
of Pediatrics

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.530
published a new
study which found

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.180
that 20% of seventh
graders are sexting.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.970
Now before your
jaw drops too far,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.720
the study sample
was seventh graders

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.130
who were identified by
their school counselor

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.240
as already having some emotional
or behavioral difficulties.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.750
And of those in the study group,
those who were sexting were

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.870
more likely to make out and
have sex than those who didn't.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.440
Shocker.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.760
I know.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.320
Just so we're all
on the same page,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.730
legally sexting refers
to sexual photo, video,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.120
and text messages sent
using a cell phone.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.190
The National Campaign found
that across the board about 40%

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.822
of teens have sent sexually
suggestive messages.

00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:07.280
A quarter of high schoolers
and a third of college students

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.850
admit to having sent and
received nude pictures.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.640
Sending text sex was more
common amongst young men,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.140
while sending nude
or semi-nude photos

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.610
was more common amongst women.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.160
And 61% of the
women said that they

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.920
felt pressured to
send the pictures.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.980
So this makes me
wonder, why is sexting

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.180
so common amongst teens?

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.060
It's unfortunate that
a huge part of it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.650
is feeling pressured.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.170
Being a teenager is full of
all kinds of sexual pressures,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.241
so I suppose sexting is just a
modern addition to that list.

00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:34.990
Another big part of
it is that, well, they

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.280
think it's fun and sexy.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.490
Another huge shocker.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.010
When I was a
rambunctious youngen,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.870
I also remember
feeling like sexting

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.690
was less intimidating
than in-person flirting.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.150
The phone made the
exchange kind of abstract.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.330
It was less awkward.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.530
And it felt like there
were fewer consequences.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.430
Text sex won't get you
pregnant or give you an STI,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.939
but my teens
proceeded picture sex,

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.480
which are a whole
other can of worms.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.720
On their own, they
won't get you pregnant,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.760
usually, but about
one in five sextors

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.250
admit to sharing the
photos they receive

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.109
with a friend or two or three.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:07.650
This suggests that
teens aren't being

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.810
taught the importance of
respecting their partner's

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.620
privacy.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.360
Another study found
that a third of teens

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.760
didn't think about the
legal ramifications.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.980
Situations where it's
considered child pornography

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.145
and could get them
labeled as sex offender.

00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:21.690
Yeah, the laws are
stupidly behind.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.840
So what's to be done?

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.720
We live in a high-tech,
hyper-sexualized world.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.610
Sexting isn't going away.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.020
And thus, experts advise that
it needs to be discussed early.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.660
Kids as young as
11 have admitted

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.749
to sexting unbeknownst
to their parents.

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:38.290
And the conversations about sex
tend to focus on don't do it.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.310
Just don't do it.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.380
But this is an
adequate preparation.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.290
Teens need to
understand that it's

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.170
under no circumstances OK to
pressure someone into sexting.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.280
Nor is it OK to share
someone's photos.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.155
And both of these
behaviors are disrespectful

00:02:51.155 --> 00:02:53.582
and increasingly illegal.

00:02:53.582 --> 00:02:55.290
Teens also need to be
informed about what

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.965
the risks of sexting
actually are.

00:02:56.965 --> 00:02:57.820
How to be safe.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.510
To understand
harm-reducing alternatives.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.340
And how to navigate situations
where they're being pressured.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.840
All of this starts
with open, gentle,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.650
and non-confrontational
conversations with teens.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.700
Perhaps asking what
they know about sexting

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.460
and what they think
about it, to start.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.126
So what do you guys
think about sexting?
