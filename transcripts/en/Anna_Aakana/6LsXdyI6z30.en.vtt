00:00:00.273 --> 00:00:01.546
Ladies and Gentlemen,

00:00:01.546 --> 00:00:03.967
welcome to the 75th annual

00:00:03.967 --> 00:00:06.829
Miss Fairest of Them All!

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:08.481
(applause)

00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:10.676
These ladies have been working real hard

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:12.767
and tonight, we will find

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.418
Miss Fairest of Them All.

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:16.948
Are you ready?

00:00:17.707 --> 00:00:18.918
Let's get started.

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:44.192
(ominous music)

00:00:44.192 --> 00:00:47.813
(footsteps)

00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:49.358
(silence)

00:00:51.068 --> 00:00:52.129
What happened?

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:54.541
You passed out.

00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:56.099
It was very dramatic.

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:57.132
(accordion)

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:02.100
Your square was great.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.416
You made it to the evening gown.

00:01:04.416 --> 00:01:05.797
How long was I out?

00:01:05.797 --> 00:01:06.769
Less than a minute.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:09.766
Oh god, it's happening faster,

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:10.269
I...

00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:12.599
I keep having this dream...

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:33.335
(ominous music)

00:01:35.713 --> 00:01:37.860
So you did the whole routine with it broken?

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.390
Yup.

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:40.129
All 3 toes.

00:01:40.712 --> 00:01:41.776
Damn, Kansas.

00:01:42.553 --> 00:01:44.208
The more it hurt, the more I smiled.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.708
What?

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.509
You're...

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.721
You're all dead.

00:01:53.073 --> 00:01:54.894
You seem a little nuts, Hawaii...

00:01:55.252 --> 00:01:56.191
Maybe you should like,

00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:57.538
not be in this pageant right now,

00:01:57.538 --> 00:01:58.859
and go see a doctor?

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.859
No, none of us should be in the pageant...

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.132
they're--they're gonna announce that I won,

00:02:02.132 --> 00:02:02.569
and then--

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:03.268
(laughs)

00:02:04.282 --> 00:02:05.253
Keep dreaming...

00:02:05.253 --> 00:02:06.570
No, you don't understand!

00:02:07.278 --> 00:02:16.251
(ominous music)

00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:31.753
(ominous vocalizing)

00:02:31.753 --> 00:02:34.012
Alright ladies, you know the drill.

00:02:34.012 --> 00:02:35.920
3rd runner up, 2nd runner up,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.252
1st runner up, winner...

00:02:37.252 --> 00:02:38.195
and smile!

00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:39.451
No no no no no no no...

00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:40.981
Hope, you can't go on stage!

00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:41.662
Shhhh.

00:02:42.115 --> 00:02:45.238
All that's left to do is stand up there and smile!

00:02:45.722 --> 00:02:47.329
No, you don't understand!

00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:54.751
(ominous music)

00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:55.629
Fantastic.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.311
And the 3rd runner up of Miss Fairest is...

00:03:00.222 --> 00:03:01.569
Miss Georgia!

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:02.889
(applause)

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.390
You almost passed out, but we held you up.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.539
You're welcome.

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:08.208

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.512

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:28.328
(applause and cheer)

00:03:28.328 --> 00:03:28.979
You did it!

00:03:30.012 --> 00:03:30.660
You won!

00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:37.538
(ominous buzz)

00:03:37.538 --> 00:03:39.265
(applause and cheer)

00:03:39.265 --> 00:03:41.798
(screaming)

00:03:41.798 --> 00:03:43.665
It was just the balloons...

00:03:43.665 --> 00:03:47.752
(screaming)

00:03:47.752 --> 00:03:48.889
(screams continue)

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:49.481
YOU!

00:03:50.482 --> 00:03:55.226

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:13.360
(screams continue)

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:27.692
(ominous vocalizing)

00:04:27.692 --> 00:04:41.904
(ominous music)

00:04:41.904 --> 00:04:45.571
(feedback)

00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:52.859
(disharmonous music)

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:54.859
(ominous sounds build)

00:04:54.859 --> 00:04:57.160
