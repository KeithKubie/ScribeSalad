00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:02.480
Welcome.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.300
Please confirm your name.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.170
&gt;&gt; JP.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.210
&gt;&gt; Full name.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.680
&gt;&gt; JP Soucheck.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.470
&gt;&gt; Please verify your identity.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.510
&gt;&gt; Come on.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.720
I just want to see Lilah.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.660
&gt;&gt; What is your date of birth?

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.550
&gt;&gt; September 12th.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.040
&gt;&gt; Father's middle name.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.880
&gt;&gt; Peter.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.960
&gt;&gt; Social security number.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.790
&gt;&gt; Come on.
I just want to get through the door.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.170
&gt;&gt; Please put your eye
next to the scanner.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.280
Scare.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.510
Mother of an Android.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.990
&gt;&gt; Eye scan verified, you may entry.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.890
&gt;&gt; JP, hey.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.980
&gt;&gt; So
what's up with the whole door thing?

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.820
&gt;&gt; Well you know given
our recent trolling,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.420
I really decided that I think
authentication is a priority for us.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.290
We need to know what
user's identities are so

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.500
that we know that they
are who they say they are.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.260
Anyways, I made these cool wire frames.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.890
In fact, for version 0.3 of the app,
the developer and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.990
I are going to work on the login flow.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.190
Luckily, Firebase makes
authentication dead simple.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.870
It has support for email login and

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.310
a bunch of other providers
such as Google login.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.828
We're going to implement both.

00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:10.270
And then, once we actually know who's
logged in, we can implement some cool

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.470
functionality, like letting users
signal that they bought items, or

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.180
that they're in the store shopping.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.810
This will allow anyone looking at
the list to easily see things like,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.489
Walter's in the store, or
that Kugare has bought cheesy flakes.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.720
&gt;&gt; Right where do we start?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.013
&gt;&gt; Hm, well I should actually continue
working on these login screens a little

00:01:27.013 --> 00:01:30.010
bit, but maybe you can talk to
the developer about authentication.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.210
&gt;&gt; Let's talk about authentication.
