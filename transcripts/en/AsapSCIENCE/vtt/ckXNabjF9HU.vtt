00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.980
Hand sanitizers are really handy. Especially when soap and running water aren't within reach

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.380
But are they worth using more often, or should you try and avoid them all together?

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.680
Hand sanitizers contain ingredients like alcohol,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.620
which is often at 70% concentration,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.800
that works to kill Microbes.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.840
When left on the skin [for] 30 seconds or longer, it's able to kill 99.9%

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.800
of Bacteria present and

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.780
even certain types of viruses like influenza [a]

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.340
The sanitizer breaks open the cell membranes of these bacteria or the...

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.940
envelopes of viruses, although they're ineffective against spore releasing Bacteria and viruses without envelopes.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.940
There are also non-alcohol based

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.500
sanitizers using other ingredients,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.570
but depending on their combination may just be bacteriostatic

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.590
Meaning they prevent bacterial reproduction.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:51.599
Of course anyone who's used Sanitizer knows that it simply spreads grime and dirt around so soap and water are necessary in these cases

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.600
to clean up, but in the absence of visible dirt which works better.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.740
A 2009 Australian study had vaccinated hospital workers contaminate their hands with live

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.759
Influenza [a] virus and had some of them wash their hands with regular soap and water for 40 seconds

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.969
followed by paper towel drying while some of their hands with

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.909
61.5% ethanol sanitizer for 20 seconds and others used a combination of alcohol and

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.900
Antibacterials the remaining group was the control and did nothing as expected the control group had the most viral dna present

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.619
But the group with the least viral Dna was the soap and water group

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.890
despite the fact that

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.349
Sanitizer can destroy germs soap and water actually removes them from the hands and comes out as the superior method of infection [control]

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.350
but does the temperature of the water matter turns out that while hot water can kill Bacteria this only happens at

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:48.689
99.9 8 degrees Celsius which would burn your skin so save some [energy] and wash with cold water of course soap can also be

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.489
Antibacterial and these often contain Triclosan [so] is that even more effective?

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.720
Well it turns out that

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.959
they're typically way below the effective [1%] concentration required to cause bacterial side effects and

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.070
Studies from around the world have shown these soaps to be no better than regular soap

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.429
Furthermore Triclosan is washed down the drain and ends up in lakes and Rivers in fact

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:17.059
It's one of the top ten contaminates found in all American Rivers bio accumulating in many Marine organisms like dolphins

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:25.159
even more troubling is that Triclosan has been linked to promoting antibiotic resistance in Bacteria in a process called cross resistance as

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.369
Bacteria become resistant to Triclosan they simultaneously

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.250
evolved to resist the effects of other antibiotics

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:39.349
even though they haven't been exposed to them well this doesn't mean using antibacterial Soap will render your antibiotics ineffective the study highlights the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.280
possibility of unnecessary

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.040
Antibacterial usage potentially leading to Superbugs of course a common misconception

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.479
Is that hand sanitizer causes bacterial resistance as well which in most cases?

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.350
It doesn't as they primarily use alcohol as their active ingredients

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.270
But some brands of hand sanitizer [do] include antibacterial ingredients like Triclosan

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.749
So it's important to be aware at the end of the day your best bet is always using regular soap and washing with cold water

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.250
Saving Sanitizer for sinkless situations and avoiding antibacterial soaps for the sake of your health, the environment, and future generations

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.518
But is it truly better to be clean in the first place?

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.070
We debate between being clean or dirty in our new AsapThought video (Greg and Mitch) that you can click here and look at the hygiene

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.850
hypothesis

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.380
And other studies to figure out the best way to live [your] life from a sanitary perspective.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.320
