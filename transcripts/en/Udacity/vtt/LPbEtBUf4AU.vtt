because I don't buy eggs individually
from the store, I buy them in carts.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.500
And just like with anything else,
I could say that one carton divided by

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.630
one carton is equal to one, but
there's something else I could say.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.530
There's a relationship
between the cartons and eggs.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.390

one carton is equal to how many eggs?

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.090
