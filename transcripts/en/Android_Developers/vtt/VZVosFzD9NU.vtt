[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:09.060
DENNIS TROPER: My
name is Dennis Troper,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.790
and I'm the product
director for Wear OS,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.310
and I'm really, really
excited to be here today.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.060
Let me start with a
little bit of history.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.510
By the way, I need the clicker.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.350
You know, when we first
started Wear OS four years ago,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.250
we went out to see what people
were wearing, and what we found

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.400
was a tremendous amount
of diversity out there.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.330
People really care
about what they wear.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.180
It evokes their passion, their
style, and their personality.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.580
The same goes with what
you wear on your wrist.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.610
It's a really, really
personal choice.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.970
And so from the start,
we made a decision

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.430
to bring lots of
choice and diversity

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.440
into the wearable space.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.530
Today, we couldn't
be more pleased how

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.630
this strategy has played out.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.230
We have over 50 watches
that are powered by Wear OS

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.900
today out in the market,
from top brands like Louis

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.230
Vuitton, Michael Kors,
Fossil, and many, many others.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.490
Let me show you some of the
recent launches of watches

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.310
that we've introduced in the
market with our partners.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.760
Back in the fall, for the
holiday season of 2017,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.670
Misfit launched the
Misfit Vapor smartwatch.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.500
The Misfit team did a
great job with this watch.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.670
It has a very sleek
and stylish design.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.950
It fits great on your wrist,
and it makes for a great fitness

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.330
watch.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.630
Then this past
January, Kate Spade

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.530
launched the Kate Spade
New York smartwatch.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.870
It's a beautiful watch,
and users are really

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.970
loving the Choose Your Look
app that matches your outfit

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.190
with your watch face.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.370
And then this past March
at Baselworld, Hublot

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.780
introduced a limited edition
smartwatch called the Big Bang

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.760
Referee 2018.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.200
This is a beautifully
crafted smartwatch.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.400
It's body made out of
titanium and with a theme that

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.410
celebrates the most popular
sport in the world--

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.235
soccer.

00:02:26.235 --> 00:02:28.110
I'm actually really
excited about this watch.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.190
I'm a big soccer fan myself.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.140
And get this--
referees are going

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.950
to be wearing the Big Bang
Referee at international

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.790
matches to help them connect
with the latest goal line

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.730
technology.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.160
And that's really, really cool.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.700
So we're really excited
about all these new watches

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.230
that are coming to market.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.040
We've built a lot of
momentum with our partners.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.400
To give you a sense
of that, in 2017,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.190
we launched 26 new watches.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.960
That's twice the
number of watches

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.390
that we launched
the previous year.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.790
And an interesting stat-- we're
now seeing a lot of iOS users

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.950
in the Wear OS platform.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.260
This past year, in 2017,
we grew 148% year over year

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.730
in iOS users.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.440
And today, one out of
three new Wear OS users

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.380
activate their watches
with an iPhone.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.010
And so this is why
last month we decided

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.690
to change our name from Android
Wear to Wear OS by Google.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.220
We want a brand name that really
reflects the great diversity

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.990
of users that we
have in our platform,

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.900
as well as the wide
range of choices

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.850
of watches that are out there.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.087
We're really happy
with this new name,

00:03:54.087 --> 00:03:55.670
our partners are
really happy with it,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.960
and our users are
loving it, as well.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.410
So, you know, we've
learned a thing or two

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.250
over the last few years,
working in the wearable space,

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.970
and I want to share a key
insight with you guys.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.470
It's a simple one and
perhaps an obvious one.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.190
But the way people use watches
today is very, very different

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.320
from how they use phones.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.990
They're very different in how
people interact with them,

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.140
how long they use it,
how often they use it,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.780
and what they use it for.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.240
With a phone, first of all, you
carry it with you all the time,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.450
and you have two hands
to interact with it.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.900
It has a large screen, and you
can spend a long time with it,

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.270
playing games, doing social
media, or responding to email.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.270
With watches, it's a
very different story.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.250
With watches, you carry it with
you on your wrist all day long,

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.560
but you use it
very sporadically.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.280
And when you use it, it's
just for very short moments

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.060
to get some information,
and then the faster you

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.800
can be back doing
what you're doing

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.110
in the real world, the better.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.590
So we've taken these
learnings to heart

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.550
in how we think of our
platform going forward,

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.870
and we are now focusing on
three very important areas

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.670
to improve the user experience.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.530
Let me walk you through them.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.170
First is connection at a glance,
second is health and fitness,

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.360
and thirdly is convenient help
from the Google Assistant.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.420
Let's start with
connection at a glance.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.540
In this day and age,
people are expected

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.500
to be connected all the time.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.930
As I said before, we carry our
cell phones most of the day,

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.380
but there are some cases in
which pulling out your cell

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.650
phone is inconvenient,
or sometimes

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.270
we just don't have it with us.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.090
For example, when you go out
on a run or on a bike ride,

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.890
or if you go to a fancy
dinner dressed in an outfit

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.480
with no pockets.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.510
But in any of these
occasions, you still

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.330
want to be connected to the
people and the information

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.840
that you really care about.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.140
You know, I myself am
the father of five kids,

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.210
and I also like mountain biking.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.710
And I can tell you
from experience

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.960
having to put my cell
phone in my backpack

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.280
where I carry water is
just really inconvenient.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.180
Watches-- smartwatches--
fill this gap really neatly.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.590
They're very easy to access.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.200
There's a lot of
computing power in here.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.450
And this is one of
the key reasons why

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.020
users love wearing
Wear OS watches is

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.540
to help them have
the peace of mind

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.410
that they can be
free from their phone

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.160
but still be connected to
the information or the people

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.440
that they really care about.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.920
And so this is an area that's
a really important, connection

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.180
at a glance, and we're
doubling down on it

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.200
to increase the user experience
and bring more to our users.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.000
To give you just a
few examples of things

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.330
that we've introduced recently
in the areas of notifications

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.760
and complications, let me
show you real quick here.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.350
Very recently, we introduced
adaptive text sizing,

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.590
which essentially
allows the glanceability

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.290
of the notifications to
be much, much better.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:33.190
Because when you receive a
short text, the size of the text

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.190
gets bigger so it's
easier for you to read it.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.000
We also introduced
recently darker backgrounds

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.360
and a new font type so we
can increase the readability

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:49.000
and fit more information
onto the screen at a glance.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.200
We've also done things to
improve our complications.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.830
Complications are
these bite-sized chunks

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:01.580
of information that sit
right on your watch face,

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.880
and they're very
handy little tools.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.050
I myself, I use the
agenda complication a lot.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.300
It really helps me many
times during the day

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.110
to tell me where I need to
go next for my meetings.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.610
So we've done more,
because we think

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.420
this is an important area
for people to stay connected.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.370
Very recently, we introduced
the notification preview

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.900
complication.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.510
This is a very
handy complication

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.450
that brings the
top-ranked notification

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.970
right on your watch face.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.280
Things like breaking
news, a chat message,

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.610
or your next appointment will
be right there on your watches

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.100
with this complication.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.680
And we also introduced
another complication

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.090
that we called the recently
launched app complication.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.000
This is one where
it's very handy when

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.450
you have types of information
that you like to access very

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.210
frequently during the day--

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.750
for example, the weather
or checking the scores

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.180
of a live game.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.700
So this is just a few
examples of things

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.420
that we're doing to increase
the experience for connections

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.790
at a glance.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.220
And as I said before, we're
doubling down in this area,

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.900
and you should expect a lot more
from us in the months to come.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.660
Next is health.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.210
You know, health
and fitness is one

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.580
of the most
important reasons why

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.040
people buy a smartwatch today.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.620
People want to be healthy,
of course, and we at Wear OS

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:40.150
are very committed to helping
people lead healthier lives,

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.190
so we're doing more with it.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:49.360
We're working tirelessly
to give users the ability

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.440
to track their health much
better than ever before,

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.980
and also to offer them a
more superior experience

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.276
to track their active fitness.

00:10:00.276 --> 00:10:02.150
Let me show you just a
few examples of things

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.191
that we've done recently.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.670
Very recently we launched a
feature called touch lock.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.090
This is a great feature, for
example, if you go on a swim,

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.850
or you go out on a
run on a rainy day,

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.300
and you're tracking
your workout with Google

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.270
Fit or any other application
like MySwimPro, Strava,

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.050
or Runkeeper.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.870
With touch lock
enabled, what happens

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:32.590
is that your screen
basically gets disabled,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.440
your touchscreen gets
disabled, to avoid

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.940
any unintended behaviors
while your watch is

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.490
in constant contact with water.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.490
To disable touch lock,
all you have to do

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.650
is click on the button, and
you're back into normal mode.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.440
Next is music.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.990
Music is a huge
deal for many people

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.700
when they're working out.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.750
It helps them stay
motivated and energized.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.190
And so we've made
accessing the music media

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.740
controls much, much
easier than ever

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.140
before from the Google
Fit workout screen.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.720
All you have to do is
scroll down from that screen

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.266
and you get to the
media controls,

00:11:13.266 --> 00:11:14.890
where you can choose
the next song that

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:19.790
will help power you through
the rest of your workout.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:23.480
We're also doing a lot more
with the heart rate sensor.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.730
We recently introduced
continuous heart rate

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.550
monitoring so you can check
your heart rate many times

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.820
during the day, and you can also
compute your resting heart rate

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.290
right from Google Fit.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.800
So this is just a
few samples of things

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.710
that we're doing in
health and fitness.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.640
As I said before, helping
people lead healthier lives

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.190
is core to our mission.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:50.924
And we're working really hard
in many aspects of health

00:11:50.924 --> 00:11:52.340
and fitness, and
we're going to be

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:57.100
bringing a lot of new
features in the coming months,

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.340
so stay tuned.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.420
The last pillar that we're
focused on is the Assistant--

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.790
convenient help
from the Assistant.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:11.960
You know, today, unlike
traditional watches that

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.980
are very good at giving you
the time, with smartwatches,

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.220
you expect to get the
best out of the time.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:24.040
For example, in my case, I'm
very busy during the day.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.900
I can quickly look
at my phone and be

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.000
able to check when the next
train leaves to San Francisco

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.070
so I can be home in time for
my daughter's soccer game.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.230
We're working really
hard to improve

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:40.820
the experience for the Assistant
to optimize for the risk form

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.120
factor.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.495
In a few short
minutes, I'm going

00:12:43.495 --> 00:12:45.530
to invite Tom to come on stage.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.200
He's going to tell us a lot
more about what we're working

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.875
on here with the Assistant.

00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:51.750
So there you have it.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.790
These are the three areas
that we're focused on

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.540
to improve the user experience--
connections at a glance, health

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:02.010
and fitness, and convenient
help from the Assistant.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.200
But in order to do
this really well,

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:09.030
we require a very solid
and robust foundation.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:13.440
Here, I'm talking about things
like power, connectivity,

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.470
performance, the companion apps
that go along with the device,

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:18.760
and so on.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.440
Let me just highlight
three of them very quickly.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.890
First, iOS-- as I
said before, we're

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.370
welcoming a lot
of new iOS users,

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.750
and we want those users
to have a great user

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.020
experience just like
anybody else that

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.510
is wearing a Wear OS watch.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:41.040
Very recently, for example,
we introduced a brand new iOS

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.300
companion app that
brings Google Fit summary

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.790
stats right on the
app so you can see it

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.920
from the comfort of your iPhone.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.870
This is just one
example of many things

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.720
that we're doing to
improve the iOS experience.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.060
Next is power.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.730
Power is really,
really important

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.370
when it comes to
smartwatches, and we're

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.000
working across the Wear
OS stack to optimize

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.270
battery consumption.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.467
Right after Tom, we're going
to invite my colleague Rati.

00:14:16.467 --> 00:14:18.550
She's going to tell us a
lot more about what we're

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.680
doing with Android
P and how this

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.610
has a positive impact in power.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:29.650
And lastly, I'd
like to highlight

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:33.640
that we're bringing faster
and more frequent updates

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.340
to the platform.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.700
That's really, really
important for our users

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.570
that they get continuous
improvements to the watch

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.330
constantly throughout the year.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.840
With Wear 2.0, we made
changes to our architecture

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.660
so that pieces that
were considered

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.480
to be traditionally
part of the OS

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.060
are now updateable
platform components.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:00.750
And as a result of that,
this past year, in 2017,

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:04.930
we were able to do 11
releases to the platform

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.670
and introduce 49 new
features and improvements.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:13.830
This year, we're on track to
do the same or even higher.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.380
We're introducing a lot of
features really, really fast,

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.910
and we're really
excited about that.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.530
So as I said before,
the Google Assistant

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.810
is one of the key pillars
that we're working on,

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.530
really, really important for us.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.830
And I'm going to
invite Tom on stage

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.714
to tell us a lot more about it.

00:15:32.714 --> 00:15:33.630
TOM RUDICK: Thank you.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:39.640
Thanks, Dennis.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:44.350
Hi, I'm Tom, and I work on
the Assistant for Wear OS.

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.590
We want the Assistant to follow
you across all of your devices.

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.600
And when you interact
with the Assistant,

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.510
it should adapt to the
device that you're using.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:56.260
And for Wear, we want to provide
an awesome Assistant experience

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.240
right on your wrist.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.340
With our last update
this week, we've

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.142
completely redesigned our UI and
have three major improvements

00:16:03.142 --> 00:16:04.600
that I'd like to
talk to you about.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.650
First, we have an always
present microphone,

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.890
which automatically reopens
to continue the conversation

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.380
with the Assistant hands-free.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.160
Second, support
for text-to-speech.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.030
If you have a paired Bluetooth
headset or a wearable device

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.910
that has a speaker, when
you talk to the Assistant,

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.390
it now can speak
right back to you.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:35.520
And lastly, my favorite,
support for suggestion chips.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.020
Suggestion chips
allow you to breeze

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:41.830
right through a conversation
just by tapping.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.880
But the biggest new
addition for Wear

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.240
is support for
Actions on Google.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.570
Actions on Google allow anyone
to write a great wearable

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.130
experience without
having to write

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.620
a single line of Android code.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.460
Even better, most existing
actions already work on Wear OS

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.340
today without any changes.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.176
So let's take a look
at how this works.

00:17:04.176 --> 00:17:06.050
You may have already
used Dialogflow to build

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.060
actions for the Assistant.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.130
It's a platform
provided by Google

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.800
that helps to turn natural
language into a format

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.569
that you can just go and
build cool stuff with.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:17.210
And starting this
week, you can also

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:21.260
use Dialogflow to create
actions for Wear OS.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.480
Best of all, we've already
done all the hard work

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.280
of building out
response templates that

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.770
are appropriate for
wearable devices,

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.580
so you don't even have
to think about it.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.960
If you haven't used Dialogflow
yet, it's super easy.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.260
Just yesterday, I was
creating my own action.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.180
I only had to define
this action once,

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.180
and it will work across
all supported devices.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.710
Here's what it looks
like on mobile.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.470
This might look pretty familiar.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.670
There's an action
icon at the top,

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.450
a tapable list of the Google
I/O sessions I plan to go to,

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.506
and a suggestion
chip at the bottom.

00:17:55.506 --> 00:17:56.880
And this is how
it looks on Wear.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.460
All the same components
exist, but now they're

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:07.510
tailored for a smaller,
wearable form factor.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.790
I didn't have to do anything
special for this to happen,

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:11.390
it just works.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.470
And now, even if you're
going a little bit deeper,

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.660
and you're using the Actions SDK
or a webhook for fulfillment,

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.402
we still have you covered.

00:18:21.402 --> 00:18:22.860
In this case, I'm
adding a new card

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.000
to the conversation that has
a little more information

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.791
about this session.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.940
And this is how the card will
render on both phone and Wear.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.060
It automatically resizes
and looks great, regardless

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.460
of which device is being used.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.960
So over the past few months,
we've been building and testing

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.380
a lot of actions, and we've
come up with some best practices

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.980
to help your actions look
really great on Wear.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.330
Let's start with an example.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.870
OK Google, ask Bay Trains when
is the next BART from Fremont

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:57.450
to Hayward.

00:18:59.692 --> 00:19:01.400
There's supposed to
be an animation here.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:01.700
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.158
- There will be a
BART from Fremont

00:19:03.158 --> 00:19:05.250
to Hayward leaving
today at 11:21 AM.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:05.942
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:05.942 --> 00:19:06.650
TOM RUDICK: Cool.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.670
So as Dennis
mentioned earlier, we

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.190
want users to have glanceable
simple interactions.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.400
We want users to get
tasks done quickly.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.470
We want to allow
users to complete

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.130
a task with a single phrase.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.570
In the previous example, I was
able to get the information

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.170
that I asked for by
speaking a single phrase.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:31.620
Imagine if I had to specify all
the information separately--

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.810
the train that I
wanted, the station,

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.792
the direction of travel.

00:19:35.792 --> 00:19:37.250
That would take
way too long, and I

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.490
would be far more likely
to just pull out my phone.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:45.236
Keep your dialogues short,
concise, and task-oriented.

00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:46.610
Now, there are
cases where having

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.770
a back and forth
dialogue is important

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.080
and maybe even required,
and that is fully

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.150
supported on Wear today.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.670
However, try not to make it
part of your core user journey.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.670
As you may have just heard, Wear
now supports vocal responses,

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:05.860
and they don't have to be
the same as the visual.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.620
In the previous example,
both the visual response

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.920
and the vocal response tell
me when the next train leaves.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.820
That's what I asked for.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.730
But the visual response
goes a step further

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.515
and shows a more detailed
list of departures.

00:20:18.515 --> 00:20:20.890
That information would probably
be a little bit too dense

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:24.080
to read aloud vocally, but
visually, it works really well.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.530
Independently, both the
vocal and visual response

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:30.550
makes sense.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.920
But together, they really
complement each other

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.690
and make an awesome experience.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:40.910
Keep in mind that not all
devices support vocal feedback,

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.590
so you can use
surface capabilities

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.990
to really tailor your
experience to the device that's

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.710
being used.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.230
So vocal responses are cool,
but my favorite new feature

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.280
is suggestion chips.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:01.000
So I have to admit
I'm a little nervous.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.280
Last few times I came
to Mountain View,

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.510
it rained, and I forgot my
umbrella, got soaking wet.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.280
I know it looks like a
nice day out there today,

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.860
but let's ask the Assistant
to see how things look.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.590
OK Google, do I need
an umbrella today?

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.700
Cool, not expected to rain.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.340
This weekend I was planning
on going for a hike,

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.650
and I can use suggestion
chips to get that information

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:30.310
quickly--

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:31.980
the weather for this weekend.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.690
I can just drag up on the bottom
drawer where the microphone is

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.480
located, which will
reveal suggestion chips,

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.660
and I can tap on weather
this weekend to quickly get

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.270
the forecast for the weekend.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.560
The weather looks great.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.440
I should bring my sunscreen.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.720
I love suggestion chips.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.280
Not only are they a great
way for guiding users through

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.540
a conversation, they also
allow users to discover what

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.300
your agent can and cannot do.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.140
Provide example chips whenever
possible to guide users

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.310
through a conversation.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:11.050
When thinking about how to build
your action, be user-centric.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:12.510
Someone might be
using your action

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.140
in a lot of different ways.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.710
They might be on the go,
their hands might be full,

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:21.210
and vocal responses might
be more appropriate.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.070
Or they could be
somewhere noisy,

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.650
and suggestion chips are
the easiest way for them

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.340
to tap through an interaction.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:32.860
Design with all these
use cases in mind.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.030
We've had a lot of fun building
support for Actions on Google,

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.710
and you can get started
building your own agents today.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.810
I'm so excited to see what
you're going to build.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.550
And if you need
some inspiration,

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.120
we have a lot of great
partner demos in our sandbox,

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.100
and you can come by
after the session

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.610
to say hi and check them out.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.592
And if you're interested
in building actions,

00:22:53.592 --> 00:22:55.050
I definitely
recommend to check out

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.240
the "Design Actions for
the Google Assistant"

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.110
session, which starts right
after this one on stage 2.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.990
But don't go just yet, because
up next is Rati to tell you

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:05.175
about our platform updates.

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:12.280
RATI AGRAWAL: Thanks, Tom.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.510
Hi.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:14.610
I'm Rati.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:18.280
I'm a technical program
manager working on Wear OS.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.820
Tom just showed you how to build
really cool Assistant actions

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.090
on Google for Wear users.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:29.020
Now let's move on to the
platform updates that we have.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.780
With the new Wear OS
release, we are introducing

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.270
platform features
that will help you

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:39.040
to offer delightfully stable and
battery-efficient experiences

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.510
throughout your apps, and help
you build really cool watch

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:48.070
faces with just a
few lines of code.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:50.830
To begin, I'd like to
talk about an Android P

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:55.030
feature that is going to
impact you as a developer.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:59.640
Android P is adding restrictions
on accessing methods and fields

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.300
unsupported by the SDK to
improve app compatibility

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.250
and to prevent
apps from breaking.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.550
Wear OS is adopting
these restrictions

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.420
with the goal of
making app behavior

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.290
deterministic and stable.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:16.840
This is very similar to what
the developers on my team

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.600
face just before
a product launch.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.040
The deadlines and
restrictions can

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.860
make people a little
unhappy as they're

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.990
dashing to meet the deadlines.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:29.400
But come launch date,
the team is really happy

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.680
when they're able to launch
a stable and reliable product

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.900
that meets our users' needs.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.590
So check out the app
compatibility link

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:43.780
g.co/dev/appcompat to understand
what these changes mean

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.920
for your apps.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.690
Moving on to battery--

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:53.280
battery is precious on mobile,
and even more so on Wear.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:57.690
Last year at I/O, we highlighted
that most watches have

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:01.500
just 1/10 the battery
capacity of a phone,

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.720
and we shared some
best practices

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.400
on improving battery life.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.840
We also indicated that we
would be looking for ways

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.470
to be more aggressive than the
phone in addressing battery

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.370
usage.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:18.990
This year, we are moving
beyond the mobile platform

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:23.310
and introducing features to
reduce background activity,

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:26.640
aggressively turn off radios
when the user takes off

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.630
the watch, and enhance
battery saver mode.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.190
Let me walk you
through some of them.

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.310
Here's a snapshot of
the app Standby feature

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.440
that was introduced
in yesterday's talk,

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.230
"What's New in Android P."

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:46.310
On Wear OS, we're experimenting
with a more aggressive platform

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:49.230
change.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.720
Apps that are not
active will not

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.600
be able to create
jobs or alarms when

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.270
they are not on the charger.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.850
Now, even when they are
in the active bucket,

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.790
they can only start
jobs or alarms

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.790
if they are in the foreground.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:08.490
What do you mean by foreground?

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:14.160
Well, an active app running in
the foreground is an example,

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.640
a watch face currently
active on your dial,

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:22.600
complications on your
currently active watch face,

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.020
and in very rare
circumstances-- say,

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.150
if you're a health
monitoring app--

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:30.690
a foreground service
running on the watch.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:34.410
All of these can
create jobs and alarms.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.800
If you are a Wear app
developer, be sure to experiment

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.610
with these changes in
the developer preview

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:41.870
and provide us with feedback.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.870
Another platform feature that is
being revamped in the upcoming

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.960
release is battery saver mode.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.130
We are enhancing this mode to
go beyond the phone platform

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.580
to aggressively squeeze
that last ounce of battery

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.880
and prevent the watch from
turning off on users' wrists

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.430
during the day.

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:08.230
In this enhanced version
of battery saver mode,

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.860
we would be turning
off all radios,

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.380
touch, and tilt
detection, and would

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.880
be defaulting to a
battery-optimized watch face.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.170
Users can short press to
read the time and long press

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.720
to resume full operation.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.730
This could be
particularly helpful

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.240
if your watch is
running low on battery,

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.220
but you want to quickly
be able to turn it back

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:36.585
on to, say, make a payment or
to check an important message.

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.930
Continuing with our efforts
on improving battery life,

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:47.730
last month we moved to using a
dark theme for our system apps,

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:50.230
as Dennis mentioned earlier.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.770
Now, this theming
has the dual benefit

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:56.580
of improving glanceability and
accessibility while reducing

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.630
power consumption.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.980
In P, we're bringing these
changes to the platform

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.380
and updating the default system
UI to use the dark theme.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.515
So try these changes out on your
app using the current developer

00:28:09.515 --> 00:28:10.015
preview.

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.990
I'd like to leave you with some
best practices for watch face

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:17.850
design.

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:21.180
As you know, watch faces
are the most active apps

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:25.590
and frequently are doing
too much too often.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.990
As developers, you
have the ability

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:31.860
to influence how long
users get experience

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.010
and enjoy your watch
faces using simple coding

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.650
techniques to save battery.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.730
Let me share a few best
practices with you.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:45.600
Display, CPU, and
network are the most

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.990
battery-intensive
components of the system.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:52.170
Be mindful of the
frequency at which you

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.920
are reading, processing,
or displaying information

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.690
on a watch face.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.790
For example, if you're
reading a sensor

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:02.130
and doing calculations
every minute,

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:06.120
or sending an RPC to the
companion every minute,

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:11.060
this can significantly
impact the battery life.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.610
And once you have the new data
from the sensor or the network,

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:18.320
you would also have to wake
up the system to process it.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.380
Processor wakeups are more
expensive for battery life

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.080
than the power consumed
by individual sensors

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.510
like the accelerometer.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:31.440
So batch you sensor
requests and network calls.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.600
Batching can go a long way
in conserving battery life.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.250
Finally, moving on to
some developer tools.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.930
Last year, Android,
and as a result,

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:48.070
Wear OS, officially
starting supporting Kotlin.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.750
Now, you can already
take advantage

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:53.560
of a lot of language features,
like compile time null

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.620
checks and Lambda support.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.870
But to get the
best out of Kotlin,

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:03.430
we need to go beyond what the
language offers by default.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:07.570
On Wear, we are experimenting
with creating a Domain-Specific

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.490
Language, or DSL,
for watch faces

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:14.050
so you can get rid of a lot
of the boiler plate code.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:17.240
The initial results
are quite exciting.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.940
We reduced the watch face
creation code of 600-plus lines

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:26.208
to just under 15 lines of code.

00:30:26.208 --> 00:30:30.130
And here's a snippet of
what the DSL looks like.

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:33.880
This simplified interface allows
you to focus on the design

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.270
and customize your watch faces
using just a couple of lines

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:41.350
of code, while incorporating
best practices to boost

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:44.830
the performance and battery
life of your designs.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.380
We're very excited
about the opportunities

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.750
that Kotlin provides
and are just

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:53.230
beginning to scratch the surface
on simplifying development

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:54.970
on Wear OS.

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:57.430
We look forward to
your feedback while we

00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:01.570
work towards adding this
to our official SDK.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:06.130
Check out the code labs at I/O
and visit the Wear OS sandbox

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:10.670
to share your
feedback and ideas.

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:14.960
To summarize, use officially
supported methods and APIs

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.290
instead of private APIs
to improve compatibility

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.870
and stability of your apps.

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:24.350
Design your apps and watch
faces to be battery-efficient.

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:27.380
Remember, batching
is your friend.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.140
Download the P developer
preview and check out

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.980
how your apps are impacted by
the battery-saving features

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.720
that we are introducing.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:40.100
And finally, give Kotlin DSL
a spin using the code lab,

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.200
and let us know what you think.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.310
With that, let me hand it
back to Dennis for closing.

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:54.040
DENNIS TROPER: Thank you, Rati.

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.980
All right, to recap,
we're working really hard

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.920
to improve the Wear OS
experience in three key areas--

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:05.950
connections at a glance, health
and fitness, and a Google

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:10.000
Assistant experience that
is optimized for the wrist.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.190
We're also improving
the platform

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:17.130
with new battery-saving features
and new tools for developers.

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:20.500
And also, you can expect a
lot more and frequent updates

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.197
from us during the year.

00:32:23.197 --> 00:32:25.030
Today's session is just
the beginning for us

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:33.530
here at I/O. At 2:30 PM,
we have office hours where

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:35.780
you can meet with our
engineers and our developer

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.890
relations folks.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:38.840
Come on by if you
have any questions.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.180
They'll be really happy
to receive you and talk

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.785
to you about anything that
you like to talk about

00:32:43.785 --> 00:32:46.520
in regards to Wear OS.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.990
And at 11:30 AM tomorrow, we
have an app review session

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:54.320
where you can bring your
Wear app, your complications,

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.560
or watch faces to get
feedback from our engineers.

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:02.770
And we also have a sandbox.

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:04.720
Here's a map of where it is.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.950
Please come visit us.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:09.020
Tom, Rati, and I will be there
right after this session,

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.920
as well as many of our
colleagues at Wear OS.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.590
We also have some cool
demos there to show you

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:19.180
and a full lineup of some of
the most recent Wear OS watches.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:19.690
That's all.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:22.589
Thank you very much for
coming, and have a great I/O.

00:33:22.589 --> 00:33:27.192
