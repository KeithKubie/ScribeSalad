00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the correct answer here is 'way more than that.'

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.300
It's 2^500, which is approximately 10^150.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.640
So, that's not even a number we have a sensible name for.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.780
So, Alice's algorithm, while being correct, does not offer any way of finding

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.620
the solution for the problem that she's working on.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.620
And now, of course, the question is

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.260
if this is just because Alice wasn't able to think of a better algorithm than this, here,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.090
or because the problem that she's working on

00:00:34.090 --> 99:59:59.000
is actually a hard problem to solve.
