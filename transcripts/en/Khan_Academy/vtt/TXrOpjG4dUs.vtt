00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:02.891
Let's make a plot of real GDP

00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:05.403
as a function of time.

00:00:05.403 --> 00:00:07.563
This axis right over here is going to be

00:00:07.563 --> 00:00:10.319
real GDP, so it's an actual measure,

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:11.406
not just nominal GDP.

00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:13.006
It's an actual measure
of the goods and services

00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:14.895
produced by an economy or

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:16.886
the productivity of an economy.

00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:20.798
Over here let's have time.

00:00:20.798 --> 00:00:23.151
In our little country or whatever economy

00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:25.063
we're studying here, let's assume

00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:28.335
that over time its population is growing.

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:29.935
Let me write these things down.

00:00:29.935 --> 00:00:35.339
So, population is growing over time,

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.228
and this is not an unrealistic assumption,

00:00:38.228 --> 00:00:40.162
this is true of most countries.

00:00:40.162 --> 00:00:42.063
Population is growing over time.

00:00:42.063 --> 00:00:44.744
Also, let's assume that
productivity is improving.

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:48.138
Productivity ... Productivity is just

00:00:48.138 --> 00:00:50.610
essentially how much can each individual

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.152
person produce?

00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:52.744
Productivity.

00:00:52.744 --> 00:00:54.938
Productivity is going up.

00:00:54.938 --> 00:00:57.669
Productivity goes up due to technology,

00:00:57.669 --> 00:01:00.276
probably mainly technology,

00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:02.732
technology

00:01:02.732 --> 00:01:04.414
Mainly technology, but there could be

00:01:04.414 --> 00:01:06.420
discoveries of resources.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.268
Discovery of resources ...

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:11.148
Or it could be new business processes.

00:01:11.148 --> 00:01:12.751
People wouldn't even consider that

00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:16.879
maybe technology, so new processes.

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:18.758
On a per person basis, they're able to

00:01:18.835 --> 00:01:20.406
produce more and more over time.

00:01:20.406 --> 00:01:21.786
Because of these trends, and these are

00:01:21.786 --> 00:01:23.322
trends that do take place over

00:01:23.322 --> 00:01:25.180
long periods of time in
many, many economies,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.683
you would expect the real productivity

00:01:27.683 --> 00:01:30.049
of that economy to increase.

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.854
If you were to just do the long-term

00:01:31.854 --> 00:01:33.313
trend just based on these two things,

00:01:33.313 --> 00:01:36.025
the population growing and
productivity improving,

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:39.729
over time, real GDP should have a trend

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.293
something like that.

00:01:41.293 --> 00:01:44.184
That is the long-term trend of most

00:01:44.184 --> 00:01:46.788
properly functioning economies.

00:01:46.788 --> 00:01:49.124
When you look at it on the short-term,

00:01:49.124 --> 00:01:50.788
it doesn't look like a nice, smooth

00:01:50.788 --> 00:01:52.385
trend line like this.

00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:54.188
When you study any major
economy in the world,

00:01:54.188 --> 00:01:56.505
or any economy, any normal economy,

00:01:56.505 --> 00:01:59.983
instead of going this
nice, smooth trend line,

00:01:59.983 --> 00:02:02.932
it tends to look something more like this.

00:02:02.932 --> 00:02:06.925
Real GDP will be going really fast,

00:02:06.925 --> 00:02:08.931
maybe higher than trend line,

00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:10.550
and then all of a sudden,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.180
it will essentially recede,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.519
or it will essentially shrink.

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:15.933
Then it'll start growing again,

00:02:15.933 --> 00:02:17.563
maybe go above the trend line,

00:02:17.563 --> 00:02:19.163
then it'll recede ...
Go below the trend line.

00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:20.433
Then it'll go above the trend line,

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:23.854
it'll just keep fluxuating around

00:02:23.854 --> 00:02:26.453
a trend line like that.

00:02:26.453 --> 00:02:28.669
This fluxuation around this trend line,

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.856
this is called the business cycle.

00:02:30.856 --> 00:02:32.666
This right over here
... And you could maybe

00:02:32.666 --> 00:02:34.505
call one cycle, you could say it's from

00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:36.049
one peak to one peak or

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.019
one trough to one trough,

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.400
or whatever you want to call it,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.422
it's this idea that the economy isn't

00:02:41.422 --> 00:02:44.676
just a nice, steady-as-you-go growth,

00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:46.858
you have periods of fast growth

00:02:46.858 --> 00:02:48.257
going maybe above the trend line,

00:02:48.257 --> 00:02:50.297
and then it recedes, then it expands,

00:02:50.297 --> 00:02:51.866
then it recedes.

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:54.793
This is the business cycle.

00:02:54.793 --> 00:02:58.093
Business cycle.

00:02:58.093 --> 00:03:00.465
The term "cycle" is a
little bit misleading.

00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:02.194
Whenever you think of a cycle,

00:03:02.194 --> 00:03:03.772
even the way I drew it,
it kind of looks like

00:03:03.772 --> 00:03:05.868
a nice well-defined pattern and every

00:03:05.868 --> 00:03:08.401
the same amount of years you're going

00:03:08.401 --> 00:03:11.300
up and down, it kind of implies that

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.862
it's predictable.

00:03:11.862 --> 00:03:13.459
The reality is that the business cycle

00:03:13.475 --> 00:03:14.697
is very unpredictable.

00:03:14.697 --> 00:03:15.954
And economists more than anyone

00:03:15.954 --> 00:03:18.017
have trouble predicting
the business cycle.

00:03:18.017 --> 00:03:19.616
When you think of a cycle,

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:22.432
it's not this nice, sinusoid pattern,

00:03:22.432 --> 00:03:24.335
it's much, much more unpredictable.

00:03:24.335 --> 00:03:27.329
It does fluxuate up and down above

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.866
a trend, but it's hard to predict.

00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:31.689
Hard to predict.

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.127
In general, you don't have the same

00:03:34.127 --> 00:03:35.873
period of time between every peak

00:03:35.873 --> 00:03:37.194
and every trough.

00:03:37.194 --> 00:03:39.264
That is why it is so hard to predict.

00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:42.102
There are different terms for different

00:03:42.102 --> 00:03:43.906
phases of the business cycle.

00:03:43.906 --> 00:03:45.649
I kind of used it just in describing

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:46.871
what was happening.

00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.455
Over here, where the economy is growing,

00:03:49.455 --> 00:03:51.383
so the economy is growing
from there to there,

00:03:51.383 --> 00:03:53.449
from there to there, we would call this

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.401
phase of the business cycle,

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:57.675
I'll highlight that in green,

00:03:57.675 --> 00:03:59.150
we would call that expansion

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.646
because the economy is
literally expanding.

00:04:02.646 --> 00:04:04.630
There's more goods and services being

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.727
produced in that economy.

00:04:05.727 --> 00:04:08.273
Then when, and we'll talk about the

00:04:08.273 --> 00:04:09.467
reasons why this is happening,

00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:12.183
and then when it starts to shrink,

00:04:12.183 --> 00:04:13.360
the economy starts to shrink,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.645
this right over here, or
you could call it "recedes",

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:18.316
if you think of it in a title analogy,

00:04:18.316 --> 00:04:22.320
this right over here is
called a "recession".

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.650
This right over here is a ...

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.929
So that purple part right over there,

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:28.720
is a recession.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.124
If a recession is bad enough,

00:04:31.124 --> 00:04:33.537
it is sometimes categorized
as a "depression",

00:04:33.537 --> 00:04:35.119
and there's different
categories for a depression;

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:36.020
there's the famous joke,'

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.984
"When your neighbor loses
his job, it's a recession.

00:04:38.984 --> 00:04:42.950
When you lose your job,
it is a depression."

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.453
The interesting thing
is we see this pattern

00:04:45.453 --> 00:04:47.943
happening, whether it's every 8 years,

00:04:47.943 --> 00:04:49.182
7 years, every 10 years,

00:04:49.182 --> 00:04:51.323
but we don't fully understand exactly

00:04:51.323 --> 00:04:53.116
why it's happening.

00:04:53.116 --> 00:04:54.460
What we're going to try to attempt to do

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.967
in the next few videos is look at models

00:04:56.967 --> 00:04:59.274
that do attempt to explain it.

00:04:59.274 --> 00:05:00.951
That's actually the whole purpose

00:05:00.951 --> 00:05:02.600
why we're going to study aggregate demand

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.276
and aggregate supply.

00:05:04.276 --> 00:05:06.105
With that said, I want you to view those

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:07.484
models with a huge grain of salt

00:05:07.484 --> 00:05:09.049
because those are, I would argue,

00:05:09.049 --> 00:05:11.198
overly simplified economic models

00:05:11.198 --> 00:05:13.420
that don't take into consideration

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.195
probably the most important factor

00:05:15.195 --> 00:05:16.938
in the economic cycle or any type

00:05:16.938 --> 00:05:20.416
of market cycle, and
that is human emotions.

00:05:20.416 --> 00:05:23.115
Human emotions.

00:05:23.115 --> 00:05:24.538
You might notice in most of our studies

00:05:24.538 --> 00:05:26.655
of economics so far, we haven't really

00:05:26.655 --> 00:05:28.344
talked a lot about human emotions or

00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:29.928
human's tendencies to extrapolate

00:05:29.928 --> 00:05:33.072
the recent past, or human's greed

00:05:33.072 --> 00:05:35.780
or risk of fear and greed,
and all of these things,

00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:37.003
that are very real things because

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.251
in traditional economics, they don't

00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:39.270
fit neatly into the models.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.169
There are new fields
in behavioral economics

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.898
and behavioral finance that do try to

00:05:44.898 --> 00:05:47.114
take into account things
like human emotions,

00:05:47.114 --> 00:05:48.573
but it's not going to make its way into

00:05:48.573 --> 00:05:50.469
the models that we're going to study

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:55.084
in aggregate supply and aggregate demand.

00:05:55.084 --> 00:05:56.377
The reason why I say human emotions,

00:05:56.377 --> 00:05:58.061
and because just based on,

00:05:58.061 --> 00:06:00.748
I spent I think it was six or seven years

00:06:00.748 --> 00:06:02.924
in markets while I was an analyst at

00:06:02.924 --> 00:06:05.326
an investment firm, it
was very clear to me

00:06:05.326 --> 00:06:07.525
that what drove market cycles and

00:06:07.525 --> 00:06:09.855
economic cycles to a large degree,

00:06:09.855 --> 00:06:12.095
was based on human emotions.

00:06:12.095 --> 00:06:13.796
That what you have happening over here

00:06:13.796 --> 00:06:16.001
is that the longer time,

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.427
once again, this isn't what you would

00:06:18.427 --> 00:06:20.366
classically learn in
your freshman economics

00:06:20.366 --> 00:06:21.446
class, I'm just going to say this ...

00:06:21.446 --> 00:06:23.422
Before we start studying the classical

00:06:23.422 --> 00:06:25.609
one, because I think this
does give a better sense

00:06:25.609 --> 00:06:28.780
of what's probably happening
in an economic cycle.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.450
Right over here when the expansions

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.862
phase is starting, people
are still skeptical.

00:06:32.862 --> 00:06:34.395
They've just been through this,

00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:36.446
people were getting laid off over here,

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:38.953
people were losing their jobs,

00:06:38.953 --> 00:06:40.275
people were having
trouble paying the bills,

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:43.458
companies had very low profits or maybe

00:06:43.458 --> 00:06:44.537
no profits at all,

00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:45.720
bankruptcies were occurring,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.446
so even though the economy is starting

00:06:47.446 --> 00:06:48.828
to expand right over here,

00:06:48.828 --> 00:06:50.108
people were kind of skeptical.

00:06:50.108 --> 00:06:51.988
In the recent past, they
remember all of this pain

00:06:51.988 --> 00:06:53.358
so they don't want to go out there

00:06:53.358 --> 00:06:54.272
and start spending money.

00:06:54.272 --> 00:06:55.357
They don't want to go out there

00:06:55.357 --> 00:06:56.390
and start investing.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.056
The further and further
they go from that point,

00:06:58.056 --> 00:06:59.702
and I'm just explaining the emotional

00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:02.618
aspect of the economic cycle which I think

00:07:02.618 --> 00:07:03.940
is probably the most powerful one,

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.125
the further and further
they go away from this,

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:07.401
they say maybe this is for real.

00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:08.790
Maybe this is really happening.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.722
Their memories of that pain are

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:12.265
more and more distant.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.613
Their memories of all the risk,

00:07:13.613 --> 00:07:14.998
the memories of all the layoffs

00:07:14.998 --> 00:07:16.060
and the bankruptcies become

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.968
more and more distant

00:07:16.968 --> 00:07:18.726
and then they become
more and more confident

00:07:18.726 --> 00:07:20.271
and more and more eager to invest.

00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:21.691
They start investing and

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:22.668
spending more and more,

00:07:22.668 --> 00:07:23.824
they start hiring,

00:07:23.824 --> 00:07:25.546
and because of all of that,

00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:27.226
they see fewer and fewer bankruptcies,

00:07:27.226 --> 00:07:28.433
fewer and fewer layoffs,

00:07:28.433 --> 00:07:29.592
hiring is starting to occur,

00:07:29.592 --> 00:07:31.519
people are getting more and more and more

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:33.831
optimistic, so the economy keeps growing.

00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:35.597
When you go to points right around here,

00:07:35.597 --> 00:07:38.472
it's been a long time since anyone really

00:07:38.472 --> 00:07:40.796
talked about major
layoffs and bankruptcies,

00:07:40.796 --> 00:07:44.534
and foreclosures and all the rest.

00:07:44.534 --> 00:07:47.000
People over here are feeling
super, super confident

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.238
and they're probably underplaying risk

00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:50.063
at this point.

00:07:50.063 --> 00:07:51.463
They're investing money,

00:07:51.463 --> 00:07:53.264
they're spending money
like there's no tomorrow

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:54.816
because they think there will always be

00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:55.937
good growth.

00:07:55.937 --> 00:07:56.938
They're essentially extrapulating

00:07:56.938 --> 00:07:58.399
the recent past.

00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:00.192
They think, and there's actually even

00:08:00.192 --> 00:08:03.127
been studies that show
that even economists,

00:08:03.127 --> 00:08:04.355
when you ask them at this point,

00:08:04.355 --> 00:08:06.608
what's the foreseeable future going

00:08:06.608 --> 00:08:08.374
to look like, they tend to extrapulate

00:08:08.374 --> 00:08:09.358
the recent past.

00:08:09.358 --> 00:08:10.596
They say the recent past, we were growing

00:08:10.596 --> 00:08:12.394
like that, so in the future
we will grow like that.

00:08:12.394 --> 00:08:14.324
At this point, essentially people are

00:08:14.324 --> 00:08:17.371
being too bullish, they're
being too optimistic

00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:19.582
and they're probably
misallocating investment.

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:23.323
As soon as things don't grow as people

00:08:23.323 --> 00:08:24.947
expect, they start getting
a little bit fearful,

00:08:24.947 --> 00:08:26.585
but they're still in denial at this point,

00:08:26.585 --> 00:08:27.927
they get a little bit more fearful,

00:08:27.927 --> 00:08:28.707
but here they say,

00:08:28.707 --> 00:08:29.984
"Oh my God, something is going on."

00:08:29.984 --> 00:08:31.782
They start panicking,
layoffs start happening,

00:08:31.782 --> 00:08:34.565
economy recedes and then we have

00:08:34.565 --> 00:08:36.160
the entire cycle again.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.939
To kind of understand
this emotional aspect

00:08:37.939 --> 00:08:40.254
of it, this is something I redrew.

00:08:40.254 --> 00:08:45.409
I redrew a graph that always gets kind of

00:08:45.409 --> 00:08:47.368
chain mailed around or sent around

00:08:47.368 --> 00:08:50.559
usually during every bubble when

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:52.077
people start becoming skeptical

00:08:52.077 --> 00:08:53.662
of the growth and economy.

00:08:53.662 --> 00:08:56.591
It traditionally refers
to stock market cycles.

00:08:56.591 --> 00:08:58.259
Stock market cycles are closely linked

00:08:58.259 --> 00:09:00.254
to actual economic cycles.

00:09:00.254 --> 00:09:02.154
I think these words really do capture

00:09:02.154 --> 00:09:04.788
the emotional sentiment of what's going on

00:09:04.788 --> 00:09:06.490
in either during the business cycle

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.188
or during a stock market cycle.

00:09:08.188 --> 00:09:11.729
Right when we're in the
middle of an expansion,

00:09:11.729 --> 00:09:13.938
people are pretty optimistic.

00:09:13.938 --> 00:09:15.600
A little bit further into it,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.653
people are feeling excitement.

00:09:16.653 --> 00:09:18.394
They're saying, "Maybe this
is a new type of thing.

00:09:18.394 --> 00:09:19.810
Maybe we're going to be
able to grow forever."

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.822
Then there's a thrill that people,

00:09:21.822 --> 00:09:23.202
just the last few years,

00:09:23.202 --> 00:09:24.829
all they do is they remember making money.

00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:26.135
They say, "I'm going to put all my money

00:09:26.135 --> 00:09:27.671
in the stock market. I'm going to start

00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:28.938
buying Pets.com and whatever else."

00:09:28.938 --> 00:09:30.941
Then there's euphoria.

00:09:30.941 --> 00:09:32.274
They're just like, "Wow, easy money.

00:09:32.274 --> 00:09:33.246
I don't have to work for a living.

00:09:33.246 --> 00:09:34.697
I can just keep flipping houses or

00:09:34.697 --> 00:09:37.947
buying stocks of Pets.com,"
or whatever else,

00:09:37.947 --> 00:09:38.885
day trading.

00:09:38.885 --> 00:09:40.644
Then all of a sudden, you have some signs

00:09:40.644 --> 00:09:42.202
that maybe there was some bad investment,

00:09:42.202 --> 00:09:44.125
that people's investments weren't turning

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.404
out as good as they expected.

00:09:45.404 --> 00:09:48.584
People get a little
anxious, but then as you

00:09:48.584 --> 00:09:50.455
still foresee this, they start denying it.

00:09:50.455 --> 00:09:53.489
Some people say, "Are we
in a recession thing?"

00:09:53.489 --> 00:09:55.118
"No, no, no, no, we're not in a recession.

00:09:55.118 --> 00:09:56.527
It's been so long since
we were in a recession.

00:09:56.527 --> 00:09:57.716
Things are different this time.

00:09:57.716 --> 00:09:59.085
The internet changes everything.

00:09:59.085 --> 00:10:00.630
Housing never goes down."

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.214
But then as it continues,

00:10:02.214 --> 00:10:03.639
as the recession really does continue,

00:10:03.639 --> 00:10:05.533
they start to get fearful,
they start saying,

00:10:05.533 --> 00:10:06.786
"Maybe this is something going on,"

00:10:06.786 --> 00:10:08.865
then desperate, then panic,

00:10:08.865 --> 00:10:10.272
and that's when people really,

00:10:10.272 --> 00:10:11.480
if you think of a stock market cycle,

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.225
really start to sell in the case of a

00:10:14.225 --> 00:10:15.854
regular business cycle,

00:10:15.854 --> 00:10:17.189
they start to maybe underspend,

00:10:17.189 --> 00:10:19.017
they start to really hoard things,

00:10:19.017 --> 00:10:20.949
then capitulation ...
This is when they say, '

00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:22.599
"Things are just bad. They're never going

00:10:22.599 --> 00:10:23.800
to get any better," and then they become

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.537
despondent and eventually,
you could even say,

00:10:25.537 --> 00:10:28.067
emotionally people start getting depressed

00:10:28.067 --> 00:10:29.923
because they say it's been so long since

00:10:29.923 --> 00:10:32.072
we've felt all of these good emotions

00:10:32.072 --> 00:10:33.240
right over here.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.793
As any good investors will tell you,

00:10:35.793 --> 00:10:37.358
"This is the best time to invest."

00:10:37.358 --> 00:10:40.110
"This is the worst time to invest."

00:10:40.218 --> 00:10:42.192
Even though there's maybe a little bit

00:10:42.192 --> 00:10:43.476
of growth right over here,

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.193
it's been so long since we've experienced

00:10:45.193 --> 00:10:47.062
all of these emotions.
People are depressed,

00:10:47.062 --> 00:10:48.678
but then as the growth continues,

00:10:48.678 --> 00:10:50.155
They start to feel
hopeful, a little relieved,

00:10:50.155 --> 00:10:52.105
they say, "At least we're not getting

00:10:52.105 --> 00:10:53.412
worse and worse," and then you get

00:10:53.412 --> 00:10:54.736
back to optimism again.

00:10:54.736 --> 00:10:56.662
So keep this in mind because

00:10:56.662 --> 00:10:58.660
in my mind, the emotions really are

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.403
the main factor that are playing in

00:11:00.403 --> 00:11:02.739
either stock market
cycles or economic cycles.

00:11:02.739 --> 00:11:05.494
We we study it kind of classically

00:11:05.494 --> 00:11:07.288
in an economics class, we're going to take

00:11:07.288 --> 00:11:10.165
human emotions a bit out of the picture,

00:11:10.165 --> 00:11:12.063
which is a little bit artificial because

00:11:12.063 --> 00:11:14.967
they might be the most
important part of the picture.
