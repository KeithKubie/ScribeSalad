00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:00.784
- [Voiceover] In this video

00:00:00.784 --> 00:00:02.463
we're gonna do an example problem,

00:00:02.463 --> 00:00:04.645
where we calculate in internal energy

00:00:04.645 --> 00:00:07.693
and also calculate pressure volume work.

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:11.861
So, we know the external pressure

00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:15.464
is 1.01 times ten to the 5th pascal,

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:18.694
and our system is some balloon,

00:00:18.694 --> 00:00:20.915
let's say it's a balloon of argon gas,

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.362
and initially our gas has
a volume of 2.3 liters,

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:30.029
and then it transfers,

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.029
the gas transfers 485 joules

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:38.597
of energy as heat to the surroundings.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.453
Once it does that,

00:00:45.453 --> 00:00:47.407
the final volume of our system,

00:00:47.407 --> 00:00:50.689
is 2.05 liters.

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:51.908
And we're assuming here,

00:00:51.908 --> 00:00:54.809
that the moles of gas didn't change.

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.767
The question we're gonna answer is,

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:03.238
for this process, what is delta U?

00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:06.355
So, what the change in
internal energy for our system?

00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:10.808
We can use the first law of
thermodynamics to answer this.

00:01:10.808 --> 00:01:14.140
The first law tells us that
the change in internal energy,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.621
delta U, is equal to the work done,

00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:21.849
plus the heat transfer.

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:23.476
Before we plug any numbers in here,

00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:25.849
the first thing I wanna do is make sure

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:28.816
I have a good idea of what
signs everything should be.

00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:29.989
I think that's one of the trickiest things

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.816
in these kind of problems.

00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:35.027
So here, since our
system transferred energy

00:01:35.027 --> 00:01:37.291
to the surroundings and
not the other way around,

00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:39.590
Q should be negative,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.029
because when your system transfers energy

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:43.189
to the surroundings,

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.919
then it's internal energy should go down.

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:47.800
Work on the other hand,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.255
since V two is less than V one,

00:01:51.255 --> 00:01:52.988
the volume of our system went down,

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:54.428
which means the surroundings

00:01:54.428 --> 00:01:56.898
had to do work on the gas

00:01:56.898 --> 00:01:58.729
to get the volume to decrease.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.410
We would expect if the surroundings

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.151
did work on our system,

00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:04.056
that would increase the internal energy.

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:07.631
So that means the work
done here is positive.

00:02:07.631 --> 00:02:09.411
We can also calculate work

00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:11.385
because we know the external pressure,

00:02:11.385 --> 00:02:13.126
we know it's constant,

00:02:13.126 --> 00:02:15.915
and work can be calculated

00:02:15.915 --> 00:02:19.635
as the external pressure
times the change in volume,

00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:20.890
and we know both of those things,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.277
we know the external pressure

00:02:22.277 --> 00:02:25.545
and we know the initial and final volumes.

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.252
So if we start plugging that in,

00:02:28.602 --> 00:02:30.720
we get that delta U is equal

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.488
to negative 485 joules,

00:02:35.597 --> 00:02:38.511
so that's our heat, we know
it should have a negative sign

00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:41.576
because the heat was
transferred to the surroundings.

00:02:41.576 --> 00:02:44.141
So negative 485 joules,

00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:47.282
minus, we should have
a negative sign there,

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.230
minus the external pressure 1.01,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.271
times ten to the 5th pascals,

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.699
so that's our external pressure
times our change in volume.

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.139
So that's our final pressure,

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.039
2.05 liters, minus our initial pressure,

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:07.972
which is 2.30 liters.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.356
We could at this point be like," okay,

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.518
"we figured it all out,

00:03:11.518 --> 00:03:12.900
"we just have to stick
all of these numbers

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.137
"in a calculator and we're done,"

00:03:15.137 --> 00:03:19.384
and that's probably what my
first instinct would often be,

00:03:19.384 --> 00:03:21.644
but there's one more
thing that we should check

00:03:21.644 --> 00:03:23.340
before we actually plug in the numbers

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.487
and have a party.

00:03:25.487 --> 00:03:26.937
And that's our units,

00:03:26.937 --> 00:03:31.035
we have our heat, in terms of joules,

00:03:31.035 --> 00:03:33.555
we probably want our
change in internal energy

00:03:33.555 --> 00:03:35.738
in terms of joules too.

00:03:35.738 --> 00:03:36.922
On this other side,

00:03:36.922 --> 00:03:38.582
we're calculating our work here,

00:03:38.582 --> 00:03:43.435
and we have pascals, so pascals times,

00:03:43.435 --> 00:03:46.141
so we have joules, and joules,

00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:48.562
we have pascals times liters,

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:49.860
so then the question is, okay,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.860
we're doing joules minus
pascals, times liters,

00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:59.063
we need to make sure that
whatever we calculate here,

00:03:59.063 --> 00:04:02.080
in terms of work, also
has units of joules.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.937
Otherwise, we will be, we'll
be subtracting two things

00:04:04.937 --> 00:04:06.364
that don't have the same unit,

00:04:06.364 --> 00:04:08.246
and that's bad.
(giggles)

00:04:08.246 --> 00:04:11.021
We'll have to do some sort
of unit conversion first.

00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:14.340
So, let's just double check
that pascals times liters,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.338
will give us joules.

00:04:16.338 --> 00:04:17.742
So the way I did this,

00:04:17.742 --> 00:04:21.922
is by converting everything
to the same units.

00:04:21.922 --> 00:04:22.978
So, if you take joules,

00:04:22.978 --> 00:04:24.337
which is already SI units,

00:04:24.337 --> 00:04:26.264
we can actually simplify it more,

00:04:26.264 --> 00:04:28.795
in terms of other SI units.

00:04:28.795 --> 00:04:30.794
So, a joule is equal

00:04:30.794 --> 00:04:35.774
to one kilogram meters squared

00:04:35.774 --> 00:04:36.929
per second squared.

00:04:37.825 --> 00:04:39.984
So, joules is equal to, one joule is equal

00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:42.847
to one kilogram meters
squared over seconds squared.

00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:47.542
One pascal, pascals are also in terms of,

00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:48.982
are also SI units,

00:04:48.982 --> 00:04:50.440
and if we convert pascals

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.605
to kilograms, meters, and seconds,

00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:53.935
we get that one pascal

00:04:53.935 --> 00:04:58.673
is one kilogram per meter seconds squared.

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.585
What this tells us is that,

00:05:01.585 --> 00:05:05.116
we have to multiply
this by units of volume,

00:05:05.116 --> 00:05:07.163
and whatever we multiply it by

00:05:07.163 --> 00:05:10.089
should give us units of joules.

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:11.726
So, what we need to do here,

00:05:11.726 --> 00:05:15.273
is convert our liters to meters cubed.

00:05:17.455 --> 00:05:18.742
And if we do that,

00:05:18.742 --> 00:05:22.840
everything is in terms of
kilograms, meters, and seconds,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.511
this meters cancels out with one of these,

00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:27.761
and we end up with one
kilogram meters squared

00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:29.916
per second squared on both sides.

00:05:29.916 --> 00:05:32.916
So then, everything is in terms of joules.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.566
That's not the only way
that you could've made sure

00:05:34.566 --> 00:05:36.458
that the units made sense.

00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:38.780
You could've converted
them to something else,

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.080
but basically you just have to make sure

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.457
that all of the units you're
using in your equation

00:05:43.457 --> 00:05:45.247
match each other if
you're going to add them

00:05:45.247 --> 00:05:46.257
or subtract them.

00:05:46.257 --> 00:05:48.507
All of this is to say
that we need to make sure

00:05:48.507 --> 00:05:50.999
we convert liters to meters cubed,

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:54.406
so that everything works
out in terms of joules.

00:05:54.406 --> 00:05:55.184
So if we do that,

00:05:55.184 --> 00:05:57.977
we get that minus 485 joules,

00:05:59.376 --> 00:06:03.167
1.01 times ten to the 5th pascals,

00:06:04.241 --> 00:06:07.558
times negative .25 liters,

00:06:07.558 --> 00:06:09.995
which is the change in
volume, which is negative,

00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:10.800
the volume went down,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.797
so the change in volume
should be negative,

00:06:12.797 --> 00:06:16.303
and then we have to
add one more thing here

00:06:16.303 --> 00:06:19.816
to convert our liters to meters cubed.

00:06:21.643 --> 00:06:24.158
So, one liter is equal to one,

00:06:25.478 --> 00:06:29.156
ten to the minus third, meters cubed.

00:06:30.328 --> 00:06:32.127
So now our liters cancel out,

00:06:32.127 --> 00:06:35.960
and pascals times meters
cubed, gives us joules.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.874
So that gives us, that delta U,

00:06:38.874 --> 00:06:40.279
or change in internal energy,

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:43.599
is negative 485 joules,

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:45.596
then if we plug this
all into our calculator

00:06:45.596 --> 00:06:46.919
to calculate the work,

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:51.919
we get positive 25.25 joules.

00:06:53.457 --> 00:06:55.999
So if we add our heat and our work here,

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:57.821
we get that the overall change

00:06:57.821 --> 00:07:00.250
in internal energy for this process

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.463
is negative 460 joules.

00:07:04.636 --> 00:07:06.378
So, the key things to remember here,

00:07:06.378 --> 00:07:07.736
for this kind of problem,

00:07:07.736 --> 00:07:10.802
is to double check your
signs for work and heat,

00:07:10.802 --> 00:07:13.238
and also to make sure
all of your units match.
