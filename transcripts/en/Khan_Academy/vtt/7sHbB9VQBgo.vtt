00:00:00.392 --> 00:00:01.892
- [Voiceover] So, grammarians,
if you're a native

00:00:01.892 --> 00:00:06.385
English speaker, the phrase
French old white house

00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:09.781
might seem a little weird to
you, if you're not a native

00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:12.641
English speaker it might
not, and this is something

00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:15.584
that I didn't really know about
before I started preparing

00:00:15.584 --> 00:00:19.958
to teach this course, is that
there is a specific order

00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.049
that adjectives go in in English.

00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:24.747
This is something that
I think we just pick up

00:00:24.747 --> 00:00:27.115
as English speakers but if
you didn't grow up speaking

00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:30.965
English it gets a little tricky sometimes.

00:00:30.965 --> 00:00:33.995
So the question is, in order
to make this seem right,

00:00:33.995 --> 00:00:37.496
what order do you put these adjectives in?

00:00:42.546 --> 00:00:44.326
That's near about as I can reckon it.

00:00:44.326 --> 00:00:49.326
Making this into old white French house.

00:00:57.946 --> 00:01:02.025
Because there is an order
and it goes like this.

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:07.025
Determiner, opinion, size,
age, shape, color, origin,

00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:19.335
material, purpose, or
for short dosa scomp.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.782
Dosa scomp. Aw.

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:25.557
Okay, that's actually kind of a thing.

00:01:25.557 --> 00:01:30.557
So a dosa is a South Indian
flat bread, and a scomp,

00:01:33.237 --> 00:01:37.103
I'm gonna say is a word for eating.

00:01:37.103 --> 00:01:40.274
It's not a word, it's a made
up word, but dosa scomp.

00:01:40.274 --> 00:01:44.494
Sounds like scarf to me.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.664
Or chomp.

00:01:48.684 --> 00:01:51.743
Both of those are verbs that denote
eating, as well as scarf

00:01:51.743 --> 00:01:54.616
being a garment, so dosa scomp.

00:01:54.616 --> 00:01:57.263
I just want you to imagine
sitting down to a delicious

00:01:57.263 --> 00:02:00.346
South Indian meal and
scomping on some dosas.

00:02:00.346 --> 00:02:01.407
So dosa scomp.

00:02:01.407 --> 00:02:06.407
Determiner, and that's
words like the or an.

00:02:07.364 --> 00:02:10.464
Opinion, this is when you're
describing something there are

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:15.464
certain descriptors that not
everyone would agree with.

00:02:16.264 --> 00:02:20.653
So if you're looking at a
piece of black metal, everyone

00:02:20.653 --> 00:02:22.481
would be able to agree that it is black.

00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:26.347
But if you think it's cool
looking or ugly looking,

00:02:26.347 --> 00:02:28.455
you know, everything that anyone
could conceivably disagree

00:02:28.455 --> 00:02:31.083
about, that's an opinion.

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:35.176
So, cool for example,
that would be an opinion.

00:02:35.176 --> 00:02:40.176
Size, so the cool, big,
old, square, black,.

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:51.129
And origin usually can be where it's from.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.943
So let's say Texan.

00:02:54.943 --> 00:02:57.662
And then we have materials,
let's say leather, cause leather

00:02:57.662 --> 00:02:59.525
can be black, and the purpose.

00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:02.259
This is where we would use
what's called a participle

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:06.298
or a gerundive to determine
what the thing is for.

00:03:06.298 --> 00:03:09.939
So if we were talking
about a lawnmower that you

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.939
ride around on, that's
called a riding mower.

00:03:17.672 --> 00:03:22.113
And the last thing here
is the thing itself.

00:03:22.113 --> 00:03:24.984
So we're looking at, so this
thing is cool, big, old,

00:03:24.984 --> 00:03:29.793
square, black, Texan, leather,
riding mower, but frankly

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:33.309
in most normal English
sentences you'll probably never

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:38.309
going to use more than
three adjectives to describe

00:03:38.377 --> 00:03:40.677
a given thing.

00:03:40.677 --> 00:03:43.480
Like old white French house.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.379
Now sometimes, you might
find yourself using more than

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.516
one adjective that fits
into the same category.

00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:55.309
So you might say the exciting,
unparalleled green dragon.

00:03:58.318 --> 00:04:01.870
And you'll notice I put a comma
there, because when you use

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.870
two adjectives from the same
category, so two opinions,

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.014
exciting and unparalleled,
you wanna separate them with

00:04:11.014 --> 00:04:15.071
a comma, but generally if
you're just scooting down the

00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:18.572
dosa scomp, old white French
house, you don't need to

00:04:18.572 --> 00:04:23.135
separate these non-coordinate
adjectives from each other.

00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:25.956
And we'll get more into
commas in punctuation section,

00:04:25.956 --> 00:04:30.159
but for now, all you need
to remember is dosa scomp.

00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:34.227
And if you've never had a
dosa, I strongly urge you to

00:04:34.227 --> 00:04:36.874
look up recipes online or go
to a South Indian restaurant

00:04:36.874 --> 00:04:40.027
and make and eat this delicious food.

00:04:40.027 --> 00:04:41.994
And then, you're just
gonna scomp on some dosas.

00:04:41.994 --> 00:04:44.920
So determiner, opinion, size, age, dosa.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.920
Shape, color, origin, material,
purpose, and then the thing.

00:04:50.127 --> 00:04:53.731
That's the order that
adjectives go in in English.

00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:55.837
Why is this? I have no idea.

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:58.636
You know sometimes language can be really,

00:04:58.636 --> 00:05:00.681
the word I tend to use is arbitrary.

00:05:00.681 --> 00:05:02.841
You can call it random, if you like.

00:05:02.841 --> 00:05:06.951
This is just the way that
we arrived at this order,

00:05:06.951 --> 00:05:10.521
it's just basically through
random chance of convention.

00:05:10.521 --> 00:05:12.852
And what seems to sound right.

00:05:12.852 --> 00:05:14.874
And what sounds right for
English isn't always what sounds

00:05:14.874 --> 00:05:16.161
right for other languages.

00:05:16.161 --> 00:05:18.235
For example, the way we're
using adjectives here,

00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:21.353
we're always putting them
to the left of whatever they

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:23.982
modify, the exciting,
unparalleled green dragon.

00:05:23.982 --> 00:05:27.587
It's all to the left, it's
all old white French house.

00:05:27.587 --> 00:05:30.564
It's all on this one side of it.

00:05:30.564 --> 00:05:34.013
And other languages don't
do that necessarily.

00:05:34.013 --> 00:05:36.922
So when you're trying to just
throw a bunch of adjectives

00:05:36.922 --> 00:05:40.875
together on the left side of
the noun, this is the order.

00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:43.120
Just remember dosa scomp.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.764
And that's how adjective
order works in English.

00:05:46.764 --> 00:05:47.944
You can learn anything.

00:05:47.944 --> 00:05:49.944
David out.
