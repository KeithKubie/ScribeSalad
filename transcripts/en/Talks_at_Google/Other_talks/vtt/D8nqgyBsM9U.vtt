GEORGE MUSSER: Thanks
for coming out today

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.360
to talk about some basic physics
and some very interesting

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.790
phenomena in that area.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:07.970
My name is George Musser.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.990
I'm a contributing editor at
"Scientific American" magazine.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.200
I was before the senior
editor for space, science,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.720
and fundamental physics
at that magazine

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.550
for I guess it was
something like 15 years.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.330
Actually, I have an
undergraduate degree,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.180
in double E, in math, and the
very first program I wrote

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.560
was not "Hello, World" it was
actually in machine language

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.780
using actually hexadecimal.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.840
I was like 10 years old.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.780
This was back in 1980 or
so, and I made an LED blink.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.980
I was so proud of myself.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.690
Today, you can do that in
two seconds on an Arduino

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.860
or whatever.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.610
My graduate work was
on the planet Venus.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.670
So if you have any
questions about Venus

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.240
and you're willing to put
up with information that's

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.980
20 years old, I'm
happy to oblige you

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.180
in the Q and A session.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.000
So the phenomena I'd like to get
at today is called non-locality

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.050
or as the title suggests,
spooky action at a distance.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.000
That's the somewhat
derogatory appellation

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.830
that Einstein gave to this
phenomena back in the 1940s,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.280
actually.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.000
So before I get into some
concrete physics about it,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.540
I wanted to spiral
in on the topic

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.734
and give you some just
general remarks about it.

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:20.650
And then we'll get
progressively more specific

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.480
over the course of the talk.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.590
The basic idea of
non-locality is

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.950
you can have a connection
between different things.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.730
Something here can be connected
to something over there.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.140
And the nature of the
connection can vary,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.220
but, in some way or other,
the fates of those objects

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.150
are bound together.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.680
In a sense, to touch one
is to touch the other.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.930
You can have an effect
propagating from one

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.570
to the other.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.400
And obviously, physics, the
physical sciences in general,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.480
is a story of
connections in the world.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.820
That's what physics tries to do.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.600
But what's unusual about this
particular type of connection

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.750
is there doesn't seem
to be a connect door.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.090
There's no rope.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.564
There's no handcuffs binding
the two things together.

00:02:05.564 --> 00:02:07.230
There is none of the
standard mechanisms

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.000
of physics like forces,
waves, intermediary particles.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.010
These things are acting on
each other at a distance,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.540
hence the name of
the phenomenon,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.590
or phenomena, actually.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.530
As we'll see, this is
a variety of phenomena.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.880
And the question is,
what is up with that?

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.630
Like, what could be explaining
this weird connection

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.080
without connector?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.730
So spiraling a little bit
more, getting a little bit

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.750
more detailed, usually
in a laboratory,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.500
the objects that
are being connected

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.800
are subatomic particles.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.437
They don't have
to be, by the way,

00:02:41.437 --> 00:02:43.770
particles are easy to manipulate
and the principles that

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.499
govern them are quite pure.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.790
They're not confounded by
the complexity of the system,

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.290
for example.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.400
But in principle, you could
take these two bottles

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.108
and connect them.

00:02:51.108 --> 00:02:56.980
I mean, anything can be
connected through this process.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.526
So what you do is you
might create the particles

00:03:01.526 --> 00:03:03.650
at the same time, through
the same kind of process,

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.360
so they are connected by
virtue of a common origin.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.587
Or you might have
them already created,

00:03:09.587 --> 00:03:12.170
bring them together, bang them
together, interact in some way,

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.000
and they develop this
peculiar connection

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.690
whose nature I'll elaborate on.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.326
And typically in
these experiments,

00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:21.450
you might hold onto one--
there may be two of them,

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.075
you might hold onto
one of them and you

00:03:23.075 --> 00:03:25.370
give the other to your
friend who then goes off

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.840
to the other side of the
laboratory or the city

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.040
or the solar system
or the galactic empire

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.960
or wherever they may go with
their own individual particle.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.300
You then manipulate your
particle in some way.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.140
You measure it, really.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.720
It gives some kind of response.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.900
Your friend does the same
to his or her own particle

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.940
and it gives some response.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.570
And they're the same response.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.980
That's the nature of
this non-locality.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.600
The particles are remaining
connected without a connector.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.980
They remain coordinated
without any kind of-- seeming,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.650
at least, that there's no kind
of mechanism to coordinate

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.050
them.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.515
So this is-- if you had
to give something that's

00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:06.140
as close to Harry Potter as you
can imagine, this is really it,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.515
at least in
contemporary science.

00:04:07.515 --> 00:04:10.917
This is the closest
we've got to magic.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.250
A very subtle form of magic,
as I'll come back to later.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.750
It's not the kind
of thing you could

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.970
use to apparate or levitate
things or transmute them

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.445
or whatever.

00:04:18.445 --> 00:04:20.320
By the word magical,
just means that it's not

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.892
explicable in our current
physical framework

00:04:22.892 --> 00:04:24.350
and our current
theories don't seem

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.280
to have an explanation for it.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.040
Now this synchronicity between
these distant particles,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.480
these distant events of
measurement of particles,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.820
is something Einstein
was greatly troubled by.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.340
Goes back to the very,
very earliest days

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.600
of quantum mechanics, actually
just over a century ago now.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.000
And he was actually much
more worried about it

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.930
than almost any other
aspect of quantum theory.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.832
And people talk a lot
about God not playing dice

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.790
with the universe and
Einstein was very worried

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.650
about the indeterminism or
randomness of quantum theory.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.550
But non-locality is
actually above that

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.420
in his list of problems
with the theory,

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.660
or conundrums with the theory.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.160
It's actually the
only thing he ever

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.040
wrote a paper about, which
indicates the level of concern

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.820
that he had whereas
randomness was just

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.890
something he complained about
to his friends over dinner.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.284
Now if I had been giving
this talk 10 years ago,

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:19.950
let's say, I would
actually be done now.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.900
I could take your
questions because that's

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.970
as far as people could get.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.220
They knew there was a mystery.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.136
There actually were
technological applications

00:05:28.136 --> 00:05:29.310
for it.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.980
But there was no understanding
in any kind of detail.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.030
There's no explanation of it.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.060
And the job of physics is really
to naturalize the supernatural,

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.580
is to domesticate
magic and pull it

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.040
into the realm of
rational explanation.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.090
And my book is kind
of a meager attempt

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.750
to do that, to give a
naturalistic explanation

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.795
for what seems, on the
face of it, supernatural,

00:05:51.795 --> 00:05:53.450
this non-locality.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.200
And that explanation will
come, as I'll elaborate on,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.080
in the form of a
failure of space.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.950
Spacetime, more generally,
but I really focus on space,

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.440
this concept of space, which
in any kind of basic physics

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.590
is taken as this substrate, is
taken as the fundamental stage

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.837
on which the world takes
place and everything's

00:06:14.837 --> 00:06:15.920
phrased in terms of space.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.390
The xyz and the t, if you have
time in there, coordinates,

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.087
distances, sizes, everything
we talk about in physics

00:06:22.087 --> 00:06:23.420
is spatial in some way or other.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.550
And non-locality seems
to be undermining

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.740
that, seems to be
suggesting perhaps

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.790
there's a deeper level
that underlies space.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.970
At least that's the proposition
that I'll put forward today.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.450
That deeper level
might indicate a need

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.770
for a unified theory of physics.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.220
So it's essential to that
whole quest for unified theory.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.840
It might actually already
be in our theories.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.256
We don't really
need to unify them

00:06:44.256 --> 00:06:46.196
but it's there not
fully appreciated.

00:06:46.196 --> 00:06:48.320
So there's different ways,
but in some way or other

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.860
you need something to
underlie, at least in this way

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.540
of thinking, to underlie space.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.990
So let me again, continuing
my tour of the subject,

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.010
spiraling in on it.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.730
Let me dissect the
idea of non-locality.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.589
And to do that, I need to
tell you what locality is.

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:07.380
What am I negating?

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.490
What's the non in front of?

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.140
And the word locality has,
in physics and philosophy,

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.230
different associated meanings.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.710
It's really kind of synonymous
actually with spatial.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.168
When you see the
word locality, you

00:07:20.168 --> 00:07:22.340
can almost substitute
in your head spatial.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.730
The two ideas are
closely related

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.188
but locality is a
bit more specific

00:07:25.188 --> 00:07:27.611
about what it
means to be spatial

00:07:27.611 --> 00:07:28.860
and it has different meanings.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.520
So meaning number one is
things have locations.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.520
Physical things, at
least, exist in places.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.370
You have a quality of
being localized to a place.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.780
If you can't point to something,
a physical thing at least,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.329
and say here it is, it doesn't
really exist, in a sense.

00:07:49.329 --> 00:07:51.620
If, well, teacher wants to
know where your homework is.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.130
I don't know where
it is, nowhere.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.921
It's tantamount to
saying it doesn't exist.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.740
Second, a second
important meaning

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:04.804
is that things in different
places are different things.

00:08:04.804 --> 00:08:05.720
They have an autonomy.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.790
They have an autonomous
existence to them.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.476
That's actually what
we mean by thing.

00:08:10.476 --> 00:08:12.350
I mean, what does the
word thing really mean?

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.320
It means a localized
part of the universe.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.490
A little piece that you
can carve out and say,

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.329
ah, there's an
identifiable thing.

00:08:20.329 --> 00:08:22.620
Has an existence that's
independent of the other things

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.380
that the world consists of.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.760
Third, and this is the
one that people focus on

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.530
in terms of the theory,
things in different places,

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:37.700
so hence, different things,
are isolated from one another.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.650
They have a measure
of isolation.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.500
They, of course,
interact with one another

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.730
but they always interact through
the space that separates them.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.240
So they might
interact by actually

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.073
moving through the space
that separates them

00:08:49.073 --> 00:08:51.710
and banging into each other,
called contact action.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.950
That's the original sense
of locality going back

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.090
to the ancient Greeks.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.940
Contact action where atoms
would come together and hit.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.386
But in modern physics,
we also have waves,

00:09:01.386 --> 00:09:03.510
we have intermediary
particles, other ways for them

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.301
to interact, but it's
always through space.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.239
Now the need to
interact through space

00:09:12.239 --> 00:09:14.030
tells you, actually,
a lot just on its own.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.799
It's your basic almost
metaphysical concept.

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:18.840
It tells you, for instance,
that the interactions

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.550
between objects is attenuated
by the distance between them.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.470
So if I double the
distance between them,

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.619
in a lot of force
laws it's a one

00:09:26.619 --> 00:09:27.785
over r squared relationship.

00:09:27.785 --> 00:09:31.160
It goes down by
a factor of four.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.120
Sometimes it's actually
not such a simple force

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.856
law, like with springs,
but in some way or other,

00:09:36.856 --> 00:09:38.480
increasing the distance
between objects

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.660
makes it more difficult
for them to interact.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.610
It introduces a time
lag between them

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.560
because things have to have time
to get from one to the other,

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.290
and that is limited
by the speed of light

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.000
in our current theories.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.100
That's really the role
the speed of light plays.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.740
It's actually not the
speed of light, that

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.906
just was a historical thing.

00:09:55.906 --> 00:09:58.010
It's the speed of,
the maximal speed

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.460
of interaction between
objects in the universe.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.670
So this idea of
non-locality and spaciality

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.970
is really fundamental to our
entire intellectual framework.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.620
It's not just about physics,
it's all the natural sciences.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.500
And it goes all the
way back to the sources

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.370
of natural philosophy
in the ancient world.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.766
Ancient China and ancient
Greece both articulated

00:10:21.766 --> 00:10:23.515
in different ways a
principle of locality.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.770
And I mean, you think about
it, what does science do?

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.926
What is the purpose of
basic science, at least?

00:10:31.926 --> 00:10:33.550
It's to create
narratives of the world.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:37.240
Things exist at certain
places, they move around,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.376
they interact.

00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:40.000
And you can break
down any-- in theory,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.310
you can break down any
process into that kind of step

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.340
by step causal narrative and
that is dependent on the fact

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.330
that we have this
idea of locality.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.020
It also has a
methodological importance.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.310
So the world is so
big and I am so small.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.610
I can't possibly comprehend
the entire universe.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.540
What do I do?

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.730
I break it down.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.755
I look at this piece.

00:11:02.755 --> 00:11:03.630
I look at this piece.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.755
I look at this other piece.

00:11:04.755 --> 00:11:07.720
I see how they interact,
that's usually the hard part.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.210
And I can do that because the
world is divisible into pieces.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.710
The world lets us understand it.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.190
That's actually
extremely profound

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.160
and we're lucky that
that's the case.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.940
Probably we couldn't even
exist if that weren't the case.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.860
We certainly couldn't
exist as rational beings

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.620
unless the universe were
explicable in some way.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.670
And that's something
Einstein also commented on.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.290
And finally, just
let me throw up

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:33.370
one of the many philosophical
implications of locality,

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.160
and it has to do with
our personal identity.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.680
So what does it mean
to be an individual?

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.460
Well, it means that each of
us has our own integrity.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.990
We occupy a certain position, a
little volume of the universe,

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.130
and that ultimately is
underpinned and guaranteed

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.970
by the principle of locality.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.150
Because anything that affects
me has to pass through the space

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.270
to get to me, has to
actually pass through my skin

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.280
or enter me somehow.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.317
And if that weren't the case,
if things could just reach out,

00:12:02.317 --> 00:12:04.150
if something could just
reach into your mind

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.540
and control your
thoughts, well, you'd

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.710
begin to question whether
your thoughts were your own.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.751
Your whole sense of
personhood would be violated.

00:12:09.751 --> 00:12:12.030
So your sense of personhood
depends on this concept

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.690
of locality, as well.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.250
So I just bring
all this up really

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.160
as a way to demonstrate
the mystery,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.760
the depth of the mystery
that non-locality

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.514
is going to represent.

00:12:23.514 --> 00:12:25.680
God knows, physics talks
about lots of weird things.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.890
We've got dark energy,
matter, any number

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.236
of things from quantum physics.

00:12:29.236 --> 00:12:30.110
I mean, just name it.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.490
Even turbulence, I mean,
so many things in the world

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.084
are just plain weird.

00:12:34.084 --> 00:12:35.250
That's the fun of the world.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.874
Thank God, it's weird,
otherwise, like,

00:12:36.874 --> 00:12:38.250
why are we here?

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.920
But locality is weirder.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.060
It's the uber weirdness.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.050
It's the thing that burrows into
the very foundations of science

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:48.360
and makes us question
the whole enterprise.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.755
OK, on the one hand,
just to sum up quickly,

00:12:53.755 --> 00:12:55.380
the world has this
quality of locality.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.690
Things have positions,
they interact in space.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:58.500
We're individuals.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.410
Science can partition the world.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.150
And so locality does seem to
be an important characteristic

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.670
of, at least, the observable
world, the world that we

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.140
inhabit in a daily life.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.600
But if you look
more closely, or do

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.390
special analysis of
our current theories,

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:20.575
you see this non-locality, and
it comes out in different ways.

00:13:20.575 --> 00:13:21.950
I'll discuss a
couple of the ways

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.620
today, but let me
just kind of survey

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.084
a few of the different ones.

00:13:25.084 --> 00:13:26.500
And what's interesting
is actually

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.750
there are many different ones.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.560
Not just the one
Einstein originally

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.030
worried about, about
subatomic particles.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.180
There's also a lot of
different kinds of locality

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.962
having to do with black holes.

00:13:35.962 --> 00:13:38.170
That goes back to the work
really of Stephen Hawking.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.404
And you're probably all aware
of this impending announcement,

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:43.070
one hopes if at least,
rumors are right,

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.191
about gravitational
waves, and the importance

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:47.190
of that announcement
probably is it will tell us

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.200
a lot about black holes.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.200
So black holes are going
to be in the news a lot

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.460
in the coming weeks, at least,
if the rumors are correct.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.710
The workings of gravity
also have a subtle form

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.860
of non-locality in
them, which is ironic

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.110
because Einstein invented
his theory of gravity,

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.917
general relativity, to banish
the Newtonian law on locality

00:14:05.917 --> 00:14:06.750
that had been there.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.300
I can come back to that later.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.841
But this is something
that was really

00:14:09.841 --> 00:14:12.600
only appreciated in the 1990s.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.300
Cosmology, early universe
observations, Big Bang, all

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.930
that, there seems to be,
though it's more controversial,

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:24.050
some kind of non-locality
there, as well that's weird.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.730
So in these different ways
you get different violations

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.580
of those principles I
mentioned earlier of locality.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.340
So one example is in some of
these forms of non-locality,

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.150
the things at different
places are not

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.870
isolated from one another.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.680
You can actually affect
this one and, boom,

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.620
instantaneously affect
the other one over there.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.439
The effect jumps across as
if going through hyperspace

00:14:44.439 --> 00:14:44.980
or something.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.620
More subtly, the world can
have holistic qualities.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.880
So what that means is and
this is a difficult concept

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.180
to wrap around-- I mean, we
use the word holism if you

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.888
go to yoga class or
whatever, but this is

00:14:59.888 --> 00:15:01.520
a more subtle form of holism.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.860
And I'll come back to it a few
times in the course of the talk

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.232
and try to zero in on it.

00:15:06.232 --> 00:15:08.190
So if you don't get it
first time, that's cool.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.130
The idea is that properties
cannot be attributed

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.240
to the parts of a system.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.174
They're properties of a
collective of the system.

00:15:15.174 --> 00:15:16.590
and that's a type
of non-locality.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.507
You can't localize the
property to any of the pieces.

00:15:19.507 --> 00:15:20.340
In fact, it's worse.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.760
You can't even build up the
property from the pieces.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.240
It's not like a Lego set where
you get a house from lots

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.150
of little bricks.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.650
There's certain properties of
the whole that actually cannot

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:35.010
be partitioned in that way and
that's a type of non-locality.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:39.705
Now this is something that
you learn as a really--

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:42.080
it's probably actually going
to probably into high school

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.890
physics, but certainly
undergraduate physics,

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.890
graduate school physics,
a lot of these concepts

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.396
are brought up.

00:15:47.396 --> 00:15:49.770
But what got me personally
interested to the level that I

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.524
would write a book about it
is that I saw connections

00:15:52.524 --> 00:15:53.690
among these different areas.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:57.079
So I try to synthesize
the types of non-locality

00:15:57.079 --> 00:15:58.120
in these different areas.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.904
And the fact that you have a
lot of types is interesting.

00:16:01.904 --> 00:16:03.320
It indicates that
this is just not

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.210
an isolated curiosity that
you can dismiss and put

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.300
in a carnival side
show or whatever.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.920
It's actually
something that is maybe

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.910
at the root of the mysteries
that we face in physics today.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.160
Now I'm going to throw out
a general purpose disclaimer

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.470
before I get into some
of the concrete cases.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.030
I have to do that for
scientific honesty.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.380
A lot of people,
scientists, physicists,

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.869
doubt a lot of these
intimations of non-locality.

00:16:29.869 --> 00:16:32.160
They think maybe it's a
misinterpretation of the theory

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.757
or of the experiment.

00:16:33.757 --> 00:16:36.090
And there's actually quite
an interesting and vociferous

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.807
debate over that, which
I do talk about a little

00:16:38.807 --> 00:16:40.306
in the book trying
to pick it apart.

00:16:42.972 --> 00:16:45.180
And you can see where those
skeptics are coming from.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.138
I mean locality is a very
successful principle.

00:16:47.138 --> 00:16:50.150
It's something we observe
just from our senses.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.344
So why question it?

00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:54.260
But this is one of those
cases where, I think,

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.729
the evidence is strong enough.

00:16:55.729 --> 00:16:57.770
You don't have to make a
stronger case than that.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:02.832
It's good enough that we
should pursue what it means.

00:17:02.832 --> 00:17:04.790
And that's what I will
do the rest of the talk.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.369
So disclaimer over.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:11.280
So let me go into a
couple concrete cases

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.040
of this non-locality,
and I'll start

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.780
with the one that concerned
Einstein, quantum entanglement.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.319
Often when I give
these talks, people

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:22.480
get hung up on the
word entanglement.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.510
And you really just think about
it as a romantic entanglement

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.010
thing.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:28.240
It's a relationship
between objects,

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.040
a connection between them
that's awkward, actually.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.580
So this particular laboratory
is in upstate New York,

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.560
Colgate University.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.900
And if you've ever
been in a physics lab,

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.150
it's actually kind of typical.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.940
There's even a coffee
maker on the left

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.856
here, which is an important
and essential part

00:17:43.856 --> 00:17:46.150
of any laboratory.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.720
It's the laboratory
of Enrique Galvez, who

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.390
is a Peruvian,
actually, I think,

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.510
he's a naturalized
US citizen now,

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.760
who has really been a
pioneer in miniaturizing

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.980
these experiments.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.146
These experiments actually
gp-- this particular kind

00:17:58.146 --> 00:18:00.410
of experiment goes really
back to the '70s or even

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:01.720
the late 60s.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.227
But they were humongous, taking
up the whole lab experiments

00:18:04.227 --> 00:18:06.060
and now you can really
pull down into-- this

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.514
is the size of a
dining room table.

00:18:08.514 --> 00:18:09.930
You actually could
get it probably

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.138
onto the size of this podium.

00:18:11.138 --> 00:18:15.330
That's the progress of
miniaturization on this.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.280
So one thing that's cool
about this table, by the way,

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.685
is you see all those
little holes on it?

00:18:20.685 --> 00:18:21.560
It's like a pegboard.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.617
You can actually screw
the components down

00:18:23.617 --> 00:18:25.200
and that's super
important for getting

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.532
the alignment in these
experiments correct.

00:18:27.532 --> 00:18:29.740
That's the hard part about
doing these experiments is

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.565
they spend months
of work-- well,

00:18:33.565 --> 00:18:35.190
Colgate's an
undergraduate institution.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:40.660
Poor RA is coming in to try to
align these mirrors and things.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.915
So this particular version
experiment uses light.

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:45.040
It's an optical experiment.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.250
It uses photons, in other words,
photons, particles of light.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:51.990
And photons are great because
they're easy to manipulate.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.050
There's also just an
established technology

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:54.966
for manipulating them.

00:18:54.966 --> 00:18:59.770
So there's mirrors, filters,
prisms, non-linear crystals,

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.060
optical fibers, the
whole range of equipment

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.442
that's available for
these experiments.

00:19:05.442 --> 00:19:07.400
Photons also have a lot
of different properties

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.200
that are nice.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.946
Obviously, they have
color, so energy, momentum,

00:19:11.946 --> 00:19:14.570
the direction they're moving in
but the property that's usually

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.580
focused on is
their polarization,

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.320
Polarization, it's
a binary property,

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.370
so it's just easier
to deal with.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.490
The others are reals,
so it's kind of harder

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:26.130
to deal with a
continuum quantity.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.165
The hard part about
photons is detecting them.

00:19:29.165 --> 00:19:31.290
Remember, you have to detect
these photons particle

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.540
by particle.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:36.855
So there's a lot of confounding
light in these experiments.

00:19:36.855 --> 00:19:38.480
This room has to be
completely darkened

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.729
for them to do the experiment.

00:19:39.729 --> 00:19:41.500
Even all the LEDs--
and everything

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.720
we have has LEDs in it--
has to be taped over

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.820
with electrical tape.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.403
There's a big curtain
drawn around it.

00:19:46.403 --> 00:19:48.940
It's actually spooky just
by the virtue of the set up

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.740
when they do it.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.530
Other kinds of particles have
countervailing trade-offs.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.660
So maybe they're easier
to detect but harder

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.669
to manipulate, like electrons,
protons, charged particles.

00:19:58.669 --> 00:20:00.960
And I don't know if anyone
saw, there's a big "New York

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.300
Times" article in, I guess,
beginning of November, maybe

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.889
late October, spooky action
at a distance proved.

00:20:07.889 --> 00:20:09.680
That was the headline,
something like that.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.740
And what was cool about
the experiments described

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:16.310
in that article is they
combined the advantages

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.120
of different types of particles.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:22.577
So they used photons to
connect different wings

00:20:22.577 --> 00:20:25.160
of the experiment but electrons
in the wings of the experiment

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.200
because they were
easier to detect.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.750
So there was a
hybrid approach that

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.174
got over a lot of the
difficulties of doing

00:20:30.174 --> 00:20:30.840
this experiment.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.580
But this particular photograph
dates to, I think, 2011 ,

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.160
so it predates that.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.550
So from this angle,
this is a blurry shot,

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:42.444
but I show it because
you can see two--

00:20:42.444 --> 00:20:44.860
if you run your eye-- I should
have drawn a line on this--

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.640
if you run your eye
vertically on this you

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.340
see two lines of instruments.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.040
And those would be
the two entangled

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.710
photons in this experiment.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.990
So let me just show you
the schematic of this.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.110
So it starts when you
have a laser in back that

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:02.130
emits a stream of photons and
they're blue for a purpose.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:05.810
There actually are blue or
maybe nearer to violet photons,

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:07.870
and they run through
different set up

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.120
instruments that align the
beams and clean up the beam

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.869
and everything and
then they hit the thing

00:21:11.869 --> 00:21:13.870
I call a crystal, that
I'll come back to.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:17.240
And that splits them,
through a nonlinear process,

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.750
into two photons each
of half the energy.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.067
So that puts them into the
red part of the spectrum.

00:21:22.067 --> 00:21:24.650
And then they hit, because I'm
dealing with polarization here,

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.430
polarizing filters and they
either get through the filter

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:28.190
or not.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:29.830
And they're picked up by
a detector-- actually they

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.954
go into a set of fiber
optics and they're picked up

00:21:31.954 --> 00:21:34.660
by a detector and
instrumentation at the bottom

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.130
there and they look
for coincidences.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.380
So when the photons hit the
detectors at the same time

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.820
within a certain
window that counts

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.205
as a coincident detection.

00:21:51.512 --> 00:21:53.720
These particular detectors,
by the way, are about 10%

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.600
efficient.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.920
So one in 10 photons
that strikes them gets

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.026
picked up and so one in
100 pairs that strikes,

00:22:00.026 --> 00:22:01.900
and that kind of statistics
becomes important

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.983
but has been overcome in
these recent experiments.

00:22:03.983 --> 00:22:08.320
So this is my finger pointing
to the polarizing filters

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.205
because that's a central element
of this experiment, gives you

00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:12.215
a sense of scale.

00:22:12.215 --> 00:22:14.340
That's the distance over
which, in this experiment,

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.180
the spooky action is occurring.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.065
It's about the width of my
palm or hand or whatever.

00:22:20.065 --> 00:22:21.656
That's the spooky
action distance

00:22:21.656 --> 00:22:23.280
in this particular
experiment, but that

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.740
can be extended to arbitrary
lengths if you want to.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.150
But here we just do
it to that width.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:30.490
The distinct look of a 35
millimeter camera lenses,

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.730
like a 50 millimeter lens, you
can turn the dial on the side

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.977
and that changes the
orientation of the polarization

00:22:36.977 --> 00:22:37.560
of the filter.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.220
So, in the past,
I've given a talk

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:47.310
in very similar to
this and at the end

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.530
and in email afterwards,
everyone always asks me

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.310
about that crystal I mentioned.

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:55.190
The crystal that splits
the incoming blues

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.430
into two outgoing reds.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.630
And I think part--
it's a crystal,

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.890
sounds weird, but
it's actually--

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.910
I didn't even get into the
details in it in previous talks

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.340
and not even in the book
because the details actually

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.290
don't matter.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.389
But, to head off
any questions, let

00:23:11.389 --> 00:23:13.180
me go into the crystal
for a couple minutes

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.460
because it is
actually cool physics.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.460
There actually is an amount,
that little transparent cube

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:24.960
in the middle is actually
an example of this crystal.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.796
It's actually a crystal
with barium borate.

00:23:26.796 --> 00:23:28.920
Barium borate comes in
different crystalline forms.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.310
This is the beta phase of it.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:36.140
And it, as this
cool image shows,

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.820
it actually splits the incoming
beam into two outgoing beams

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.830
through this process
known as down conversion,

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.430
spontaneous parametric down
conversion is the full title.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.000
And each of those terms has a
meaning, but down conversion.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.190
This picture, by the way,
is really hard to make.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:50.360
This is a long exposure.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.860
It's probably a
composite image even

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.890
and they actually made it by
taking a piece of tissue paper

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.932
and running it along the
beam during the duration

00:23:56.932 --> 00:23:58.723
of the exposure so you
can actually see it.

00:23:58.723 --> 00:24:01.320
Because otherwise you don't
see the beam in the laboratory.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.660
It would be bad if you
did because that means

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.350
there would be
scattering from the beam

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.840
and you'd be reducing the
intensity of the beam.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.590
So you don't want to
see the beam usually,

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.987
but, in this case, for
the dramatic picture,

00:24:10.987 --> 00:24:12.820
they did that using a
little piece of paper.

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.330
It's actually cool.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:17.920
So the splitting that occurs in
the crystal at the very center

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.780
of this picture is,
you can loosely think

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.270
of it as a type of refraction.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.092
It's a nonlinear exotic
type of refraction,

00:24:25.092 --> 00:24:26.300
that's what's occurring here.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.230
It actually requires quantum
field theory to explain fully,

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.477
but just for simple
purposes, think of it

00:24:31.477 --> 00:24:33.185
that the beam is
actually being refracted

00:24:33.185 --> 00:24:35.680
into two outgoing beams.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.150
Now here's a schematic
diagram of that set up.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:41.450
There's a crystal, that's
that block in the middle.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.950
And that white line
that you can see

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.670
on the side of the block, that's
the optic axis of the crystal.

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.730
So what you do is-- the crystal
is symmetrical about that axis.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.320
You send in, in this
case, vertically

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.960
polarized light
parallel to that axis

00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.930
and the crystal will create two
outgoing horizontally polarized

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.140
photons.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.780
In this case, the photons had
the same polarization, namely

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.640
in the horizontal direction.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.046
Now in case you ever watch a
YouTube video or look this up,

00:25:13.046 --> 00:25:15.580
I think, even on Wikipedia
or certainly in any magazine

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.246
articles, often they
describe a set up

00:25:17.246 --> 00:25:18.745
where they're
opposite polarizations

00:25:18.745 --> 00:25:21.602
and there's no
contradiction there.

00:25:21.602 --> 00:25:23.560
You can actually set up
the crystal to do both.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.420
But in this experiment
that I'm describing,

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.990
they're the same polarization.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:32.720
So you can rotate the whole
thing 90 degrees again you send

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.550
something that's-- photons are
polarized parallel to that axis

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.520
and they come out polarized
perpendicular to the axis.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.980
So that is how you
get two photons.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.270
Now you need two entangled
photons and that's something

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.935
a little bit more subtle.

00:25:52.935 --> 00:25:54.810
So if you don't get it
the first time around,

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:55.750
I'm going to come
back to it later.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:57.600
But let me spill
it out and then we

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.720
can talk about it if this
doesn't make any sense.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.160
So what does it mean
to be in entangled?

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:09.000
It means that the photons have
a polarization, excuse me,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.780
that the pair of photons
has a polarization

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.370
but the individuals
don't, which is to say,

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.202
the individuals have an
ambiguous polarization.

00:26:17.202 --> 00:26:19.410
That goes back to this whole
business of the property

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.320
can't be localized.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.861
So each photon, as I'll show
in an animation in a second,

00:26:23.861 --> 00:26:25.610
actually doesn't even
have a polarization,

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.085
but the system, as a whole,
has the property of they're

00:26:28.085 --> 00:26:29.630
the same polarization.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:33.130
And that's the mystery here
that we're trying to solve.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.520
So the way that that's
done in the experiment

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.680
is you take two of those
crystals, you pair of them up,

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.980
you send in diagonally
polarized light,

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.650
and it comes out with an
ambiguous polarization.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:49.809
It's the same
polarization on both sides

00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:51.225
but it's an ambiguous
polarization

00:26:51.225 --> 00:26:54.800
and that's the weird
thing about entanglement.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.450
The ambiguity is
only resolved later

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.200
when those things
actually hit a detector.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.044
When they hit a
detector, they resolve,

00:27:00.044 --> 00:27:01.960
and they're, in this
case, either horizontally

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.830
or vertically polarized
but they're always the same

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:04.550
each time.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:07.400
And I'll come back
to that in a second.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.370
So crystal is nice because
it gives you a controlled way

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.194
to produce entangled photons.

00:27:14.194 --> 00:27:16.610
But I want to emphasize that
there's nothing special about

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:17.401
the crystal per se.

00:27:17.401 --> 00:27:19.230
It's not like a
metaphysical crystal

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.240
that you buy in a
Haight-Ashbury kind of thing.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.310
No, it's just a particular
good way of doing it.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.200
I don't know if any of these
lights in here are fluorescent,

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.519
they look LEDs to me.

00:27:29.519 --> 00:27:31.060
The spots probably
aren't, but if you

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.893
go in the fluorescent
lights in the hallway,

00:27:32.893 --> 00:27:34.830
they are emitting
entangled photons.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.050
This is something that's
not actually widely known.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:39.190
The very first
experiment in the 1970s

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.690
actually used
mercury vapor lamps

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.170
because a mercury
atom gets excited

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.100
and then it decays
from its excited

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.240
state by emitting photons.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.510
It sometimes emits
photons in pairs,

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.450
and those two pairs
will be entangled,

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:54.260
will spin entangled or
polarization entangled with one

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.030
another.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.720
I did a do it yourself
version of this experiment

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.910
in my basement using a
radioactive isotope, sodium-22.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.147
It gives off
entangled gamma rays,

00:28:04.147 --> 00:28:05.980
and it can be picked
up by a Geiger counter.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.250
A Geiger counter is just
an extremely cheap photon

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:10.270
detector, basically.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:12.360
So you can do this
with all sorts of ways.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.060
You can just bang particles
together and entangle them.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.205
So there's nothing
special about a crystal,

00:28:15.205 --> 00:28:17.150
it just, it gives
you a controlled way

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:19.530
to do this experiment.

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:24.540
Now the physical implementation
of this isn't important.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.019
So we can go to a higher
level of abstraction.

00:28:27.019 --> 00:28:29.060
We don't have to work at
the physical layer here.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.310
We can go to a higher level.

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.757
You can think of
these things as coins.

00:28:32.757 --> 00:28:34.340
That's the higher
level of abstraction

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:37.050
we can take this-- each
photon is like a coin,

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:38.150
like flipping a coin.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.100
The whole thing is an extremely
expensive coin tosser,

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.225
like $10,000 coin tosser.

00:28:45.225 --> 00:28:47.600
And what it does is it creates
coins, flips them, creates

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.266
another pair, flips
it, creates a third,

00:28:49.266 --> 00:28:52.790
flips it, thousands of times a
second, adds up the statistics.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:56.580
So whether it comes
up heads or tails

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.940
is whether it goes through
the polarizing filter or not.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.750
And those things are
dialed so there's a 50/50

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:01.749
chance it's a fair coin.

00:29:01.749 --> 00:29:06.480
So we can go to this higher
level abstraction and a coin

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.600
gives you a certain series
of results, heads, tails, et

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.100
cetera.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:14.160
Purely at random, unpredictable
by the indeterminacy of quantum

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.820
mechanics.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.970
Go to the other side, you also
get heads, tails, blah, blah,

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:19.920
blah.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.240
Again, completely random,
completely unpredictable,

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.850
indeterminate.

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:29.957
Both sides, they're
the same outcome.

00:29:29.957 --> 00:29:31.540
That's, in this
particular experiment,

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.290
that's the connection
we're talking about.

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:35.107
That's the weirdness
that is at the heart

00:29:35.107 --> 00:29:36.440
of this entanglement experiment.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.720
Two random outcomes in two
places giving the same result.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.060
Like two coins being flipped on
two different football fields

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.550
all giving the same answer.

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:49.460
I like the coin metaphor
for a number of reasons.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.543
Obviously, any metaphor
will have its limitations,

00:29:51.543 --> 00:29:53.280
but this one does
get across the idea

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:57.090
that these are two independent
events, two independent coin

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:00.520
tosses, coming out the
same on both sides.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.934
That's the ambiguity I
was talking about earlier.

00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:04.850
Before, you flip a coin,
almost by definition,

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:05.891
there's no outcome to it.

00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:07.200
It's ambiguous.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.310
Otherwise why flip?

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:13.000
So unfortunately, a lot
of my Amazon reviewers

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.240
are missing this
particular point

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.410
and bringing me
down in their stars

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:21.740
because they're saying
well, George, come on,

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:22.740
what's the mystery here?

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.660
Why did you write
hundreds of pages

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:28.505
on this topic when it's obvious
you've created identical coins.

00:30:28.505 --> 00:30:30.630
And you toss them and they
give identical outcomes.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.510
It doesn't seem
mysterious at all.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:35.280
Well, that's partly an artifact
of this particular set up

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.620
of the experiment.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.730
It's also a misunderstanding
that quantum theory

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:40.990
is indeterminate.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:43.930
So these are indeterminate
tosses coming out the same.

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:46.260
But to prove the
point, what you can do

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.330
is you can do an elaboration
on the experiment.

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:53.500
I can dial those polarizing
filters to different settings.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.500
I have complete freedom.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.374
I can dial it actually
to any setting I want,

00:30:56.374 --> 00:30:58.940
but I'll choose two
particular settings.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:01.090
So there's four
permutations of settings

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:03.140
on the left and the
right, and I'll just,

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.390
for the purposes
of metaphor, say

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.720
that's like flipping the
coin with my left hand

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.380
or with my right hand.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.537
So I choose the hand at random.

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:14.620
In other words, I dial the
polarization at random.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.740
So what I've designated
as left comes out

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:21.847
whatever I go down the line,
it's a series of outcomes.

00:31:21.847 --> 00:31:23.680
And so there's two
levels of randomness here

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.410
that's important.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:27.072
One is the choice of hand
with which I'm tossing,

00:31:27.072 --> 00:31:29.030
and if I'm coordinated,
which actually I'm not,

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:31.410
I can flip them and get
these kinds of results

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:32.510
with either hand.

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:35.280
And there's the randomness
of the outcomes.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.780
I can do that on the
other side, as well

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:42.090
and I get actually a different
series of hands, in general,

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:43.710
and a set of outcomes.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:47.570
So, in this case, they're
not exactly identical.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:50.317
This is where we start getting
to some of the mysteries of it.

00:31:50.317 --> 00:31:52.150
Notice that there's--
I've highlighted them,

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:54.750
two exceptions to
the identical rule.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.740
They're not identical
on both sides.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.310
They're identical for three of
the four permutations of left

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:02.070
and right hand, but
for one, they're

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:05.800
actually always anticorrelated,
always the opposite outcome

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.880
on the two sides.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.300
Now notice where you
get the exceptions.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.260
You get the exceptions only
if, and only if, coin one

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:16.080
is tossed by the
person with their left

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.730
and coin two is tossed by the
person with their right hand.

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:20.730
In all other cases, you
get a different outcome.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:25.187
So the outcome depends on
both sides inextricably.

00:32:25.187 --> 00:32:26.770
It's as though there's
a communication

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.750
between both sides.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.959
That's the kind of connection
I'm talking about here.

00:32:30.959 --> 00:32:33.208
And you can elaborate on
this to your heart's content.

00:32:33.208 --> 00:32:35.920
There's just a zillion different
ways of-- polarizer settings,

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.711
you can do three
particles, four particles,

00:32:37.711 --> 00:32:39.580
infinite number of
particles, in principle,

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:44.210
and you get outcomes that cannot
be explained simply by taking

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.130
two identical coins
and flipping them.

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.730
It's more subtle, obviously.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:54.230
No known force is acting
to interlink the two sides

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:56.255
and communicate between them.

00:32:56.255 --> 00:32:57.950
Ah, you say, known force.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:00.150
Well, what about unknown forces?

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:02.284
And that's always a concern
because we certainly

00:33:02.284 --> 00:33:03.700
don't think our
theories of nature

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.360
exhaust the
possibilities out there.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.700
Probably the Higgs boson
comes with a whole series

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:11.880
of Higgs-like forces.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.860
Maybe they could
communicate, who knows?

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.740
Ah, but you can rule that out.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.842
One easy way to do it is
just move the particles

00:33:17.842 --> 00:33:20.050
further apart and see what
happens to the correlation

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:20.591
between them.

00:33:20.591 --> 00:33:22.270
And it's not affected by that.

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.115
So normally if you
have two things that

00:33:24.115 --> 00:33:26.600
are correlated, say, by a wave
and you double the distance,

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.640
you expect the strength of
the correlation to diminish

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.848
and that doesn't happen here.

00:33:29.848 --> 00:33:32.420
So there doesn't seem to be
anything passing through space.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.620
No force, even an unknown kind.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.640
But also what's done
here is the experiment

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.240
is done too quickly for a
force or hypothetical effect

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.610
to propagate.

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:46.990
You can actually do it at
the same, exact same time.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.600
Measure this particle
and change its setting

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.920
at the exact same time
as you do it over here.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.820
So any force would have
to be instantaneous

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:55.695
across that distance.

00:33:55.695 --> 00:33:58.130
It would have to
move infinitely fast.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.610
Infinitely is obviously
faster than light,

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.890
so that is ruled out by
Einstein's theory, or at least,

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:07.780
would contradict Einstein's
theory in a very serious way.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.179
So it doesn't seem to be caused
even by an unknown force.

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:12.642
We're left with this
magic, this weird thing.

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.040
I promised to qualify that
word magic a little bit,

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.610
and I'll do so now.

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:22.300
The magic is extremely subtle.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.587
You're not going to win a
Wizarding Cup with this magic.

00:34:25.587 --> 00:34:27.920
You're not going to even pass
your Owls with this magic,

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.678
because you don't see it if
you just confine your attention

00:34:30.678 --> 00:34:31.719
to one side or the other.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:33.815
You just see heads, tails,
heads, tails, whatever.

00:34:33.815 --> 00:34:35.440
Other side, heads,
tails, heads, tails.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.717
You just see 50/50 outcome.

00:34:36.717 --> 00:34:38.800
There's no statistical
variation on the two sides.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:44.790
Only when you compare them do
you see a pattern of any sort.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:48.060
So very subtle, very
weak form of magic,

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.169
but it's still pretty weird.

00:34:50.169 --> 00:34:51.710
By the way, that's
the reason-- and I

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:54.001
have to say this whenever
I'm in California doing this,

00:34:54.001 --> 00:34:56.310
no psychic powers
can be involved here.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.550
No telepathy, this is not
going to be of any use

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:01.320
to explain paranormal phenomena
even if those phenomena could

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.407
be verified experimentally.

00:35:03.407 --> 00:35:05.240
Actually in the '70s,
that was a live issue.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.519
So it's been settled.

00:35:07.519 --> 00:35:08.810
It's still pretty cool, though.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.150
There's lots of
technological applications

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.290
obviously, for
quantum computers.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.290
This is-- or certain types
of quantum computers,

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:14.129
this is important.

00:35:14.129 --> 00:35:16.420
The one that gets the most
traction, the most attention

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.910
is cryptography.

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:20.550
You can use this to certify
the privacy of a communication

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:21.540
channel.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.800
And essentially
the way it works is

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.850
you keep one of the
particles that are entangled.

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:29.980
You give one, or send the
one across to the person

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.570
you're communicating with
and if the NSA intercepts it

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.230
in the middle, it will
change the correlations

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:37.220
that your friend receives
on the other side

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.630
and there's no way for
even the government

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:41.630
to mimic that connection.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.870
It's just guaranteed by the
laws of quantum physics.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.369
And then once you've established
that communication channel,

00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:49.750
you can send a secure key
from one party to the other

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:54.530
and then encrypt whatever
message that you have.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.420
OK, so that is
quantum entanglement.

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.740
Just to give you a flavor
of how broad the concept

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.260
of non-locality
is, and then I'll

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.370
try to get into an
explanation for it,

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:07.585
I'm going to mention the
type, or at least one

00:36:07.585 --> 00:36:08.960
of the types of
non-locality that

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.460
are involved with black holes.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.710
And again, we're going to
hear a lot about black holes

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.168
in the coming days,
so that's cool.

00:36:14.168 --> 00:36:19.300
Here is a picture of a black
hole indicated by that arrow.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:23.980
Not much there, which
is the point of it.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.070
You do actually see
a little bit of gas

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:27.550
where that arrow terminates.

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:31.430
And this is an infrared
image, and the spectrum

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:36.750
indicates that the gas has a
temperature of 10,000 kelvins.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:41.307
Now if you had a region
of that size glowing

00:36:41.307 --> 00:36:43.640
with the temperature that's
much hotter than the surface

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.780
of the sun, you would
have a little star there.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:51.390
In fact, what you would see
is something more like that.

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:54.811
So there's a disconnect here
between the temperature that's

00:36:54.811 --> 00:36:56.560
observed and the
luminosity of the object.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.130
The object is way underluminous.

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:02.420
The energy is going missing.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.350
It's going down the black hole.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:06.650
That's some of the best
evidence we currently

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.850
have for black holes.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:10.400
This kind of missing
energy and also

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.980
speaks to what is a black hole?

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.520
It sucks things in,
can't get back out.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.910
So this is from the movie
"Interstellar" and some

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.910
of the simulations of
gravitational lensing done

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:20.650
for that movie.

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:26.110
Black hole basically looks
like, from the outside,

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:30.940
a giant, extremely dark planet
with a lot of stuff around it

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.350
usually.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:36.440
And if you fall into it,
there's no hope for you,

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.960
you just fall in and
that's it, you're dead.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:46.560
So what's important here
is the irreversibility

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.680
of the act of falling in.

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.700
You can't un-fall You can't
ascend out of the black hole

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.920
by definition.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.210
It's got this perimeter or
event horizon that things cannot

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:58.220
cross.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.120
What's important for
our purposes today

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.287
is that to cross that event
horizon, in other words,

00:38:02.287 --> 00:38:03.869
to escape from a
black hole, you would

00:38:03.869 --> 00:38:06.220
have to exceed the speed
of light, you would have,

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.900
essentially, to violate
the principle of locality.

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.740
Principle of locality
is what's really

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.790
explaining or kind
of underpinning

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:16.370
the irreversibility
of black holes.

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:18.953
So there's a connection between
irreversibility of black holes

00:38:18.953 --> 00:38:22.360
according to Einstein's theory
and the principle of locality.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.380
And this is the thing
that Stephen Hawking

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:28.190
clarified in the mid-1970s.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:32.550
He showed that the black
hole is like a big bonfire.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:34.410
It actually incinerates things.

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:37.830
So if your hapless
astronaut falls in,

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:42.000
the black hole will glow
that much more strongly

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.180
and the energy represented
by the astronaut

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.467
will actually come out in the
form of random heat radiation.

00:38:48.467 --> 00:38:50.050
Now if you were
clever, you might say,

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:52.970
aha, I'm going to collect
all that heat radiation

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:55.700
and I'm going to turn it
back into the black hole

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.340
and I'm going to
recover my friend.

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.200
And you would reverse the
process, as you could actually

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.241
do with chemical burning.

00:39:00.241 --> 00:39:03.070
If I had an actual
fire here, God forbid,

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.050
and were to burn
something in it,

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:08.890
I could take all the products
of that chemical reaction

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:13.190
and, in principle, run
the reaction backwards.

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:15.276
It would be difficult to
do with an actual fire,

00:39:15.276 --> 00:39:16.400
but in principle you could.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.410
But if you try to do
that with a black hole,

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:20.920
try to run it backwards, you
just get more of the same.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.420
You can't recover your friend.

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.600
You just get more
random radiation.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.770
It's actually even
uncorrelated with

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:25.894
the first random radiation.

00:39:25.894 --> 00:39:31.380
So it's really random now,
and no astronaut will pop out.

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:35.120
If I were to drop an egg on
the floor and it shattered,

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.799
a hard-boiled egg
and it shattered,

00:39:37.799 --> 00:39:39.840
I could imagine running
the whole movie backwards

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.290
and it would pop up off
the floor and back up

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:42.110
onto my plate.

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:45.130
You can't do that
with black holes.

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:49.520
So that is a problem
because everything

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.920
in fundamental physics, the
laws of fundamental physics

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.760
are all time reversible.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.240
If I can move this direction,
I can move that direction.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.900
If I can make it, I can
break it, or vice versa.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.870
So the black hole's going to
be an exception to that rule.

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.340
Obviously, in daily
life, we do see

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.960
a lot of irreversible processes,
but if you look more closely

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.320
they're reversible
at the atomic level

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.660
and what gives them their
apparent irreversibility is

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:18.350
the initial conditions on
it or a asymmetry that you

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:20.690
have in there.

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:26.480
So fundamental physics is by its
very nature, time reversible.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.350
So it looks like black holes
are an exception to that rule.

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:32.420
So there's something
weird going on with them.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.974
And you might say well, it's
just black holes and just

00:40:35.974 --> 00:40:38.390
exotic objects in the center
of the galaxy or whatever, so

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:39.190
big deal.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:41.850
But it turns out that if
you violate irreversibility

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:44.480
in any part of the
fundamental laws of physics,

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.890
you would violate it everywhere.

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:46.940
It's like being pregnant.

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.090
You can't be a
little bit pregnant.

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:49.830
You can't be a little
bit reversible.

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:53.480
And so the laws of
physics predict,

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.760
or at least the grounds
on which we construct

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.093
the laws of physics, predict
that black holes themselves

00:40:58.093 --> 00:41:00.130
should be reversible.

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:04.420
And I made the point
earlier that irreversibility

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.670
and locality are connected.

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:10.600
Ergo, reversibility and
non-locality are connected.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.420
It's a subtle argument,
but the basic idea

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:17.530
is that there just has to be a
way to get out of a black hole.

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:19.295
There has to be an
escape hatch some way

00:41:19.295 --> 00:41:21.420
or you have to be able to
exceed the speed of light

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.997
or there has to be a
tunnel of some sort

00:41:24.997 --> 00:41:26.830
to get you out of a
black hole, all of which

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:29.134
would violate locality here.

00:41:29.134 --> 00:41:30.800
So in the interest
of time, I'm actually

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.840
going to skip the next instance
of non-locality in black holes

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.860
and if you are curious, ask me
about the holographic principle

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.300
in the question
session or just we

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:42.720
can talk outside, if you like.

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.800
And it's actually pretty cool.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:49.500
So I promised an
attempt to explain

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:53.110
these non-local phenomena.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.810
So let's think about what
the phenomena represent.

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:58.541
They connect things
like particles,

00:41:58.541 --> 00:42:00.290
or the inside and
outside of a black hole,

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:04.040
pieces of a black hole,
different aspects of nature,

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.519
as though those objects
were not separated.

00:42:06.519 --> 00:42:08.560
As though they were actually
were just juxtaposed

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.990
or even coincident.

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:14.070
So the thinking is
deceptively simple,

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:17.490
that the distance between
things is somehow a mirage.

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:19.630
That things seem to be
separated but they're

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:23.500
really juxtaposed
at a deeper level

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:28.030
and might that explain
the non-local phenomena?

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:30.940
So that's just to say that space
is a mirage and mirage isn't

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.490
maybe the right word here.

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:34.620
It's really that
space is a construct.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.480
Space is built. It's
not fundamental,

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.846
it's built on something.

00:42:39.846 --> 00:42:41.720
So this is actually
where we can make contact

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.135
with a whole different
direction on the problem,

00:42:44.135 --> 00:42:46.010
and that's always good
when you can laterally

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:48.770
think like that, having
to do with understanding

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:50.450
the force of gravity.

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:52.900
So in Einstein's theory, the
general relativity theory,

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.390
the force of gravity
is associated

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.680
with the structure of
space and particular,

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.080
the curvature of space.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.530
So why does a baseball
arc back to the ground?

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:03.070
Well, the trajectories
through space and time

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:05.780
of the ball and the ground
will actually intersect,

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.310
and they'll do that
because Earth, its mass,

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:11.540
has warped space
around it causing

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:13.050
paths that were
parallel to actually

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:15.710
not to be parallel anymore.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.390
So gravity reflects the
structure of spacetime.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:23.040
And one of the great scientific
enterprises of our age

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:27.650
is to combine quantum theory
with Einstein's theory,

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:31.140
to combine quantum theory
with gravity theory

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:34.420
to give a quantum
theory of gravity.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:37.180
Now this is where you get into
string theory, loop quantum

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.540
gravity theory.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.810
You can go watch or read Brian
Greene on this, Lee Smolin.

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:45.880
I have, my first book is
on these theories, as well.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.150
And I'm going to--
there's a lot, by the way,

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:50.774
a lot of controversy and dispute
and everybody hates each other

00:43:50.774 --> 00:43:52.250
and it's very vexed.

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:54.090
But what's often
lost in that debate

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:57.690
is they're all saying the
same thing in different ways.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:00.550
They're all saying that space,
or at least a kind of space

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.656
that we inhabit is constructed.

00:44:02.656 --> 00:44:04.030
It may be constructed
by strings.

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:05.420
It may be constructed by loops.

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:08.580
It may be constructed by
causal event networks.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.900
Space may look
something like that.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:19.060
So this featureless
rectangle is meant

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.000
to represent the
space that we inhabit.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.750
It's featureless.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:25.420
You know, I look at
space in front of me

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.420
and I don't even see it.

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.280
I mean, it has no content to it.

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.492
But if I were to
zoom in, deep, deep,

00:44:30.492 --> 00:44:32.200
deep down, I would
begin to see some kind

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.400
of filigree structure,
quanta of space in some way

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.900
or other that might
be formed again,

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.970
by any of those kind of
fundamental ingredients

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:42.160
like strings or loops.

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.591
So again, space is
a construct in all

00:44:44.591 --> 00:44:46.340
of these theories,
independent, completely

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.080
independent of all of
these arguments about

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.120
spooky action at a distance.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.119
This is coming from another
tradition in physics

00:44:51.119 --> 00:44:53.700
altogether.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.524
So one thing that's
cool about this approach

00:44:56.524 --> 00:44:58.440
is you can take your
intuitions, such as they,

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:02.010
are about ordinary
atoms, hydrogen, helium,

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:04.630
et cetera, ordinary
molecules, H2O, whatever

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:06.220
and apply it to space.

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:08.220
Some of that intuition
should carry over

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.900
into your understanding of
space if both are molecular

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.700
or quantized in some way.

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:18.500
So water, what are some of the
properties of liquid water?

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:23.310
So it flows, it can wet
things, form droplets,

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:26.180
so it's associated
with surface tension.

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.840
I can send waves through
it, sound waves or ripples

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.470
on the surface.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:32.240
I can freeze it, boil
it, in other words,

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.170
I can change its state.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:38.480
All those properties
of liquid water

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.790
are not properties
of H2O molecules.

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:43.020
H2O molecules don't
flow in the sense

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.400
that we mean the word flow.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.120
They certainly can't undergo
any change of state, at least,

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.730
an ordinary change of state
as we understand that.

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:54.330
All those properties of the
liquid form, the material,

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:55.740
are properties of
the collective.

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.570
You take 10 to
the 24 whatever it

00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:01.550
is H2O molecules in this bottle,
and you get those properties

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:04.660
just by massing them together.

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:09.570
So maybe that intuition
carries over to space.

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:11.590
The atoms of space,
the quanta of space,

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:14.280
whatever, the strings,
loops, et cetera.

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.400
Are not themselves spatial.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.630
Space is something that
emerges in the collective.

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:26.340
It's an emergent property of
kazillions of those quanta.

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:30.130
And the space we inhabit may
be like a crystal in a phase.

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:32.930
It may be one of the many
phases of that system.

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:37.250
So that actually ties into
the idea of locality again.

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:39.620
In a crystal, each
part of the crystal

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:41.080
has a well defined neighborhood.

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:44.720
So a given molecule or atom
or whatever in the crystal

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.710
has some neighbors to it.

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:48.230
That's not the
case with the gas.

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:49.740
The neighbors are always
shifting around with that.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.365
There's no fixed
sense of neighborhood.

00:46:51.365 --> 00:46:54.100
So our space is sort of
like a crystal in some ways.

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:57.340
It has well defined
neighborhoods of things.

00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:03.265
But you could melt space,
evaporate space, screw around

00:47:03.265 --> 00:47:05.140
with space in different
ways and transform it

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:08.560
into different phases
and that would--

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.410
independent of the
kinds of phenomena

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:12.368
I'm talking about today,
that would actually be

00:47:12.368 --> 00:47:13.730
great to explain black holes.

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:16.140
The black hole actually may be
a place where space is literally

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:16.639
evaporated.

00:47:16.639 --> 00:47:18.962
It's undergone a
change of phase.

00:47:18.962 --> 00:47:20.420
In other words, in
that case, there

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:23.560
wouldn't actually be an
interior to the black hole.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:26.031
The black hole surface would
actually mark the end of space

00:47:26.031 --> 00:47:28.530
and inside would be sort of
like a vapor phase or something,

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.322
but something that's
certainly not spatial.

00:47:30.322 --> 00:47:32.655
I don't know if anyone in
here has heard of the firewall

00:47:32.655 --> 00:47:34.620
paradox that's been
discussed in physics a lot,

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.536
but that's kind of the
outcome of that paradox

00:47:36.536 --> 00:47:40.730
is to suggest that there is
no interior of a black hole.

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:42.560
So here is in animation
that I created

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:46.330
to try to get across, in a
very simplified model, what

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:48.090
I'm talking about here.

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:53.620
So here we have a collection
of nine atoms space,

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:57.358
those are the dots arrayed
around the polygon.

00:47:57.358 --> 00:47:59.060
This is not a spatial system.

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:01.850
This is meant to represent
a highly energetic network.

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:06.610
Each edge of the network
represents a degree of energy

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:10.130
and every node is connected
to every other node.

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:13.700
So there's no sense of
distance in this network.

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.700
Everything is equally
distant from one another.

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.687
You couldn't even actually
put that into a-- I

00:48:18.687 --> 00:48:20.270
guess you'd need a
nine-dimensional or

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:22.645
eight-dimensional space or
whatever to actually represent

00:48:22.645 --> 00:48:23.760
that spatially.

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.510
So it's not a spatial system.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:30.610
Then you imagine cooling down
the network, which corresponds

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:34.060
to fewer links, and now you
see what kind of network

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:35.724
that you have.

00:48:35.724 --> 00:48:38.140
It's somewhat contrived, but
this gives you an idea of it.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:41.802
Now you have something that is
beginning to look like space.

00:48:41.802 --> 00:48:43.260
There's a sense
of, in other words,

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:47.599
a sense of distance
in this network now.

00:48:47.599 --> 00:48:49.890
You can actually assign
coordinates and define a metric

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:52.630
on this network.

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:54.310
Now, what's nice
about this thing is

00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:56.790
you can begin to play
games, and you say,

00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:58.670
well, crystals have
defects in them.

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:00.550
They have irregularities.

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:01.980
Breakage is an irregularity.

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:04.563
Well, maybe we can try to think
about what that would be here.

00:49:04.563 --> 00:49:11.120
So, in that case, maybe you
maintain one of the edges here.

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:17.027
It didn't in the
process of cooling,

00:49:17.027 --> 00:49:18.110
and now look what happens.

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:20.870
You get a direct connection
between this bottom left

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:24.680
and the top right node in
this little miniature almost

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.620
like Cartesian-like grid.

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:29.410
That is sort of like having
a non-local connection

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:32.860
because those two points in
space, which on the face of it

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:35.230
seem far apart, are
actually directly connected.

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:37.230
Like a little wormhole
between them and actually

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:41.880
there's a connection there
with the idea of wormholes.

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:44.520
So this is, obviously,
a simplified model.

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:47.284
It's highly speculative,
but I think it's fair to say

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:48.450
and I think it's defensible.

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:49.820
I'd actually stand up
in front of Brian Greene

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.403
and Lee Smolin and
the others and say,

00:49:51.403 --> 00:49:54.180
ha, you guys all think
that space is constructed

00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:57.110
in some way or other, it's
coming out of something deeper,

00:49:57.110 --> 00:50:01.970
be it just graph theory approach
or some other approaches,

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:03.180
as well.

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:05.090
So, in that case,
non-locality is no longer

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:06.169
an insoluble puzzle.

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:07.335
It's no longer supernatural.

00:50:07.335 --> 00:50:08.420
You can make it natural.

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.586
You can explain it in terms
of some kind of network.

00:50:10.586 --> 00:50:14.820
You have to expand your physical
framework, but you can do that.

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.710
More metaphorically,
you can think

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:20.950
of the non-locality as like,
the property of a Turkish rug.

00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:24.067
If you go to a Turkish or
a Persian carpet dealer,

00:50:24.067 --> 00:50:25.650
sit and have mint
tea for a long time,

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:28.100
eventually walk out
with a rug or kilim.

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.130
And you can begin to look
at the quality of the weave.

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:33.940
You can look for worn
spots, imperfections

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:35.052
I've got a one at home.

00:50:35.052 --> 00:50:37.010
We've got one, I actually
didn't want to buy it

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:39.370
because it had this guy.

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:42.300
They drew a picture of a guy
on it and he didn't have an arm

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.500
and he looked like that.

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.470
And my wife was like,
George, no way that's

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:47.340
the cool thing about
this kilim is that it

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:48.950
indicates it was hand-woven.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:52.904
There's a slight imperfection
in the carpet telling you

00:50:52.904 --> 00:50:53.570
how it was made.

00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:55.110
So non-locality is like that.

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:58.160
It's an imperfection in space
telling you a little bit maybe,

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:02.650
maybe how space is woven.

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:06.170
So let me just wrap up and then
I'd love to take your questions

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:08.250
and talk about more.

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:10.640
We've got this
phenomenon or phenomena

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:13.620
of non-locality,
spooky connections

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:16.150
between different places,
different things that,

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:18.996
by right, shouldn't
be connected.

00:51:18.996 --> 00:51:20.370
And again, most
of the time, that

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:21.620
would be the end of the story.

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:25.020
But in really the past 10
years you're beginning to see,

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:27.930
as people talk more about
emergent spacetime, the germ

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:30.250
of an explanation for it.

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:34.509
It's derived from some
deeper structure in nature.

00:51:34.509 --> 00:51:36.800
And what's cool and I hope
science fiction writers will

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:40.642
pick up on this, you can imagine
universes that are not spatial.

00:51:40.642 --> 00:51:42.350
That the atoms have
rearranged themselves

00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:46.629
into some non-spatialness and, I
mean, what does that even mean?

00:51:46.629 --> 00:51:48.170
It's like, how do
you visualize that?

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:49.620
It doesn't mean the
universe has gone away,

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:50.995
but it's entered
this other phase

00:51:50.995 --> 00:51:54.526
and how cool would that
be to try to visualize?

00:51:54.526 --> 00:51:55.900
Thank you very
much for listening

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.399
and I'd love to
take your questions.

00:52:03.449 --> 00:52:05.240
So I've been told that
there's microphones,

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.860
but I guess you guys know the
routine much better than I do.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.276
Or we can talk
afterwards outside.

00:52:13.402 --> 00:52:15.860
AUDIENCE: Going way back over
here to the start of the talk

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.630
show because my mind is totally
spinning around circles.

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:20.305
GEORGE MUSSER: That's
where should be.

00:52:20.305 --> 00:52:21.680
AUDIENCE: But how
do you actually

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:24.370
measure-- when two photons
strike at the same time,

00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:25.995
how do you actually
measure things that

00:52:25.995 --> 00:52:27.730
are that close to
one another in time

00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:29.522
and that are so small,
in terms of photons?

00:52:29.522 --> 00:52:30.730
GEORGE MUSSER: Good question.

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:32.610
So the question is
how do you really

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:35.040
know that you conducted the
experiment simultaneously

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:35.760
on both wings?

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.476
AUDIENCE:Very small quantities
at a time, very small, small,

00:52:37.476 --> 00:52:38.080
small particles.

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:40.250
GEORGE MUSSER: Right, so
usually with that actually you

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:42.280
guarantee that by the path
length in the experiment.

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.321
You just make sure that
the photons are traveling

00:52:44.321 --> 00:52:46.650
the same distance and
there's a variety of ways

00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:47.900
you can test that and measure.

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:49.780
You look for the phasing
of the light through it.

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.040
So there's a whole precursor
to the experiment that'll

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:58.180
establish that the photons are
traveling over the same period

00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:01.049
of time to each other.

00:53:01.049 --> 00:53:02.340
Does that answer your question?

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:03.040
AUDIENCE: Is that
like [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.120
of a second or something?

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:07.944
Like these things happen at
the exact same time, 0.000,

00:53:07.944 --> 00:53:09.820
you know, something?

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:13.420
GEORGE MUSSER: Right so
there's some master signal

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:16.874
that's going out and
you have to be careful

00:53:16.874 --> 00:53:19.290
because everything's happening
at the speed of light here,

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:23.530
that the distance over which the
signal that's provoking the two

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.590
wings of the experiment
to release their photon,

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:28.294
for example, that the signal's
traveling the same length,

00:53:28.294 --> 00:53:30.210
so therefore, it takes
the same amount of time

00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:33.944
and that makes these two
events, in theory, simultaneous.

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:35.360
Now obviously,
there's going to be

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:38.180
some kind of experimental
precision on that.

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:42.671
I think the limit is something
like 10,000 times faster

00:53:42.671 --> 00:53:43.670
than the speed of light.

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:45.590
That would be the speed
at which something

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:47.340
would have to cross
the wing given

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:49.880
the precision of the timing
on those experiments.

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:52.027
I mean, you can
synchronize them with,

00:53:52.027 --> 00:53:54.110
certainly with picoseconds
or something like that,

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:55.950
but I don't know what
the detail would be.

00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:58.470
And then you can, another fun
thing you can do is you can,

00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:01.590
because the Earth is rotating,
you can actually watch

00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:04.640
the experiment for a 24-hour
period and if universe has any

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.800
kind of hypothetical frame of
reference that's an absolute

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.280
frame of reference, you would
rotate through that frame,

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:14.030
so you should see variations
in the timing, which you don't.

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:16.290
So the whole thing
seems to be kosher

00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:18.265
as far as Einstein's
theory is concerned.

00:54:18.265 --> 00:54:19.140
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:20.134
GEORGE MUSSER: Sure.

00:54:20.134 --> 00:54:22.050
It's actually fun to get
into the nitty gritty

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:22.925
of these experiments.

00:54:22.925 --> 00:54:25.240
The timing is a huge issue.

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.140
Those crystals are actually
extremely inefficient.

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:33.250
They'll release only like
one laser photon in a billion

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:36.310
will actually produce
the entangled photon.

00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:38.890
So there's a lot of statistics
that you have to work through

00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:41.220
on that and that's why this
has taken decades really

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.246
to bring to it's current state.

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:49.934
AUDIENCE: You skipped over some
slides about holographic theory

00:54:49.934 --> 00:54:51.600
and how it relates
to black holes, which

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:52.790
is an idea I've
learned about recently

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:53.840
and it's really compelling.

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:55.881
So I wondering if you
could elaborate on how that

00:54:55.881 --> 00:54:58.300
might relate to non-locality.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:02.352
GEORGE MUSSER: Yes, so, this
might be too long for an answer

00:55:02.352 --> 00:55:03.060
to your question.

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:04.809
We can talk about it
more in the corridor.

00:55:04.809 --> 00:55:07.990
But it goes back to what I
was saying about black holes

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:09.590
being like incinerators.

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:13.230
They have a temperature to them.

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:16.160
That comes out of the
work of Stephen Hawking.

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:18.774
So, first of all,
that immediately

00:55:18.774 --> 00:55:20.440
implies, by the way,
that the black hole

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:22.390
must consist of some kind
of microscopic structure.

00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:24.640
Anything that has a temperature
and can raise or lower

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.700
temperature, like water,
has to be molecular

00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:29.450
because the molecular
motions are what's

00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:30.620
actually storing the heat.

00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:32.170
It's what's actually
representing the concept

00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:32.860
of temperature here.

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:34.359
So the black hole
already, you know,

00:55:34.359 --> 00:55:38.440
has to be divisible into some
kind of molecular, atomic,

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.134
or microscopic structure.

00:55:40.134 --> 00:55:41.550
And then you can
play other games.

00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:43.650
You can do things like
hypothetical games of,

00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:47.469
well, if I add a certain
amount of energy to-- well,

00:55:47.469 --> 00:55:48.510
let's take it with water.

00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:50.176
If I add a certain
amount of heat energy

00:55:50.176 --> 00:55:52.800
to this water and the
temperature bumps up

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.590
just a teeny amount,
then I know there

00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:58.020
must be a lot of molecules
because the energy's being

00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:59.549
divided over those molecules.

00:55:59.549 --> 00:56:01.340
If it goes up a huge
amount, few molecules.

00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.230
You can actually
count the number

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:04.000
of molecules in the
water, and you can

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.860
do the same for black holes.

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:08.860
And with water, when you do a
counting exercise like that,

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:11.390
the number of molecules is
proportional to the volume

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.890
of water.

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:14.130
If I have a bigger
bottle, more molecules.

00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:15.090
It just scales up.

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:17.324
There's a volumetric scaling.

00:56:17.324 --> 00:56:19.240
It's too long to go back
to the slide on this,

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:21.480
but if you do the same
thing for black holes,

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.940
it scales up with the
area of the black hole.

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:27.050
If you do this kind of
exercise of how many molecules

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.750
does the black hole have?

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:31.260
It's proportional to the
surface area of the black hole,

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:34.040
not to the interior volume.

00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:37.930
So a black hole from the
outside looks three-dimensional

00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:41.610
but it's acting, it's behaving
as a two-dimensional system.

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:43.300
And that is where
the word hologram

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:44.760
enters this whole discussion.

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:47.900
Because a hologram, you
know, Princess Leia,

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:49.640
looks three-dimensional.

00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:53.290
You can actually walk around the
droid projecting Princess Leia

00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:55.600
and see it looks
three-dimensional,

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.040
but you know that it's
two-dimensional, ultimately

00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:58.150
two-dimensional.

00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:59.900
And you could probably
get that by looking

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:02.235
at the kind of details
that Princess Leia had.

00:57:02.235 --> 00:57:04.236
If you enlarged
the hologram, you'd

00:57:04.236 --> 00:57:05.860
begin to see some
graininess in it that

00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:07.710
would indicate the
thing is actually

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:10.135
a two-dimensional projection.

00:57:10.135 --> 00:57:11.635
AUDIENCE: But isn't
the surface area

00:57:11.635 --> 00:57:16.080
of the black hole related to
its volume, like a sphere.

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:18.100
GEORGE MUSSER: You would
think so but that, no.

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:26.380
I mean, there's a couple levels
at which the answer is no.

00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:29.240
First, the level
is actually-- even

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:31.810
in general relativity theory,
the interior of a black hole

00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:34.420
is a highly distorted spacetime.

00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:35.920
So it doesn't scale up.

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:38.211
There's actually more space
in it than there should be,

00:57:38.211 --> 00:57:39.917
in a way, because
of this distortion.

00:57:39.917 --> 00:57:41.500
So it looks like a
ball on the outside

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.987
but you can't do your
4/3 pi r cubed with it.

00:57:43.987 --> 00:57:45.070
It doesn't work like that.

00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:48.020
And worse, in the quantum
theory of gravity, at least

00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:50.560
according to some of
these interpretations,

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:52.040
there is no interior.

00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.310
So there's nothing to volume.

00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:55.764
There's no volume there at all.

00:57:55.764 --> 00:57:57.430
And, oh, but the
connection to locality,

00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:58.660
I promised to go back.

00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:02.990
The volumetric scaling is
actually related to locality.

00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:07.782
So if you scale up--
if I have two water

00:58:07.782 --> 00:58:09.740
molecules-- molecules,
certainly, but certainly

00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:13.890
bottles, I can treat each
independently and then

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:16.190
add up the total
volume because I've

00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:20.844
divided the bucket of water, or
whatever I have into subvolumes

00:58:20.844 --> 00:58:23.010
and added up the subvolumes
to get the total volume.

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:25.090
That's where you get
the volumetric scaling.

00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:29.490
You just integrate
over that x cubed.

00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:34.889
So that volumetric scaling
is failing for black holes

00:58:34.889 --> 00:58:37.180
and since the volumetric
scaling comes out of locality,

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:39.180
it means locality is
failing for black holes.

00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:40.638
A lot of these
black hole arguments

00:58:40.638 --> 00:58:43.587
require a couple
stages in logic.

00:58:43.587 --> 00:58:44.295
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:58:44.295 --> 00:58:45.128
GEORGE MUSSER: Sure.

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.470
So you guys are all like happy
with all this and there no

00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:52.440
questions?

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.080
It takes time to
formulate them, so I

00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.788
think I'll be around
for lunch and you're

00:58:55.788 --> 00:58:57.116
welcome to pester me.

00:58:57.116 --> 00:58:58.740
AUDIENCE: Hi, I just
have one question.

00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:01.140
I don't understand--
well, by some definition

00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:03.470
of understanding-- the
part about when you're

00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:05.406
saying that the black
hole is irreversible,

00:59:05.406 --> 00:59:08.240
you're saying that you would
expect it to be reversible

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.120
but it's not what.

00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:11.880
You would expect
it based on what?

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:13.624
Based on the way
the math works out?

00:59:13.624 --> 00:59:14.415
GEORGE MUSSER: Yes.

00:59:14.415 --> 00:59:17.140
AUDIENCE: And the other
one based on observation?

00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:18.050
It's not clear.

00:59:18.050 --> 00:59:18.900
GEORGE MUSSER: I
rushed through that

00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:20.275
and I'm glad you
called me on it.

00:59:20.275 --> 00:59:25.280
So the question is, in
general relativity theory

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:29.200
black holes are
irreversible by definition.

00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.700
You fall in, you
can't get back out.

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:33.120
It's all the well known
properties of black holes.

00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.745
You'd have to exceed
the speed of light

00:59:34.745 --> 00:59:35.850
to get out, specifically.

00:59:35.850 --> 00:59:41.840
So that has always been
considered a paradox in a way.

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.740
It's always been considered
a problem that black holes

00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:50.010
seemed to be irreversible when
everything else in science is--

00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:51.720
AUDIENCE: And by
seem to be, you mean

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:54.310
seem according to the math?

00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:55.500
GEORGE MUSSER: Yes, yes.

00:59:55.500 --> 01:00:00.450
Well, certainly
according to the theory.

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:03.960
They're observationally
irreversible.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.520
What's a good example of that?

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.124
I mean, the simple example
would-- it's not entirely

01:00:09.124 --> 01:00:11.790
the same as the theoretical one,
but I'll give it to you anyway.

01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:15.430
So if you have a neutron star,
just any physical object,

01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:20.070
and matter falls onto that
object, it will heat it up.

01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:22.600
It's like, if you pummel
it, it will heat up

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.970
and the object will
radiate away that energy.

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:27.980
So there's a steady state
that will be achieved

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:29.550
in any kind of material system.

01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:32.370
And this is a well
known aspect of stars

01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:34.725
and other systems like this.

01:00:34.725 --> 01:00:36.100
Black holes are
unable to achieve

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.933
any kind of steady state
like that, at least

01:00:37.933 --> 01:00:40.500
according to the theory and
also according to observations.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.700
You see, in the
example I showed,

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:45.830
the black hole was actually
sucking in some gas but it

01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:51.107
wasn't-- as it sucked in, it
didn't heat up and release

01:00:51.107 --> 01:00:52.440
the energy of the gas out again.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.360
So there seemed to
be an irreversibility

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.600
in that process.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.250
So the contention
that Hawking made

01:00:57.250 --> 01:01:00.770
is that if you look long
enough, as in 10 to the 30 year

01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:02.460
long enough, you
would eventually

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:06.100
see the energy emerge back out
in the form of these Hawking

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.840
particles.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:12.580
And that also was irreversible
because the Hawking particles

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:13.910
coming out are random.

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:15.342
You couldn't unwind the system.

01:01:15.342 --> 01:01:17.050
AUDIENCE: Did that
correlate [INAUDIBLE]?

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:19.205
GEORGE MUSSER: Exactly
there's no correlation.

01:01:19.205 --> 01:01:21.580
In fact, I'm glad you bring
up the word correlation there

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:24.270
because if you had two
entangled, if you played

01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:25.960
a game, two entangled
particles, you

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.199
threw one into a black hole.

01:01:27.199 --> 01:01:28.740
The one that came
out would no longer

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:32.270
be entangled with that
one that you kept,

01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:37.711
which is violating the
reversibility of quantum

01:01:37.711 --> 01:01:38.210
theory.

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:40.520
That's actually why
it's called a paradox.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.830
Because quantum
theory is telling you

01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:44.620
that you have an
irreversible process,

01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:46.350
which is against quantum theory.

01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:50.899
So there's a loop there
that is contradictory.

01:01:50.899 --> 01:01:51.690
Does that help any?

01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:54.250
I know it's hard to get
your mind around but--

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:55.210
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:56.170
GEORGE MUSSER: Sure.

01:02:00.469 --> 01:02:02.010
Well, thank you all
for coming today.

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:03.850
If you do have
questions, pester me.

01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:05.876
I'm happy to-- and
actually for me,

01:02:05.876 --> 01:02:07.250
the benefit of
giving these talks

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:09.380
is really the questions
because they provoke me

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.910
like it did with the down
version crystal, actually

01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:13.310
modified the talk
and will modify

01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:14.820
another edition of the
book based on the questions

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:15.319
that I got.

01:02:15.319 --> 01:02:18.245
So if you do have
questions, feel free.

01:02:18.245 --> 01:02:19.620
Or if you don't
want to ask them,

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.870
I can give you my email
address later and we can talk.

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:22.850
Thanks.

01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:26.178
[APPLAUSE]
