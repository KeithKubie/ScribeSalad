the last video was very abstract in

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850
the last video was very abstract in
 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.360
the last video was very abstract in
general and I used you know f of X and G

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370
general and I used you know f of X and G
 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.639
general and I used you know f of X and G
of T and H of T what I want to do in

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649
of T and H of T what I want to do in
 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.770
of T and H of T what I want to do in
this video is do an actual example so

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780
this video is do an actual example so
 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.190
this video is do an actual example so
let's say I have f of X Y let's say that

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200
let's say I have f of X Y let's say that
 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.080
let's say I have f of X Y let's say that
f of X Y is equal to X Y and let's say

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
f of X Y is equal to X Y and let's say
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.599
f of X Y is equal to X Y and let's say
that we have a path in the XY plane or

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609
that we have a path in the XY plane or
 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.220
that we have a path in the XY plane or
curve in the xy-plane I'm going to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
curve in the xy-plane I'm going to
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.390
curve in the xy-plane I'm going to
define my curve say my curve is going to

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400
define my curve say my curve is going to
 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.460
define my curve say my curve is going to
be defined by X being equal to cosine of

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470
be defined by X being equal to cosine of
 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.900
be defined by X being equal to cosine of
T and Y being equal to sine of T and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
T and Y being equal to sine of T and
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.420
T and Y being equal to sine of T and
we're going to go from it's not you know

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
we're going to go from it's not you know
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.430
we're going to go from it's not you know
we have to define what what are our

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
we have to define what what are our
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.290
we have to define what what are our
boundaries on our T and we're going to

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300
boundaries on our T and we're going to
 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.180
boundaries on our T and we're going to
go from T is equal to 0 or or T is going

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
go from T is equal to 0 or or T is going
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.459
go from T is equal to 0 or or T is going
to be greater than or equal to 0 and

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469
to be greater than or equal to 0 and
 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.139
to be greater than or equal to 0 and
then less than or equal to we're going

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
then less than or equal to we're going
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.810
then less than or equal to we're going
to deal in radians PI over 2 if this was

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
to deal in radians PI over 2 if this was
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.569
to deal in radians PI over 2 if this was
degrees that would be 90 degrees so

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579
degrees that would be 90 degrees so
 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.369
degrees that would be 90 degrees so
that's our curve and immediately you

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379
that's our curve and immediately you
 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.049
that's our curve and immediately you
might already know what this type of a

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
might already know what this type of a
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.369
might already know what this type of a
curve looks like and I'm going to draw

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379
curve looks like and I'm going to draw
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.900
curve looks like and I'm going to draw
that really fast right here and then

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
that really fast right here and then
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.250
that really fast right here and then
we'll try to visualize this I've

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
we'll try to visualize this I've
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.050
we'll try to visualize this I've
actually grafted ahead of time so that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
actually grafted ahead of time so that
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.240
actually grafted ahead of time so that
we can visualize this so this curve

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
we can visualize this so this curve
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.469
we can visualize this so this curve
right here if I were to just draw it in

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479
right here if I were to just draw it in
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.990
right here if I were to just draw it in
the standard XY plane let me do that in

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
the standard XY plane let me do that in
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.850
the standard XY plane let me do that in
a different color so we can make the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860
a different color so we can make the
 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.330
a different color so we can make the
curve green so let's say that is y and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
curve green so let's say that is y and
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.980
curve green so let's say that is y and
that this is right here X so when T is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
that this is right here X so when T is
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.710
that this is right here X so when T is
equal to 0 X is going to be equal to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720
equal to 0 X is going to be equal to
 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.940
equal to 0 X is going to be equal to
cosine of 0 cosine of 0 is 1 Y is going

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
cosine of 0 cosine of 0 is 1 Y is going
 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.760
cosine of 0 cosine of 0 is 1 Y is going
to be equal to sine of 0 which is 0 so T

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
to be equal to sine of 0 which is 0 so T
 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.550
to be equal to sine of 0 which is 0 so T
is equal to 0 we're going to be at X is

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
is equal to 0 we're going to be at X is
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.010
is equal to 0 we're going to be at X is
equal to 1 right that's cosine of 0 and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
equal to 1 right that's cosine of 0 and
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.469
equal to 1 right that's cosine of 0 and
Y is sine of 0 or Y is going to be 0 so

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
Y is sine of 0 or Y is going to be 0 so
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.910
Y is sine of 0 or Y is going to be 0 so
we're going to be right there that's at

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
we're going to be right there that's at
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.899
we're going to be right there that's at
t is equal to t is equal to 0 when T is

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909
t is equal to t is equal to 0 when T is
 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.550
t is equal to t is equal to 0 when T is
equal to PI of 2 what's going to happen

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
equal to PI of 2 what's going to happen
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.039
equal to PI of 2 what's going to happen
cosine of PI over 2 right that's the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
cosine of PI over 2 right that's the
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.600
cosine of PI over 2 right that's the
angle cosine of PI over 2 is 0 sine of

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610
angle cosine of PI over 2 is 0 sine of
 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.580
angle cosine of PI over 2 is 0 sine of
PI over 2 is 1 so we're going to be at

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590
PI over 2 is 1 so we're going to be at
 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.060
PI over 2 is 1 so we're going to be at
the point 0 1 so this is when we're at T

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070
the point 0 1 so this is when we're at T
 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.730
the point 0 1 so this is when we're at T
is equal to PI over 2 and you might

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
is equal to PI over 2 and you might
 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.990
is equal to PI over 2 and you might
recognize what we're going to draw is

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000
recognize what we're going to draw is
 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.670
recognize what we're going to draw is
actually the first quadrant of the unit

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680
actually the first quadrant of the unit
 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.109
actually the first quadrant of the unit
circle when T is equal to PI over 4 or

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119
circle when T is equal to PI over 4 or
 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.089
circle when T is equal to PI over 4 or
45 degrees we're going to be at square

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099
45 degrees we're going to be at square
 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.740
45 degrees we're going to be at square
root of 2 square root of 2 you can try

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750
root of 2 square root of 2 you can try
 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.290
root of 2 square root of 2 you can try
it out for your

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300
it out for your
 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.190
it out for your
self but we're just going to have a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200
self but we're just going to have a
 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.720
self but we're just going to have a
curve that looks like this it's going to

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730
curve that looks like this it's going to
 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.690
curve that looks like this it's going to
be the top right of a circle of the unit

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700
be the top right of a circle of the unit
 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.670
be the top right of a circle of the unit
circle it's going to have radius one and

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680
circle it's going to have radius one and
 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.900
circle it's going to have radius one and
we're going to go in that direction from

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910
we're going to go in that direction from
 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.840
we're going to go in that direction from
T is equal to zero to T is equal to PI

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850
T is equal to zero to T is equal to PI
 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.120
T is equal to zero to T is equal to PI
over two that's what this curve looks

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130
over two that's what this curve looks
 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.450
over two that's what this curve looks
like but in the last our goal isn't here

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460
like but in the last our goal isn't here
 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.520
like but in the last our goal isn't here
just to graph a parametric equation what

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530
just to graph a parametric equation what
 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.160
just to graph a parametric equation what
we want to do is raise a fence out of

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170
we want to do is raise a fence out of
 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.130
we want to do is raise a fence out of
this kind of base and rise it to this

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140
this kind of base and rise it to this
 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.960
this kind of base and rise it to this
surface so let's see if we can do that

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970
surface so let's see if we can do that
 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.820
surface so let's see if we can do that
or at least visualize it first and then

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830
or at least visualize it first and then
 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.500
or at least visualize it first and then
we'll use the tools we use in the last

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510
we'll use the tools we use in the last
 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.090
we'll use the tools we use in the last
video so right here I've graphed I've

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100
video so right here I've graphed I've
 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.490
video so right here I've graphed I've
graphed this function and I've done it

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
graphed this function and I've done it
 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.870
graphed this function and I've done it
I've rotated a little bit so you could

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880
I've rotated a little bit so you could
 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.970
I've rotated a little bit so you could
see the other case this right here let

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980
see the other case this right here let
 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.250
see the other case this right here let
me get some dark colors out that right

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260
me get some dark colors out that right
 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.700
me get some dark colors out that right
there is the x-axis that's the x-axis

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710
there is the x-axis that's the x-axis
 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.740
there is the x-axis that's the x-axis
that in the back is the y-axis and the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750
that in the back is the y-axis and the
 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.080
that in the back is the y-axis and the
vertical axis is the z axis and this is

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090
vertical axis is the z axis and this is
 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.840
vertical axis is the z axis and this is
actually two this is one right here y

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850
actually two this is one right here y
 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.550
actually two this is one right here y
equal one is right there so this is it

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560
equal one is right there so this is it
 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.870
equal one is right there so this is it
graph that way so if I were to graph

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880
graph that way so if I were to graph
 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.120
graph that way so if I were to graph
this contour and the XY plane it would

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130
this contour and the XY plane it would
 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.280
this contour and the XY plane it would
be under this graph and it would go like

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290
be under this graph and it would go like
 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.200
be under this graph and it would go like
something like this let me see if I can

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210
something like this let me see if I can
 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.479
something like this let me see if I can
draw it it would look something like

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489
draw it it would look something like
 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.910
draw it it would look something like
this this would be on the XY plane this

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920
this this would be on the XY plane this
 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.370
this this would be on the XY plane this
is the same exact graph f of X is equal

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380
is the same exact graph f of X is equal
 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.800
is the same exact graph f of X is equal
to XY let me make that clear this is f

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810
to XY let me make that clear this is f
 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.780
to XY let me make that clear this is f
of X f of XY is equal to XY that's both

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790
of X f of XY is equal to XY that's both
 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.790
of X f of XY is equal to XY that's both
of these I just rotated it in this

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800
of these I just rotated it in this
 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.970
of these I just rotated it in this
situation this is now that right there

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980
situation this is now that right there
 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.550
situation this is now that right there
is now the x axis I've rotated to the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560
is now the x axis I've rotated to the
 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.740
is now the x axis I've rotated to the
left you can kind of imagine that right

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750
left you can kind of imagine that right
 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.570
left you can kind of imagine that right
there's the x axis that right there is

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580
there's the x axis that right there is
 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.420
there's the x axis that right there is
the y axis it was rotated closer to me

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430
the y axis it was rotated closer to me
 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.780
the y axis it was rotated closer to me
that's the z axis and then this curve if

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790
that's the z axis and then this curve if
 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.690
that's the z axis and then this curve if
I were to draw it in this rotation if I

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700
I were to draw it in this rotation if I
 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.650
I were to draw it in this rotation if I
were to draw it in this rotation it's

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660
were to draw it in this rotation it's
 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.910
were to draw it in this rotation it's
going to look like this when T is equal

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920
going to look like this when T is equal
 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.430
going to look like this when T is equal
to 0 where it X is equal to 1 Y is equal

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440
to 0 where it X is equal to 1 Y is equal
 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.940
to 0 where it X is equal to 1 Y is equal
to 0 it's going to form a unit circle

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950
to 0 it's going to form a unit circle
 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.830
to 0 it's going to form a unit circle
something like our half or quarter of a

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840
something like our half or quarter of a
 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.660
something like our half or quarter of a
unit circle like that and when T is

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670
unit circle like that and when T is
 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.400
unit circle like that and when T is
equal to PI over 2 we're going to get

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410
equal to PI over 2 we're going to get
 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.920
equal to PI over 2 we're going to get
there and what we want to do is find the

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930
there and what we want to do is find the
 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.870
there and what we want to do is find the
area of the curtain that's defined so

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880
area of the curtain that's defined so
 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.280
area of the curtain that's defined so
let's see let's raise a curtain from

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290
let's see let's raise a curtain from
 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.210
let's see let's raise a curtain from
this curve up to f of X Y so if we keep

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220
this curve up to f of X Y so if we keep
 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.789
this curve up to f of X Y so if we keep
raising walls from this up to X of Y

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799
raising walls from this up to X of Y
 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:18.750
raising walls from this up to X of Y
we're going to have a wall that looks

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760
we're going to have a wall that looks
 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.330
we're going to have a wall that looks
something like that

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340
something like that
 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.260
something like that
gonna have a wall that looks something

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270
gonna have a wall that looks something
 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.909
gonna have a wall that looks something
like that let me shade it in colored in

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919
like that let me shade it in colored in
 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:24.930
like that let me shade it in colored in
so it looks a little bit more

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940
so it looks a little bit more
 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.610
so it looks a little bit more
substantive

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620
substantive
 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.470
substantive
so a wall that looks something like that

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480
so a wall that looks something like that
 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.670
so a wall that looks something like that
if I were to try to do it here this

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680
if I were to try to do it here this
 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.280
if I were to try to do it here this
would be under the ceiling but the the

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290
would be under the ceiling but the the
 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.070
would be under the ceiling but the the
wall would look something like that

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080
wall would look something like that
 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.170
wall would look something like that
right there we want to find the area of

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180
right there we want to find the area of
 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.570
right there we want to find the area of
that we want to find the area of this

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580
that we want to find the area of this
 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.180
that we want to find the area of this
right here where the base is defined by

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190
right here where the base is defined by
 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.129
right here where the base is defined by
this curve and then the ceiling is

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139
this curve and then the ceiling is
 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.010
this curve and then the ceiling is
defined by this surface here XY which I

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020
defined by this surface here XY which I
 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.840
defined by this surface here XY which I
just which I graphed and I rotated in

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850
just which I graphed and I rotated in
 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.379
just which I graphed and I rotated in
two situations now in the last video we

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389
two situations now in the last video we
 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.180
two situations now in the last video we
came up with a well you could argue

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190
came up with a well you could argue
 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.650
came up with a well you could argue
whether it's simple but the idea is well

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660
whether it's simple but the idea is well
 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.719
whether it's simple but the idea is well
let's just take small arc lengths change

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729
let's just take small arc lengths change
 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.300
let's just take small arc lengths change
in arc lengths and multiply them by the

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310
in arc lengths and multiply them by the
 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.659
in arc lengths and multiply them by the
height multiply them by the height at

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669
height multiply them by the height at
 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.420
height multiply them by the height at
that point and those small change in arc

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430
that point and those small change in arc
 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.219
that point and those small change in arc
lengths we call them D s and then the

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229
lengths we call them D s and then the
 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.020
lengths we call them D s and then the
height is just f of X Y at that point

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030
height is just f of X Y at that point
 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.879
height is just f of X Y at that point
and we'll take an infinite sum of these

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889
and we'll take an infinite sum of these
 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.370
and we'll take an infinite sum of these
from T is equal to 0 to t equal to PI

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380
from T is equal to 0 to t equal to PI
 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.590
from T is equal to 0 to t equal to PI
over 2 and then that should give us the

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600
over 2 and then that should give us the
 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.740
over 2 and then that should give us the
area of this wall of this wall right

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750
area of this wall of this wall right
 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.200
area of this wall of this wall right
there so what we said is well to figure

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210
there so what we said is well to figure
 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.670
there so what we said is well to figure
out the area of that we're just going to

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680
out the area of that we're just going to
 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.330
out the area of that we're just going to
take the integral from T is equal to 0

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340
take the integral from T is equal to 0
 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.629
take the integral from T is equal to 0
to T is equal to PI over 2 it doesn't

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639
to T is equal to PI over 2 it doesn't
 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:31.800
to T is equal to PI over 2 it doesn't
make a lot of sense when I write it like

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810
make a lot of sense when I write it like
 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:38.640
make a lot of sense when I write it like
this of f of X Y times or let me be even

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650
this of f of X Y times or let me be even
 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.200
this of f of X Y times or let me be even
better instead of writing f of X Y let

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210
better instead of writing f of X Y let
 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.430
better instead of writing f of X Y let
me just write the actual function let's

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440
me just write the actual function let's
 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.659
me just write the actual function let's
get a little bit more concrete

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669
get a little bit more concrete
 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:48.120
get a little bit more concrete
so f of XY is XY x so the particular XY

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130
so f of XY is XY x so the particular XY
 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.740
so f of XY is XY x so the particular XY
times the little change in our arc

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750
times the little change in our arc
 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.879
times the little change in our arc
length of that point I'm going to be

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889
length of that point I'm going to be
 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.550

very hand wavy here this is all a little

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560
very hand wavy here this is all a little
 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.680
very hand wavy here this is all a little
bit of review of the last video and we

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690
bit of review of the last video and we
 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.629
bit of review of the last video and we
figured out in the last video this

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639
figured out in the last video this
 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.210
figured out in the last video this
change in arc length right here this

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220
change in arc length right here this
 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.420
change in arc length right here this
change in arc length D s we figured out

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430
change in arc length D s we figured out
 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.129
change in arc length D s we figured out
that we could rewrite that as the square

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139
that we could rewrite that as the square
 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:10.200
that we could rewrite that as the square
root of DX versus or the derivative of X

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210
root of DX versus or the derivative of X
 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.870
root of DX versus or the derivative of X
with respect to T squared plus the

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880
with respect to T squared plus the
 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.240
with respect to T squared plus the
derivative of Y with respect to T

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250
derivative of Y with respect to T
 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.450
derivative of Y with respect to T
squared and then all of that times DT

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460
squared and then all of that times DT
 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.580
squared and then all of that times DT
and so I'm just rebuilding the formula

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590
and so I'm just rebuilding the formula
 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.100
and so I'm just rebuilding the formula
that we got in the last video so this

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110
that we got in the last video so this
 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.370
that we got in the last video so this
expression can be re-written as the

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380
expression can be re-written as the
 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.879
expression can be re-written as the

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:34.230
integral from t is equal to 0 to T is
equal to PI over 2 times X Y but you

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240
equal to PI over 2 times X Y but you
 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.589
equal to PI over 2 times X Y but you
know what

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599
know what
 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:36.330
know what
right right from the get-go we want

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340
right right from the get-go we want
 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.980
right right from the get-go we want
everything of entry to be in terms of T

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990
everything of entry to be in terms of T
 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.480
everything of entry to be in terms of T
so instead of an at we instead of

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490
so instead of an at we instead of
 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.930
so instead of an at we instead of
writing

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940
writing
 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.180
writing
x times y let's substitute the

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190
x times y let's substitute the
 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.400
x times y let's substitute the
parametric form so instead of X let's

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410
parametric form so instead of X let's
 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.190
parametric form so instead of X let's
write cosine of T so let me write cosine

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200
write cosine of T so let me write cosine
 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.090
write cosine of T so let me write cosine
of T right that is X X is equal to

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100
of T right that is X X is equal to
 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.180
of T right that is X X is equal to
cosine of T on this curve right X that's

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.190
cosine of T on this curve right X that's
 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.740
cosine of T on this curve right X that's
how we define X in terms of the

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750
how we define X in terms of the
 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.200
how we define X in terms of the
parameter T and then times y which we're

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210
parameter T and then times y which we're
 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.290
parameter T and then times y which we're

define that something is u so you say u
is equal to sine of T and then D u DT

00:10:59.240 --> 00:10:59.250
is equal to sine of T and then D u DT
 

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.680
is equal to sine of T and then D u DT
the derivative of U with respect to T is

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:01.690
the derivative of U with respect to T is
 

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.500
the derivative of U with respect to T is
equal to cosine of T or if you multiply

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:04.510
equal to cosine of T or if you multiply
 

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.800
equal to cosine of T or if you multiply
both sides by the differential DT

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:06.810
both sides by the differential DT
 

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.270
both sides by the differential DT
if we're not going to be too rigorous

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:08.280
if we're not going to be too rigorous
 

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:13.730
if we're not going to be too rigorous
you get D U is equal to cosine of T DT

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:13.740
you get D U is equal to cosine of T DT
 

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.430
you get D U is equal to cosine of T DT
and notice right here I have a U and

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440
and notice right here I have a U and
 

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.940
and notice right here I have a U and
then cosine of T DT this thing right

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:19.950
then cosine of T DT this thing right
 

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.310
then cosine of T DT this thing right
here that thing is equal to D of U and

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320
here that thing is equal to D of U and
 

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.020
here that thing is equal to D of U and
then we just have to redefine the

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:24.030
then we just have to redefine the
 

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:27.140
then we just have to redefine the
boundaries when T is equal to zero

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:27.150
boundaries when T is equal to zero
 

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.820
boundaries when T is equal to zero
let me so we're going to have this thing

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:28.830
let me so we're going to have this thing
 

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.090
let me so we're going to have this thing
is going to turn into the integral

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:31.100
is going to turn into the integral
 

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.710
is going to turn into the integral
instead of T is equal to zero when T is

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720
instead of T is equal to zero when T is
 

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.930
instead of T is equal to zero when T is
equal to zero what is u equal to sine of

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:35.940
equal to zero what is u equal to sine of
 

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.780
equal to zero what is u equal to sine of
zero is zero so this goes from U is

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:38.790
zero is zero so this goes from U is
 

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.890
zero is zero so this goes from U is
equal to zero when T is PI over two T is

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:42.900
equal to zero when T is PI over two T is
 

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.260
equal to zero when T is PI over two T is
PI over 2 sine of PI over 2 is 1 so when

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:45.270
PI over 2 sine of PI over 2 is 1 so when
 

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.720
PI over 2 sine of PI over 2 is 1 so when
T is PI over 2 U is equal to 1 so from U

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:47.730
T is PI over 2 U is equal to 1 so from U
 

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.120
T is PI over 2 U is equal to 1 so from U
is equal to 0 to U is equal to 1 just

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.130
is equal to 0 to U is equal to 1 just
 

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.790
is equal to 0 to U is equal to 1 just
redid the boundaries in terms of U and

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800
redid the boundaries in terms of U and
 

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.250
redid the boundaries in terms of U and
then we have instead of sine of T I'm

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:55.260
then we have instead of sine of T I'm
 

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.650
then we have instead of sine of T I'm
going to write U and instead of cosine

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:57.660
going to write U and instead of cosine
 

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.380
going to write U and instead of cosine
of T DT I'm just going to write D U and

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:00.390
of T DT I'm just going to write D U and
 

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:02.900
of T DT I'm just going to write D U and
now this is a super easy integral in

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:02.910
now this is a super easy integral in
 

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.930
now this is a super easy integral in
terms of U this is just equal to the

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:05.940
terms of U this is just equal to the
 

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.010
terms of U this is just equal to the
antiderivative of U is U 1/2 times u

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:10.020
antiderivative of U is U 1/2 times u
 

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.050
antiderivative of U is U 1/2 times u
squared right we just raised the

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.060
squared right we just raised the
 

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.210
squared right we just raised the
exponent and then divided by that raised

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.220
exponent and then divided by that raised
 

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.730
exponent and then divided by that raised
exponent so 1/2 u squared and we're

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740
exponent so 1/2 u squared and we're
 

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.880
exponent so 1/2 u squared and we're
going to evaluate it from 0 to 1 and so

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:19.890
going to evaluate it from 0 to 1 and so
 

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:24.650
going to evaluate it from 0 to 1 and so
this is going to be equal to 1/2 times 1

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660
this is going to be equal to 1/2 times 1
 

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.320
this is going to be equal to 1/2 times 1
squared minus 1/2 times 0 squared which

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:29.330
squared minus 1/2 times 0 squared which
 

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.260
squared minus 1/2 times 0 squared which
is equal to 1/2 times 1 minus 0 which is

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:33.270
is equal to 1/2 times 1 minus 0 which is
 

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.870
is equal to 1/2 times 1 minus 0 which is
equal to 1/2 so we did all that work and

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880
equal to 1/2 so we did all that work and
 

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.110
equal to 1/2 so we did all that work and
we got a nice simple answer the area the

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120
we got a nice simple answer the area the
 

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.840
we got a nice simple answer the area the
