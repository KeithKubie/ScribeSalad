00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.250
&gt;&gt; You're right I think tracking things over time, a

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.470
line chart might be better. Maybe with two lines, one for.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sounds good.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.000
&gt;&gt; Alright, so I changed it to a line chart, and I

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.096
think actually in hindsight, I may have liked the bar chart more.

00:00:14.096 --> 00:00:14.212
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:14.212 --> 00:00:16.810
&gt;&gt; But this is, this is good, and there was even an option for a

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.980
cumulative, so I could have kept track of the total amount of money I'd earned.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.030
&gt;&gt; Up to every certain date, which is pretty cool.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
