00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.932
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:10.460
WAYNE SUTTON: I'm Wayne Sutton.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.835
MELINDA EPLER:
I'm Melinda Epler.

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:13.580
We're the founders
of Change Catalyst.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.800
We empower inclusive and
sustainable innovation

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.150
globally.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.630
Welcome to the series
sponsored by Women Techmakers,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.590
Google's program that provides
visibility, community,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.650
and resources for
women in technology.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.540
Together, we're
helping tech hubs

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.300
to develop more inclusive
cultures, programs, and spaces.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.560
WAYNE SUTTON: Studies show that
diversity and inclusion efforts

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.384
must come as a mandate from the
top in order to be successful.

00:00:37.384 --> 00:00:39.800
Leaders set the values and the
culture of the organization

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.167
and determine the
measures for success.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.000
MELINDA EPLER: The first
step is for leaders

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.370
to personally believe
diversity and inclusion

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.680
are right for your
organization and to drive

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.390
this home to your staff.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.540
In order to do that, you need to
align your diversity inclusion

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.340
efforts with your
business goals.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.420
WAYNE SUTTON: For instance,
how would diversity

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.220
affect your market growth,
improve product service design,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.970
and develop
disruptive innovation?

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.345
MELINDA EPLER:
How will inclusion

00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:07.040
affect your staff productivity,
customer satisfaction,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.540
and overall profitability?

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.530
WAYNE SUTTON: How will
a diverse staff better

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.390
attract, educate, and support
a diverse tech population?

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.460
MELINDA EPLER: As a leader,
you must continuously

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.130
advocate for your
organization to be inclusive.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.650
This means you have to
get uncomfortable and be

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.900
self-aware of your own biases.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.200
Leaders must be empathetic to
differences and to the barriers

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.570
under-represented
people in tech face.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.460
We call this leading
with empathy.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.830
WAYNE SUTTON: With leadership
comes a responsibility

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.010
to bring diverse voices into
your decision-making process.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.460
It's essential for leadership
to advocate for the company's

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.950
diversity and inclusion
and for leadership

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.050
to be diverse themselves.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.200
First and foremost, create
a pathway for current staff

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.510
to become leaders in
your organization.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.670
Also, offer
leadership development

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.137
pathways for future leaders
to rise in your organization.

00:01:55.137 --> 00:01:57.470
MELINDA EPLER: Ensure your
promotion policies and salary

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.440
compensation are equitable
across all groups.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.940
And when doing an
executive search,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.280
you might want to
institute the Rooney Rule,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.340
so that you're viewing
diverse candidates.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.000
WAYNE SUTTON: Embed diversity
and inclusion strategies

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.460
into your succession planning.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.043
MELINDA EPLER: Some
organizations also

00:02:12.043 --> 00:02:15.064
develop a diversity committee
or inclusion advisory board.

00:02:15.064 --> 00:02:17.480
You can read more about each
of these via the links below.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.730
WAYNE SUTTON: If you have
one, your board of directors

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.550
has an important impact on
executive leadership, role

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.100
models, accountability,
and decision making.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.980
Carefully consider the diversity
of new members of the board,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.690
in order to develop a
diverse and inclusive guiding

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.815
body for your organization.

00:02:31.815 --> 00:02:34.064
MELINDA EPLER: You might
also consider associate board

00:02:34.064 --> 00:02:34.580
memberships.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.140
Usually, these are
non-voting members

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.480
of your board of directors
or advisory board

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.539
who bring a diverse
perspective to the table.

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:42.830
We've created some specific
templates and resources you

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.501
can access via the links below.

00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:47.000
WAYNE SUTTON: Lastly, just like
as your product development,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.520
the most important piece
of diversity inclusion

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.540
is to start somewhere and then
continue to improve and grow

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.010
your efforts over time.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.350
MELINDA EPLER: We've just
given you 11 different ways

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.992
to lead on inclusion.

00:02:58.992 --> 00:03:00.450
WAYNE SUTTON: Start
with one today.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.210
And what would that one be?

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.585
MELINDA EPLER:
And then, join us,

00:03:03.585 --> 00:03:06.110
as we go deeper into cultural
change, external programs,

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.347
and physical spaces of tech
hubs in the next videos.

00:03:09.347 --> 00:03:11.180

create inclusive tech hubs

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.978
around the world.
