00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.670
Will a vacuum chamber float on water or sink and what will happen when you crack the vacuum chamber underwater

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.370
Well Maxament. I think we've come up with a good way to make some small disposable vacuum chambers. So let's try it out

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.720
Rather than using a full-size vacuum chamber and putting it into say a large tub of water or swimming pool

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.659
We're gonna see if we can't make a very small vacuum container, just using a soda bottle. Here's the basic idea:

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.569
We're going to empty out our soda bottle, drill a small hole into the lid and add a rubber stopper

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.160
We'll put the whole bottle and stopper inside of a vacuum chamber and suck all of the air out

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.860
The stopper should prevent any air rushing back into our bottle, at which point we can see how well it floats on water

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.180
compared to a bottle full of air

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.620
the first step in turning our little soda bottle here into a vacuum chamber is of course going to be emptying out what's already in it

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.220
Cream soda guys

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.259
One more thing that I do want to do just to see if we're getting our vacuum is

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.609
I'm gonna drop a marshmallow down into this bottle. So it won't have a complete vacuum

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.740
It'll be a vacuum with a marshmallow in it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.359
But I think that will really help us see whether or not we're getting the effect. We want this piece of tape

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.870
It's gonna be pretty loose. You can't really see it

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.779
But there should be just enough space for air to escape out of the bottle. All right time to fire this up

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.770
Give it a test

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.529
Let's take our entire bottle with the modified lid

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.669
Place it inside our vacuum chamber and let's drop one more

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.329
Marshmallow down into that vacuum chamber so we can see the difference between the two, pull out all the air and see what happens.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.439
I spy two expanding marshmallows. Just what I was hoping to see. Think we've got a pretty good vacuum

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.640
Now let's see what happens if we add air back in

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.750
That marshmallow doesn't look as squished down as this one did so I think we did manage to keep a vacuum in there

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.869
In fact, I'm gonna pull up on the rubber and see if the marshmallow changes. Oh

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.489
Definitely, so, we did have a vacuum in there and then I broke the seal and now we don't have a vacuum in there

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.619
It's just full of air and a marshmallow again. So we confirmed that it does hold a vacuum or at least lower pressure

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.550
It might not be a complete vacuum, but it's much closer than it is now

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.169
You can see how squished that marshmallow got. Poor guy. Same thing one more time this time though

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.800
We just aren't going to break the seal as long as it looks like everything is working

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.300
I'm gonna put another layer of tape over it to really hold down the rubber seal. Hopefully that'll prevent any leaks

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.140
You know, I am providing lateral stabilization

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.000
Trying to hold the bottle from falling over but I am not holding it up at all

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.060
In fact, even if I push it down under the water you can see that it pops back up quickly.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.920
So, confirmed. A vacuum chamber does float on water

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.939
well, I didn't actually think that a bottle with a vacuum in it was going to sink when we think about a bottle floating we

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.119
Think about the air inside of it being what keeps it afloat

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.589
what really makes the difference is whether the total density of a bottle and

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.980
Whatever it contains is higher or lower than the total density of the water that it

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.660
displaces the bottle full of air weighs less than the same volume of water

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.000
A bottle full of vacuum actually weighs even less than that

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.649
We don't really think of air as having much weight

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.860
But it does have mass it's mostly made of nitrogen oxygen and a little bit of carbon dioxide and some other trace elements

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.540
That air while very lightweight to us does have some mass to it

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.070
However, we were able to test and confirm that a bottle with a vacuum in

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.959
it does float on water and now it's time to move on to the second part of the common request which is to see what

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.449
Happens if you break a vacuum chamber underwater. Well, once again, I think they mean while it has a vacuum

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.070
So let's pull all the air out of our bottle once again, and then try and crack it underwater

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.880
poor marshmallow friend has now been inflated and deflated and re-inflated and

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.100
(Sighs) Thatâ€™s tough

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.360
Oh, that's so cool

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.090
Yeah water is just

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.300
spraying in there super fast

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.200
Yeah, It's kind of cool because those bubbles are a vacuum that are just surrounded by water and as the water

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.220
fills in all the spaces they are dissipating

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.180
not all of them are vacuum though because some of them stay and are starting to float up toward the surface

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.010
Maxament, Thank you for your suggestions

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.130
this has been great to

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.040
experiment with in fact that looked so cool that I think we're gonna have to scale that up and maybe do one of our

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.860
Full-size vacuum jars just get all the water on

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.539
It find a.. maybe aswimming pool or something at least a really big container of water

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.409
And something where I can get a lot more momentum and just whack it with a hammer

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.480
Get it to really crack open all once maybe do that a few different times. I don't know. This is really cool

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.210
