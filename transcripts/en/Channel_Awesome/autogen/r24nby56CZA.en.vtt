00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 align:start position:0%
was still things that were like my
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
was still things that were like my
initial<00:00:49.440><c> thought</c><00:00:49.590><c> was</c><00:00:49.710><c> like</c><00:00:49.800><c> maybe</c><00:00:50.010><c> it</c><00:00:50.160><c> was</c>

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 align:start position:0%
initial thought was like maybe it was
 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.479 align:start position:0%
initial thought was like maybe it was
gonna<00:00:50.370><c> be</c><00:00:50.550><c> a</c><00:00:50.579><c> garage</c><00:00:51.000><c> that</c><00:00:51.980><c> the</c><00:00:52.980><c> child</c><00:00:53.250><c> had</c>

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 align:start position:0%
gonna be a garage that the child had
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.979 align:start position:0%
gonna be a garage that the child had
some<00:00:53.670><c> juego</c><00:00:53.940><c> display</c><00:00:54.329><c> and</c><00:00:54.510><c> he</c><00:00:54.600><c> just</c><00:00:54.809><c> hasn't</c>

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 align:start position:0%
some juego display and he just hasn't
 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.900 align:start position:0%
some juego display and he just hasn't
come<00:00:55.500><c> back</c><00:00:55.710><c> and</c><00:00:55.949><c> played</c><00:00:56.129><c> with</c><00:00:56.309><c> in</c><00:00:56.430><c> a</c><00:00:56.489><c> long</c><00:00:56.640><c> time</c>

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 align:start position:0%
come back and played with in a long time
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
come back and played with in a long time
so<00:00:57.180><c> it's</c><00:00:57.300><c> like</c><00:00:57.329><c> Toy</c><00:00:57.570><c> Story</c><00:00:57.899><c> the</c><00:00:57.989><c> way</c><00:00:58.230><c> goes</c><00:00:58.379><c> in</c>

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 align:start position:0%
so it's like Toy Story the way goes in
 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.260 align:start position:0%
so it's like Toy Story the way goes in
run<00:00:58.649><c> amuck</c><00:00:58.890><c> everything</c><00:00:59.280><c> I</c><00:00:59.520><c> don't</c><00:00:59.699><c> know</c><00:00:59.820><c> so</c><00:01:00.090><c> so</c>

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 align:start position:0%
run amuck everything I don't know so so
 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.330 align:start position:0%
run amuck everything I don't know so so
so<00:01:00.480><c> the</c><00:01:00.660><c> reason</c><00:01:01.140><c> this</c><00:01:01.410><c> works</c><00:01:01.620><c> out</c><00:01:01.800><c> really</c><00:01:02.010><c> well</c>

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
so the reason this works out really well
 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.549 align:start position:0%
so the reason this works out really well
is<00:01:02.640><c> because</c><00:01:03.300><c> because</c><00:01:03.930><c> it's</c><00:01:04.140><c> a</c><00:01:04.229><c> kid</c><00:01:04.409><c> playing</c>

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
is because because it's a kid playing
 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.060 align:start position:0%
is because because it's a kid playing
with<00:01:04.830><c> all</c><00:01:04.979><c> this</c><00:01:05.390><c> he</c><00:01:06.390><c> knows</c><00:01:06.780><c> all</c><00:01:07.320><c> the</c><00:01:07.560><c> cliches</c>

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 align:start position:0%
with all this he knows all the cliches
 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.219 align:start position:0%
with all this he knows all the cliches
he's<00:01:08.430><c> representing</c><00:01:09.090><c> all</c><00:01:09.270><c> the</c><00:01:09.479><c> cliches</c><00:01:09.869><c> he's</c>
