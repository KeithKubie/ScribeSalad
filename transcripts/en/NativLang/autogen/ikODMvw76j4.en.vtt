00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.600
 Here is a story about a language that can create incredibly long words 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.400
 and why he was alone in Europe, surrounded by languages ​​that work so differently. 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.999
 Central Europe - many peoples with ragged borders. 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:20.970
 But, let me show you a language card. 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.300
 What do you see? 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.710
 Probably more pieces. 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.000
 Shortly German, some Romance, Slavic languages. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.699
 And this piece here - Hungarian 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.410
 Now look again at the language family map. 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.590
 The Hungarian piece is a language island surrounded by all Indo-European countries! 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.050
 After learning about this isolation and calculating how many Hungarian words there are, 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.200
 I just had to try 'magyar nyelv', the Hungarian language, for myself. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.510
 But, I'm not a Hungarian. 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.600
 Practice with me and fix me, but this story is too good to not share. 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.000
 Go back 1122 years, until the Pannonian lowland, flat, without the sea and 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.900
 surrounded by mountains, she argued for her 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.180
 And who better to end the disputes of tribes of nomadic horsemen that the Europeans called 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.800
 , but they themselves were called by the name of their most important tribe 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.920
 Led by Arpad, 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.720
 The Magyars conquered the valley in 894 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.980
 honfoglalás (founding) 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.060
 To lash, S is y, and here's how you write with 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.880
 but do not exchange or get them, Hungarian! 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.240
 For the decades ahead, these masters of the bow and the horseshoe have established their authority 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:42.920
 separating southern Slavs from other Slavs, and irritating peoples to Italy, France and Spain. 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.480
 It is said that they had westerners on their knees, praying: 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.549
 Arpad's successors managed to improve relations with the West. 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.820
 Just to the Millennium, Stefan I founded the European Kingdom 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.760
 a surprising victory for Christianity. 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.040
 But success has isolated the Hungarian. 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:12.940
 And by the end of this story, this language with its terribly long words will show how isolated the Hungarian is, and it is not. 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.400
 Do you remember my adventure for the longest word? 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.020
 These languages ​​extended words by taking a basic word and combining it with another base. 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.290
 For example, there are two Buddha and Pest cities, uniting and having one name! 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.780
 But that's not the reason why the Hungarian has such long words. 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.600
 There are base words to which grammatical suffixes are added, especially at the end. 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.310
 Suffocation for everything, I swear! 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.370
 The verb '' jelent '' means reporting or reporting. 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.600
 It's only made of smaller pieces, but anyway. 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.700
 Let it be easy. 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.220
 We put the prefix '' be- '' and the action is internal 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.580
 Add the recurring suffix 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.640
 And you are reporting yourself. 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.120
 Also change the 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.720
 A, and do not forget the suffixes for times and ways, for example about the potential -ne- (would) 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.360
 There are millions of forms that shame even the Latin 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.500
 Example ember (human) 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.740
 For example, you want to give something to this man. 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.880
 You will need the due date: 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.260
 If there are several people, they are: 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.180
 And if there is anything for them all: 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.000
 Forget those scary-sounding maturities 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.500
 They are just forms to DO, RETURN TO, ENTRY IN, EXIT FROM 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.100
 and so on. 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.819
 Same for adjectives. 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.620
 Nagy means "great," but let's add something: 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.940
 it means "like-great" wonderful. 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.540
 Using the same suffixes, you can have many wonderful things and can save them for some wonderful: 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.800
 or for many wonderful people: 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.099
 Oh, there is more! 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.440
 Example suffix for comparing wonderful things to find out what's more wonderful: 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.620
 And a superlative prefix for the most wonderful: 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.640
 Wait before you rest, more suffixes: 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.830
 Do you now see why the Hungarian words can be so difficult? 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.769
 These millions of roots and suffixes seem to be 'glued', so the linguists have called that kind of 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.460
 creating words "agglutination" with the Latin root: 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.000
 Some linguists are skeptical, but the concept is accepted 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.500
 part of the glue supporting the Hungarian is the harmony with the vowels 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.610
 Have you noticed all is, eh, eh? 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.220
 These e-tags in the suffix are there to match the verb in the base 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.780
 For this the set of ember is: 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.060
 , but mouths are: 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.440
 This is the initial Hungarian grammar, but is so foreign to his neighbors 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.440
 But why? 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.340
 We know where it is, but where did it come from? 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.230
 The hint of his start is right in his words. 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:08.280
 Historical linguists followed closely related words to Hungarian-like languages. 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.600
 Nowhere near Hungary. 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.500
 Far away, far ... in Western Siberia 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.200
 Together with the Hungarian language, these languages ​​are part of the Ural language family. 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.600
 The ancestors of the Hungarians migrated from Siberia to the southwest, carrying their longs 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.600
 words on the threshold of the Pannonian Lowland, where our history began. 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.990
 Hungarian, after all, you are not so alone. 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.800
 Just your language relatives are far from you.
