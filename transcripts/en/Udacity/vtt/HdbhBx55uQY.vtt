00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.689
Once the user's location preference 
has been stored,

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:05.800
when do we make use of it? 
We need the preferred location

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.060
when we query the weather service. 
Luckily, in lesson two,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.620
we modified fetch weather task 
to accept a location parameter.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.309
We hard coded it to be 
the Mountain View zip code,

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.500
but now we should use 
the location stored in shared preferences.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.000
We haven't explicitly shown 
you how to do this,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.940
so you might need 
to do some digging around

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.580
on the Ander developer site
to figure out how to do it.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.850
Once you've made the change, 
check the box to continue.
