00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.100
Guys, today, we are here at
a store called Bricks &amp; Minifigs

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.357
with our friend Cory.

00:01:06.357 --> 00:01:07.950
This is a Lego store.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.900
It's...

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.480
Describe it to us a little bit.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.200
At Bricks &amp; Minifigs,
we sell all things Lego.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.276
We buy back Lego,

00:01:14.276 --> 00:01:17.250
and we resell pre-owned sets,
loose minifigures,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.448
bulk pieces, you can build
your own mini figure,

00:01:19.448 --> 00:01:21.700
and you can even host
your birthday party here.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.664
It's amazing.

00:01:22.664 --> 00:01:24.509
We came in here to film,

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.240
and we played
for an hour.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.980
This place is amazing.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.420
So today, we want to do
an experiment of Lego.

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.194
We have done some stuff
with Lego pieces before,

00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:36.400
and today's adventure is gonna
be a little bit more destructive

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.980
than some other stuff.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.574
Lego is made from
what's called ABS plastic,

00:01:40.574 --> 00:01:44.150
and ABS plastic is well known
for not doing so well

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.660
if it comes
in contact with acetone.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.960
And so, our thought is we
can get a lot of acetone,

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.500
and a lot of Lego,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.152
and see what happens
when they meet.

00:01:52.152 --> 00:01:55.351
Our plan is to destroy
something Star Wars themed,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.000
and in fact,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.200
we're going to try
and melt the Millennium Falcon.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.600
Nate, we don't have a fish tank
big enough for this.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.187
Okay, I believe this is
the largest Lego set

00:02:08.187 --> 00:02:09.020
that is made.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.140
So we're going to go
for not this Millennium Falcon,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.120
but this Millennium Falcon.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.660
We're going to set
up a fish tank,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.297
and then we're going
to pour a lot of acetone in,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.840
and just submerge
the Millennium Falcon in it.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.600
So this should be pretty great.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.100
So I mean,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.280
we can give it back to you,
but like in a bucket.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.560
Well, yeah.

00:02:28.562 --> 00:02:29.892
Well, okay.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.520
Okay.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.950
So if we're going
to destroy one of these,

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.050
then I think we need to see

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.127
how it's built from the ground
up, don't you think?

00:02:35.127 --> 00:02:35.750
Oh, definitely.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.660
Because there's, it's
not just outward,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.290
like there's the inner pieces you
can actually see inside this.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.040
Yeah.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.740
I want to see
how this is put together.

00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:43.650
We'll build one,

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.540
and then we'll see what happens
when we dunk it in acetone.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:03:16.280
[Music]

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.182
We've got a Millennium
Falcon set up on a tank.

00:03:18.182 --> 00:03:21.950
We've also got it sitting
over this large plastic tub,

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.850
and that's because it's supposed
to be water tight,

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.550
and acetone shouldn't
destroy the silicone

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.592
that's holding these panes
of glass together,

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:30.800
but just in case it starts

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.040
to leak, we don't want it
to all fail catastrophically,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.300
and just pour
acetone everywhere.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.680
So if it does start to leak,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.200
it should mostly
land in this tub.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.140
And so it's just a little bit
of a precaution.

00:03:41.147 --> 00:03:42.382
So as sad as this is,

00:03:42.382 --> 00:03:44.979
we still want as many angles
as possible of the destruction

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:46.599
that we're going
to be causing here.

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.766
So we've got lots of GoPros.

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:48.902
We've got lots of lights.

00:03:48.902 --> 00:03:50.940
We're going to make sure
that everything's time elapsed.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.940
All right, we've got
10 gallons of acetone.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.092
Might do it.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.360
Let's start pouring.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:08.000
[Music]

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.580
Is that looking cloudy?

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.920
I don't want to look cloudy.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.700
That's super cloudy actually.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.440
You can't even see through that.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.800
I think it's just dissolving
the white bottom piece already.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.000
Yeah, where I'm pouring,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.867
it's already like
smoothed it out a lot.

00:04:22.867 --> 00:04:23.633
It looks like...

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.680
I'm going to pour on the clear,
see what happens.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.377
All right.

00:04:29.377 --> 00:04:31.130
This is starting to dissolve

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.740
the Lego a lot faster
than I thought it was going to.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.880
The spots where we've
been pouring it,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.877
like it's removing
detail already.

00:04:38.877 --> 00:04:42.168
Like I'm pretty sure the sides
were that's been poured on,

00:04:42.168 --> 00:04:43.294
like it no longer has

00:04:43.294 --> 00:04:46.000
the word Lego on the bumps
and stuff like that.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.400
Acetone is actually very clear.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.640
So what we're seeing,
all of this cloudiness,

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.538
is when we're pouring it

00:04:52.538 --> 00:04:57.000
in the white bottom of it was
just dissolving that quickly.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.940
Hopefully, it'll clear up just a little just,
just enough for us to see it.

00:05:00.952 --> 00:05:02.200
I think it might settle.

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:02.802
Yeah.

00:05:04.452 --> 00:05:07.050
So even this top part here
that isn't under,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.300
but it's just been splashed on,
look at this.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.241
That's my fingernail just
scraping right into that.

00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:13.950
Well, you can see right here,

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.600
where I first started
pouring, its actually...

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.100
[inaudible] and let it sit now.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.442
Yeah, that's stuck
to my fingers.

00:05:20.442 --> 00:05:32.800
[Music]

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.640
Quick update.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.247
This is now been sitting in the
tank of acetone for about an hour,

00:05:36.247 --> 00:05:37.091
and unfortunately,

00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:38.599
right as we pour
the acetone in,

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.500
and immediately
started getting cloudy.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.695
We think that might be

00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:44.142
because the white base
that it was sitting on,

00:05:44.142 --> 00:05:46.904
and the blue background were
actually not Lego brand.

00:05:46.904 --> 00:05:48.520
They were an off-brand,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.151
and yeah, it was probably
a different formula the plastic

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.720
that dissolves even faster,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.520
and so, it just
went cloudy immediately.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.330
Now, you can see

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.297
that the acetone is
basically all blue, even

00:05:57.297 --> 00:05:59.950
though there's only just those
two blue plates in the back.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.420
So we are going
to try this again,

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.920
including destroying
a second Millennium Falcon,

00:06:06.922 --> 00:06:09.650
because we want to start
with clear acetone,

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.240
and make it so you can
actually see what's happening.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.358
It may still go cloudy as
some of Lego dissolves,

00:06:15.358 --> 00:06:17.549
but we wanted to at
least start clear,

00:06:17.549 --> 00:06:18.673
and then get cloudy.

00:06:18.673 --> 00:06:21.650
So now, we're going to try
and take some of those out,

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.700
and see this is just like mush.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.852
Oh, no.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.160
The stickers are
almost been staying.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.340
Let's see what happens if I try
and lift the whole thing.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.160
I-- Oh.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.940
Lift, lift slowly

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.880
because it-- Lifts really slow
because when it breaks,

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.438
it's gonna splash down a lot.

00:06:38.438 --> 00:06:39.057
I got it.

00:06:39.057 --> 00:06:39.535
I got it.

00:06:39.535 --> 00:06:40.366
This piece--

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:41.460
There goes that one.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.860
Okay, it's gone.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.160
I'm sorry Han,
Chewie, forgive me.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.440
You guys see this.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.400
It's like, you can kind
of see the Lego pattern left

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.640
as it just dissolves
against my hand.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.340
Oh no.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.484
Bowl full of spaceship.

00:07:00.484 --> 00:07:04.500
This will no longer be making
the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.507
Oh, it has weakened my glove.

00:07:06.507 --> 00:07:07.750
We wear nitrile gloves,

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.980
which are fairly
chemically resistant.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.512
But this has been too much.

00:07:11.512 --> 00:07:12.362
Mine's gone.

00:07:12.362 --> 00:07:16.050
Prolonged contact with acetone
in your skin is not a good idea.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.350
It's not like gonna
instantly cause problems,

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.300
but it's definitely

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.738
not something you
want to keep doing.

00:07:20.738 --> 00:07:22.997
You use this stuff to take
off nail polish and stuff,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.760
but I'm still going to go
rinse my hands anyways,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.440
because it went
right through on me.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.320
I'm gonna try something else.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.000
We're going to fill
the tank with acetone.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.120
No base plate,
no backdrop to it.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.340
And then we're just going
to lower our Millennium Falcon

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.000
down into it.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.296
I have done very small-scale
tests of putting Lego

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.760
in acetone that way before,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.440
and we didn't get any cloudy
when I did that.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.900
So hopefully, we'll get
a better result like this.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:51.540
[Music]

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.080
If this spills,

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.580
we saying goodbye
to this kitchen.

00:07:55.602 --> 00:07:57.046
Turn on the fan,

00:07:57.046 --> 00:07:59.992
and just leave
the house for a day.

00:08:00.852 --> 00:08:04.000
So there's only one redeeming
quality about melting this now.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.603
Nate has included himself
in the melting process.

00:08:06.603 --> 00:08:07.738
Got to have a pilot.

00:08:07.738 --> 00:08:10.535
So we've blended Grant,
and now we're melting Nate.

00:08:10.535 --> 00:08:11.300
I'll be fine.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.072
Okay.

00:08:12.072 --> 00:08:12.752
Let go.

00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:13.679
I don't wanna.

00:08:13.679 --> 00:08:14.341
Let it go.

00:08:14.341 --> 00:08:15.202
There you go.

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:19.808
Carefully lower it down,
here, filling the acetone.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.700
Oh no.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.960
Much less cloudy.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.200
All right, Yoda,
pull it up out of the swamp.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.620
Come on, you can do it.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.459
Dude, do not.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.000
There is no dry.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.460
It's something, definitely.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.880
Yeah, and you can see,

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.400
so it's hard to see
on the camera right now,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.420
we'll see zoom in later.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.995
But if you're actually
looking at it,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
the red color is actually
already seeping away.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.520
Oh, it is.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.018
It is.

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:38.604
You see that?

00:08:38.604 --> 00:08:40.462
All right, let's let
this sit for a while,

00:08:40.462 --> 00:08:42.931
and just observe
the destruction.

00:08:43.532 --> 00:08:45.460
I do like distraction.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:09:19.820
[Music]

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.320
We've left this in
for about three hours.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.320
And as you can see,

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.940
we have achieved
pretty total destruction.

00:09:27.943 --> 00:09:29.262
Oh, it's all over.

00:09:29.262 --> 00:09:29.960
You did that.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.564
Everything.

00:09:30.564 --> 00:09:31.800
I shouldn't touch it.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.180
There's just like there's one
centerpiece holding itself up.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.200
There's a couple of arch
shaped pieces of Lego in there,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.080
and those seem to be...

00:09:39.088 --> 00:09:40.677
They haven't melted at all.

00:09:40.677 --> 00:09:41.568
Oddly resistant.

00:09:41.568 --> 00:09:42.862
I'm going to touch it.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.540
Oh, oh, no.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.620
It's just barely
supported right now.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.180
This is the end of
the Millennium Falcon, you guys.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.960
Oh, it's--

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.300
No, now, it's a boat.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:54.800
Look at that.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.692
So I can just like scrape off,

00:09:57.932 --> 00:10:01.292
and then these arches
are like untouched.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.600
Okay, so not untouched.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.450
It's very fragile.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.050
But like...

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.495
So a lot of the bricks,

00:10:06.495 --> 00:10:09.762
they seriously like swelled up,
absorbed the acetone,

00:10:09.802 --> 00:10:11.037
and look at that goo.

00:10:11.037 --> 00:10:13.661
But these, they're like
the exact same shape,

00:10:13.661 --> 00:10:16.955
so I'm guessing there's like
different densities of Lego.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.120
Oh no.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.055
I was going to try and see

00:10:19.055 --> 00:10:20.440
if I could unsnap
any of these Lego,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.141
see if any of--

00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:22.650
And they are still
in the center.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:23.220
Okay?

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.150
No, I think that's
a no right there.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.920
So this piece right here,

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.820
it has like these little
pegs on the side.

00:10:29.832 --> 00:10:32.715
And so I think there's
a structural grade of Lego,

00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:34.608
and a less structural
grade of Lego.

00:10:34.608 --> 00:10:35.871
It's not swollen up.

00:10:35.871 --> 00:10:38.650
You can still clearly
read Lego on the bumps,

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:42.120
and everything else
hours ago became swollen

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.950
and illegible and really soft.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.060
Oh, hey, I found
another survived piece,

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.540
because you can see
it's still dry.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.492
Nothing touched that.

00:10:48.492 --> 00:10:50.510
It was just like
enclosed entirely.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:54.240
Yeah, but pulling it apart kind
of feels like a caramel popcorn.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.080
This is a rescue attempt.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.350
I'm going to try
and pull my mini figure out.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.780
He escaped the cockpit.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.200
I have become liquid,

00:11:03.382 --> 00:11:05.682
and I just got cut
in half with a pair of tongs.

00:11:05.682 --> 00:11:06.841
Hang on, I can fix you.

00:11:06.841 --> 00:11:07.446
Don't worry.

00:11:07.446 --> 00:11:08.152
I've got this.

00:11:08.302 --> 00:11:09.260
Good luck.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.495
There, you're fine.

00:11:10.495 --> 00:11:11.150
See?

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.950
I look great.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:12.800
You're fine.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.740
Oh, I think we should
now take the remains

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.250
of this Millennium Falcon
back to the nice people

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.400
who lent it to us.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.260
Yeah, they did ask for it back.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.640
We are back at the
Bricks &amp; Minifigs store,

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.414
and we're here to present Cory

00:11:26.414 --> 00:11:28.858
with the remains
of our Millennium Falcon.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.220
&gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
&gt;&gt; There you go.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.300
Just the way you gave it to us.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.880
What did you do to my baby?

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.620
I'm so sorry.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.260
Quick reminder.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.540
Before.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.340
After.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.000
Oh my gosh.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:40.800
Okay.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.900
So how many gallons of acetone?

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.940
I think we used to 8.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:44.940
8 gallons of acetone.

00:11:44.942 --> 00:11:45.742
Yeah.

00:11:45.742 --> 00:11:48.540
And then several days
to evaporate, I'm guessing.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.880
Yeah, we poured
most of it off,

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.300
but we didn't like--

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.400
We didn't want to
poor everything off,

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.680
because there was a lot
of like liquid Lego sludge

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.020
in it as well.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.220
So we wanted to let
it settle quite a bit.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.700
I got to say,
my favorite part is

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.460
that they're just still
a couple of pieces

00:12:03.474 --> 00:12:04.779
that didn't go anywhere.

00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:06.511
So like, this is the cockpit,

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.780
and it's not clear
anymore obviously.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.340
Like, it should be clear,

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.820
and now it's
very opaque plastic.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.160
But it's still intact.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.620
You guys are braver than I,

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.540
because man, to do
that to such a wonderful sight.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.335
It's true.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.600
Fortunately, we still have one.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.775
We're not going
to ruin this one.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.980
Okay, good.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.780
As he drops it, right?

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.620
Maybe don't let
Nate hold it anymore.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.160
Okay.

00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:31.780
Wait, this one you can--

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.560
Now, this one.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.380
&gt;&gt; Whoa. Whoa.
&gt;&gt; Put that down.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.760
Come on.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.780
Really.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:38.860
Guys, that's not all,

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.877
we've always got more
for you to see.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.420
This box up here at the top will
take you to our latest video.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.620
That box at the bottom will take

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.300
you to what YouTube thinks
you should be watching next.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.920
And if you hit this bomb
in the middle,

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.480
it will subscribe you,

00:12:47.484 --> 00:12:48.601
so you never miss
out on the fun.

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:50.020
Don't forge to ring that bell,

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.140
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:51.860
Talk to you then.
