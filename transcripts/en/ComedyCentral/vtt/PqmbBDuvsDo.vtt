and Nightly Show

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:16.516
(audience cheers)

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.718
and he's the co-host
of the new music series

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:20.687 align:start size:94% position:6%

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.323 align:start position:0%
and you can catch him at
Harrah's Resort in Atlantic City

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.725 align:start size:97% position:3%
Saturday July 9th,
legendary TV host, comedian,

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.594
and actor Arsenio
Hall, everybody!

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:28.561
(audience applause)

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.396
Yes!

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.733
That's right.

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.901
And for everyone at home
enjoying our conversation

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:35.902 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:39.739 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now, over the
course of two weeks,

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.542 align:start position:0%
Trump really seems to be falling
apart with his candidacy.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:43.810
I don't know if he is;

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.944
But he fired his
campaign manager.

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:46.279 align:start size:84% position:16%
His campaign
virtually has no cash.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:47.714
His numbers are falling.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.916 align:start size:88% position:13%
I think his unfavorables
like are at 61%

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.184
or something like that.

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.585 align:start size:84% position:16%
He was lambasted for
his unfavorables,

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.121 align:start size:84% position:16%
for his reaction to
the Orlando shootings.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.656
- [Robin] Oh yeah.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:59.492 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Arsenio, I'm glad you're
here alright, because--

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:00.860
- [Arsenio] I know him.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.661 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Larry] You have a
personal connection with him.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:02.762
- I won The Apprentice.

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:06.299 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm the Jackie
Robinson of Apprentice.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.467
I'm the first.

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:11.871 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So let me ask you, in
your heart of hearts, okay?

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:14.174
- [Larry] Do you think
Donald Trump is truly

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:19.045 align:start size:97% position:3%
invested in becoming president
or is all of this a con?

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:22.015
Is he playing us right now?

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:25.085 line:0%
- Larry, first of all,
this is Donald Trump

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.186 line:0%
and you know that ego.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.887 line:0%
He wants to rule the world.

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:30.156 line:0%
This ain't no game for him.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.993
This ain't no... right?

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.728
He wants to rule...

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.130
The world

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.399
I think he just needs
some black friends.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.535
(audience laughing)

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:45.038 align:start size:94% position:6%
More than Omarosa; I
know what y'all thinking.

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:45.872
- Right.

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:48.341
Yeah, but do you
think... See to me

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:49.843
it seems like when
he started winning,

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:51.744 align:start size:84% position:16%
he was like, "Oh,
shit, I was joking."

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.813 align:start size:84% position:16%
(audience laughing)
- Well--

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:55.315
- [Larry] I didn't think
this was gonna happen!

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:58.451
- But Larry, he's got to
win now because he's ruined

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.153 align:start size:97% position:3%
his life in every other place.
- [Larry] He has.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.122 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Arsenio] But
Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.323
- [Larry] That is a fact.

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:04.357
- I have a tie that
he gave me once.

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:05.758
It's a Donald Trump tie.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:07.160
Made in China.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.463 align:start size:97% position:3%
He can't even go to China now.
- [Larry] No he can't.

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:12.432 align:start size:94% position:6%
To even get his own ties.
- Right, right.

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.134
He can't go give
orders to the lady.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:17.237
Nobody's sewing for him
in China ever again.

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:18.738
- [Larry] So nice; I loved it.

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:20.306
- [Mike] I think he's been
trying to get out of it.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.342 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You think he was
actively trying to get out?

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.543
- I mean look at the
shit he's been saying.

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:26.012 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
Does that sound like
somebody that wanna win?

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:27.914 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
(audience applause)
- [Larry] It's working!

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:28.948
But it's working!

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:30.683
- And I know and he's like us!

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.519
I'm sure every time
Trump goes home,

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.788
he's like "What the
fuck is going on!?"

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.157 align:start size:88% position:13%
- So you think--
- [Mike] I just made fun

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.058 align:start size:84% position:16%
of a handicapped dude
and they love me!

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:40.426
- [Larry] I tried
the Mexican joke

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:43.329 align:start size:97% position:3%
and they liked me even more!
- [Robin] I know.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.231 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You know what's crazy
about him hating immigrants?

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:48.168 align:start size:84% position:16%
The Donald Trump I
know, back in the day,

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.736 align:start size:81% position:19%
didn't fuck nobody
but immigrants.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:52.939 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Robin] Yeah, exactly.
(audience applause)

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.375
- [Larry] Back in the day I
believe he was married, yeah.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:58.278
- Yeah, I mean other
than Marla Maples.

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.779
- [Robin] Yeah.

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:00.747
- And she who knows?

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:02.715
I don't even know where she is.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:04.484
That might be like
Mission: Impossible.

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.287
She might do this one day and
it's like, "Oh that's Rosa!"

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:08.688
(audience laughter)

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.123
She may not even be white.

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:12.692 align:start size:97% position:3%
The only white woman he
really wants is his daughter.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.060
And you know that.
(audience shock)

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.895
- [Robin] Yes, that's my theory!

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:17.964
That's my theory
is that he actually

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:20.066 align:start size:84% position:16%
only ran for president
to impress Ivanka.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.601 line:0%
I really think so.
- [Larry] Really?

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:23.336 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- Yeah he was like--
- [Larry] Wait, he's running

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:25.038 align:start size:84% position:16%
for president to
impress his daughter?

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.040
- [Robin] Yes and you know
what no one else talks about?

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.241 align:start size:81% position:19%
He has another
daughter that gets

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.210 align:start size:84% position:16%
no molesty love?
- That's Marla Maple's

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.511
daugther!
- Yeah!

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:33.012 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That's... Yes!
- [Larry] It's so true though.

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:35.582
- [Robin] I don't even want to
have sex with that daughter!

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:38.284 align:start size:81% position:19%
(Robin laughs)
- No molesty love.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:40.320
- [Robin] No molesty love.
- [Mike] No molesty love.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.255
That's messed up.
- It is messed up.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.823
- [Mike] On so many levels.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:45.391
- So it that the
art of the deal.

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.293
How to get molesty
love is the deal?

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:48.895 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, chapter 12.
(Larry laughs)

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:52.298 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I did not know that.
- Can I correct something?

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:55.969 align:start size:97% position:3%
I said he needs black friends,
he needs friends period.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.270 align:start size:75% position:25%
Right?
- [Robin] Yeah.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.371
- Because sometimes--
- [Larry] Does he have

00:03:58.371 --> 00:03:59.339 align:start size:88% position:13%
any friends?
- [Arsenio] You know...

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:00.807
- Does he really have friends?

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:01.941 align:start position:0%
Because he used to hang out
with everybody back in the day,

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:03.376 align:start size:81% position:19%
who was something.
- Yeah.

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:05.578 align:start position:0%
But he wanted to attach himself
to that limelight in that.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:08.815
But does he really
have any friends?

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:11.918 align:start size:97% position:3%
- If he had friends...
Would his hair be like that?

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:14.354 align:start size:81% position:19%
Right?
(audience laughs)

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:15.588
Right, if he got friends?

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:16.823
Because I'll tell
you something--

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:18.291 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Larry] Somebody would
of told him by now.

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:19.759 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Arsenio] Somebody would
pull your coat tails.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.229
If you got a black friend,
they'll pull your coat tails.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.697
I remember one time...

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:27.567 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
This happened in this town,
we're standing together

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:30.303 line:0%
and he had a lady pull his hair.

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:31.504
Because she was looking at him;

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:32.972 align:start size:88% position:13%
you know how when
somebody has big breasts

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:35.775 align:start size:97% position:3%
and you keep wandering down
looking at her breasts.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.644 align:start size:97% position:3%
They were looking at his head
just staring at his hair.

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:39.545
Trying to make eye contact,
but kept looking like this...

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:41.147 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It's like my eyes are here.
- Yeah!

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:42.982
(audience laughs)

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:47.153 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Stop looking at my titties.
- My eyes are right here.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.959
- So I pulled him
off to the side,

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.295 align:start size:94% position:6%
I didn't want to front
him off in front of people

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.196 align:start size:88% position:13%
because he's cool if you
put him off privately

00:04:57.196 --> 00:04:59.932 align:start size:88% position:13%
and say, "Yo DT.."
- [Mike] That's what you

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:01.067 align:start size:72% position:28%
called him.
- Yeah!

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:02.135 align:start size:84% position:16%
(Mike laughs)
I mean when you're not

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:03.336
on the air you can say it.

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:04.904 align:start size:84% position:16%
I said on the air
one time; I was like,

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:07.874
"Yo, they don't think
your hair is not real.

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:09.876
"They just think
it's fucked up."

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:11.210 align:start size:84% position:16%
(guests and audience
laughs wildly)

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.313 align:start size:75% position:25%
You know?
- I agree, yeah.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.481
- Because he always
had to pull his hair.

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:18.418
- It's not a compliment Donald.

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:19.652
Okay I wanna show you this,

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:20.853
because I want your
reaction to this.

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:22.088 align:start size:84% position:16%
Can we show that
clip of what he said

00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:23.156
at his rally when
looking for his

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.658 align:start size:88% position:13%
African-American friend?
- Oh!

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:26.926 align:start size:84% position:16%
- My god.
- We gotta show that.

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:28.394
Let's just show that.
- Don't show this clip.

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:31.464
- We had a case where we
had an African-American guy

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:34.667
who was a fan of mine;
Great fan, great guy!

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:37.904
In fact, I wanna find out
what's going on with him.

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:40.406 align:start size:97% position:3%
Oh look at my
African-American over here!

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:41.841
Look at him!
(crowd wooing)

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:45.311 align:start size:88% position:13%
(Robin laughs)
- "My African-American?"

00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:46.679
- Yeah, he must of
not got the email;

You don't own us.

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:51.951 align:start size:97% position:3%
We're free, bruh.
(audience continues laughing)

00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:53.353
Enough with you're tripped out

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.188 align:start size:94% position:6%
memory lane, motherfucker.
- I love how--

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.923 align:start size:97% position:3%
- "My African-American?"
- [Robin] I love how it's just

00:05:56.923 --> 00:05:59.325
his game of Where's Waldo,
but just with black people.

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:00.793
I mean his just like--
- [Mike] Like it was hard

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:03.262 align:start size:97% position:3%
to find him at a trump rally.
- Well he was so shocked,

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:04.931
"Oh my god!"
(Robin laughs)

00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:06.432
- He knew exactly where he was.

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:07.734
- If he had a black
friend, he wouldn't

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:10.503 align:start size:97% position:3%
of put "my" in that sentence.
- [Robin] Right.

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:12.905
- [Larry] Does he think
you're his black friend?

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:17.076 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Oh not after tonight.
(guests and audience laughs)

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:23.583 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Okay--
- [Arsenio] You know how he

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.518
likes to spray his hair
real hard on the sides?

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:27.754
By the way, it's real
crunchy on the sides.

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:30.056
He sprays real hard; but
tonight he's gonna be,

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:33.326 align:start size:84% position:16%
"My nigga, My nigga."
(Robin laughs)

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:35.528
- [Mike] You know that's
what he wanted to say!

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:36.729 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah, that's--
- [Mike] "That's my nigga!"

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:37.964 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Arsenio] Yeah,
that's what he wanted!

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:40.633 align:start size:88% position:13%
"My nigga, My nigga!"
- They say it, why can't

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:43.536 align:start size:88% position:13%
I say it?
- "My nigga, My nigga!"

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:45.571 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That's exactly what
he wanted to say!

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:47.073
"My African-American."

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.574
Shit, come on man.
- You think he's

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:50.476 align:start size:81% position:19%
really serious;
like spending time

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:52.345
with him, you think he's
really really serious?

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:54.781
- He can't go back
to Apprentice, he's
got to be serious.

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:56.416 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Mike] He can't be. How?
- You don't act a fool

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:59.519
at this job until you
get your next job.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:00.453
Right?
- Right.

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:02.221
Yeah it's true; It's true.

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:04.123 align:start size:97% position:3%
- He can't go back--
- [Larry] You better make sure

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:06.359 align:start size:84% position:16%
all those lottery
numbers are correct,

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:08.694
or we'll be saying "Fuck
all you motherfuckers...

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:09.929
- Yeah, yeah.
- "I'm out...

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:12.265
"Oh! Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.099 align:start size:81% position:19%
- It's a five;
Wait, it's a five!

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.400
- "Wait, wait, wait!

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.905 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I thought it was a four!
(Mike claps)

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:21.574 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Robin] He does need black
and brown votes though.

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:23.576 align:start position:0%
- [Larry] He can't get black...
Do you think white people

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:25.812 align:start size:94% position:6%
are gonna vote for Trump?
- [Arsenio] No!

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:27.713
- [Mike] Hell no.
- [Larry] You sure?

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:29.382 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Mike] I don't know;
let me tell you something,

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:31.250
there's no black people voting

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.653
for a motherfucker that
labels us "the blacks."

00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:35.087
I'm sorry, that's not happening.

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:37.990
- [Arsenio] Yeah.
- You're gonna vote

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.592 align:start size:81% position:19%
for a dude that
says "the blacks"?

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:41.260 align:start size:84% position:16%
"The blacks love me."
- Maybe, but he's

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.162
a good salesman.
- It's like fucking

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:44.597 align:start size:84% position:16%
with a Borg.
- Let me ask you this.

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:46.799 align:start size:94% position:6%
Okay, here's a challenge;
let me ask you this,

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:49.836 align:start size:84% position:16%
if Trump said "Okay
I am coming out

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:51.237
"for reparations
for black people.

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:52.538
"Hillary's not gonna say this.

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:54.207 align:start size:88% position:13%
"I'm saying reparations
for black people.

00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:56.409 align:start size:94% position:6%
"All of you guys, I'm
writing down a $25,000--"

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:58.010
See, you're face is
changing right now!

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.547 align:start position:0%
"I'm writing everybody a
$25,000 dollar check right now,

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:03.049 align:start size:84% position:16%
"and I get to say
nigga, that's right!"

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.851 align:start size:84% position:16%
(Robin laughs)
"That's right, I get

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.853 align:start size:84% position:16%
"to say nigga; Here's
$25,000 dollars!

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:08.988
"Who's voting for me now?"
- [Mike] For 25 grand, you

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.289
don't get to call me nigga.
- [Larry] Are you voting

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:11.224 align:start size:94% position:6%
for him now?
- For 25 grand, you can't

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:12.692
call me nigga; You kidding me?

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:13.893
- [Larry] Okay, he
won't call you that;

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:15.628 align:start size:88% position:13%
Are you voting for him?
- For 25 grand, no.

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:18.531 align:start size:84% position:16%
Nah, not for 25 grand.
- [Arsenio] For me

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:19.999
to vote for him, he's got to do

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:22.935 align:start size:84% position:16%
a Kool-Aid commercial
or something.

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:25.271
Like a strawberry Kool-Aid;

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:27.373
and I'll be like, "I'm
thinking, I'm thinking!"

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:28.908
- [Mike] For me to vote for him,

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:30.510
because you know I'm
the reparations dude,

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.078
I've been backing for that show.

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:33.913
- [Larry] So it's
a matter of price?

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:36.048
- Yes, and this is what it is.

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:38.551
If he gave 25 grand and...

00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:42.188
like we said earlier, free
college for black people--

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.157
- [Larry] That's your price?
- [Mike] It depends though.

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:47.627 align:start size:84% position:16%
I gotta see... Because
I don't trust him.

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:49.529 align:start size:97% position:3%
I gotta see the legislation--
- [Larry] Let me just

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.596 align:start size:94% position:6%
say two words.
- [Mike] Because he might

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:51.831 align:start size:84% position:16%
be slick.
- [Larry] Let me just

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:52.899
say two words; Let me
just say two words.

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:54.367 align:start size:72% position:28%
- [Mike] What?
- Sell-out.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:55.167
Okay, we'll be right back.
(guests and audiences cheers)

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:56.435
We'll be right back.

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:59.272
