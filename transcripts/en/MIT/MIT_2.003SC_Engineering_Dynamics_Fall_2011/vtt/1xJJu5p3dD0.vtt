00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.310
PROFESSOR: Today we are going
to talk about the vibration

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.030
of continuous systems.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.590
Not covered on
the quiz, but it's

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.680
a really important part
of real-world vibration

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:51.080
and the most-- one of the
easiest ones to demonstrate,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.290
I've shown you this one
before, is the taut string.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.040
But I want to show you something
unusual about-- something

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.830
you may not know about strings.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.959
Wait until it calms
down here a little bit.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.930
OK, so this is your guitar
string or a piano string.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.360
It's under tension.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.640
We've already seen
that it exhibits

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640
natural frequencies
in mode shape,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.420
so there's the first mode.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.310
Looks like half a sine wave.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.770
Has a particular frequency
associated with it.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.690
Get it to stop doing
that-- but if I excite it

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.040
at twice the frequency-- I
don't know if I can do this.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.484
There we go.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.330
That turns out to
be exactly twice

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.990
the frequency of the first.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.820
The mode shaped
one full sine wave.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.550
The mode shapes for a taut
string are sine n pi x over L.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.860
But strings can do
something else kind of neat.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.281
And that is if I
hit this thing--

00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:03.030
I'm going to wait till
it calms down here.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.520
If I give this
thing just a pulse,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.790
what do you expect to see?

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.620
Are you going to see vibration?

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.750
Tell me what you see.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.310
What do you see happening?

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.930
Something running
back and forth.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.920
Right?

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.710
What you're seeing
is wave propagation.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.850
It's not really vibration.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.131
Vibration we see of its modes
and standing waves and things

00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:38.630
like that.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.180
Right?

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.250
So the taut string satisfies
an equation of motion that's

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.660
called the wave equation.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.040
We're going to talk quite a
bit about that this morning.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.020
And the wave equation has
its name give something away.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.530
The wave equation describes
continuous systems

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.690
of a particular kind that
support travelling waves.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.870
And so the string
will both support--

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.875
I can give it a little pluck.

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:10.300
I'll try to just place it in
a particular shape and let go.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.959
There it is.

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.500
And that little pluck just goes
back and forth back and forth

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.420
at a particular speed.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.190
So is there a relationship
between the speed

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.950
at which things can
travel in a string

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.040
and the natural
frequencies of the string?

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.910
Well, we'll get into that today.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.280
And I'm going to start
by just showing you

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.940
a little something that
comes from my research

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.680
and-- let's see.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.990
Let me do this.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.060
I think this will work.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.750
Hear that?

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.380
As I go slower, does
frequency go up or down?

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.360
It's kind of slow, and
I'm going to speed up.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.570
Right?

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.980
Goes up as the speed goes up.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.520
So that's the result
of the phenomenon

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.440
called flow-induced vibration.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.240
And I'll give you
a very brief intro

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.619
to flow-induced vibration.

00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:25.980
You have a cylinder sitting
still, flow coming by it--

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.050
water or air.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.070
The cylinder is diameter D,
velocity U, for the flow.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.310
What happens in the wake of that
cylinder, vortices are formed.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.916
And just like if you're
paddling a canoe or something

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:44.540
and stick a paddle
in the water, you'll

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.730
see vortices shed off the side.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.240
First you get one
that's positive

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.300
and then one that's negative
And so one full cycle of this

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.800
is from here to here.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.765
There's a frequency
to this shedding.

00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:04.750
And the shedding
frequency, FS, in hertz,

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.530
can be predicted by a simple
dimensionless parameter called

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:15.600
the Strouhal number, St U over
D. And that's approximately 0.2

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.360
U/D for stationary cylinders.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.030
You can predict the frequency at
which these vortices are shed.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.830
Now, associated with
the shedding of vortices

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.640
is a lift force.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.080
I'll call it some
FL cosine omega

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.340
t, which is 2 pi FS, times t.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.420
So at this frequency
of vortex shedding

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.780
there is a transverse force.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.860
There's actually an
inline force also,

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.220
which I'll call FD for drag.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:51.360
And it goes like cosine
2 omega s times t.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.780
It's twice the
frequency of that.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.990
And so you'll get some
inline oscillatory excitation

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.580
and what we call cross-flow
oscillatory excitation.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:08.250
And this is the cause
of lots of things

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.670
that the people who work on it
call flow-induced vibration.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:18.030
Now, an amazing thing happens is
if this cylinder is elastically

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.760
mounted or is flexible, and
that force starts to act on it,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.620
it will begin to vibrate.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.570
And the amazing thing,
as it begins to vibrate,

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.770
it correlates the
shedding of these vortices

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.720
all along the cylinder.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.390
So it's like soldiers
marching in step

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.360
going across the bridge.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.349
If everybody's walking
randomly, then the bridge

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:44.390
doesn't respond too much.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.960
But if everybody
marches together,

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.980
you can put a pretty
good excitation into it.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.250
Well, the motion of
the cylinder itself

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.820
organizes these vortex shedding
all along the cylinder,

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.540
so they're all marching in step.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.110
And that means the force is
all correlated on the length.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.640
And you can get some pretty
substantial response.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.720
So that's the subject called
flow-induced vibration.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.800
And with that, I'm going
to show you a few slides.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.000
Let's dim the lights a little
bit, if you could, to see this.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.761
There's some pictures I
just want you to see better.

00:07:17.761 --> 00:07:18.260
All right.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.690
So I do flow-induced vibration.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.630
I've been doing
this-- working on this

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.970
for all my professional career.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:29.060
And it's applied, primarily,
to big, flexible cylinders

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:29.710
in the ocean.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.490
Particularly associated with the
things that the US Navy does.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.990
Long cables and things and
also the offshore oil industry.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.174
Next slide.

00:07:38.174 --> 00:07:39.090
Can we dim the lights?

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.195
Can we dim the lights?

00:07:48.752 --> 00:07:49.960
I want you to be able to see.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.100
This is a tension leg platform.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.080
It's one of the
structures that's

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.070
used in the offshore
industry to produce oil.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:03.220
And one of these might be
moored in 3,000 feet of water,

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.840
1,000 meters of water.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.330
Might weigh 20,000 tons.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.160
And what's connecting
it-- what holds in place--

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.230
are steel cylinders
a half a meter

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.710
in diameter, 3,000 feet
long, going vertically

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.840
down from each of those three
pontoon legs sticking out.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.630
And they're under
a lot of tension.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.140
And in fact, it pulls the
thing down into the water

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.060
so the buoyancy
of the whole thing

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.240
puts tension on these cylinders.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.669
But now, what happens
if an ocean current

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.179
comes by those cylinders?

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:37.330
Vortex shedding, and
the cylinders vibrate.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.289
And if they vibrate, over time
they will fatigue and fail.

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:40.789
OK.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:41.617
Next slide.

00:08:41.617 --> 00:08:42.950
There's a picture of a real one.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.730
That's a bigger one
called Marco Polo.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.476
It's on a launch ship that'll
take it out to the site

00:08:47.476 --> 00:08:47.975
that it is.

00:08:47.975 --> 00:08:52.780
And the ship will lower
and it will slide off.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.610
So these are big.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.200
Next slide.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.319
This is a diagram of
the Gulf of Mexico.

00:08:59.319 --> 00:09:00.610
South America is at the bottom.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.609
The Yucatan Peninsula is
sticking up there right

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:04.010
in the middle of the bottom.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.930
This is a picture of
satellite imagery of currents

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.200
in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.110
And there's a current that
flows up off of South America

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.530
into the Gulf of Mexico,
goes around in a loop,

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.437
and then comes out.

00:09:15.437 --> 00:09:17.770
You can see Florida sticking
down in there on the right.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.890
That current comes
out of the Gulf,

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.805
goes around the tip of Florida,
and goes up the Atlantic Coast,

00:09:22.805 --> 00:09:25.190
and is known as the Gulf Stream.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.060
But it starts as
a big current that

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.350
comes into the Gulf of Mexic.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.060
And, every now and then, that
current pinches off an eddy.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.530
And that's what that red
circle is in the middle.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.510
And it's an eddy that's many,
many kilometers in diameter

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.880
with surface currents on the
order of a meter per second

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.790
or more.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:48.360
And those are the biggest
threat for causing

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.880
flow-induced vibration
failures of long members

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.340
from hanging off of
offshore structures.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.660
Next.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.500
So I've been doing research
in this area for a long time.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.120
This is a picture taken
in the summer of 1981.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.920
It is a piece of steel
pipe about 2 inches

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.390
in diameter and 75 feet long.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.130
It's under 750
pounds of tension,

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.630
and it's pinned at each end.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:18.650
It behaves almost exactly
like my rubber cord here.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.440
It has natural frequencies,
and it will vibrate

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.910
if a current comes by it.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.100
So this is actually a sandbar.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.040
And at low tide, we'd do
all the work putting it up.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.280
Then, as the tide
comes in, the flow

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.670
is perpendicular
to the cylinder,

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.590
and vortices start shedding.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.100
And as the pipe
begins to move, they

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.150
get organized all
along the length.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:45.300
And a typical
response mode was when

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.720
the vortex shedding frequency,
therefore the lift force

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.470
frequency, coincided with
the natural frequency.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.210
Then you'd expect it to give
quite a bit of response.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:00.740
The diagram on the left
is if you cut the cylinder

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.750
and looked down its axis,
this is the trajectory

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.290
that you'd see
the cylinder make.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.030
It would sit there and just
make big figure eights.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.100
So up and down vertical
is its vertical motion.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.445
Flow's coming from,
say, left to right.

00:11:13.445 --> 00:11:15.340
Its vertical motion
is up and down.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.770
In-line motion's like this.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.500
And exactly such a phase it
just makes big beautiful figure

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.180
eights.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.140
That's the kind of
motion you'd see.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.170
OK?

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.780
So then, very much what I was
talking about a minute ago,

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.700
very much behavior
dominated by vibration.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.560
Vibration in the third mode,
cross flow, was a typical one.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.660
And fifth mode,
inline, was typical.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.740
But as cylinders
go in the ocean,

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.900
that one's kind of short.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.840
Third mode vibration
is sort of low.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.670
So as years have
gone by and oil is

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.000
being produced in deeper
and deeper and deeper water,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.541
the cylinders we're
putting out there

00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:57.420
get longer and longer
and longer and longer.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.240
And the modes that are
excited by currents coming by

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.887
get quite high.

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:03.220
So this is an experiment we did.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.580
It was roughly a
1/10 scale model.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.280
Model is almost 2 inches
in diameter, 500 feet long.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.950
Scale that up by a
factor of 10, you're

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.350
up around 20 inches in
diameter and 5,000 feet

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:17.520
long, which is exactly the
size of the drilling riser

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.960
that BP had hung
off the drilling

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.800
ship when the blowout occurred.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.780
It's a piece of steel pipe,
21 inches in diameter,

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.720
3/4 of an inch wall
thickness, 5,000 feet long,

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.320
under a lot of tension.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.340
And when ocean
currents come by, it

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.424
behaves just like this string.

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:39.340
And so we're out-- this
is a 1/10 scale model.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.040
So we put a big weight on
the bottom of the cylinder,

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.060
put it behind a boat, and
towed it in the Gulf Stream.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.130
Next picture.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:47.992
So there's the boat.

00:12:47.992 --> 00:12:49.200
It's an oceanographic vessel.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.830
It's actually a catamaran.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.140
Next.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.860
This is a spool that had
our test cylinder on it.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.340
There's a reddish object
down on the bottom which

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:08.500
is-- that's a 750-pound
piece of railroad wheel,

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.970
and it's the weight
on the bottom.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.510
And so you'd spool this
thing off, lower it down,

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.770
and then do your tests.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.280
Next.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.203
Top, we measured
tension inclination.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.630
And then we also had-- it's
a pin joint at the top,

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.550
so it would vibrate freely.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.430
Inside, though,
was fiber optics.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.090
Next.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.030
We had eight optical fibers.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.070
And in those optical
fibers were what

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.260
we call optical strain gauges.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.850
So we had 280 optical strain
gauges instrumented up and down

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.932
that pipe so we could
measure its vibration.

00:13:44.932 --> 00:13:47.140
And so you're looking at a
cross section of the pipe.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.060
There were two optical
fibers in each quadrant,

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:55.300
and each one of those
fibers had 35 sensors on it.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.470
Next.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.330
This is typical
experimental case.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.370
This is the surface.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.200
This is 500 feet down.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.730
This is the current profile.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.630
So the flow velocity
is about 2 feet

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.860
per second near the
surface, up to 4 feet

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.600
per second down on the bottom.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.700
And this is the region
where most of the excitation

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.570
was coming from that would drive
the flow-induced vibration.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:25.270
This is measured RMS strain
caused by the bending vibration

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:25.980
in the cylinders.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.950
And peak-- the maximum
strain-- is about right there.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.200
Next.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.060
Typical response spectrum.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.090
Basically, the frequency content
at three different locations.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.190
Down deep, in the
middle, near the top.

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.830
This is frequency.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.660
So this would be the
peak that describes

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.300
the principal cross-flow
vibration at the vortex

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.640
shedding frequency.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.140
Next.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.990
This is position, bottom to top.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:59.310
This is time, and these
are strain records from all

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:00.620
of those strain sensors.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.770
There's a strain sensor about
every 2 meters along here.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.140
But what you're seeing
is-- this is evidence.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.720
The red is the
amplitude and red--

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:15.790
let's say red is positive strain
and blue is negative strain.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.190
And so at any location on the
pipe where it's vibrating,

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.660
it's going to go from red to
blue, red to blue, red to blue.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.284
But it's showing you that
they're highly correlated

00:15:25.284 --> 00:15:26.700
all along the
length, that there's

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.240
a red streak all lined up, but
it's not parallel to the pipe.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.320
It's inclined.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.400
This is showing you
wave propagation.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.170
The behavior of the
pipe is completely

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:40.350
dominated by wave propagation,
not by standing wave vibration.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:45.930
So totally different than
that short pipe in 1981.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:46.716
The wave equation.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.660
Let's imagine we have a long
pipe or a string like that,

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:08.760
and it can carry waves
traveling along it.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:13.760
The position at any location on
here-- here's a coordinate x.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.040
We describe the
motion at a point

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.250
by a coordinate w of x and t.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:25.640
So it's a function of
where it is and time.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.790
What describes the
motion of something

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.800
which obeys the wave equation
is the following equation.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:38.400
Partial squared w with
respect to x squared

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:44.640
equals 1/c squared partial
squared w with respect

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.220
to t squared.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.310
That's what's known as the
one-dimensional wave equation.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.540
And the one-dimensional
wave equation

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:57.240
governs an incredibly broad
category of physical phenomena.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:02.700
Light behaves according
to the wave equation.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.958
Sound propagating
across the room to you

00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.069
is governed by
the wave equation.

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:11.859
Longitudinal vibration of rods,
torsional vibration of rods--

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:13.609
all governed by
the wave equation.

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:15.859
So it's worthwhile to know
a little bit about the wave

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:17.609
equation.

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:19.650
And what I showed
you this morning,

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.550
it has this kind
of duality to it.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.940
You can have things that vibrate
with standing waves and mode

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.400
shapes, but the same
system can support

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.390
waves that travel along it.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:33.370
So let's figure out why that is.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:41.060
So I'm going to do the
derivation for you of the wave

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.539
equation for a
string, just so you

00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:44.080
know where it comes
from because then

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.500
that general derivation applies
to all these different things.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:56.540
So imagine you've got now--
we're interested in eventually

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.510
getting to vibration.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.150
So I'm going to make this
a finite length string.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:11.340
And it has this position we'll
describe as a w of x and t.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:17.920
It has a tension, T, a
mass per unit length, m.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.630
So this is like
kilograms per meter

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:28.510
is the mass per unit length of
this thing which can vibrate.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:29.500
So tension.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.970
Mass per unit length.

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.480
L, the length of it.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.820
What other parameters
do we need?

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.980
That'll do for the moment.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.255
Now-- so let's draw
it again without.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:52.010
In some displaced position
and what's exciting

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.060
it may be my vortex
shedding, and so I'm going

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.560
to draw that excitation here.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.980
And that we'll describe
as F of x and t,

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:05.310
some force per unit length.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.665
So this has units of
newtons per meter.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:15.190
Now, in that little--
there may also

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.105
be drag forces,
the fluid damping.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.950
So I'm going to cut out a
little piece of this cylinder

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:33.810
and do a force balance on
that piece of cylinder.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.350
So basically, F equals ma.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.990
We're just applying Newton
to this piece of cylinder.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:42.320
And I'll draw it right here.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.580
A little section
of it is curved.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.910
Here's horizontal.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.770
There's horizontal.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:53.130
We need to evaluate
all the forces on it.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:59.020
So the tension on this
end-- so like that.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.475
And the tension on this end
is some different angle.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:07.440
This we'll call theta 1.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.290
This we'll call theta 2.

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:19.150
And along here are my
excitation forces, F of x and t.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:23.360
There may be some resistance--
drag forces, damping.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.380
That'll be a damping
constant, R of x,

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.940
which is force per unit
length per unit velocity,

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:36.120
times-- the force
on this would have

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.970
to be multiplied
by the velocity, so

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:42.600
the derivative of this
displacement with respect

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.280
to time.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:49.040
That's the force along here,
and it can vary with position.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.420
Have we accounted
for everything?

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:58.840
Ah, well, this is position
x, and this is at x plus dx.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.685
So this little element
is dx in length.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.265
And this is all
for small motions.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:35.820
And if you assume
small motions, then you

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:43.630
can say theta 1 is approximately
equal to sine theta 1.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:48.400
That's also approximately
equal to tan theta 1.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.480
And that's equal to the
derivative of w with respect

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.870
to x, just the slope.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.070
We're going to take
advantage of that.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.205
Theta 2, same thing.

00:21:59.205 --> 00:22:05.660
It's approximately equal to
tan theta 2 here, and sin

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.130
and all those things.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:11.100
But that, then-- the slope
has changed a little bit

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.270
when you go through dx.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:18.950
And this is equal to the
slope on the left-hand side

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:28.860
plus the rate of change
of the slope times dx.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.340
So the slope on the left,
this is now the slope

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.490
on the right-hand side.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.290
And so now, all
that's left to do

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:54.510
is to write a force balance
for that little piece

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.410
on the element dx.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.510
So if positive, upward.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:07.240
We have a T sine theta.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.340
But because sine theta
is approximately tan

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.310
theta is equal to
dw dx, then there's

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:29.900
an upward force on the
right-hand side, which is T.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:33.660
And this turns into partial
squared w with respect

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.180
to x squared dx.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.530
So on the right-hand
side-- positive

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.710
upwards-- you have
T times the partial

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:49.666
of w with respect to x, plus
partial square w with respect

00:23:49.666 --> 00:23:53.300
to x squared dx.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.100
That's the upward force
on the right-hand side.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:01.460
On the left-hand side, we have a
downward force, minus T partial

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.240
of w with respect to x.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.840
And you notice that this one's
going to cancel that one.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:15.600
We have minus R of x partial
w with respect to t--

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.940
that's the velocity-- dx long.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:21.840
Because that's force
per unit length.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.020
And have we missed anything?

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.660
So that's the sum of
the external forces

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.530
on this little slice.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:33.400
And that has to be equal
to-- what did Newton say?

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:39.030
The mass, which is the mass
per unit length, times dx,

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:43.300
is the total mass,
times the acceleration,

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:48.235
partial squared w with
respect to t squared.

00:24:51.841 --> 00:24:56.130
So this cancels this term.

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:59.690
And then you notice I'm
left with everything

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:04.960
as just something dx,
something dx, something dx.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:14.360
Get rid of the dx's,
and I can write-- oh, I

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.280
left out something.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:25.900
I left out my distributed
force, F of x and t dx.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.010
It's positive as it's drawn.

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:29.030
It's over here also.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:32.190
So this, and I
cancel out that dx.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:35.710
So I put them all together
now and assemble them.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:44.410
I can write down the equation
that governs this motion.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:49.840
So T partial square
w with respect

00:25:49.840 --> 00:26:02.700
to x squared minus r of x times
velocity plus f of x and t

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:09.472
equals m partial square w
with respect to t squared.

00:26:09.472 --> 00:26:11.930
And that just says that the
sum of the forces on the object

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.555
equals its mass times
its acceleration.

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:22.500
Now, if we're interested in
natural frequencies and mode

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:28.970
shapes, when we've been doing
one and two degree of freedom

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:31.480
systems, and we want to get
the natural frequencies in mode

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:35.530
shapes, we temporarily let
the damping be 0 and the force

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:36.341
be 0, right?

00:26:36.341 --> 00:26:37.840
So we want to do
the same thing now.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:46.330
We're interested in how do you
find the omega n's and what I

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:47.880
call the psi n's.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.710
Because now the mode
shapes are functions.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.590
And so this is a
natural frequency

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:55.020
and the mode shape for mode n.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.870
We know there's lots of modes.

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:06.540
So we let r of x and
f of x and t be 0.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:13.970
And when we do that,
this term goes away.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:14.840
This term goes away.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.150
I'm just left with T partial
squared w with respect

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.450
to x squared equals this.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.340
And I'm going to
divide through by t.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:29.330
So I get partial squared w with
respect to x squared equals 1

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:43.260
over T over m partial squared
w with respect to t squared.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:49.390
And this T/m quantity
turns out to be

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:53.840
the speed of wave
propagation in the medium.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:06.335
And that is the wave equation.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.620
So we've just found the
wave equation for the string

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:19.027
just by applying Newton's law
to a little section of string.

00:28:19.027 --> 00:28:20.360
You can do that for the vibrate.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.870
You're going to
do the same thing,

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:24.650
cut out a little
section of a beam,

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:28.110
do the force balance on it,
set it equal to the mass times

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.890
acceleration.

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:32.620
And for a beam, you'll get
a fourth order differential

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.450
equation.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:36.860
And it's not the wave equation.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:41.040
It still vibrates, but
it's not governed by what

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.550
we call the wave equation.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:53.030
OK, so this is the one
dimensional wave equation.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:57.245
This quantity T/m is
the phase velocity.

00:28:57.245 --> 00:28:58.370
It's called phase velocity.

00:29:09.304 --> 00:29:10.970
You know, that's a
good one to remember.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.094
For a simple string, the speed
of phenomena running down

00:29:14.094 --> 00:29:16.260
the string is the square
root of the tension divided

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.426
by the mass per unit length.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.460
And if you had a long string,
I put that little pluck in it,

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.910
and you can see that pluck
running back and forth on it.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:31.201
That's the speed it's going at.

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:39.667
Basically, it's called--
well, so if I have my string,

00:29:39.667 --> 00:29:41.500
and I put a little bump
on it, and that bump

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.630
goes zipping along,
your eye will see

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:45.670
this thing propagating at c.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:55.480
So to get natural
frequencies in mode shapes,

00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:01.700
we basically need to
solve this equation.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.955
And it's quite
straightforward to do.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:08.760
And a technique
known as separation

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:14.440
of variables works, which
means that all you're doing

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.120
is saying, I believe
that I'm going

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.180
to be able to write the
solution as some function of x

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:26.310
only times some function of
time only, product of two terms.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:41.250
And that in fact-- because
we're interested in vibration.

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.720
You can tell me what
the function of time is.

00:30:46.444 --> 00:30:49.110
You're going to tell me half the
solution just from observation.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.590
What is it?

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:55.160
Just the time dependent part.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.275
It's the same as anything
else that vibrates.

00:30:57.275 --> 00:30:59.370
So a single degree
of freedom system,

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:03.450
what is the time dependent
function that we substitute in

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.040
to find the natural frequency?

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:06.915
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:11.332
PROFESSOR: Say again?

00:31:11.332 --> 00:31:12.540
AUDIENCE: e to the i omega t.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.850
PROFESSOR: e to the i
omega t would be just fine.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:16.160
Cosine omega t works.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.230
Sine omega t works.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.840
But e to the i omega t
is pretty easy to use.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.760
Because it's so simple
to take the derivatives.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.140
So we can guess
that this is going

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:34.430
to be some W of x times
Ae to the i omega t.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:35.240
And plug it in.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.180
Plug it into our wave
equation over here.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:47.976
So I'll make sure I
write it consistently.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:57.110
So we plug this
into the first term.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:59.790
It's two derivatives
with respect to x.

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:09.270
So this is just-- and the
time-dependent part just

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:09.966
stays outside.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:18.730
And on the right-hand side, when
we plug it in here, 1 over c

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.520
squared, two derivatives
with respect to time,

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.120
it's going to give me
minus omega squared,

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:28.430
so minus omega squared
over c squared.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:37.610
And then it gives me back
W of x Ae to the i omega t.

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:42.650
And now I can get rid of
the Ae to the i omega t's.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:47.250
And I'm left with just an
equation involving x only.

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:50.250
And it's an ordinary
differential equation

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:51.750
in w of x.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:07.730
So it turns into d2W dx
squared plus omega squared

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:12.170
over c squared W equals 0.

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:16.500
And you've seen this
equation before.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.000
Does this not look like,
have some similarity to,

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.840
Mx double dot plus kx equals 0?

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.520
They're basically
the same equation.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.950
This one's a function of x.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:33.250
That one's a function of time.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:38.450
And we know the solution
to this one is some x of t

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:43.920
is some amplitude
e to the i omega t.

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.710
So therefore, we can guess
that the solution to this one

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:55.605
is W of x is going to be--
I'll write it as some B.

00:33:55.605 --> 00:33:57.290
Now I need a function of x.

00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:03.392
But it can be just like this--
e to the i, and I'll say kx.

00:34:03.392 --> 00:34:04.933
I know that's going
to be a solution.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.870
So let's plug it in.

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:23.850
If I plug that in, I
get minus k squared

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:42.469
Be to the ikx plus omega squared
over c squared Be to the ikx

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:44.260
equals 0.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.349
Well, now I get rid of these.

00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:51.860
And what I found out
is that k squared is

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.600
omega squared over c squared.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.845
And this has a name-- k.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.920
It's called the wave number.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.050
And it also happens to
be 2 pi over lambda.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:13.100
We'll come back to that.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.141
Lambda is the wavelength.

00:35:14.141 --> 00:35:18.080
You have sinusoidal waves
running through the medium.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.220
2 pi over lambda is the
same as omega over c.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:28.810
And this is called
the wave number--

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.120
really important
quantity if you're

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.500
trying to understand wave
propagation in systems.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.840
And actually, this
one, this definition

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.150
applies to all wave
bearing systems,

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:42.830
whether or not they
obey the wave equation.

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:45.630
It'll apply to waves
traveling down a beam as well.

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:49.260
So the definition of wave number
is frequency divided by speed,

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.900
or 2 pi over the wavelength.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.310
Well, let's see.

00:35:55.310 --> 00:36:02.850
We can't go much further with
just the wave equation itself.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:05.000
In order to get the
natural frequencies,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.645
we have to invoke
other information

00:36:07.645 --> 00:36:09.140
that we know in the problem.

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.950
In particular, we
know that in order

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:20.350
to get natural frequencies,
we had to create conditions

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:21.660
where this could vibrate.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:24.820
In particular, I fix that
end, and I fix this end,

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.590
and I put some tension on it.

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:28.574
And now it'll vibrate.

00:36:28.574 --> 00:36:29.990
But it clearly has
something to do

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:32.030
with its ends and its length.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:35.900
And so this is a
boundary value problem.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.780
And we have to invoke the
boundary conditions to actually

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.550
finish finding the natural
frequencies and mode shapes.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:37:00.300
Apply the boundary
conditions-- so I assumed here

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.690
that my W of x is going to
look something like that.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:06.530
In order to get a little
more information out of this,

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:12.290
I'm going to write now W of x
in an alternative form that's

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:13.450
equally valid.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:26.050
And I'll call it B1 cosine
kx plus a B2 sine kx.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:29.840
And I could relate that to
e to the ikx, B to the ikx,

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.700
by real and imaginary
parts, and so forth.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.710
This is a real part.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:37.370
I'm saying in general it could
have a cosine part and also

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:38.630
a sine part.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:43.970
But now I know my boundary
conditions are W at x equals 0.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.620
W of 0 is what?

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.445
What's the displacement
at x equals 0?

00:37:47.445 --> 00:37:48.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:52.955
PROFESSOR: 0.

00:37:52.955 --> 00:37:53.580
That's the pin.

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.430
That's the end
where it's fixed at.

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:59.110
And we started out here
with a second order

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.550
partial differential equation.

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:03.055
And a second order equation
requires two boundary

00:38:03.055 --> 00:38:03.555
conditions.

00:38:03.555 --> 00:38:05.440
A fourth order
equation for the beam

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.560
will require four
boundary conditions.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.990
We only have to find two.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:11.720
One of them is it has
no motion on the left.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:15.080
So you plug in 0 for x.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.540
Cosine of 0 is 1.

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.770
Sine of 0 is 0.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:24.670
So we find out that
this is B1 times 1.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:26.930
But it has to be 0 as
the boundary condition.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:30.440
So that implies B1 is 0.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.390
There's no cosines
in this answer.

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:36.990
And W at L is 0.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:47.160
And so that says B2
sine kL equals 0.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.680
And that's true.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:57.670
That's only true
if kL equals n pi.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.300
So now I've found
out that there's,

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:03.430
just for vibration of
a finite length string,

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:06.950
only particular
values of k that work.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:11.630
So that says that there are
special values of k which

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:31.560
I'll call k sub n which
are equal to n pi over L.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.989
And from that, we now
have our mode shapes.

00:39:33.989 --> 00:39:35.530
Because we can say,
ah, well, there's

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:41.710
special solution
for this W of x that

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:45.160
applies only when we satisfy
the boundary conditions.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.345
And that will be some
undetermined amplitude.

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:53.110
B2 came from the sine term.

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:02.900
And those are our mode shapes.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.900
And now the natural
frequencies-- once

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.180
you know mode shapes,
natural frequencies actually

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.010
become pretty trivial to find.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:13.930
In this case, if we know
that's the mode shape,

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:17.690
then how do we get the
natural frequencies?

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:21.260
Well, we know that--
what's the definition of k?

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:31.880
Therefore, the
particular values of k

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.600
that were allowed
solutions here are

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:40.390
going to correspond to
particular values of omega n.

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:49.570
And therefore, omega n squared
is just kn squared c squared.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:59.720
And that's n pi
over L squared T/m.

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:06.810
That's omega n squared.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:09.990
So the natural
frequencies of a string

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:16.020
are n pi over L root T/m.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:25.270
And this is in
radians per second.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:27.670
And I like to work
in hertz sometimes.

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:33.890
So the natural frequencies
in hertz-- omega n over 2 pi.

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:39.110
And that becomes n
over 2L root T/m.

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:50.840
So the first natural frequency,
f1, is 1 over 2L root T/m.

00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:00.630
Now, let's draw.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:02.480
What's the mode shape
for the first mode?

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:10.960
Well, it's half a sine
wave, vibrates like that.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.900
It's full wavelength.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.120
I didn't leave myself
quite enough room.

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.350
That's half a wavelength
of a sine wave.

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:20.510
So the full wavelength
would be like that.

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:25.760
This is of length L. And
so is this piece over here.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:30.890
So the lambda is 2L for
this particular problem.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.410
Let's see, how do I want
to pose this question?

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:52.780
So how long does it take
for a wave or disturbance

00:42:52.780 --> 00:43:01.600
to travel the length
of this finite string?

00:43:10.991 --> 00:43:14.372
How long does it take it
to go down there and back?

00:43:14.372 --> 00:43:15.580
How would you calculate that?

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.190
Distance equals rate times time.

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:24.550
What's the distance?

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:26.530
2L.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:29.500
What's the speed?

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.920
c.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.820
So the length of time ought
to be 2L over c, right?

00:43:39.690 --> 00:44:01.710
So the time required-- and
2L divided by T over m.

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:05.573
But f1 is T/m divided by 2L.

00:44:05.573 --> 00:44:06.072
Hmm.

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.730
So the period-- so there's
a direct connection

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:22.340
between propagation speed,
frequencies, wavelengths.

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.750
They're very closely related.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:33.940
So the natural frequency of
the first mode of this string,

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:38.610
that frequency, is exactly
1 over the length of time

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:41.572
it takes for a disturbance
to travel down and back.

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:52.070
So with that depth
of understanding

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:58.710
of how the wave
equation behaves,

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:04.990
you can guess the behavior
of lots of other things

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:07.711
that behave like that,
like my rod here.

00:45:07.711 --> 00:45:09.460
I'll do a little demo
with it in a second.

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.780
So for example, the
longitudinal vibration,

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:32.630
stress waves running
up and down this thing,

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:35.150
obey the wave equation.

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:40.395
So if I take this thing
and drop it on the floor,

00:45:40.395 --> 00:45:42.720
it'll bounce off the floor.

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.890
How long does it take
to bounce off the floor?

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:53.320
So what do you think actually--
what physics has to happen?

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:57.800
What's required to make this
thing bounce off the floor?

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.650
So we're going to consider
the floor infinitely rigid.

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:01.880
It hits the floor.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.180
It actually stays there for
some finite length of time,

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.430
and then it leaves.

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:09.180
So physically, when I was
holding up my string, if I

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.700
smacked the end, what happened?

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:18.420
A pulse took off, ran down
the end, reflected, came back.

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.710
And that was one round trip.

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:23.390
What do you suppose
happens here?

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:26.370
I put a pulse into the end.

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:29.555
Is it a tension or compression,
the strain that's felt?

00:46:29.555 --> 00:46:30.430
AUDIENCE: Compression

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:31.000
PROFESSOR: Compression.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.130
So a little compression
pulse is put into the end.

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:37.270
That compression pulse
then, when it first hits,

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:41.190
the compression and the speed
of propagation is finite.

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:44.490
So that compression wave
starts traveling up here.

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:49.900
Behind the compression wave,
this rod has come to a stop.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.330
In front of the
compression wave,

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:53.960
the rod doesn't know
it hit the ground yet.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.820
It's still moving down.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.480
So that compression
wave travels up,

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:03.390
and it is decelerating
each little slice of mass

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:04.440
as it passes through.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.760
It brings it to a stop.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:09.090
And so the compression
reaches the top end.

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:12.520
The cylinder has come to a stop.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.347
The end is free.

00:47:13.347 --> 00:47:14.780
It can't take any strain.

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:16.790
So an equal and
opposite tension wave

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:20.100
has to start to make the sum
of them go to 0 at the end.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.710
The boundary condition
at the end is no strain.

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:24.260
So it reflects as
a tension wave.

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.900
Now you have a tension
wave going down.

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:29.020
And what it does is it
accelerates every atom as it

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.200
goes by, as it goes past it.

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.480
So everything is stopped now.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.180
Now it starts down,
and this thing

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:39.750
starts rebounding from-- the
top rebounds from the floor

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:40.850
before the bottom does.

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:43.310
The top starts going up.

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:44.800
All of it-- more
and more goes up.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.800
And one hits the bottom.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.660
The tension wave hits the
floor, and it jumps off.

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:49.930
So how long does it take?

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:00.500
Right?

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.930
And what do you guess
the natural frequency

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:07.369
of a free-free rod is?

00:48:07.369 --> 00:48:08.660
Now, it has a funny mode shape.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.550
The mode shape is not half
a sine wave like this.

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:14.240
The displacement of the
rod, it has free ends.

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.740
The ends are moving a lot.

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.713
But I'll give you a clue.

00:48:19.713 --> 00:48:23.700
[ROD RINGING]

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.820
I can hold it in the
center and not damp it.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:28.755
What do you think the
mode shape looks like?

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:37.560
Half a wavelength long,
ends are free-- cosine,

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.080
maximum displacement,
goes to zero,

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.100
maximum negative displacement.

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:45.500
So it's half a
wavelength long, but it's

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:48.560
a cosine half a wavelength.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.800
And the full wavelength is 2L.

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:57.190
So this has mode shapes.

00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:00.199
The mode shapes-- I've applied
different boundary conditions.

00:49:00.199 --> 00:49:01.865
These are free-free
boundary conditions.

00:49:01.865 --> 00:49:07.290
The mode shapes are
cosine n pi x over L.

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:10.120
But they have to obey
a certain other law

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:14.240
that we know about,
conservation of momentum.

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.830
Because I've got
gravity to deal with,

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:17.163
I have to hang on to this thing.

00:49:17.163 --> 00:49:19.730
But I've picked a place to hang
onto it that you can hear it.

00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:21.970
I'm not affecting the motion.

00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:24.440
There's no motion
where I'm holding it.

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.720
So if I were out in
space, I could do this--

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:27.632
[ROD RINGING]

00:49:27.632 --> 00:49:30.250
--and just let it hang
there in space, right?

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.020
And it would sit there and ring.

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:35.820
What is happening to the
center of mass of this system

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.545
as it vibrates?

00:49:37.545 --> 00:49:39.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.420
PROFESSOR: Stationary.

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.310
So half of the mass
of this thing's

00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:44.579
got to be moving that way.

00:49:44.579 --> 00:49:46.120
And half of the mass
has to be moving

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.660
that way so that the total
center of mass doesn't move.

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:51.700
Well, cosine mode
shape, positive here,

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:54.250
negative there, perfectly
symmetric, center of mass

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:55.360
doesn't move.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.030
So there's all sorts
of neat little problems

00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:02.450
that you can solve just by
knowing the wave equation

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:06.220
and figuring out
boundary conditions.

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.250
How many of you stand
in the shower at home

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:11.150
and sing, and
every now and then,

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:14.619
you hit a note, man, you
just sound great, right?

00:50:14.619 --> 00:50:16.160
And it's just all
this reverberation.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.451
How many of you have done that?

00:50:17.451 --> 00:50:20.690
OK, right, what's going on?

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:23.866
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Natural frequency?

00:50:23.866 --> 00:50:25.490
PROFESSOR: You've
hit a-- somebody said

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:26.260
natural frequency.

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:27.420
Of what?

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:29.975
PROFESSOR: Huh?

00:50:29.975 --> 00:50:30.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:39.960
PROFESSOR: You've hit the
natural frequency of the shower

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.020
stall itself.

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:47.310
If the shower stall
is a meter across,

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:49.780
pressure waves-- and
you plot pressure

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:55.130
inside of the shower,
the lowest mode

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:56.530
if you're plotting pressure.

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:58.750
Well, let's plot actually
molecular movement.

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:00.500
What's the boundary
condition at the wall,

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:03.470
the molecules at the wall?

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:04.610
They can't move, right?

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:05.450
0.

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:07.810
So the molecular
motion at resonance

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:11.400
in the shower stall, the
molecules, the pressures making

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:14.400
them move back and forth, looks
like back to the string again.

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.970
This is L. The first
natural frequency

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:21.470
of sound waves bouncing
off the walls in the stall

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:32.030
is 1 over 2L root
times c, whatever c is.

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:36.240
And c is the speed
of sound in air,

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.490
which is 340 meters per second.

00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:40.985
So 340 meters per
second divided by 2L--

00:51:40.985 --> 00:51:44.240
so if it's 1 meter
across here, it's

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:48.500
340 divided by 2, 170 hertz.

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.750
So that first note you
can hit in the 1 meter

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:54.784
across shower stall is about
170 hertz-- pretty low.

00:51:54.784 --> 00:51:55.950
But you can hit second mode.

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:57.720
It'd be twice
that, and so forth.

00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:02.770
OK, what about an organ pipe?

00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:05.150
This is an organ pipe, wood.

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:08.225
It's got a stoppered end.

00:52:08.225 --> 00:52:09.974
Actually, let's do it
without the stopper.

00:52:09.974 --> 00:52:12.030
Now it's an open organ pipe.

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.022
[ORGAN NOTE]

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:18.390
Basic wave equation--
how would you

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:20.020
model its boundary conditions?

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:26.080
So you can talk about maybe
particle molecular motion.

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:30.960
This is, now again, just
sound waves, so air particles.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.410
And this is now longitudinal.

00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:33.530
Things are moving inside.

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:37.850
So what's the boundary condition
at this end, free or fixed?

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:38.352
Free.

00:52:38.352 --> 00:52:40.810
And here it's quite open, so
the boundary condition on here

00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:42.550
is free.

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:50.416
So for the molecular motion
in a free-free organ pipe,

00:52:50.416 --> 00:52:53.720
you have to get back to that
half a wavelength cosine thing.

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.530
And if you wanted to
plot pressure instead,

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:57.880
you can write the wave
equation in terms of pressure.

00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.735
Pressure is-- this is
pressure relief here

00:53:00.735 --> 00:53:02.440
and pressure relief there.

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:11.510
So in fact, if is
displacement of the molecules,

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:14.800
pressure would plot like that.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.670
You'd have what's called
a pressure relief boundary

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:18.480
condition.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.120
But again, it's a
half wavelength long.

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.540
What do you think the
first natural frequency

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:22.738
of this organ pipe is?

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:34.220
The period would be 2L over c.

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.880
The frequency
would be c over 2L.

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:53.205
So the frequency for the organ
pipe open end f1 is c over 2L.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.410
[ORGAN NOTE]

00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:00.340
Check your intuition.

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:03.300
I'm going to close the
end-- still an organ pipe.

00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:07.850
Is the frequency now going
to be higher or lower?

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:08.580
Take a vote.

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:11.430
How many think the
frequency is going to go up?

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:13.540
Raise your hands, commit.

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:15.479
All right, down.

00:54:15.479 --> 00:54:16.770
We've got a lot of uncertainty.

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:18.808
All right, let's
do the experiment.

00:54:18.808 --> 00:54:20.720
[ORGAN NOTE]

00:54:23.588 --> 00:54:25.500
[LOWER ORGAN NOTE]

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:28.524
How come?

00:54:28.524 --> 00:54:30.440
I find that actually
kind of counterintuitive.

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:33.290
Until I learned this, I would
have guessed the opposite way.

00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:36.715
What's going on with
pressure in a closed pipe?

00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:44.960
Well, here at the orifice
where the sound is actually

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.770
generated, it's the pressure.

00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:49.720
If we wanted to plot
pressure at the opening,

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:52.390
that's a pressure relief place.

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:54.060
So it's 0.

00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:57.590
But at the other end where
the stopper is, it's maximum.

00:55:01.070 --> 00:55:03.620
How many wavelengths is that?

00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:04.515
A quarter.

00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:12.470
And so the length of time
it takes for the thing

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:15.440
to go through one
complete period

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:31.510
is going to be 4L over c, half
the frequency of the open pipe.

00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:35.260
OK, so the wave equation
is really quite powerful,

00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:36.665
governs lots of things.

00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:45.810
I've got 10, 15
minutes left here.

00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:51.510
I don't want you to go away
thinking that the whole world

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:53.160
behaves like the wave equation.

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:58.090
Because there are some
important other physical systems

00:55:58.090 --> 00:55:59.900
that we care about.

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:02.800
And I'm going to
show you just one.

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:10.500
And that's the
vibration of the beam.

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:14.030
So here's the cantilever beam.

00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:20.290
The whole table is moving.

00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:23.770
And you can see it
up on the screen.

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:26.950
OK, so its first mode
vibration, tip moves maximum.

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:30.520
It kind of looks like
a quarter wavelength.

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.660
It roughly is, but not exactly.

00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:36.785
So let's draw a cantilever.

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:48.110
And most of you have had 2.001.

00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:53.310
So if you put a load
P out here-- bends,

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:55.900
goes through a
displacement delta.

00:56:55.900 --> 00:57:05.170
So you know that delta equals
Pl cubed over 3EI, right?

00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:07.749
And what's this I?

00:57:07.749 --> 00:57:10.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.020
PROFESSOR: Area
moment of inertia.

00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:14.470
Now that you've been
doing dynamics all term,

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:16.249
we talk about mass
moments of inertia.

00:57:16.249 --> 00:57:17.790
There's also area
moments of inertia.

00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:20.790
So this is the area moment
of inertia of a beam.

00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:23.320
In this case, our beam is
a little rectangular cross

00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:24.770
section.

00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:28.550
And the neutral axis is
here, a little variable y

00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:29.810
at displacement.

00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:35.130
I is the integral
of y squared dA.

00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:40.575
And dA is just a little
slice of area here, dA.

00:57:40.575 --> 00:57:43.830
And the integral of y squared
dA is your cross sectional area

00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:48.380
moment of inertia in the
direction of bending.

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:55.980
So that is I. You can also
write it as a kappa squared A.

00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:58.260
And we ran into
this in dynamics.

00:57:58.260 --> 00:57:59.930
We called it the
radius of gyration.

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:03.840
You had the same thing with
area moments of inertia,

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:04.860
the radius of gyration.

00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:08.910
This is going to be really
helpful in a second.

00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:15.970
So if you solve the
force balance for a beam

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:26.960
like I did for the string,
take a little slice,

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:30.270
do force balance for
transverse motions--

00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:32.550
I'm not going to grind it out.

00:58:32.550 --> 00:58:35.540
And temporarily neglect
external forces and damping.

00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:38.090
I want to get to the natural
frequencies and mode shapes.

00:58:38.090 --> 00:58:41.300
So the free vibration,
no damping, equation

00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:48.680
looks like EI partial
4 w with respect

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:58.970
to x to the fourth plus rho A
partial squared w with respect

00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:01.330
to t squared equals 0.

00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:03.615
And now this is
density, mass density.

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:10.930
And the A, this A, is the
area of the cross section.

00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:22.090
So it's just some bh with
thickness times the width.

00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:26.104
So rho times A is a
mass per unit length.

00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:31.190
And so mass per
unit length times

00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:33.200
dx would be the
little mass associated

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.380
with the element times
the acceleration should

00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:37.360
be the forces on the element.

00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:40.330
So that's the fourth
order partial differential

00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:44.690
equation that describes
the vibration of a beam.

00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:50.630
And you have to apply
the boundary conditions.

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:55.150
And for the string, it was
just B1 cosine B2 sine.

00:59:55.150 --> 01:00:02.470
For the beam, it's B1 cosine
plus B2 sine plus C2 cosh

01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:05.730
plus D2 sinh x.

01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:08.160
And then you have to apply
four boundary conditions

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:13.177
and solve for B1, B2, and
so forth, all four of those.

01:00:13.177 --> 01:00:13.760
I won't do it.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.801
But that's how you do it.

01:00:14.801 --> 01:00:18.110
Separation-- and separation
of variables works again.

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:20.540
So we solve this, apply
the boundary conditions.

01:00:26.185 --> 01:00:27.560
What are the
boundary conditions?

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.643
Just so you understand
what I mean by the boundary

01:00:29.643 --> 01:00:31.990
conditions, what are they
for a free-free beam,

01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:33.340
zero motion at the wall?

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:43.210
No strain at the end, no
bending moment at the end,

01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:44.940
no sheer force at
the end-- so there's

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:47.315
no second derivative,
no third derivative.

01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:56.790
And at the wall, the slope
is 0, the first derivative.

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:59.704
No slope comes into the wall,
but the slope is 0 there.

01:00:59.704 --> 01:01:01.620
So those are the different
kind of boundaries.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.980
So if you have a
free-free beam, you

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:09.740
have no bending at either end
and no strain at either end.

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:11.830
Fixed-fixed beam--
no displacement,

01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:14.342
zero slopes at both at ends,
and all different combinations.

01:01:14.342 --> 01:01:16.050
And every different
combination gives you

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:17.990
different natural frequencies.

01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:21.010
So you apply the boundary
conditions, and for a beam,

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:24.230
you find out that
for all beams omega

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:31.790
n can be written as some
beta n, a parameter, squared,

01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:39.600
I'll call it, times the
square root of EI over rho A.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.725
And this thing varies according
to the boundary conditions.

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:50.170
Now that's what you get shown
in every textbook in the world.

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:54.810
And I have a very hard
time visualizing this,

01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:59.060
getting physical
intuition by that.

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.140
So something you never
see in a textbook

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:12.050
but I often do is let's
replace I with kappa squared A.

01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:19.310
And you get a square root of E
over rho and a square root of I

01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:22.740
over A. But I is kappa
squared A. The A's cancel.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:29.040
It's the square root
of kappa squared.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.346
So this, you know
what E over rho is?

01:02:32.346 --> 01:02:38.960
E over rho, square
root of E over rho,

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:47.910
is the sound speed
in a solid material.

01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:51.790
So the speed of stress
waves traveling up and down

01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:54.409
this thing is the square
root of E over rho.

01:02:54.409 --> 01:02:54.950
[ROD RINGING]

01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:55.658
This is aluminum.

01:02:55.658 --> 01:03:00.650
It's about 4,000
meters a second.

01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:03.970
So if you know just the
properties of the material,

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:04.730
you have that.

01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:08.590
And that says then
omega n for beams

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:16.020
is some beta n squared a
parameter times kappa CL.

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:18.320
And this thing, this
is often written CL.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.870
It's the longitudinal
sound speed.

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:28.420
This is sound speed for waves
traveling through the medium.

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:30.990
So this tells you if you
make the beam twice as thick,

01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:33.790
what do you do to its
natural frequencies?

01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:37.250
Doubles-- instantly
you know that.

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:40.970
So bending properties depend a
lot on the radius of gyration.

01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:43.180
And I'll give you a
few natural frequencies

01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.770
for different
boundary conditions

01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:46.560
just so you see what
they behave like.

01:03:56.020 --> 01:04:06.680
So a pin-pin beam
looks like that.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:14.469
So you put a plank across the
stream, rocks on both sides,

01:04:14.469 --> 01:04:16.010
you've got a pin-pin
beam, basically.

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:17.360
It's set there in rock.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.405
So some length L
has properties EI.

01:04:20.405 --> 01:04:23.410
So the natural frequencies
for a pin-pin beam,

01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:29.250
the beta n's, are
just n pi over L.

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:32.690
And so your natural
frequencies-- omega n

01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:38.960
looks like n pi over L
quantity squared kappa CL.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:57.590
And for the cantilever,
the natural frequencies

01:04:57.590 --> 01:05:09.795
look like omega n pi squared
over 4L squared, is the beta n.

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:16.360
And I'll write it this
way again-- EI over

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.870
rho A. You can always
go back and do that.

01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:20.800
Or you can call it kappa CL.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.310
This is also kappa CL.

01:05:25.310 --> 01:05:29.360
But then there are
some numbers you've got

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:33.070
to use here-- 1.194 squared.

01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:34.650
That's the first mode.

01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:39.300
Second mode-- 2.988 squared.

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:45.900
And then after that-- 5
squared, 7 squared, 9 squared.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:50.220
So this is the natural
frequency of a cantilever.

01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:53.880
Pi squared over 4L
squared times 1.194

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.240
squared kappa CL, that's
this natural frequency.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:05.590
And one final case,
because I can show it

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:08.640
to you-- the free-free case.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:14.822
So that's a beam bending
that vibrates like that.

01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:22.810
And I happen to know on a
beam for the first mode-- this

01:06:22.810 --> 01:06:24.310
is the first mode of a beam.

01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:26.710
Where these nodes are,
where there's no motion,

01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:29.132
I should be able to hold
it there and not damp it.

01:06:29.132 --> 01:06:31.340
And that turns out to be at
about the quarter points.

01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:36.382
So whack it like that.

01:06:36.382 --> 01:06:40.720
[ROD RINGING]

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.470
And do it again.

01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:44.610
[ROD RINGING]

01:06:44.610 --> 01:06:50.921
All right, so I want you to
hold it about right there.

01:06:50.921 --> 01:06:52.920
Nope, you can't hold it
like that, though-- just

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:53.690
got to balance it.

01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:56.258
Because you've got to be
right where the node is.

01:06:56.258 --> 01:06:59.914
[ROD RINGING]

01:06:59.914 --> 01:07:01.580
You can hear that
little bit lower tone.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.160
That's that free-free
bending mode.

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:03.810
And it's just sitting.

01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:06.060
You can feel it vibrating
a little bit but not much.

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:08.060
When you're right
in the right spot,

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:11.670
you're right on the mode shape.

01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:14.120
You can almost see it if
you hit it hard enough.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.210
So that's the free-free beam.

01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:23.472
And the free-free beam has
natural frequencies omega n,

01:07:23.472 --> 01:07:39.160
again, pi squared over 4L
squared kappa CL 3.0112

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:47.540
squared, 5 squared, 7 squared,
9 squared, so as you go up in n.

01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:49.132
So those are the
natural frequencies

01:07:49.132 --> 01:07:49.965
of a free-free beam.

01:07:53.060 --> 01:08:05.360
Oh, one last fact about
beams-- so this is now

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.860
a steel beam under no tension.

01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:12.310
It can support its own
weight, long though.

01:08:12.310 --> 01:08:16.180
So can a beam support
waves traveling down

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:18.979
the beam, transverse waves
traveling down the beam?

01:08:18.979 --> 01:08:19.810
What do you think?

01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:24.330
Well, if it can support
this, it can probably

01:08:24.330 --> 01:08:25.920
support waves, right?

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.500
So waves will
propagate in a beam

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:30.450
even though this is fourth order
partial differential equation.

01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:33.020
But how fast do they go?

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:35.819
That's the question.

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:36.880
So this is a beam.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.649
And I want to know about
waves traveling down it.

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:41.590
And I'm not going
to go through-- this

01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:46.540
would take another hour or so to
show you where this comes from.

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:50.859
But here's my beam.

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:54.130
Here's a disturbance
traveling along it

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:57.899
with some speed that
I'm going to call CT.

01:08:57.899 --> 01:09:00.880
It's transverse wave speed.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.189
It's the speed you'd see
a crest of a wave moving

01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:06.970
at running down that beam.

01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:18.899
CT for a beam-- square
root of omega kappa CL.

01:09:18.899 --> 01:09:23.819
And CL, again, is the
square root of E over rho.

01:09:23.819 --> 01:09:25.790
That's the speed of
sound in the material.

01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:28.920
That just turns up in here.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:38.250
So what does this tell you
about the frequency dependence

01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:40.253
of the speed?

01:09:40.253 --> 01:09:41.794
Does the speed change
with frequency?

01:09:44.979 --> 01:09:47.970
Omega kappa CL-- it's
proportional to frequency.

01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:51.910
High frequency waves go faster
than low frequency waves

01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:54.250
in a beam.

01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:56.450
I didn't emphasize it when
we were talking about it.

01:09:56.450 --> 01:10:02.170
But the wave equation,
what was c for the string?

01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:06.220
For the wave equation, the
speed of wave propagation

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:07.280
was square root of T/m.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.220
Was it frequency dependent?

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:12.130
Always traveled
at the same speed.

01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:15.455
And so there's an
important consequence.

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:24.140
So for anything that
obeys the wave equation,

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:28.330
the speed of propagation is
a constant and independent

01:10:28.330 --> 01:10:30.450
to frequency.

01:10:30.450 --> 01:10:35.600
So I can make any initial
shape that I make in this thing

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.210
and let it go.

01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:39.260
Its initial disturbance,
that little shape

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:44.559
will stay that shape and run
up and down the thing forever.

01:10:44.559 --> 01:10:46.600
And that shape-- you could
imagine a little pluck

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.950
like this to start with.

01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:51.370
You could imagine
doing a Fourier

01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:52.720
series to approximate that.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.740
It would be made up of a
bunch of different Fourier

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:58.270
components.

01:10:58.270 --> 01:11:00.957
And yet for something that
bears the wave equation,

01:11:00.957 --> 01:11:03.290
that little pluck will just
stay the shape of that pluck

01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:04.890
and run around forever.

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:07.190
But not so in a beam.

01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:09.810
If you did that in a beam,
if you come up and put

01:11:09.810 --> 01:11:14.640
an impulse into a
beam, all that energy

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.720
would start out together.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:20.082
But in very brief time, the
high frequency information

01:11:20.082 --> 01:11:22.415
would get out in front of the
low frequency information.

01:11:22.415 --> 01:11:26.570
And if you were way down this
beam, and somebody up a mile

01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:29.660
away whacks one end, and
you're down further along,

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.550
you'll see high
frequency waves past you,

01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:34.780
and then lower frequency,
and finally really slow

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:37.300
ones coming by, the
really long waves.

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:41.560
So that's called dispersion.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.125
So beam waves are dispersive.

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:53.100
Things that obey the wave
equation are non-dispersive.

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:56.670
The energy all travels at
the same speed independent

01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:58.270
of frequency.

01:11:58.270 --> 01:12:03.700
All right, so that's
it for the term.

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:07.520
I'll see you guys
on next Wednesday.
