00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.070
Find the area of a square
with side 6x minus 5y.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.380
So if you have a square, all the
sides are going to be the

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.720
same length, and they're
telling us the

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.400
length is 6x minus 5y.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.130
The height will also
be 6x minus 5y.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.090
And if you wanted to find the
area of the square, you would

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.830
just multiply the width times
the height, or you would

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.250
multiply 6x minus 5y
times 6x minus 5y.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.820
Or another way to think about
it is you're taking 6x minus

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.920
5y to the second power,
or you're

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.920
taking 6x minus 5y squared.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.960
That's why raising something to
the second power is called

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.150
squaring it because you're
essentially finding the area

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.380
of a square.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.310
You're going from one dimension
to two dimensions.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.130
That's where the term
squared comes from.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.180
Now, when you square something,
you can just do the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.280
distributive property
twice like we've

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.540
done in several videos.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.570
But a shortcut when you square
something, and it all just

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.560
comes from working it out by
doing the distributive

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.545
property twice, is you can
square the first term, so

00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:13.170
it'll be 6x squared, and then
you can take the product of

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.660
both terms and multiply it by
2, so times 2 times 6x times

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.230
negative 5y.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.140
And then you can square
the last term.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.990
Let me do it in a new color.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.000
So plus negative 5y squared.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.580
So that's the last
term right there.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.730
This is the product
of both of them.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.100
You multiply it by 2 and that
will be this quantity squared.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.380
And you can get there by just
doing the distributive

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.045
property twice, or FOIL, however
you want to do it, but

00:01:40.045 --> 00:01:43.010
this is a quicker way so that
when you see a squared, you

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.400
can immediately get to this.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.650
And just working it out,
you get 6x squared is

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.730
36x squared, right?

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.160
6 squared times x squared.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.790
And then you have a negative--
let's see, 2 times 6 times 5.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.730
That is negative 10 times
6, so it's negative 60.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.280
And then we have an x and a
y, xy, and then all of the

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.900
constants, when you multiply
them, you get negative 60.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.150
And then finally, you have a
plus negative 5y squared.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.980
So what is negative 5 squared?

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.930
Negative 5 squared
is positive 25.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.870
And then y squared is
just y squared.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.120
And we're done!

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.420
We found the area of the square
with side 6x minus 5y.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.710
It's represented by this
expression right here.
