00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.870
MALE SPEAKER: Very
warm welcome.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.330
We're going to be discussing
everything monsters today.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.119
I thought I'd start--

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.280
I spent the first 10 minutes
writing down some monster

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.840
jokes to whip you into
a monster frenzy.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.560
OK.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.680
Why couldn't the monster
buy a pair of shoes?

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.310
DAN SCANLON: Why?

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.840
KORI RAE: He didn't have feet.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.220
MALE SPEAKER: Because
he had a big foot.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.690
KORI RAE: Ah.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.100
DAN SCANLON: Ah.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.220
That's gold.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.022
It's not too late to get
that in the movie.

00:00:29.022 --> 00:00:31.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.230
MALE SPEAKER: It
does get worse.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.820
Why did the monster transfer
jobs so easily?

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.860
DAN SCANLON: I don't know.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.830
MALE SPEAKER: Because of the
claws in his contract.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.952
DAN SCANLON: Ah.

00:00:42.952 --> 00:00:44.434
MALE SPEAKER: That's
terrible, isn't it?

00:00:44.434 --> 00:00:44.930
DAN SCANLON: Much worse.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.830
KORI RAE: Nice.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.130
MALE SPEAKER: Last
one, I promise.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.200
Why couldn't the monster
get into his apartment?

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.310
This one needs a bit of work.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.170
DAN SCANLON: OK.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.760
KORI RAE: The others didn't.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.630
DAN SCANLON: Yeah, yeah.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.230
The others are great.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.890
MALE SPEAKER: Why couldn't
the monster--

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.710
now I haven't--

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.600
there is a punchline.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.900
DAN SCANLON: OK.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.000
KORI RAE: OK.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.550
MALE SPEAKER: He couldn't get
into his apartment because of

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.650
the Lock Ness Monster.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.300
KORI RAE: Oh.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.712
DAN SCANLON: Yeah.

00:01:08.712 --> 00:01:10.040
Except that--

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.690
OK.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.260
We'll work on that.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.380
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
I wrote down

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.776
applause and I got a little.

00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:16.114
DAN SCANLON: Oh look at that.

00:01:16.114 --> 00:01:17.590
You wrote down applause.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.950
With an actual pause
for those jokes.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.910
It's very professional.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.600
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.300
So thankfully you're not here
to listen to these jokes.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.080
We're actually here to meet the
creators of this, which

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.152
will either be awkward
silence or a trailer.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.690
So we're very lucky to have
the director of "Monsters

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.525
University," Dan Scanlon, and
Kori Rae, the producer.

00:01:46.525 --> 00:01:47.950
KORI RAE: Hello.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.230
MALE SPEAKER: Maybe I'll ask
you to introduce a bit more

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.860
about yourselves in a minute,
but the first question is how

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.910
does it feel seeing that?

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.820
DAN SCANLON: Oh, it's great.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.160
It's fun to watch the trailer
with an audience.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.190
I don't think we've
ever done that.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.280
KORI RAE: I know.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.640
DAN SCANLON: Yeah.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.180
We're so excited that
the movie's done.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.920
We spent so much time
working on it.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.940
We spend almost five years
working on each individual

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.830
film at Pixar.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.490
And so to finally have the movie
coming out in two days

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.650
and to be able to share
it with the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.210
world is very exciting.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.220
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.410
From a production point of view,
the amount of work that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.040
goes into that-- is that
a relief to see

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.710
how amazing it is?

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.160
KORI RAE: It is.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.640
And it's been interesting
in the last few weeks.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.750
It's almost bittersweet when
it's over because you do spend

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.180
so much time with the crew
and so much time on the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.710
production.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.440
And it's a little bit of an odd
departure when it's over

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.650
so we're still experiencing
a little bit of that.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.810
But super-excited to get
it out to the world.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.603
Can't wait.

00:02:48.603 --> 00:02:49.290
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.920
So we may open up some questions
we have maybe 20

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.560
minutes left.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.030
So I was hopefully going to
go through some topics.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.300
I was kind of interested in how
you arrived at Pixar on

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.780
your journey and a little bit
about your education and

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.220
inspirations.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.410
DAN SCANLON: Yeah, in my case
I always loved to draw, got

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.820
really into film and animation
when I was young.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.640
I went to college in
Ohio studying--

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.020
actually studying illustration
and kind of fell

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.290
off film for awhile.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.080
But then I get a job at this
company in Ohio called

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.850
Character Builders that did a
lot of direct-to-video Disney

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.420
sequels, "The Little Mermaid
II" and "101 Dalmatians II"

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.220
and all those.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.770
But it was great.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.390
It was a great experience
because we had to make the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.980
movies for half the budget
and half the time.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.730
Frankly even knowing that you're
making a movie that

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.210
people didn't want to exist.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.420
The people didn't want
those movies.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.160
But I liked that.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.970
I liked kind of the underdog
nature of, all right we're

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.210
going to try to make these
as good as we can.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.770
And then I left there and I
applied to as many places as I

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.740
could because I just wanted to
try to move to California.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.330
To try to really go for it.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.840
And I applied at all these
different places.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.090
And I applied at Pixar as
sort of the joke one.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.200
Like well, I guess it wouldn't
hurt to get my

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.400
name on a form somewhere.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.910
And no one replied to
me except for Pixar.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.300
And it was such a great example

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.540
of just go for whatever.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.510
Go for everything you want
because you never know.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.660
And luckily they brought me in
to work on "Cars"-- the first

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.740
"Cars."

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.510
And in my interview with Joe
Ranft, who was a great story

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.330
artist there, he said, oh you're
from the Detroit area.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.800
I bet you're really good
at drawing cars.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.950
I didn't know what the movie
was going to be about yet.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.370
And I said, oh to be honest with
you I hate drawing cars.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.060
I don't know how to do it.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.620
That's why I'm leaving
Detroit.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.210
I couldn't draw a car
to save my life.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.130
And then I said, the movie's
called "Cars"?

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.620
I was like, ohh.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.940
Oh.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.470
And so, yeah "Monsters Inc," the
first one, actually came

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.290
out the first month that
I worked at Pixar.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.100
And I got to go to the wrap
party and it was just such a

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.830
dream to be there.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.620
And then I worked on "Toy
Story" and made my own

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.620
live-action film feature
called "Tracy" on the

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.280
weekends, with other people from
Pixar, just as practice

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.520
writing and directing
a feature on my own.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.030
And I think that helped
me get this job.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.290
MALE SPEAKER: So the inspiration
was Disney when

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.010
you were a child--

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.220
sort of growing up with the old
classic [INAUDIBLE] films.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.470
DAN SCANLON: A lot of it was
more Warner Bros., Chuck

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.180
Jones, Tex Avery-- that
kind of stuff.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.900
But I was a fan of the shorts
Pixar was doing.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.070
And I was a fan of Aardman, the
shorts that Aardman was

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.060
doing at the time.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.210
MALE SPEAKER: That's great.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.880
And Kori, in terms of producing,
did you start small

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.560
and then work into
big scale film?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.180
KORI RAE: Yeah, I started
at the very bottom.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.530
I got in on the ground floor
about 20 years ago when we

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.920
used to produce commercials.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.320
And I applied for an assistant
to the executive producer of

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.860
the Commercials Group and went
up against a couple of

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.670
internal people.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.520
And I had a little bit of a
writing background and project

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.400
management background, so
somehow they hired me.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.150
And then I kind of quickly
worked my way up in the

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.070
Commercial Group and started
producing commercials until

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.470
"Toy Story" came out.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.540
And they took all of our
people that were in the

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.420
Commercials Group, all 12 or
13, just to finish "Toy

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.770
Story." And then once it was
released and Disney said well

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.750
maybe we might help--

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.800
if you want to make another
movie, maybe.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.120
So that's when we kind of
closed up shop in the

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.770
Commercial Group and I moved
over and started working on "A

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.910
Bug's Life" as the animation
manager.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.080
So that was my first
feature film.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.410
And then I've worked on a bunch
since then, and this is

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.780
my first full producing gig.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.230
I was a development producer
on "Up" but just

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.960
for the first year.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.990
MALE SPEAKER: What's really
astounding I think, watching

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.200
Pixar movies, is the incredible
amount of detail

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.440
and love and passion that
goes into those films.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.180
And also how complex it must
be from the beginning of a

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.950
storyboard through to
the finished piece.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.590
But just a little bit on that
process, do you still

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.010
traditionally begin with the
drawings and the gag drawings

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.690
the way that the old Disney
films were made and the old

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:10.510
Warner Bros. films?

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.980
DAN SCANLON: Yeah.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:11.270
KORI RAE: Yeah.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.560
DAN SCANLON: Absolutely.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.330
KORI RAE: Absolutely, yeah.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.410
We did over 200,000 storyboards
for this film.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.550
So--

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.910
DAN SCANLON: Oops.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.435
KORI RAE: For better or worse.

00:07:20.435 --> 00:07:22.960
DAN SCANLON: I couldn't
make up my mind.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.300
Yeah, we'd still do a ton
of hand-drawn stuff.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.230
Even our storyboards--

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.730
and when I started on "Cars"
our storyboards were

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.560
completely hand-drawn on paper
and pasted to the wall, and we

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.790
pointed at them with
an old stick.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.860
It feels like an incredibly
outdated thing now, but the

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.000
world changed fast.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.540
And now we're drawing
on Cintiqs.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.360
But you know in the art
department people still draw

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.100
on paper every now and then.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.432
KORI RAE: Yep.

00:07:50.432 --> 00:07:51.320
DAN SCANLON: Yeah.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.130
MALE SPEAKER: And I guess
because the actual process of

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.330
these animation renderings is
very expensive, you really try

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.450
and get the lock down
on these finished

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.550
animatics to begin with.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.070
So you've pretty much got the
whole story working before you

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.240
move forward.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.550
KORI RAE: At least
segments of it.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:07.130
You know what I mean.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:11.380
We certainly put the story reels
up over and over again a

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.600
lot the first two
years at least--

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.400
like every three months.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.090
We'd put them, up we show
them to the internal

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.930
kind of brain trust--

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.320
all the directors at Pixar.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.070
Then they give a bunch of notes,
we tear them down and

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.780
we start all over.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.820
And we do that every
three months or so.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.900
And then slowly we--

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.429
and along with that
we do design.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.870
We start design pretty
early-on as well--

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:35.890
production design.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.189
And then it kind of gets into
production from there.

00:08:38.189 --> 00:08:39.530
MALE SPEAKER: So you're kind of
building everything up bit

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.834
by bit, but occasionally
going back in.

00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:43.830
KORI RAE: Yeah, for sure.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.790
MALE SPEAKER: So I guess you
took this template but then

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:49.600
you also thought we want this
idea for a sequel, but we

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.640
don't want a sequel
we want a prequel.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.836
How did that come about?

00:08:53.836 --> 00:08:56.200
DAN SCANLON: About five years
ago we started thinking about

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.450
it for the first time.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.180
Just the idea that we loved
these characters and wanted to

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.550
see if there was even an
idea there worth doing.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:08.560
So a bunch of us got together,
including John Lasseter and

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.510
Pete Docter who wrote the
original-- or I mean that

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.380
directed the original film--

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.810
the original writers
were there.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.680
And we thought if we were going
to do a story with these

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.140
characters we wanted to do
something that explored their

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.940
relationship more.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.500
And that was really where we got
the idea of well we should

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.180
go back in time and actually
see how the

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.290
relationship developed.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.140
And obviously from that idea
we loved the entertainment

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.960
possibility of college,
monster college.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.260
But the real heart of it for
us was when we realized we

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.940
could tell the story
about Mike.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.790
And the movie is very
much Mike's story.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.070
It's a movie about these guys
coming together but our main

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.970
character this time is Mike.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:56.180
And we found that prequels are
tough because you more or less

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.330
know how the movie's going to
end and that everyone's going

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.580
to survive.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.570
And so we wanted to tell a story
where knowing the ending

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.710
at the beginning of the movie
was a good thing.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.020
We wanted to tell a story about
a character who doesn't

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.820
get everything he wants
in the end.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.220
There are so many movies that
say if you work hard and never

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.910
give up everything will
always turn out great.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.310
And even though that's a great
message it's just sadly it's

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.540
not always true.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.160
And so many of us that
experienced that in our weird

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.380
past to our careers, that we'd
had these big dreams that were

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.340
kind of dashed.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.620
And at the time it seemed
devastating, but we look back

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.700
on it now and realize
well it actually led

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.720
to something better.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.130
And we wanted to tell
that story.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.520
So it's really the story of Mike
desperately wanting to be

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.760
a scarer more than anything
in his life.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.570
And then the audience
knowing he's headed

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.390
for kind of a disaster.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.900
That seemed so interesting
to us.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.170
To tell a story that was a
little controversial and we

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.340
hadn't quite seen before.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.800
And that's where the gist
of the idea came from.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.700
MALE SPEAKER: It was sort of a
wonderful surprise watching

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.860
the film thinking that
we do know, kind of

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.840
in a way, what happens.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.320
But actually it's just
this great snapshot

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.880
of life on an American--

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.490
in an American university.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.440
Was there ever a slight worry
that you were thinking would

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.830
this translate globally, this
idea of universities?

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.200
Not for me, I remember growing
up in the UK with programs

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.410
like "The Wonder Years," and I
had this idea of what American

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.220
college was like.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.070
DAN SCANLON: That's
so funny as we

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:25.360
started to talk to people.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.280
Well number one we thought you
really just need to know

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.880
there's fraternities and
sororities in the movie.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.650
But I think as long as you
see them as teams--

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.375
KORI RAE: Teams or
clubs, yeah.

00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:34.790
DAN SCANLON: --it makes sense.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.560
Then the more people we talked
to would say exactly what you

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.330
said like, well I know what it
is from American movies.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.790
And I'd think, yeah that's the
only reason I know what it is.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.850
Like the college I went to
was nothing like that.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:46.940
We went to art school.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.330
They didn't have fraternities or
sororities or any of that.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.010
KORI RAE: Yeah.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.440
DAN SCANLON: So it seemed like
it's being received well

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.510
regardless of that.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.990
MALE SPEAKER: And I
think-- sorry--

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.890
KORI RAE: Oh no, I was just
going to say because the film

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.040
is really about self-discovery.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.650
And it's really about that time
in your life when you're

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.740
18-19 years old, kind of out on
your own for the first time

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.950
figuring stuff out.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:12.040
And so we have found that it
still is a pretty universal

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.380
story and a pretty universal
message, even though it takes

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.470
place on a college campus.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.250
Even if that part isn't quite
familiar with people.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.290
We think the story
still resonates.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.490
MALE SPEAKER: It has this
great bit where you're

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.600
introduced to all these
different frat parties that

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.480
have all these different
sort of personalities.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.330
I think we may have a clip, the
ROR Trailer, of meeting

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.100
one of the other sort
of gangs on campus.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.670
KORI RAE: Yeah exactly.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.418
BACKGROUND SPEAKER:
Do you want to

00:12:36.418 --> 00:12:38.610
do initiation reports--

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:39.820
MALE SPEAKER: We can
show initiation.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.560
I was going to ask you if
this was your initiation

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.860
ceremony for Pixar.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:44.620
DAN SCANLON: Right, yes.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.320
MALE SPEAKER: OK, so we'll
run the other one.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.850
And just on the characters--

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.000
it looks like you had an
absolute blast creating and

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.970
designing these, because it's
a world where anything can

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.310
happen, right?

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.790
DAN SCANLON: Yeah,
oh for sure.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:06.270
We have a great art
department.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:09.140
And you know the first thing
we really do is think about

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.890
the characters themselves, what
they need to be in order

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.680
to tell the story, and then
we start designing them.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.450
And it is tough.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:20.360
In the case of "Monsters" it's
fun because it can be anything

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.850
and it's hard because
it can be anything.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:28.010
It's hard to figure out
what to hold onto.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.900
Yeah, we had a great time
with this team.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.440
We have a new character, the
dean in the movie Dean

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.470
Hardscrabble, who had to be
one of the most terrifying

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.600
scarers of all time.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.640
And so we really wanted to
design something that was

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.110
really freaky looking.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.330
We got on the topic of bugs.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.100
Bugs are creepy.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.180
And we found this thing--

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.070
it's a giant centipede, it's a
real thing that exists in the

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:55.290
world-- and we rented one.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.670
And they brought it--

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.670
KORI RAE: We weren't
going to buy one.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:59.550
We weren't going to keep it.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.780
DAN SCANLON: No.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.120
Yeah, and they brought it into
meetings in what looked like a

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.070
plastic jar that had
potato salad in it.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:13.080
It was so not official with a
little bit of tape on it.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.800
This doesn't seem right that one
of the interns is taking

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.260
care of this thing.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.190
And they said, the guy that
brought it said, if it bites

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.070
you you won't die but you'll
wish you were dead.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.760
So we would have this thing
around all the time.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.580
But it was really great to
research to have it there.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.250
MALE SPEAKER: And it's also
interesting because the other

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.130
world, the animation world,
gives you sort of the

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.630
opportunity to make
things move in

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.790
completely different ways.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.172
And that's what I also loved
about this film--

00:14:45.172 --> 00:14:47.492
you had the opportunity to play
with short legs, long

00:14:47.492 --> 00:14:49.880
legs, millipedes, giant--

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.850
It's an opportunity for the
animators to really sort of

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:53.890
get their teeth into it.

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:54.350
DAN SCANLON: Yeah.

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:55.150
KORI RAE: Yeah.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.590
DAN SCANLON: Oh yeah, I mean
animation-wise it was each one

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.540
of these things-- once you
develop a new-looking

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.650
character, now you have to
figure out how it moves.

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:05.760
And again they're all things
that we've never really seen

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.000
before necessarily.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.870
Tentacles are very
hard, apparently.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:10.710
KORI RAE: For sure.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.850
Yeah, I think just the scope of
this film and the different

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:14.920
body types.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.320
It was actually one of the most
challenging things about

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.090
the film, technically.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.980
Where just the different-- the
number of different types of

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.020
monsters, and the way that
they moved, and the

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:25.960
locomotion of them.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.540
It was because there's dozens
and hundreds of

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.970
monsters in each shot.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.140
And they all move differently.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.580
So you have to--

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.980
the animator has to animate
Terri and Terry with

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.490
tentacles, and they have to
animate Squishy that just kind

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:46.470
of has squishy legs, and Art
who moves in a weird way.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:47.660
DAN SCANLON: Yeah, he's
sort of the purple

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.200
thing you saw in that--

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.250
KORI RAE: U-shaped guy.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:50.510
DAN SCANLON: Yeah.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.140
KORI RAE: Yeah.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.060
DAN SCANLON: And that was great
because the animators

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.730
would almost kind of test
themselves and who could come

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.820
up with the weirdest thing
for Art to do.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.420
It was just very fun
to explore that.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.180
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, it's
beautiful to watch.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.130
And also I think the other thing
that stood out was the

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.540
attention to detail which
is always there

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.970
in these Pixar films.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.010
But I'd never seen
anything like--

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:12.020
there was almost dust
particles I noticed.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.640
There's a part where Mike writes
in his calendar and

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.270
that the pen absorbs
into the calendar.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.370
It's almost like--

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:19.900
that's incredible.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:24.100
I mean how far can that
technology go?

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:24.850
DAN SCANLON: I don't know.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:25.270
KORI RAE: I don't know.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:25.980
It's amazing.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:30.690
I think it's that the artists
are really pushing themselves

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:31.190
all the time.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.390
This isn't like Dan--

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.840
I don't think Dan was in the
review going, OK now make sure

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.850
that that marker really
seeps in there.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.040
It's everybody challenging
themselves.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:40.840
And that's--

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.470
like this environment, it's
similar at Pixar--

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.840
we're just always trying
to push individually.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.420
All the artists are pushing
themselves to do something

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.560
cooler than last time.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.300
Or add that little touch at
the very end of the shot.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.340
And it's remarkable.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.170
I mean that is what all
adds up to that

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:01.730
incredible level of detail.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.750
Again most of it
isn't planned.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.359
Some of it is.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.390
And a lot of it just happens
because the artists

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:08.520
are who they are.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.560
So it's cool that way.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.160
MALE SPEAKER: So like with
"Nemo" it was water, and this

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.890
particular problem may have been
tentacles and the amount

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.420
of monsters on the show.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.700
KORI RAE: Yeah, it was kind of
the amount of characters was

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.859
the big challenge.

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:21.170
DAN SCANLON: That and apparently
backpacks.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.030
KORI RAE: Backpacks.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.650
DAN SCANLON: At some
point backpacks are

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.270
really hard to simulate.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:28.540
And put a backpack on
a hair creature.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.440
But I felt bad because it's
well it's college--

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.260
they don't wear clothes.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.630
So what else is going
to show you that

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.000
they're college students?

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.640
So it's not as sexy and exciting
as a giant ocean of

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.890
water and flames, but backpacks
were tough.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.630
So if you see a backpack,
applaud.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.850
MALE SPEAKER: And also I think
that the world of the

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:49.640
university--

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.090
I was kind of intrigued
as to--

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:55.280
does it completely exist
somewhere in a CG.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.180
What's the level that
you went to to plan

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.660
out this giant campus.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.940
KORI RAE: Yes, a lot.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:03.830
We did have--

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.420
we had an actual model upfront
just trying to figure out the

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.370
whole layout of the campus.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:12.930
And then we did go ahead and
put that into the computer.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:16.460
I mean there's cheats here and
there where we needed for

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.660
specific scenes.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.420
But yeah, it was definitely--

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.480
and that was painstaking.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.080
Because the story has to drive
that, and the story has to be

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.790
to a certain point where you can
say, great this building

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.550
is here and this one's here.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.120
And then we'd say, hey
Dan, what's going to

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.020
happen in this building?

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.730
And he'd say, I don't know.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:35.290
I don't know yet.

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:37.990
We haven't figured it out.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.890
DAN SCANLON: Yeah.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:39.950
KORI RAE: So it's the
chick and egg thing.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:40.380
Yeah.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:40.950
Yeah.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:45.090
DAN SCANLON: And that's what's
great about the sets

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.750
department and everyone, is
they know that the story

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.070
change trumps everything.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.070
And sometimes it's sad.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.230
Sometimes you've worked really
hard on something and you

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.320
think, that building can't
be over there anymore.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.430
We made this change.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.110
We gotta move that building, or
get rid of that building,

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:59.800
or get rid of that character.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.580
And it's tough.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.710
But I think people understand
that it's all in favor of

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:04.660
making a good story.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.620
And nobody wants to just keep
something in the movie

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.750
because it's cool.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:08.800
KORI RAE: Right.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.160
DAN SCANLON: And we
worked hard on it.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.210
You know, they want
it to be right.

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:12.663
KORI RAE: That's true.

00:19:12.663 --> 00:19:13.370
Yeah.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.240
MALE SPEAKER: So going back to
the story, was there one

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.840
particular part that you
may have been stuck on?

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.670
Was it the third act, or the
middle act, or the first?

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:22.920
DAN SCANLON: You know--

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.480
well thinking of it in acts--

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.020
the middle probably.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:28.830
KORI RAE: I think
the middle was.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.970
DAN SCANLON: It's funny, every
Pixar movie has that.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.120
Where you think, ooh this
movie's going to have a tough

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.810
first act or a tough
third act.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.140
I think a tough middle is
what you want, if you

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:37.930
have to have something.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.520
As long as the movie starts
pretty good and ends pretty

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.950
good, who cares what happens
in the middle.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.020
You end up going to the
bathroom, you get popcorn.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.450
But the real danger
is when you've got

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:48.460
screwed-up third act.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.700
Because that's the whole
point of the movie.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.720
But it happens all the time.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.410
You just bang your
head against the

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:54.967
wall to get it working.

00:19:54.967 --> 00:19:56.220
KORI RAE: Right.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.120
MALE SPEAKER: It seems like it's
such a process of getting

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.310
the script writers and then also
there's this I guess this

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.540
is reality of when you get the
guys in to do the voice-overs.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.960
There may be a chemistry or
something that emerges from

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.940
there which can springboard
to another idea.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.460
So it's sort of organic in a
way, but it also has so much

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.490
riding on it I guess.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:17.470
I mean--

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.740
I have a question on pressure
which I underlined three

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.600
times, the word pressure, just
to sort of heighten it up.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.510
DAN SCANLON: You wrote it
in the form of a joke.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.280
MALE SPEAKER: In the
joke-- no, no.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.100
It's not a joke.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.820
No more jokes.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:31.270
But I mean you're a director
of the most successful film

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:35.221
company in history.

00:20:35.221 --> 00:20:38.120
Is there a level of--

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.270
is there a level of pressure
that you feel?

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.000
DAN SCANLON: I think that we--

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.070
we're pretty supported
at Pixar.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:48.120
It's a very supportive place.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.780
I always feel like we're
all in it together.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.790
It's not competitive you know.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:57.910
We try not to look at our movies
next to the other one

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.270
and that type of thing.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:03.330
Everyone is so excited about
whatever individual movie is

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.370
coming out that you--

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:08.000
I don't know-- you really don't
think about it as much.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.035
I think we're trying to make
movies that we like.

00:21:12.035 --> 00:21:14.550
Because at first, our first
audience is ourselves.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.360
It's the company.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.780
And we're trying to make
a movie that we like.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.230
And we honestly believe and
hope that if we do that,

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.060
hopefully we'll connect with
people rather than trying to

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.080
judge what the world
wants right now.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:32.050
I think that's always kind of
a dangerous road to go down.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.990
But I don't know.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.440
Everyone keeps asking me if
I feel this pressure.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.770
I feel like I should
probably feel it.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.290
I do now.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.030
KORI RAE: I think part of it
is that there's pressure at

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.490
the beginning in it because it's
just getting the story

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.070
off the ground in any
way shape or form

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.010
is the hardest part.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.240
And then there's no time.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.710
There's no time to think if
you're really moving forward.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.970
There's no time to even think
about the pressure.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:57.700
It's so crazy how jam packed the
production schedule is--

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.030
even at four years.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:04.150
It's almost like you just put
your head down and, uh.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.980
DAN SCANLON: Luckily we'll have
plenty of time on Friday

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.470
afternoon to refresh
rotten tomatoes.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:11.360
KORI RAE: I'm not doing that.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.950
MALE SPEAKER: I mean I
definitely haven't seen a film

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:16.400
where I've kind of like smiled
all the way through it.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.730
It's just like a really
enjoyable film.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.310
Once you're into the world
and that's it.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:25.400
So I don't envision too many
bad reviews really.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.980
Did you want to run the clip of
the ROR trailer because I

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.180
think it's interesting to talk
about the little different

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.210
frat gangs that appear.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.470
Actually, there's like a real
opportunity to develop those

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:43.180
different personalities and
characters within that.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.020
Is that based on the frat
gangs where you

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:46.780
were growing up?

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.310
DAN SCANLON: Yeah, I mean I
think some of it is based on

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.630
our own experiences and then
just sort of those classic

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.450
college archetypes with the
monster twist on them.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.490
But yeah, I mean that was the
fun of having the fraternities

00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:00.090
and sororities in the movie,
was to be able to just

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.850
celebrate those kind of classic

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:04.630
college cliches and types.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:05.790
MALE SPEAKER: I love the
guy with the lisp.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.410
DAN SCANLON: Yeah.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:08.940
MALE SPEAKER: I did used to
hear Pixar stories that

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.650
occasionally some of the traits
of animators or people

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.660
that work there found their
way into the characters.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.470
No one at Pixar with a lisp?

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:19.220
DAN SCANLON: No, not
that I would say.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:19.440
KORI RAE: No.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.090
But I think Bobby Moynihan
who voiced the character

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.530
of Chet kind of--

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.310
DAN SCANLON: He adds a lot.

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:25.150
KORI RAE: He adds
a lot to that.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.310
He came up with that I think.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:29.845
I mean you directed it, but
it's kind of his thing.

00:23:29.845 --> 00:23:31.420
He's so great.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.040
MALE SPEAKER: So now the
film is finished.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.700
You get this chance to maybe
take a bit of a breather

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.450
before you begin to sort of
build up the energy to take on

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:41.170
something else.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:42.805
DAN SCANLON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:42.805 --> 00:23:44.380
I'm going to take
some time off.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:44.870
KORI RAE: Exactly.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.580
A little bit.

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:46.930
DAN SCANLON: Yeah.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.890
KORI RAE: And then, yeah, come
back and then we'll go into

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:53.863
development and see if we can
come up with another idea--

00:23:53.863 --> 00:23:54.570
MALE SPEAKER: That's
fantastic.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:55.120
KORI RAE: --for another movie.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:55.550
Yeah.

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:58.150
MALE SPEAKER: In terms of
questions we only have sort of

00:23:58.150 --> 00:23:59.350
15-20 minutes left.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:04.580
So if anyone would like to cue
up that would be fantastic.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:10.050
AUDIENCE: I read that this is
the first Pixar movie that

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.300
makes full use so ray tracing?

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.870
I'm wondering if you could
discuss how that affected the

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:19.640
creative process with
movie making?

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.680
KORI RAE: Yeah, I mean yeah.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:25.133
Global illumination and that--
we've kind of did a bunch of R

00:24:25.133 --> 00:24:25.900
&amp; D at the beginning.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.436
And we've used that for the
first time on this film.

00:24:29.436 --> 00:24:30.850
DAN SCANLON: Yeah, and
it's beautiful.

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.430
I mean we love the look of it.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.130
It works really well for
this particular film.

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:40.160
It allows us to, or it allowed
me to see scenes lit kind of

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.680
quicker and more specifically.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.000
Which allowed us to tell a story
with light in a way that

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.220
we really wanted to do.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:53.630
Which just makes everything
easier I felt.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:57.780
And Pete Docter was the
executive producer on this

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.090
film and he was a big mentor
for me the whole time.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:04.450
And he would come in, and once
a week, and look at character

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:07.130
designs and animation.

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.250
And it had been 12 years since
he did his film and they did

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.880
it on a Texas Instrument
computer.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.490
He would look at what I
get to see and he'd

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:17.980
go, you're so lucky.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.650
You have it so easy.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:21.660
When he would see character
designs they were sort of

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:25.720
frozen in this weird shape and
made out of simple things.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.740
And I'd see them they'd be posed
in a production pose

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.180
with a drop shadow on it.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.290
I'm like sure, that
looks good.

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:33.000
So easy.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.905
Sorry.

00:25:33.905 --> 00:25:35.360
KORI RAE: That's true.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:35.652
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:35.652 --> 00:25:37.450
Thanks so much for coming.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.790
So the past three out of four
Pixar movies have been either

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.430
sequels or prequels.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.580
So my question is why, and what
are the challenges of

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.220
coming up with new stories
when there's

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.736
already existing material?

00:25:48.736 --> 00:25:53.140
KORI RAE: Yeah, I mean we're
kind of lucky to be able to

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.970
make more movies than
we could years ago.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.810
And we're able to go back into
these worlds and tell new

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:02.990
stories with existing characters
and worlds that we

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.830
created a while ago.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:06.500
So we're actually excited
to go back into a

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.250
lot of these worlds.

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.460
And we're also excited to
tell original stories.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.040
We're just happy to
be doing both.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.500
But I think certainly
sequels and prequels

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.150
offer another challenge.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.930
Because it's--

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:25.150
you have to kind of deal with
predictability and everything

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:29.640
that goes before, and come up
with brand new ideas that will

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.740
keep the audience interested.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.960
So it's challenging.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.800
But I think we're really glad
that we're able to do both.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.330
And move forward doing both.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.090
DAN SCANLON: We finally
have that luxury.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:40.580
But sequels can be tough.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.550
I mean we've said, it's like
it's as if someone took the

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:46.670
game chess and said, OK use all
these pieces but come up

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:48.970
with a different game that's
just as good as chess but

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:49.770
isn't chess.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.980
But you can't change the
characters that much.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.430
It's this other challenge.

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:57.460
AUDIENCE: This kind of
goes back to that

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.660
pressure question earlier.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.990
So it seems like the tradition
that Pixar staff, co-directors

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.660
of past feature films or short
films, step into director's

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.710
chair such as Pete and Andrew.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:10.120
So how much did co-directing
that short film for "Cars"

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.800
help you step into the
director's chair this time?

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.800
And also what does that say
about Pixar to have that much

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.750
trust and confidence in somebody
with their immaculate

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:19.370
track record?

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.251
DAN SCANLON: Yeah.

00:27:21.251 --> 00:27:22.245
Jesus.

00:27:22.245 --> 00:27:25.330
Pressure you guys
are putting on.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:29.490
I co-directed "Mater and the
Ghost Site" which was a short

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.790
on the DVD several years ago.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.810
But with John, so I mean
you couldn't really

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:36.570
have a better teacher.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.000
It's different than making
an original short.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.160
Those shorts, by the time we
do those, the whole team

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.150
you're with are so good
in that world.

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.870
And the animators know how to
animate those characters.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.330
That ship kind of
sails itself.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:52.810
It's a really great jumping off
point, but it is a whole

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:55.350
different world than
making a feature.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:58.010
I mean most the assets
already exist.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.740
I think we made a
lamp for that.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.380
That was like the only
thing we made.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.550
I look back on it a little bit,
I was probably strutting

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:07.140
around going, I co-directed a
movie, and not realizing, no

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.690
you didn't.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.960
You kind of did, but yeah.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:16.640
But I actually think that more
the years in story are where

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.850
the trust comes from.

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:20.920
Because story is the most
important thing when directing

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.630
a movie because all
your decisions

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:23.895
go back to the story.

00:28:23.895 --> 00:28:26.820
You don't have to know
everything about animation, or

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.260
lighting, or how the
computer works.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.210
You just have to know how to
explain the emotions that you

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.940
want and to know how
to tell a story.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.490
So I think actually making the
feature film I made on my own

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.370
was probably where more of
the trust came from.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:42.970
Because that was something
that they made that was a

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:46.700
feature-length project.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.130
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to
comment about the "Monsters

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:52.030
University" website being
excellent PR, and

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.300
that that was great.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.600
And I'm wondering with the
release of the movie if

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.290
there's going to be any
new things up on

00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:00.040
the website, surprises.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.500
KORI RAE: Oh man, that
is a great question.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.710
DAN SCANLON: Robin?

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:03.800
Sorry, our PR.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.632
KORI RAE: I know.

00:29:04.632 --> 00:29:05.930
It's PR.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.700
I think probably so, yes.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.790
I think they're going to try
to keep that active for a

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.120
little while longer.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.570
To be honest we've been just
traveling around Europe the

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:16.065
last few weeks.

00:29:16.065 --> 00:29:16.740
DAN SCANLON: Humble brag.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.380
KORI RAE: Oh,sorry.

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.580
Humble brag.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:19.870
DAN SCANLON: It's no big
deal, been to Europe.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:20.650
KORI RAE: Oh that's
bragging, really?

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:21.880
Shit.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.020
Anyhow, but so I'm not sure
what's happening with it.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.960
But I would imagine that they're
going to put some cool

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.910
new stuff on there I hope.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.354
It is great, I love it.

00:29:30.354 --> 00:29:31.740
DAN SCANLON: Yeah, me too.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.430
AUDIENCE: Along the lines of
the sequel, prequel, I was

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:37.170
surprised when I looked up that
the original movie came

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:38.550
out in 2001.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.760
And so I think about how much
changed in my life since that

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.270
time, because I was in high
school when it came out.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:48.520
So what is the challenge when
you take for instance that

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.210
large amount of time between
audiences and maybe some of

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.340
the original viewers are now
going into college themselves.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.410
And then as a quick follow-up
is there a door open for a

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:00.360
return of Mike and
Sully after this?

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:05.140
KORI RAE: Yeah, I mean I think
the fact that it's 12 years

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:09.070
later and a lot of kids were
six or seven when they saw

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:11.320
"Monsters Inc" and are
now going to college.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.920
That totally is a
happy accident.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.240
I know that probably sounds
like a lie but it's not.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.170
It really was the timing
did work out that way.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.760
We didn't even know what the
release date of the movie

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.180
would be when we started
talking about it.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.750
That was really a happy accident
that's been fun.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.790
I mean we did a lot of
screenings at colleges and

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.180
universities around
the country.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:37.510
And it was really fantastic to
see the feedback just of kids

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.620
who kind of grew up with
Mike and Sully and

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:41.870
now they're at school.

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:43.920
DAN SCANLON: And we're going
to wait another 60 years to

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.810
make "Monsters Retirement Home"
so that you can all

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:49.240
relate to that.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:53.200
We really don't have any idea
for what happens next.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.520
We don't know yet.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:54.680
KORI RAE: Yeah.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.350
DAN SCANLON: Or if.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.270
KORI RAE: No plans yet.

00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:01.320
AUDIENCE: Is this is the first
G rated college movie?

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:01.780
DAN SCANLON: Yeah.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.490
AUDIENCE: Was that like
a good challenge or?

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:04.320
DAN SCANLON: Yeah.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.280
It is, I mean it is, for
the obvious reasons.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.090
But we realized early on that
what John Lasseter called kind

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:14.270
of the raucous nature of
college, as long as you had

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:17.650
monsters kind of falling down
and smashing things and eating

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:18.930
garbage out of the
garbage can.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:21.720
It kind of felt like, oh that's
a pretty wild party.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:25.130
I don't need to know what's in
the red cup, although there

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:26.380
are red cups.

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:30.930
But you know what?

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.400
In some ways though, I think
the bigger issue was that

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.270
college is what college
movies are about.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:39.410
And I think that was a tougher
sell in a way.

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:42.440
College movies are about
rebellion and rebelling

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.750
against the system.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:46.960
And without giving anything
away, I mean these guys do

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.150
that a lot.

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:52.540
They have to, and it has to be
about kind of bucking the

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:53.290
system a little bit.

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:57.110
And I almost feel like that is
more subversive and harder for

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:00.590
people to swallow because yeah,
a college movie for

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.160
parents would be about kids
that go to school and do

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.950
great, and get great grades, and
don't have any problems.

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.120
And this can't be that.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.370
KORI RAE: Right.

00:32:11.805 --> 00:32:13.430
AUDIENCE: This is a
question for Dan.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:16.660
You mentioned earlier and then
you alluded to it in your

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:20.180
career path, that you made this
movie on your spare time

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.210
with other Pixar people?

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.550
I wonder if you could tell a
little more of that within the

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:25.120
context of Pixar culture?

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.110
Like are there always these
creative ambitious people

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:29.450
doing these side projects?

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:31.880
Or where you really like driven
to figure out how you

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.150
could kind of take your career
to the next level?

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:36.170
DAN SCANLON: Oh I think that's
what's great about Pixar is

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:37.190
there's a lot of people
doing that.

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.610
KORI RAE: Yeah.

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:39.950
DAN SCANLON: There's always
artists making their own comic

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:41.550
book and people doing
their own thing.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:45.570
And I think Pixar is really
supportive of it, as long as

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:48.140
it's handled correctly.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:52.220
Because it's all about like
here, it's all about allowing

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.010
people to get better
and explore.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:58.780
And what better way than for
them to do it on their own

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.310
little bit too.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.840
I think a lot of people are
doing those kinds of things

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.420
and it does help you grow.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.640
AUDIENCE: With both of you
having been with Pixar since

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.840
before the Disney acquisition
and afterwards and with the

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.130
purchase of the "Star Wars"
franchise ringing in our ears,

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:18.280
what kind of freedoms and how
did the production process and

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.580
creative process change pre
and post acquisition?

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:28.560
KORI RAE: I mean obviously the
biggest thing was access to

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:33.220
the characters and making more
films, sequels, prequels with

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:33.820
those characters.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.220
That was kind of the biggest win
for us because we really

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.020
wanted to be able to do that.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:46.230
But creatively in terms of being
there, we're still so

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.660
singularly focused--

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.300
I can't say that word--

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:53.990
on just making great movies that
we haven't noticed any

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.240
big changes.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.350
I mean when we're heads down
making a movie it's the same.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:02.240
We're trying to do better each
time and we're trying to tell

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.590
better stories and use
technology in a different way.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:08.725
But in terms of the culture
nothing has changed honestly.

00:34:12.232 --> 00:34:13.010
It's been good in that way.

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:14.139
DAN SCANLON: We're
a bigger company.

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:15.179
KORI RAE: We're pretty
autonomous.

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:19.170
I mean Pixar itself is an
autonomous part of the Disney

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:19.850
corporation.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.940
So, and it does feel
like that still.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.929
AUDIENCE: Pixar is known for
having great technical prowess

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:28.630
and then also artistic vision.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:30.830
So you have these two groups
of people with really

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:31.520
incredible talent.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.170
How do they match up against
one another where you have

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:37.394
people able to do something but
necessarily not having the

00:34:37.394 --> 00:34:38.130
vision there.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:39.650
Or you have people having
the vision but not

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:42.070
the technical ability.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:42.510
KORI RAE: Yeah.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.719
I mean I think that is
one of the beautiful

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:45.639
things about Pixar.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:49.790
It was started by John Lasseter
and Bill Reeves,

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:51.210
sitting in a room together--

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.860
the artist and then the
technical director.

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.719
Kind of sitting there helping
each other solve problems,

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:58.810
creative problems and
technical problems.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:03.490
And I think that's kind of the
basis of what Pixar what we

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:04.860
were built on.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.100
With kind of that mentality.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:11.450
So we work really hard to make
sure that that those people do

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:12.120
collaborate.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:16.490
I mean we have the folks who
are building the characters

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:19.440
and rigging the characters
really in the same room with

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.870
the animators to figure
out how best to do it.

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:26.090
And the best shows and the best
departments and the best

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:29.220
movies are the ones who do that
collaboration the best.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.760
And you have to have it.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.580
It's so key because these
films are exactly that.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.490
It is a true marriage of
art and technology.

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:39.870
And you have to have
that collaboration.

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:43.340
And so a lot of my job as a
producer is actually to make

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:44.400
sure that that's happening.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.510
And that it's happening in all
departments and that all

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:50.460
departments are talking
to one another.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:55.260
So it's really important and it
requires a fair bit of work

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.950
and to make sure that
we keep doing that.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.860
DAN SCANLON: And Kori really
made that happen on this film.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:07.280
It was a big part of what you
brought to the film is that

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.020
working together.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:11.500
I feel like we really had
departments working together

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.130
in such a special way
on this film.

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:15.986
And I think it shows
in the final film.

00:36:15.986 --> 00:36:16.890
KORI RAE: Cool.

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:17.530
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:19.000
This is such a treat.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.190
Your movies have such attention
to detail, and after

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:25.590
five years and that amount of
focus are there still things

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:28.830
that you look at and you say
I wish wed done this?

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:31.990
Or do you get to do
get to do it all?

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:33.970
DAN SCANLON: Boy, I gotta say
with five years you kind of

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:34.850
get to do it all.

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:39.700
Like sometimes almost to
a nightmarish degree.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:43.180
You watch each shot so many
times with a room full of

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.375
people looking for the tiniest
little mistake.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.100
It's not that I'm saying the
movie's perfect or anything,

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:54.600
but as far as those details
really everybody

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.980
just combs over them.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.560
Although it is funny, Leon Kirch
told me, he said, wait

00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.900
til the movie comes
out though.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.260
People will find stuff.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.670
But we were in a room full
of people looking at

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:05.600
every little dot.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.390
And he's like, they'll find
something and it will be huge

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:12.580
because you were so busy looking
at the one frame that

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.690
turned off for a frame, that
you'll miss the fact that he

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:18.030
said in "Toy Story 3"--

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:20.110
I don't think he'll mind-- he
said in "Toy Story 3" somebody

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.470
pointed out that at one point
Andy is running around with

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:23.580
Woody or something.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.980
And the camera pans over-- the
entire bed is shoved halfway

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:27.810
into the wall.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:31.890
And he's like, we watched this a
million times and called out

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:34.180
the tiniest little stuff
and we missed that.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.840
So keep an eye out for
our giant mistakes.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.790
KORI RAE: Yeah, that's true.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.400
MALE SPEAKER: Well it's
interesting about the

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.870
communication thing a little
bit because I know the

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:48.770
original atrium at Pixar was
built so that everyone could

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:52.690
meet, eat together, bump into
each other and exchange ideas.

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:56.000
And now it's a far bigger
company in a way.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.900
Does that still happen or is it
a case of sort of making a

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:02.260
point of leaving your office,
walking around, and

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:02.880
interrupting?

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.590
KORI RAE: No, it really
does still happen.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:06.190
And the bathrooms--

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:06.730
that's the key.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:08.930
It's the food but it's
also the restrooms.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:10.260
That's where you meet people.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:15.040
And Steve insisted on putting
them all in the middle, and we

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.430
when we were about to move into
the Emeryville campus

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:19.650
from Point Richmond we
were just up in arms.

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:24.220
Like we can't walk that
far to the restroom.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.260
But it actually works.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.180
Well we have a few buildings--

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.750
each building is kind
of set up that way.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.440
It really does work.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.690
At the very beginning of
this film we were in an

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.380
out-building kind of down an
alley a little away, when we

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.790
were in early development.

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:43.460
And we remember the difference
in moving

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.370
back to the main building.

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:48.640
How great it was to see
everybody again.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.290
And not be isolated like that.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:52.860
So it is really important.

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:57.790
You run into people all the
time and it makes you

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:00.230
communicate and talk to people
that you otherwise

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:01.380
wouldn't have seen.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.560
So it's quite effective.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.854
Steve's a smart guy.

00:39:04.854 --> 00:39:06.750
DAN SCANLON: Yeah.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:12.750
MALE SPEAKER: I guess we talk a
little bit about Steve, that

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.390
things must have changed
a little from

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:16.380
that aspect as well.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:19.580
And also with John because now
he's overseeing feature

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:22.160
animation down in LA.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.020
And then he still manages to--

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.830
what's his working day like?

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:26.650
It must be incredible.

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:27.430
KORI RAE: Yeah it's crazy.

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:29.250
He's Superman for sure.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:32.300
None of us really quite
know how he does it.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.000
But he does.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.060
DAN SCANLON: He does
do it, yeah.

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:34.900
KORI RAE: And he's hands on.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.970
It's not like he's just coming
in and-- he's actively working

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:40.860
on all of the films and the
shorts and everything at the

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.160
studio every day.

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.160
I think he goes down
to Disney one day a

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.070
week or two days sometimes.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:52.420
But yeah, we checked in with
him at least once a week,

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:55.540
sometimes twice a week, for a
couple of hours and showed him

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.510
all stages of production.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:01.250
Because it's really important
to get his genius eye on

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:04.350
things and to get feedback
from him.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:06.830
DAN SCANLON: He gives
great notes.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.790
Because he has a distance from
it too that he can really

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:12.020
judge because we've
been so focused.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.420
KORI RAE: Right.

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.370
MALE SPEAKER: I did also notice
that there was a recent

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:17.260
announcement that there's
going to be a lot more

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.290
features up til 2016.

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:23.265
And films such as "Untitled Film
Number 8," "Untitled Film

00:40:23.265 --> 00:40:28.120
Number 9." So do you think one
of those may be yours, or you

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:31.110
hope so, or you'll pitch a new
idea, what will you do?

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.000
KORI RAE: Wait, what year?

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:32.920
DAN SCANLON: I don't know.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.800
We'll do the math.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.410
Well let's see.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:35.660
A year-long vacation.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:39.770
We don't know yet.

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.870
We'll have to see, hopefully.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:45.470
KORI RAE: Yeah there's a
lot of stuff going on.

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:47.210
And it's really--

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:49.860
we have a lot of projects in the
works and then you have to

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.020
see how they pan out.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.910
Because even when you try
scheduling them and say, yeah,

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:56.390
we want this one to
come out here.

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:58.450
Until you get really into it
you're not sure that it's

00:40:58.450 --> 00:40:59.360
going to work at all.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:04.230
So there's a lot of shuffling
that happens before that.

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:06.720
MALE SPEAKER: And sounds as if
that the pitching of an idea--

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.330
I kind of got the impression, is
it true that there's three

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:10.840
ideas that you would
take to John?

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.620
Particularly if you were going
to work on a short idea for a

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:17.220
movie, that you would approach
the brain trust with three

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:20.660
strong ideas and then possibly
one of those may make it?

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.440
Is that true?

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.080
KORI RAE: Yeah.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.890
That is, especially
the shorts.

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:26.880
I think that is definitely
how.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.190
And I think it was a suggestion
from John because

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:31.650
it just opens the world
a little more.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:35.580
And I think they get to see
more of the creative of an

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:36.400
individual.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.240
If they're not--

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.690
if these aren't folks who've
directed before or something

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:42.230
and are coming out of
animation or story.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:47.040
It gives them a wider view of
the total creativity of the

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.110
person, to kind of pitch
three ideas.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:51.110
But it has been successful.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.160
DAN SCANLON: And you're not
putting all your eggs in one

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:52.655
basket too.

00:41:52.655 --> 00:41:54.080
KORI RAE: Exactly, exactly.

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.480
MALE SPEAKER: We've got time
for two more questions.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.100
Is that OK?

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.680
KORI RAE: Cool.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.110
AUDIENCE: With several films
in production concurrently,

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.360
how do they interact?

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.100
DAN SCANLON: How do
they interact?

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.190
KORI RAE: Mostly on the creative
front, getting

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.250
feedback on the creative
front.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.210
DAN SCANLON: It's nice because
you can take a little break

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:16.710
from your own movie and your own
problems and go watch the

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.930
rough reels of one of the movies
that's coming out two

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:20.510
years after you.

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:24.240
And give notes, and
again share their

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.680
problems for a moment.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.240
And selfishly the thing that I
like about it, and I think a

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.830
lot of the directors do, is
even as you are doing that

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:33.330
there's a small part of your
brain going, does that make

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:34.220
sense for my movie?

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.680
Like when someone says, is
you're hero really being

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.310
challenge to the utmost
degree or uses

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:41.230
some crazy story paradigm.

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:43.603
You think, is my hero
going through his

00:42:43.603 --> 00:42:45.100
worst possible journey?

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.820
And it's just something
to get your mind--

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.260
KORI RAE: Yeah, it shakes
things up a lot.

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:50.790
Yeah.

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:53.630
AUDIENCE: So working at an
animated film studio, what is

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:57.340
it like watching an animated
film by different studio?

00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:58.850
What goes through your mind?

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:03.262
DAN SCANLON: I don't know.

00:43:03.262 --> 00:43:04.540
I don't know.

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.920
I don't see that many
of them lately.

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.740
We've been so busy making our
movie we never go to movies

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:10.800
anymore for--

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.530
KORI RAE: That's kind of true.

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:11.970
DAN SCANLON: --years.

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:13.060
It's really sad.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:14.120
Because when I get home
I don't want to

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.440
think about a movie.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.895
So instead I watch three hours
of "Pawn Stars" because it's

00:43:19.895 --> 00:43:22.710
stupid and it will make
me fall asleep.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:26.810
And it's terrible.

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:28.390
I gotta start watching movies.

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:29.180
KORI RAE: Yeah.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.540
In a few weeks we'll start
watching movies again.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:32.270
But it's been a while.

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:39.010
But like anything, I think it's
good and difficult all at

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:39.820
the same time, right?

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.390
When you're looking at
your work up against

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:43.540
other people's work.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.540
It's hard not to go there.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.330
DAN SCANLON: The studio, they're
all fans of all sorts

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:47.730
of animation.

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:47.980
KORI RAE: Exactly.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.640
DAN SCANLON: I think people
watch stuff--

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.020
KORI RAE: It's a small world.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:51.680
DAN SCANLON: --and appreciate
the work that's going into it.

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.680
KORI RAE: For sure.

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.640
DAN SCANLON: We probably
have friends that

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.730
work at those studios.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:55.360
It's all--

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.160
KORI RAE: Yeah, it's still
a pretty small world.

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.300
MALE SPEAKER: It's been
interesting trying to talk

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.290
about the film without
too many spoilers.

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:06.790
But it definitely is an amazing
film and you should

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:09.340
really congratulate yourselves
on that.

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:12.600
And in future, I'll just open
up the floor with about 59

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.990
minutes to go and just ask
questions instead, right?

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:17.250
Because they were
great questions.

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:18.000
KORI RAE: Good questions,
yeah.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:18.500
DAN SCANLON: All right.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:19.699
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
very much indeed.

00:44:19.699 --> 00:44:20.188
DAN SCANLON: Thank you.

00:44:20.188 --> 00:44:21.166
KORI RAE: Thanks you guys.

00:44:21.166 --> 00:44:24.100
Thank you.
