00:00:03.942 --> 00:00:05.150
WESLEY CHUN: Hey, developers.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.524
Have you wondered how you can
help your sales, marketing,

00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:09.590
and business dev coworkers
auto-generate slide

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.600
presentations out
of a set of images?

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.870
Greetings and welcome to another
episode of the G Suite show.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.430
I'm your host, Wesley Chun.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.770
Today we're going to show
you how to do just that.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.630
Slideshows have come a long way,
from hand shadows in the cave

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.910
since fire was invented.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.950
Then shadow puppetry
of civilized men

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.670
to the magic lanterns of the
17th through 19th centuries.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.580
And Uncle Bob's endless family
vacation on 35-millimeter

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.100
slides.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.720
And finally to
today's generation

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.640
of tools like
PowerPoint, Keynote,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.530
and, of course, Google Slides.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.050
While presentation software
are end user applications,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.430
some are programmable.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.640
PowerPoint provides a COM
server, where VB, C, or even

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.796
Python can be used to create PPT
files or drive presentations.

00:00:47.796 --> 00:00:49.170
Now we can take
this to the cloud

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.427
by coding Google Slides with
Apps Script, a customized

00:00:51.427 --> 00:00:53.510
version of JavaScript that
runs in Google's cloud,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.930
giving you access to G
Suite services, like slides.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.805
As previously advertised,
today's code sample

00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:00.930
is a short script that
creates a slide presentation

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.270
from a collection of images.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.620
We're going to walk
through a simple version

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.810
first, then add a few
more lines to make it just

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.410
a little bit more useful.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.650
Let's go to the computer
now and take a look.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.420
Jumping right in,
we've got lines one

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.090
through two, which name your
slide deck, both the file

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.760
name and the title
of the presentation.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.790
Line two specifically
creates the slide deck.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.774
Note the commented
out part here.

00:01:22.774 --> 00:01:24.690
We'll skip it for now,
but we'll tell you what

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.110
it means before we wrap up.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.200
Lines 4 through 7 is the
add image slide function.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.410
It takes a URL and index.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.380
And we'll be using this
with for each later.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.380
For every image, we're
going to add a new slide

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.720
and then insert the image.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.810
The first part of main,
from lines 9 to 16,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.350
link to each image
to create slides for.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.850
17 to 19 grab the title
and subtitle text boxes,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.300
then sets the string
values for both.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.680
20 loops through
the images, creating

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.340
slides for each by
calling add image slide.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.070
So if you save it
and run it, you'll

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.960
see that it basically works.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.050
After authorizing the script
to gain access to your Google

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.260
Slides, you'll see
in your drive folder

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.180
that it creates
our presentation--

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.830
My favorite images.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.330
And, if you open
it up, you'll see

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.170
that we have all of our
images, but in the upper left.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.990
Not so great, right?

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.930
Let's get rid of this,
and add seven more lines

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.270
to center the images,
making it much more useful.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.700
So what did we do?

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.330
The new lines, 7 through 10,
grab the height and width

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.940
of each image, as well
as the slide page.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.670
Then 11 through 13
make the calculations

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.240
to center the image on
both the x- and y-axes.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.410
And that's it.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.410
If we run this again, and take a
look at the slide presentation,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.960
you'll see we get
another slide deck.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.910
Nearly identical.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.350
But the images are
where we want them,

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.410
making this script and the slide
decks it generates presentable

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.560
right away.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.320
Isn't that cool?

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.620
And that's it.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.060
As you saw, when it was just
two major lines of code,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.840
it did its job.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.556
But adding a few more
lines made it a lot better.

00:03:12.556 --> 00:03:14.430
Well, if you want to
dig deeper into the code

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.100
sample and the app itself, check
out the corresponding tutorial.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.980
Now this script is known
as a standalone app,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.440
because it's not tied to
any specific document.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.137
While standalone apps are useful
for demos or personal use,

00:03:25.137 --> 00:03:26.970
they're harder to share
to a wider audience,

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.430
because the only way to
do it is cut and paste.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.299
Well, if you want to distribute
your apps, this isn't scalable.

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.840
With a few changes,
you can turn them

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.570
into add-ons, scripts that
can be published publicly

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.460
for anyone to
install, or privately

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.470
to your own G Suite domain.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.640
Remember that line of code
that was commented out?

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.420
Well, if you use that call,
plus some additional required

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.300
boilerplate, you'll have an
ad on that you can publish.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.490
Check out the docs
for more info.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.602
Your next steps?

00:03:51.602 --> 00:03:53.310
Well, you can jump
straight into the docs

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.062
and brainstorm your
own magic lantern app.

00:03:55.062 --> 00:03:57.020
Or if you want to learn
more about Apps Script?

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.950
Well, check out our other
videos that show you

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.397
what else you can do with it.

00:04:00.397 --> 00:04:01.980
Want to build an app
for Google Slides

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.563
outside of the Apps
Script environment

00:04:03.563 --> 00:04:05.330
and with your own
development tools?

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.480
Well, then, you want to
use a slide's REST API.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.438
And, of course, we've
got another set of videos

00:04:09.438 --> 00:04:11.190
to show you how to use that.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.339
Got our sample app working?

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.130
Well, before you start
on your own project,

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.600
I want to challenge you.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.490
Instead of hard-coding
online images,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.610
well, tweak our app to use
images on your Google Drive.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.760
Or, even more powerful, use
a drive file picker dialog,

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.640
and let your users choose.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.642
Well, let us know how
you do in the comments.

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.100
The sky's the limit
on what you can

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.195
do with slides in Apps Script.

00:04:31.195 --> 00:04:32.070
Thanks for tuning in.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.930
And send us your
suggestions on what

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.182
you'd like to see in
future episodes down below.

00:04:36.182 --> 00:04:38.640
This is Wesley Chun from Google,
and we'll see you upstairs

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.500
in the G Suite.
