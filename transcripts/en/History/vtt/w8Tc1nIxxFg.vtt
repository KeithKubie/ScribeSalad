00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:03.002
[music playing]

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:04.713
If we assume that the vision
of a floating city in the sky

00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:07.632
that was seen in Foshan by
thousands of people was just

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:10.885
some kind of optical illusion,
I find it highly coincidental

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:14.222
that the same vision is seeing
hundreds of miles away a few

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:17.934
days later in another city
called Xiong'an, also witnessed

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:21.354
by thousands of people.

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:24.023
NARRATOR: Could thousands
of people across China

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:26.943
have really witnessed
some type of alien base

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:29.195
or mothership
floating in the sky?

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:36.411
And if so, might it be
evidence of extraterrestrials

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:39.748
making their presence known?

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:42.292
Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.962
there have been many more cases
of alien entities appearing

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:49.007
in the skies above China--

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.801
cases that the government
could not ignore.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:02.854
Zhejiang province,
China, July 7, 2010.

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:08.818
Just after 8:40 PM, the Hangzhou
Xiaoshan International Airport,

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:12.489
which serves over
70,000 passengers a day,

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:15.492
is suddenly shut down.

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.869
All outbound flights
are grounded,

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.499
and inbound flights are
diverted to nearby airports.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.336
The cause of the shutdown was
an unidentified flying object

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.797
seen streaking
across the night sky

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:33.134
by a flight crew
preparing for descent.

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:38.473
Xiaoshan Airport is one
of the largest in China,

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:39.557
and that's very important.

00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:42.435
It's a very busy airport.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:46.022
What happened on July
7 is that a pilot

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:48.316
from an incoming
passenger airplane

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:51.736
noticed something very
unusual coming towards him.

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:57.575
He notified the ground crew,
and the airport was shut down,

00:01:57.575 --> 00:02:01.204
because a comet-like
object was basically

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:04.833
speeding towards the airport.

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:06.835
There was a trail behind it.

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:10.880
It was a glowing,
oval-shaped object.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.008
NARRATOR: The object was also
witnessed and photographed

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:17.679
by numerous Hangzhou residents.

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:21.057
When the UFO was seen,
all hell broke loose.

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:23.017
Flights were diverted.

00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:25.311
The military was
contacted to see

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.188
if they were test flying
anything in the area,

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:29.315
which they weren't.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.986
This is the third such
incident in five years in China

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:37.323
where the presence of a UFO
has either shut down an airport

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:42.495
or caused havoc and amazement
amongst the populace.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.998
And it's clearly something that
the Chinese government want

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.250
to shut down and play down.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.169
It could also be due to
the fact that the Chinese

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.922
have realized they're not in
control of their airspace.

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:54.632
Somebody else is.

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.259
[speaking mandarin]

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.636
INTERPRETER: The Xiaoshan
event is only one

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:00.597
of the events of this kind.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:04.225
The same thing happened
in Guizhou province.

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:08.646
At that time, the pilots were
instructed to avoid the UFO,

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:11.816
ground their aircrafts,
and returned to the air

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:14.110
after the event,
which can provide

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.196
evidence of the existence
of the UFO phenomenon.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.620
NARRATOR: While many
in the United States

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.832
view the UFO phenomena
as distinctly American,

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:30.668
recent surveys have
shown that roughly half

00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:33.588
of the 1.4 billion
Chinese people

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:38.468
believe in UFOs and
extraterrestrial life.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:41.262
And ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.932
that, despite the Chinese
government's dismissal

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:48.603
of recent UFO events,
it now appears

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.605
they, too, are
taking an interest

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:54.192
in otherworldly phenomena.

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:55.944
It's incredibly
popular in China

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.946
to be a member of
a UFO community

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:01.908
that's trying to make contact
with extraterrestrial beings.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.494
The Chinese government is
closely monitoring this,

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:09.248
and in fact, they're financing
some of these research groups.

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:11.751
So one wonders-- is
the Chinese government

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:14.921
starting to view our contact
with extraterrestrial beings

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:18.591
as something simply
too strong to deny?

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:21.761
NARRATOR: Could recent events be
forcing the Chinese government

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.888
to take a greater
interest in examining

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:27.392
possible extraterrestrial
encounters?

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:32.814
Encounters that they have
secretly known about for years?

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:35.900
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.570
and suggest that China's effort
to manufacture the world's

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.075
largest radio telescope
is an explicit mission

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:47.453
towards the search
for alien life.
