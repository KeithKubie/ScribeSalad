00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.600
Let's see if we can apply
what we've learned to a

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.890
particularly hairy problem
that I have constructed.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.600
So let me see how I can
construct this.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.780
So let's say in parallel, I have
this resistor up here.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.590
And I try to make it
so the numbers work

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.760
out reasonably neat.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:28.000
That is 4 ohms. Then I have
another resistor right here.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.340
That is 8 ohms. Then I have
another resistor right here.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.760
That is 16 ohms. And then, I
have another resistor here,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.640
that's ohms. Actually, I'm now
making it up on the fly.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.990
I think the numbers
might work out OK.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.710
16 ohms.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.750
And let's say that now here in
series, I have a resistor that

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:07.720
is 1 ohm, and then in parallel
to this whole thing-- now you

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.080
can see how hairy it's getting--
I have a resistor

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:22.420
that is 3 ohms. And let's say
I have a resistor here.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.650
Let's just make it
simple: 1 ohm.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.010
And just to make the numbers
reasonably easy-- I am doing

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.850
this on the fly now-- that's
the positive terminal,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.140
negative terminal.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.370
Let's say that the voltage
difference is 20 volts.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.050
So what I want us to do is,
figure out what is the current

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.540
flowing through the wire
at that point?

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.010
Obviously, that's going to be
different than the current at

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.090
that point, that point, that
point, that point, all of

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.710
these different points, but it's
going to be the same as

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.880
the current flowing
at this point.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.370
So what is I?

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.920
So the easiest way to do this
is try to figure out the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.040
equivalent resistance.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.199
Because once we know the
equivalent resistance of this

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.940
big hairball, then we can just
use Ohm's law and be done.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.460
So first of all, let's just
start at, I could argue, the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.090
simplest part.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.310
Let's see if we could figure out
the equivalent resistance

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.550
of these four resistors
in parallel.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.160
Well, we know that that
resistance is going to be

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:34.800
equal to 1/4 plus 1/8
plus 1/16 plus 1/16.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.450
So that resistance-- and
now it's just adding

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.100
fractions-- over 16.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:48.740
1/4 is 4/16 plus 2/16 plus 1
plus 1, so 1/R is equal to 4

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.170
plus 2 is equal to 8/16-- the
numbers are working out-- is

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.260
equal to 1/2, so that equivalent
resistance is 2.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.490
So that, quickly, we just
said, well, all of these

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.110
resistors combined is equal to
2 ohms. So let me erase that

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.620
and simplify our drawing.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.510
Simplify it.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:29.310
So that whole thing could now
be simplified as 2 ohms. I

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.240
lost some wire here.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.000
I want to make sure that
circuit can still flow.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.910
So that easily, I turned that
big, hairy mess into something

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.540
that is a lot less hairy.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.950
Well, what is the equivalent
resistance of this resistor

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.330
and this resistor?

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.290
Well, they're in series, and
series resistors, they just

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.710
add up together, right?

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.770
So the combined resistance of
this 2-ohm resistor and this

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.510
1-ohm resistor is just
a 3-ohm resistor.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.580
So let's erase and simplify.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.280
So then we get that combined
resistor, right?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.360
We had the 2-ohm that we
had simplified and

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.610
then we had a 1-ohm.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.250
So we had a 2-ohm and a 1-ohm
in series, so those simplify

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.880
to 3 ohms.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.300
Well, now this is getting
really simple.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.670
So what do these two resistors
simplify to?

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.710
Well, 1 over their combined
resistance is

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.040
equal to 1/3 plus 1/3.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.870
It equals what?

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.770
2/3.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:41.560
1/R is equal to 2/3, so R is
equal to 3/2, or we could say

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.960
1.5, right?

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.100
So let's erase that and
simplify our drawing.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.905
So this whole mess, the 3-ohm
resistor in parallel with the

00:04:57.905 --> 00:05:00.980
other 3-ohm resistor is equal
to one resistor with a 1.5

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.020
resistance.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.600
And actually, this is actually
a good point to give you a

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.320
little intuition, right?

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.550
Because even though these are
3-ohm resistors, we have two

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.880
of them, so you're kind of
increasing the pipe that the

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.790
electrons can go in by a
factor of two, right?

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.150
So it's actually decreasing
the resistance.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.590
It's giving more avenues for the
electrons to go through.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.500
Actually, they're going to be
going in that direction.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.880
And that's why the combined
resistance of both of these in

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.160
parallel is actually half
of either one of these

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.565
resistances.

00:05:27.565 --> 00:05:30.090
I encourage you to think about
that some more to give you

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.610
some intuition of what's
actually going on with the

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.100
electrons, although I'll do a
whole video on resistivity.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.180
OK so we said those two
resistors combined-- I want to

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.010
delete all of that.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.210
Those two resistors combined
equal to a 1.5-ohm resistor.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.540
That's 1.5 ohms. And now all
we're left with is two

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.270
resistors in parallel, so the
whole circuit becomes this,

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.860
which is the very basic one.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.270
This is a resistor: 1.5
ohms, 1 ohm in series.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.300
Did I say parallel just now?

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.510
No, they're in series.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:13.210
1.5 plus 1, that's 2.5 ohms.
The voltage is 20

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.710
volts across them.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.920
So what is the current?

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.860
Ohm's law.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.920
V is equal to IR.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.500
Voltage is 20 is equal to
current times our equivalent

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:31.290
resistance times 2.5 ohms. Or
another way to write 2.5 five

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.410
is 5/2, right?

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.060
So 20 is equal to I times 5/2.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:45.570
Or I is equal to 2/5 times
20, and what is that?

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.950
2/5 is equal to I
is equal to 8.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.470
8 amperes.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.590
That was not so bad,
I don't think.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.850
Although when you saw it
initially, it probably looked

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.540
extremely intimidating.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.190
Anyway, if you understood that,
you can actually solve

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.920
fairly complicated circuit
problems. I will see you in

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.510
future videos.
