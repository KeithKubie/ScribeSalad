00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The first thing I did to solve this problem was to draw a force diagram.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We know the force of gravity is pulling down on the car like we'd expect

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and there is some normal force pointing upwards and since the car isn't accelerating vertically,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we know these 2 bit forces must balance each other out perfectly.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And of course, we have the frictional force which we've said is equal to bv²

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we've got the force that the car is producing to make it go forward

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and this force is actually produced by the road pushing up on the wheels

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
by Newton's Third Law the wheels pushed on the ground and the ground pushes back on the wheels

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
causing the car to move forward,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and we know that if the car is going at its maximum speed and can't go any faster

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
then these two forces should be perfectly balance too.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We can say that this force here equals this force over here.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Starting with the equation for work, I divide both sides by Δt

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and you'll note that this term Δd that change in position over the change in time

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Well, that's just the same as velocity

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and also over here, work divided by change in time that is just the same thing as power.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We get this nice equation that power is equal to the force pushing the car forward times its velocity.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Now, what's this F equal to?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Well, we said earlier that this F has to perfectly balance out the frictional force.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We know that the frictional force is equal to bv² so we can just plug that in

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and multiplying that by the v, we get that the power is equal to bv³.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and summing for velocity, we get that the velocity required to go at a constant speed

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
at a certain power is equal to the cube root of the power divided by that constant b

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and plugging in the numbers we were given.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It turns out that 150 horsepower is equal to 111,000 watts.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We get that the maximum speed you can go is 103.8 m/s,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and if you're curious that is about equal to 232 mi/hr.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Of course, in the real world, we're not just dealing with air friction,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
we're dealing with all sorts of friction.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
This value might be a little higher that you'd expect,

00:01:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but if you've got this value, congratulations on solving the problem.
