00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.580
Okay, so the next question is, what
kind of backend stack do we want to use?

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.200
Now, I really want to get something
that's going to be quick to set up,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.030
because we should get Shopping
List Plus Plus in users' hands as

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.630
fast as possible.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.240
I'm pretty solid with Android, but

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.210
it's been a really long time
since I set up a server.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.180
&gt;&gt; Well,
maybe you don't need to set up a server.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.191
Have you ever heard of [SOUND] Firebase?

00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:24.186
&gt;&gt; Hm, well, I'm intrigued,
I have heard of Firebase,

00:00:24.186 --> 00:00:26.477
it's like a fancy database, right?

00:00:26.477 --> 00:00:27.760
&gt;&gt; It's fancy, all right.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.020
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.314
&gt;&gt; Seriously,
Firebase is a collection of services,

00:00:32.314 --> 00:00:35.825
including a database that can serve
as a simple backend for your app.

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:38.605
&gt;&gt; Okay, that sounds great, but
is it easy to use with Android?

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:39.145
&gt;&gt; Very easy.

00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:42.785
It has an SDK for
Android as well as iOS and JavaScript.

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:46.240
With Firebase you write a little client
side code, and then Firebase takes care

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.720
of all the rest,
some authentication and access to data.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.533
&gt;&gt; Well, I definitely like the idea of
not setting up a bunch of server code,

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.177
so I guess I could read up
on Firebase a little bit and

00:00:57.177 --> 00:01:00.580
kind of prep the GitHub repository for
the developer.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.820
&gt;&gt; In the meantime, I'll poke around and
set up an account, so you and

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.840
your developer can poke
around with the SDK.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.250
&gt;&gt; All right, that sound great!

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.990
&gt;&gt; Follow me, and
let's get started with Firebase.
