00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.266
- So, right here, we have the number 46,

00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.633
we have a four in the tens place,

00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:08.000
so it literally represents four tens,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.733
and we see them here, one,
two, three, four tens.

00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:15.533
That's a ten, that's a ten,
that's a ten, and that's a ten.

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.433
Each of these are ten squares,

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:22.433
so all together we have four
tens or 40 squares in purple

00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:25.667
and then we have a six in the ones place.

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:30.667
We have a six in the ones
place, we have six ones,

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:33.866
and we see that right over
here, one, two, three, four,

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:38.866
five, six, so we can write
that 46, use the same colors,

00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:45.733
46 is equal to four tens, four tens

00:00:47.256 --> 00:00:52.256
and six ones, or I could
write plus six ones.

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:58.066
Now, let's do something interesting.

00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:03.066
Let's subtract, let's subtract
four ones from the 46,

00:01:04.634 --> 00:01:07.567
so, let's think about
what it means to take,

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:11.800
let's take 46, so I'm
going to start with 46,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.033
just the number that
we have in front of us,

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:17.000
and we are going to subtract four.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We are going to subtract four.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.466
What is this going to be
equal to, how many tens?

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.633
So it's going to be a
certain number of tens,

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:28.166
and it's going to be plus
a certain number of ones,

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.200
plus a certain number of ones,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.266
so I've left blanks right over here,

00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:35.133
so how many tens are we going to have?

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.300
So, 46, that's what we started with,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.700
we're subtracting four ones,
so we're going to subtract

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.166
one, two, three, four, we're
going to take away four ones.

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.166
So how many tens do we have?

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:51.933
Well, we still have four tens,
so let's write that down,

00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:55.833
we still have four tens, but
now how many ones do we have?

00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:59.900
Well, now we only have two
ones, we only have two ones,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.633
and so you see when you
have four tens and six ones

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:05.666
and you subtracted four ones,
well, six ones minus four ones

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:10.666
is two ones, and so we
get 46, let me do that

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:16.333
in the same color, we get
40, I'm having issues here,

00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:20.700
(laughs) So, it's going
to be, this is going to be

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.700
46 minus four is equal to four tens,

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:30.800
well that's just a four in the tens place,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.694
so write a four in the tens place,

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:36.933
and then two ones, put a
two in the ones place, 42.

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:39.266
46 minus four is 42, and
you can see that right there

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:43.266
in the ones place, we just
took four from this six.
