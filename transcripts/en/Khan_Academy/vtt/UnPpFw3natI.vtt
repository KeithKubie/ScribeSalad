00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
- [Tutor] So we are
told let's count by tens

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.887
and we go 10, 20, blank, 40, 50,

00:00:07.593 --> 00:00:08.510
60, 70, 80,

00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:11.146
90, 100,

00:00:11.146 --> 00:00:12.871
what number did we miss?

00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:16.457
Pause the video, what number
did we miss right over here?

00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:18.107
Well, if we're counting by tens,

00:00:18.107 --> 00:00:19.690
we would go 10, 20,

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:23.271
30, 40, 50, 60, 70,

00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:26.072
80, 90, 100, so we're missing 30,

00:00:26.072 --> 00:00:28.673
so which choice right over here has 30?

00:00:28.673 --> 00:00:31.837
Well, if we scroll down a
little bit, we see right there,

00:00:31.837 --> 00:00:33.070
that is our choice.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.564
Let's do another example.

00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:37.231
So here we are asked

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:40.388
which ten frames show 20?

00:00:41.724 --> 00:00:44.292
A ten frame is just a fancy word

00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:47.042
for one of these blocks or these frames,

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:48.109
that have 10 objects in them,

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.108
you can see it right over here,
one, two, three, four, five,

00:00:51.108 --> 00:00:52.977
six, seven, eight, nine, 10,

00:00:52.977 --> 00:00:56.837
so which of these ten frames show 20?

00:00:56.837 --> 00:00:59.803
Well, 20 is two groups of 10,

00:00:59.803 --> 00:01:03.771
so this is 10 and then 20, so
that's 20 right over there,

00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:05.354
choice B is 10, 20,

00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:07.791
30, 40,

00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:10.490
choice C is 10, 20, 30,

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.797
so we can feel good about choice A.

00:01:13.797 --> 00:01:18.592
Here we're told drag the ten
frames into the box to make 40.

00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:21.962
So let's see, here this
is 10, right over there,

00:01:21.962 --> 00:01:24.817
then we get another 10, gets us to 20,

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:27.203
then another 10 gets us to 30

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:30.560
and then finally another 10 gets us to 40,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.810
10, 20, 30, 40, we're done.
