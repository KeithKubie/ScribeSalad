00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.480
Let's see if we can come up
with some general rules of thumb

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.790
or some general trends
for oxidation states

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.970
by looking at the
periodic table.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.960
So first, let's just focus
on the alkali metals.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.400
And I'll box them off.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.049
We'll think about
hydrogen in a second.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.340
Well, I'm going to box-- I'm
going to separate hydrogen

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.160
because it's kind
of a special case.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.540
But if we look at the
alkali metals, the Group

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.520
1 elements right
over here, we've

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.230
already talked about
the fact they're not

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.630
too electronegative.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.200
They have that one
valence electron.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.170
They wouldn't mind giving
away that electron.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.930
And so for them,
that oxidation state

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.880
might not even be a
hypothetical charge.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.090
These are very good candidates
for actually forming

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.680
ionic bonds.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.470
And so it's very
typical that when

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.410
these are in a molecule,
when these form bonds,

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.570
that these are the things
that are being oxidized.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.500
They give away an electron.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.890
So they get to-- a
typical oxidation state

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.810
for them would be positive 1.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:03.480
If we go one group over right
over here to the alkaline earth

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.880
metals, two valence electrons,
still not too electronegative.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.930
So they're likely to fully
give or partially give away

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.040
two electrons.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.899
So if you're forced to
assign an ionic-- if you

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.940
were to say, well, none
of this partial business,

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.010
just give it all away or
take it, you would say,

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.750
well, these would
typically have an oxidation

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.510
state of positive 2.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.810
In a hypothetical ionic
bonding situation,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.030
they would be more likely
to give the two electrons

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.060
because they are not
too electronegative,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.480
and it would take them a lot
to complete their valence shell

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.332
to get all the way to 8.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:41.540
Now, let's go to the other
side of the periodic table

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.410
to Group 7, the halogens.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.590
The halogens right over here,
they're quite electronegative,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.840
sitting on the right-hand
side of the periodic table.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.620
They're one electron
away from being satisfied

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.600
from a valence
electron point of view.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.050
So these are typically reduced.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.237
They typically have an
oxidation state of negative 1.

00:02:04.237 --> 00:02:06.320
And I keep saying typically,
because these are not

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.572
going to always be the case.

00:02:08.572 --> 00:02:10.280
There are other things
that could happen.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.780
But this is a
typical rule of thumb

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.750
that they're likely to
want to gain an electron.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.820
If we move over one
group to the left,

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.890
Group 6-- and that's where the
famous oxygen sits-- we already

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.010
said that oxidizing something is
doing to something what oxygen

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.890
would have done, that oxidation
is taking electrons away

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.390
from it.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.780
So these groups are
typically oxidized.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.320
And oxygen is a very
good oxidizing agent.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.090
Or another way of thinking
about it is oxygen

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.800
normally takes away electrons.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.660
These like to take
away electrons,

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.830
typically two electrons.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.180
And so their oxidation state
is typically negative 2-- once

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.805
again, just a rule of
thumb-- or that their charge

00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:01.940
is reduced by two electrons.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.290
So these are typically reduced.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.920
These are typically oxidized.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.370
Now, we could keep going.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.510
If we were to go right over
here to the Group 5 elements,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.280
typical oxidation
state is negative 3.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.306
And so you see a
general trend here.

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:24.180
And that general trend--
and once again, it's

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.200
not even a hard and fast rule
of thumb, even for the extremes,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.150
but as you get closer
and closer to the middle

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.375
of the periodic table,
you have more variation

00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:34.920
in what these typical
oxidation states could be.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.849
Now, I mentioned that
I put hydrogen aside.

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.390
Because if you really
think about it,

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.650
hydrogen, yes, hydrogen
only has one electron.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.250
And so you could
say, well, maybe it

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.080
wants to give away that electron
to get to zero electrons.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.790
That could be a reasonable
configuration for hydrogen.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.844
But you can also view hydrogen
kind of like a halogen.

00:03:53.844 --> 00:03:56.260
So you could kind of view it
kind of like an alkali metal.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.690
But in theory, it could
have been put here

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.070
on the periodic table as well.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.030
You could have put hydrogen
here, because hydrogen,

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.310
in order to complete
its first shell,

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.650
it just needs one electron.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.660
So in theory, hydrogen
could have been put there.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.150
So hydrogen actually
could typically

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.190
could have a positive or a
negative 1 oxidation state.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.810
And just to see an
example of that,

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.268
let's think about
a situation where

00:04:21.268 --> 00:04:24.580
hydrogen is the oxidizing agent.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:32.420
And an example of that would
be lithium hydride right

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.920
over here.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.030
Now, in lithium hydride,
you have a situation

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.680
where hydrogen is
more electronegative.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.830
A lithium is not
too electronegative.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.490
It would happily give
away an electron.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.880
And so in this
situation, hydrogen

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.600
is the one that's
oxidizing the lithium.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.270
Lithium is reducing
the hydrogen.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.710
Hydrogen is the one that
is hogging the electron.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.610
So the oxidation state on the
lithium here is a positive 1.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.860
And the oxidation state on the
hydrogen here is a negative.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.290
So just, once
again, I really want

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.664
to make sure we
get the notation.

00:05:06.664 --> 00:05:09.770
Lithium has been
oxidized by the hydrogen.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.430
Hydrogen has been
reduced by the lithium.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.260
Now, let's give an example where
hydrogen plays the other role.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.560
Let's imagine hydroxide.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.741
So the hydroxide anion-- so you
have a hydrogen and an oxygen.

00:05:25.741 --> 00:05:28.240
And so essentially, you could
think of a water molecule that

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.850
loses a hydrogen proton but
keeps that hydrogen's electron.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.430
And this has a negative charge.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.220
This has a negative 1 charge.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.760
But what's going
on right over here?

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.010
And actually, let
me just draw that,

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.480
because it's fun
to think about it.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.260
So this is a situation
where oxygen typically

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.850
has-- 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6 electrons.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:59.370
And when it's water, you
have 2 hydrogens like that.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.190
And then you share.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.870
And then you have
covalent bond right

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.130
over there sharing that
pair, covalent bond sharing

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.290
that right over there.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.610
To get to hydroxide,
the oxygen essentially

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:15.210
nabs both of these
electrons to become--

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.650
so you get-- that
pair, that pair.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.320
Now you have-- let me
do this in a new color.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.440
Now, you have this pair as well.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.790
And then you have that
other covalent bond

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.270
to the other hydrogen.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.510
And now this hydrogen is
now just a hydrogen proton.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.340
This one now has
a negative charge.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.076
So this is hydroxide.

00:06:37.076 --> 00:06:38.950
And so the whole thing
has a negative charge.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.740
And oxygen, as we have
already talked about,

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.490
is more electronegative
than the hydrogen.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.505
So it's hogging the electrons.

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:47.130
So when you look at
it right over here,

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.140
you would say, well,
look, hydrogen,

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.510
if we had to, if we were
forced to-- remember,

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.450
oxidation states is just
an intellectual tool

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.449
which we'll find useful.

00:06:57.005 --> 00:06:58.380
If you had to
pretend this wasn't

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.340
a covalent bond, but an
ionic bond, you'd say,

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.370
OK, then maybe this hydrogen
would fully lose an electron,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.550
so it would get an
oxidation state of plus 1.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.810
It would be oxidized
by the oxygen.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.757
And that the oxygen actually
has fully gained one electron.

00:07:13.757 --> 00:07:15.590
And you could say, well,
if we're forced to,

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.110
we could say-- if we're
forced to think about this

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.050
is an ionic bond, we'll say
it fully gains two electrons.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.640
So we'll have an oxidation
state of negative 2.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.330
And once again,
the notation, when

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.560
you do the superscript
notation for oxidation states

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.200
and ionic charge, you write
the sign after the number.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.170
And this is just the convention.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.102
And now, with these two
examples, the whole point of it

00:07:39.102 --> 00:07:40.560
is to show that
hydrogen could have

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.720
a negative 1 or a positive
1 oxidation state.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.640
But there's also something
interesting going on here.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.160
Notice, the oxidation
states of the molecules

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.690
here, they add up to the whole--
or the oxidation state of each

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.790
of the atoms in a
molecule, they add up

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:03.680
to the entire charge
of the molecule.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.100
So if you add a positive 1
plus negative 1, you get 0.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.650
And that makes sense because
the entire molecule lithium

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.490
hydride is neutral.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.750
It has no charge.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.330
Similarly, hydrogen,
plus 1 oxidation state;

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:24.170
oxygen, negative 2 oxidation
number or oxidation state--

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:29.640
you add those two together, you
have a negative 1 total charge

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.220
for the hydroxide anion,
which is exactly the charge

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.979
that we have right over there.
