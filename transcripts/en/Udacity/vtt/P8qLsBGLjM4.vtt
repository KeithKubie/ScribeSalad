00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.510
What about all the different
variations of fonts?

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.450
A font family, or

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.990
even a family of families can
contain dozens of variations.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.050
First, Roboto actually has
four distinct font families,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.900
including a condensed, monospace and
even an older slab serif family.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.910
Within each font family you
have a variety of weights.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.730
Font weight is the relative
thickness of each letter.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.090
The most common weights are regular and
bold, but

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.900
really great fonts will come in light,
thin, regular, medium, bold or black.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.330
And now these can go by different names,
like semi-bold or ultra-thin.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.190
Weights often also get numbers
assigned to them, from 0 to 1000,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.460
where the thinnest weights have
something like 100 value, and

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.750
the darkest or the thickest
weights have a 900 or 1000 value.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.050
And finally, each of these
weights normally has a normal and

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.990
an italic style.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.150
Now when it comes to
styling text in Android,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.070
the terminology is a little different.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.060
If you're using Roboto, text views have
two attributes that let you customize

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.215
the font, fontFamily and textStyle.

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:12.415
FontFamily let's you choose
which family to use and

00:01:12.415 --> 00:01:15.475
the specific weight,
such as thin or light.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:21.975
And textStyle let's you choose italics,
but it also let's you make the text bold.

00:01:21.975 --> 00:01:25.465
You should generally avoid using
textStyle to make text bold and

00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:27.765
instead use the fontFamily attribute,

00:01:27.765 --> 00:01:30.469
since you'll have more control
over the exact weight to use.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.960
Also note that not every weight
is available in every family.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.640
For example as of this writing, Roboto
condensed doesn't include a thin and

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.330
a black weight.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.430
Here's some sample code for
applying a font family in text style.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.558
Here we're saying to use
the condensed family but italicized.

00:01:49.558 --> 00:01:52.530
And here are some other examples
of values you can use for

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.280
fontFamily to set the fontFamily or
the weight, like thin, medium, light.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.580
Now, one quick note with
the condensed fonts,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.190
the Roboto Condensed example here.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.100
You can squeeze a lot more text into the
same horizontal space with these fonts,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.040
but condensed fonts can
definitely be overused.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.070
They're not quite as legible and
don't always look great with

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.300
other wider fonts, like Roboto Regular,
or even wider fonts than that.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.420
So definitely be careful when using
condensed fonts as your font family.
