1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,200
The Joe Rogan experience.
Oh. Um, do you do,

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,860
what kind of diet do they have you on?
I very clean man.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,900
Um, I guess, uh, um, I had my, uh,

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,430
my kids crack up. I tell, I said I'm
a Presbyterian, but actually, uh,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,750
there's Pescatarian, I
fish a fish, you know,

6
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:27,150
and vegetables and um,
it's no bullshit. Yeah.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,280
No bullshit. No time for bullshit all the
time for bullshit. That's exactly right,

8
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:34,470
man. Cause time, coffee time is precious.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,260
Don't used to but the caffeine and,
but doctors don't like the mad,

10
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:42,870
the caffeine. Yeah, I would
imagine. Yeah. So, um,

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,520
rest must be very important for you to
yeah. God thing. I get plenty of it.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,980
We haven't, it is what other things
that make sure that you do? Um,

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,320
the Diet has to be on point and
have to take my medication. Uh,

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,770
they didn't want me, um, to, uh, you know,

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,610
do too much strenuous
activities. Um, they,

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,710
they had limited me.
I wouldn't,

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,420
I was not able to travel out
of the country until yesterday.

18
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,920
Um, so yeah. So at one year anniversary,
that's when they give you the green light.

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,020
Yep. Man, I can go all over.

20
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,630
What did they say when they saw you
run in the parking lot and fall down?

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,300
All my doctors and um,
you know,

22
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,760
they all said,
oh,

23
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,790
let's see t what we think except
one except one my cardiologist.

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,070
And he said, you know what,
I'm not going to wreck.

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,430
She's like everybody else
did you already know that?

26
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:45,540
They just shouldn't have done that.
But man, I am so proud of you.

27
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,130
He said, you have inspired me
to start working out again. Wow.

28
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,710
Yep. That was doctor Salaam.
Doctor, if be listening.

29
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,030
Thank you. He was the only
one that didn't condemn me.

30
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,560
How far out was that?
The surgery when you fell down?

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,310
Three months get so crazy.
Yeah.

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,840
I felt like I can do too.
Mine was like,

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,850
oh well that's that mentality
that you have, you know?

34
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,270
I would imagine it's very hard to adjust.
Yeah.

35
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,310
Is Big turn from being a vet?

36
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,300
It would be the same for you.
So your active guide,

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,190
kicking the shit out of bags and
stuff. Oh, Lightman foot over there.

38
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,530
And then even maybe you think it
would not be able to raise your leg.

39
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,730
Yeah. Yeah. Or throw a punch, man.

40
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,760
I'll be walking around in the grocery
store. I'm like, man. Or with my wife,

41
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:51,780
and I'm like, man, I hope nobody fucks
with me. Oh, right, right, right.

42
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,740
Oh yeah. How would you feel
if somebody, he thinking, man,

43
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:59,830
if somebody fucks with you can't even
punch him. Yeah. You do anything.

44
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,200
You can't do math.
You'd be helpless.

45
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,010
That's man that it's hard to
little old ladies have told you.

46
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,220
Yeah, super hard to, I'm like,
man, somebody fuck with me.

47
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:15,220
I'm just going to get beat up.
I got no defense.

48
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,890
That's a terrible thing. It's a
terrible thing, but awfully humbling

49
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,360
Tam. Then you realize,
you realize that you know,

50
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:30,070
just town your whole life. You
live for strength. You know,

51
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:35,071
I've been a strong man my whole life
and then all of a sudden all of that is

52
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,780
taken away and you're just,
you know,

53
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,870
a fucking envelope with me
and you're just weak is shit.

54
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,320
It's very hard mentally to deal with.

55
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,350
But you're past that now.
Yes.

56
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,910
Now you're just in, what, what,

57
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,720
how would you categorize like how you
feel right now? Um, I categorize my,

58
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,770
my,
uh,

59
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,840
emotional feelings as being
probably better than ever.

60
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,850
Really? Yes. Uh, asked,

61
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,470
see things in such a different light,
uh,

62
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,390
after coming that close to dying.

63
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,490
Things that I thought were
important or just don't even matter.

64
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,720
Like what? Give me an example. I used
to, I give you one example. You know,

65
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,880
people I used to tell,
okay,

66
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,690
you asked me about this last time I was
on the show and I tell people, they say,

67
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:32,830
well, it's about to steroids and steroids
and a, he didn't take it serious.

68
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,190
And I tell them the same thing that I've
been saying for fucking 25 years and

69
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,480
magazine articles and stuff.
I tried them. Yes, I tried it.

70
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:44,350
And when I was young
and then worked for me,

71
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,580
I stopped taking many, many, many
years with nobody. Nobody. Like,

72
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,580
people don't believe they don't
believe that. And they'll tell me, oh,

73
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:55,570
you're full of shit. CT, you're lying
and out of like that are there. And Joe,

74
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:58,140
that used to bother the fuck out of me.
People who applied.

75
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,810
I'd be arguing with people online and say,
fuck,

76
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,570
I'll take it Goddamn drug test anytime,
24 hours a day, you could test me.

77
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,100
I fucking, I'll tell you what I gave you
10,000 bucks. If I fail your drug test,

78
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,390
all you gotta do is get off fucking social
media. Nobody ever took their brain,

79
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,400
but, but uh, I don't give a fuck if people
say I take steroids now. I don't care.

80
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:23,260
Who Cares? Right. I don't care. Now
it's a fucking compliment. Do you a,

81
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:26,650
you don't still go back and forth and
argue with people online? Oh, no, no,

82
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:30,880
not anymore. You know, I sure
did. I, Oh shit. I would,

83
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,240
I would jump on him in a mini.
Today's to see doing it.

84
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:39,140
I shake my head though, man, Joe,
because that was my mentality.

85
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,300
I attack, I attack back. He hit
me. I'm gonna hit you back, man,

86
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,310
and try to hit your heart. And if you hit,
that's glass. All cops. Oh yeah. You know,

87
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:52,540
I do the all caps. Can you talk to me
about, you're yelling, you're yelling. Cc,

88
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:57,250
but I can't have seat. So I make it all
caps so I can read what I'm what saying,

89
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,320
right, right, right. Yeah. I
said, can you actually hear that?

90
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,900
Can you actually hear that those words

91
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,940
for about a year fucking loud.
You got spidey sense, man.
