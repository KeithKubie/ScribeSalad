00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.170
I'm Dr. Oguchi Nwosu. I'm an Associate Professor in the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.769
Because I'm family medicine I deliveries.
It’s a special part of what I do.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.740
I actually finished obstetrics and gynecology before family medicine.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.660
I went to medical school in Nigeria and then I did obstetrics and gynecology in the United Kingdom

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.320
and then I did family medicine New York prior to serving in Georgia.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.149
I was born in a city called Enugu in Nigeria, it's in the eastern part of Nigeria,

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.129
but I actually grew up mostly in the western part of Nigeria, which is a city called Lagos,

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.960
and I schooled in the northern part of Nigeria.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.399
I am married, I have three boys. My wife is also from Nigeria.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.379
I love to teach. I teach residents and students, for both the inpatient as well as the outpatient setting.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.950
We do bedside teaching. In terms of getting residents to have what could be broadly described as

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.930
“great bedside manners,” which includes compassion, listening culture, and all those kind of things,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.150
the best way to do that is you need to demonstrate it.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.939
The center of the tripartite mission of your teaching of research, teaching, and you know,

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:35.200
being a clinician, if you start with the patient you can get all of those things accomplished.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.249
I see myself as a clinician giving day to day patient care, but of course I'm at an academic institution

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:45.039
and I do have some areas of focus my research.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.880
I have a particular interest in cervical cancer prevention as well as treatment but particularly prevention.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.109
I'm currently working with some researchers at Emory and we're hoping to some particular primary focus on HPV vaccination and prevention.

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:07.209
The uptick of HPV vaccination, even as would it be readily available, is fairly poor,

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.099
okay, less than 50 percent in many states.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.940
I think we can do better that given that this is something that can actually prevent cancer in the future.

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:27.849
The way I see legacy whether in medicine or in life in general is actually more an individual thing.

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:36.810
I want them to feel like “Hmm, this guy cares.” It matters to me that they see me as being, you know, caring

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.799
and trying to leave a positive imprint in them.

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.500
We get so focused on the disease and the medicines and all that and we forget

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.540
that behind that disease and behind those medicines or whatever treatments is a real person.
