00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.860
OK, so today we've got a little

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.240
mathematical nugget for you.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.820
I'm going to talk about
10 factorial.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.320
So 10 factorial is what you
get when you multiply the

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.980
numbers 10 times 9
times 8 times 7--

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.050
and you go all the way down,
times 2, times 1.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.120
How big is 10 factorial?

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.550
On your calculator you will find
a little bottom with an

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.170
exclamation mark after it.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.610
There we go.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.200
That is how big 10
factorial is.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.870
Let's write this down.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.510
3,628,800.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.080
Now what I want to talk about
is 10 factorial seconds.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.780
Now, how long is 10
factorial seconds?

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.530
All right, so 3,628,800
seconds.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.610
How long is that?

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.470
Well, it turns out to be
exactly six weeks.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.030
Let me show you.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.110
We've got 10 factorial
seconds, so how

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.320
many minutes is that?

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.710
There are 60 seconds in
a minute, so I'm going

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.800
to divide by 60.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.380
60 is 10 times 3 times 2.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.190
That's the way I'm
going to do it.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.760
So I'm going to divide by 60.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.060
I can just cancel out
10 and 3 and 2.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.590
That's a way to divide by 60.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.190
I might as well cancel out the
1 as well, while I'm at it.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.360
How many hours is that?

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.190
I'm going to divide
by 60 again.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.220
Another way to write 60
is 5 times 4 times 3.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.640
That also equals 60.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.190
I'm going to cancel out
the 5 and the 4.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.030
And I want to cancel 3.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.290
I don't have it.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.870
I'm going to take the
9, divide by 3.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.210
So that now becomes
a 3 instead.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.180
This is how many minutes
we've got.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.370
How many hours is that?

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.000
I want to divide by 24.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.070
24 is 8 times 3.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.760
Divide by 8, and that
now disappears.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.350
Fantastic.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.600
24 is gone.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.360
So this is how many
hours it is.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.420
How many weeks is that?

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.810
There are seven days
in a week.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.530
I want to divide by 7.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.590
That's how many weeks it is.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.100
How many weeks is it?

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830
What's left?

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.250
Six.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.050
There are exactly six weeks
for 10 factorial seconds.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.200
Exactly.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.380
So if you're at school, and if
you're looking forward to your

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.080
six weeks holiday, and oh, it
doesn't seem like long enough,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.557
well, perhaps you might like
to think of it as your 10

00:02:13.557 --> 00:02:15.440
factorial second holiday.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.680
So let's try this from
the other direction.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.680
So how many seconds are
there in six weeks?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.370
So we've got six weeks.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.420
How many days is that?

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.990
How many days are there
in six weeks?

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.520
We're going to times by 7.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.890
Seven days a week.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.300
How many hours is that?

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.050
24 hours in a day.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.020
So we're going to times by 24.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.230
How many minutes is that?

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.130
Well, let's times by 60.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.000
60 minutes in an hour, and then
times by 60 again because

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.240
there's 60 seconds
in a minute.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.060
This is how many seconds
you get in six weeks.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.500
Now we get our calculator.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.110
Let's see if we do get what
I said it was going to be.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:01.830
6 weeks times 7 days times 24
hours times 60 minutes times

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.660
60 seconds is exactly
what I said before.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.890
3,628,800, or to put it another
way, 10 factorial.
