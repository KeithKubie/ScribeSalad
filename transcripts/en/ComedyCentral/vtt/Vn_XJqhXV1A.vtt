If there's one thing stock photo
Web sites have in spades,

00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:14.013
it's bizarre office place photos
that look like they were taken

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:15.815
by a Russian mortician on LSD.

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:17.750

I'm gonna show you a stock photo

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:19.619

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.421

Well, you're in luck--
you're not getting points

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.325

These were
all spectacular answers,

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:42.228
-but you didn't get the buzzer
on time. -It's okay!

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:44.096
