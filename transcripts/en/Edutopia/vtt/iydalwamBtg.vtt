00:00:00.381 --> 00:00:03.131
(birds chirping)

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.182
- [Mathew Portell] We understand

00:00:11.182 --> 00:00:14.518
the effects of adverse childhood
experiences nationally.

00:00:14.518 --> 00:00:15.868
This is not an issue that is

00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:18.560
just isolated to my
demographic in my school.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.998
You're gonna do great aren't you?

00:00:19.998 --> 00:00:21.328
Okay, nice work.

00:00:21.328 --> 00:00:23.625
We understand what it does to them

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:26.537
now and potentially in the future.

00:00:26.537 --> 00:00:28.588
We're right off of downtown Nashville

00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:30.598
and we're in the midst of some serious

00:00:30.598 --> 00:00:32.889
transformation in gentrification.

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:35.897
And so a lot of our students
are being displaced.

00:00:35.897 --> 00:00:37.867
We have students who are currently

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:40.388
experiencing some serious
tragedy in their lives.

00:00:40.388 --> 00:00:42.368
And we know their stories and we take

00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:44.568
a proactive approach here to make sure

00:00:44.568 --> 00:00:46.118
their needs are being met.

00:00:46.118 --> 00:00:47.951
Doing all right today?

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.774
The old approach was you're at school

00:00:55.774 --> 00:00:57.707
you need to be at school and play school.

00:00:57.707 --> 00:00:59.935
And it was compliance driven.

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:01.054
But the trauma approach

00:01:01.054 --> 00:01:04.518
is taking a completely different lens.

00:01:04.518 --> 00:01:06.867
They have to feel safe,
they have to feel nurtured

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.358
and they have to feel supported.

00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:10.486
(children talking)

00:01:10.486 --> 00:01:13.153
(child singing)

00:01:18.993 --> 00:01:20.432
When kids walk through the door

00:01:20.432 --> 00:01:23.802
they don't leave everything
that has happened at the door.

00:01:23.802 --> 00:01:25.953
They're still developing emotionally,

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:28.670
they're still developing cognitively.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.374
And we want to give them
the ability to do that

00:01:31.374 --> 00:01:34.403
in a safe environment that is school.

00:01:34.403 --> 00:01:36.214
To be quite frank, this transformation

00:01:36.214 --> 00:01:38.705
is more about adults than it is kids.

00:01:38.705 --> 00:01:40.305
- You had a perfect day?

00:01:40.305 --> 00:01:41.738
- [Mathew Portell] It's
about giving the teachers

00:01:41.738 --> 00:01:43.931
the understanding and support to be able

00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:46.290
to meet the needs of the
kids on a basic level.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.254
- One, two, three, four, five six.

00:01:48.254 --> 00:01:51.512
There was a big mind
shift, for me especially.

00:01:51.512 --> 00:01:52.902
My students might have had a bad day

00:01:52.902 --> 00:01:55.571
something happened at home,
no one was home last night.

00:01:55.571 --> 00:01:57.862
You can't just be like
come in and do math now.

00:01:57.862 --> 00:01:59.548
So, when they know you can trust you

00:01:59.548 --> 00:02:00.381
and they can talk to you,

00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:03.131
their academics start to blossom.

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:05.412
- [Mathew Portell] One of the most

00:02:05.412 --> 00:02:07.721
transformative strategies
is getting someone

00:02:07.721 --> 00:02:09.880
who is trained in understanding

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.297
students mental health needs.

00:02:14.612 --> 00:02:17.501
- I was brought in as part
of the district initiative

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:21.082
to increase the awareness
and knowledge of ACES,

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:24.261
which are adverse childhood experiences.

00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:25.261
Class been okay?

00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:26.139
- Yep

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.232
- So coming in and identifying different

00:02:28.232 --> 00:02:30.290
trauma informed practices that we

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.040
can implement here in the school.

00:02:34.901 --> 00:02:36.421
- [Mathew Portell] One of the foundational

00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:40.588
programs that we're utilizing
is The Leader in Me.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.370
A lot of people are very familiar

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.642
with The Seven Habits of Highly
Effective People for Kids.

00:02:46.642 --> 00:02:48.330
And so here we foundationally

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.170
teach our kids the seven habits.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.941
- You'll see the posters around the school

00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:55.392
and you'll see the kids, they
know all of the seven habits.

00:02:55.392 --> 00:02:58.330
And they will spout them out to you.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.941
- The seven habits has helped me

00:02:59.941 --> 00:03:03.072
because I had to put first things first.

00:03:03.072 --> 00:03:06.031
I had to make sure that
I was getting good grades

00:03:06.031 --> 00:03:09.299
and not starting drama with any kids.

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.400
- [Mathew Portell] We
also build the students

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.432
capacity to develop the leadership skills

00:03:12.432 --> 00:03:15.131
by giving them a class in leadership.

00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:17.080
It's part of our specials rotations.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.480
Kindergarten through fourth grade

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.689
are part of The Leader in Me curriculum.

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.424
- ♪ Be proactive, be proactive ♪

00:03:25.424 --> 00:03:26.769
- We share this common language.

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.769
It is so amazing with putting
everybody on the same page.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.329
Building that positive school culture

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.697
in an environment where

00:03:33.697 --> 00:03:37.197
everyone feels empowered to be successful.

00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:43.254
- [Mathew Portell] We
now have students leading

00:03:43.254 --> 00:03:45.577
other students in different activities

00:03:45.577 --> 00:03:47.505
throughout the building.

00:03:47.505 --> 00:03:49.192
- Who wants to go first?

00:03:49.192 --> 00:03:51.199
- [Mathew Portell] And we value that.

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:55.366
- Good morning leaders,
the time is eight o'clock.

00:03:57.551 --> 00:03:58.729
- Traditionally in most schools

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:00.559
you've got the iridescent lighting

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:03.319
that burns their eyeballs like laserbeams.

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.591
But here we have teachers who
use a lot of low lighting.

00:04:06.591 --> 00:04:08.328
Some of our rooms have calming colors,

00:04:08.328 --> 00:04:11.151
utilizing color as a strategy.

00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:13.649
We also use essential oil diffusers

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:17.471
with just understanding
that your body is sensory.

00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:19.239
We utilize mindfulness as a strategy

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.620
in understanding that smells

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.991
and things around you are helpful.

00:04:23.991 --> 00:04:28.741
One of the approaches that
we're using are peace corners.

00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:31.511
- A peace corner is like, a place

00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:34.439
where you can just chill out.

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:37.469
If I get like, really
frustrated and feel like

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:40.792
I'm gonna yell or when I feel really sad,

00:04:40.792 --> 00:04:43.414
about to cry I go to the peace corner.

00:04:43.414 --> 00:04:44.923
- [Mathew Portell] It's
a proactive approach.

00:04:44.923 --> 00:04:46.821
And so many times we give kids strategies

00:04:46.821 --> 00:04:48.432
but we don't give them a time or a place

00:04:48.432 --> 00:04:50.814
to practice those strategies.

00:04:50.814 --> 00:04:54.243
(students talking)

00:04:54.243 --> 00:04:55.963
- We've really put a lot of effort

00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:58.323
in building positive relationships.

00:04:58.323 --> 00:04:59.814
Under that there are strategies,

00:04:59.814 --> 00:05:03.233
and one of them is our check
in and check out system.

00:05:03.233 --> 00:05:04.066
- [Emily Chadwick] Hey Mariah

00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:05.242
- Hi

00:05:05.242 --> 00:05:07.021
- Ready to have another great day today?

00:05:07.021 --> 00:05:07.854
- Yep

00:05:07.854 --> 00:05:08.687
- Awesome

00:05:10.728 --> 00:05:12.480
- My check in, check out buddy,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.756
her name is Mariah and
she's in fourth grade.

00:05:14.756 --> 00:05:15.926
She comes to see me at the beginning

00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:17.821
and at the end of every day.

00:05:17.821 --> 00:05:20.079
What are your goals for today?

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:22.496
- Listen, be on task and nice

00:05:24.952 --> 00:05:26.118
- Awesome

00:05:26.118 --> 00:05:28.582
She has three goals
everyday that she works on.

00:05:28.582 --> 00:05:30.720
She can get zero, one of two points

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.798
for each of her goals.

00:05:32.798 --> 00:05:36.678
- And then at the end of the
day, they know where they are.

00:05:36.678 --> 00:05:37.580
How was your day?

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.632
- Good.

00:05:38.632 --> 00:05:40.942
Actually it was fantastic.

00:05:40.942 --> 00:05:41.818
- Fantastic?

00:05:41.818 --> 00:05:43.576
People will see point sheets

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:45.120
but the most motivating piece

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.925
of our check in and check out system

00:05:46.925 --> 00:05:49.408
is the mentor/mentee relationship.

00:05:49.408 --> 00:05:53.088
- You go to him and he
asks about your day.

00:05:53.088 --> 00:05:56.800
And if you had a problem somewhere,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.760
we'll talk about that and
see how you can fix it.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.538
- The child knows everyday
they come in this building

00:06:03.538 --> 00:06:06.178
that somebody's excited
to see them in the morning

00:06:06.178 --> 00:06:08.440
and excited to see them
right before they leave.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.378
So do you think you can
knock that out of the park?

00:06:10.378 --> 00:06:11.211
- Mmhm

00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.044
- That's what I'm talking about.

00:06:12.044 --> 00:06:14.648
And it's that positive
in, positive out mindset.

00:06:14.648 --> 00:06:15.481
- You did it with me.

00:06:15.481 --> 00:06:16.749
- That's right no but
you did it on your own.

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:18.749
That's you my man, nice work.

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:20.999
That's been a huge success.

00:06:25.898 --> 00:06:28.909
Last year was a tough
year, it was really tough.

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:30.629
We didn't have the support systems

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:32.837
fully in place that we have now.

00:06:32.837 --> 00:06:35.378
I didn't support teachers in
the way that I should have

00:06:35.378 --> 00:06:37.795
and could have because
I was a new principal

00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:40.538
and I just didn't know how.

00:06:40.538 --> 00:06:42.357
But that all changed
at the end of the year

00:06:42.357 --> 00:06:44.156
when we all just as a
team sat down and said

00:06:44.156 --> 00:06:45.877
we've gotta do something different.

00:06:45.877 --> 00:06:47.837
Our paradigm has to shift

00:06:47.837 --> 00:06:50.189
where we're talking about not only

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:52.714
how to support students but
how to support yourself.

00:06:52.714 --> 00:06:53.763
Self care.

00:06:53.763 --> 00:06:56.645
- We know you can't help
others until you help yourself.

00:06:56.645 --> 00:06:59.453
Sometimes this job is hard,
this job is exhausting.

00:06:59.453 --> 00:07:01.343
Sometimes you just need a minute.

00:07:01.343 --> 00:07:04.575
(keyboard tapping)

00:07:04.575 --> 00:07:08.482
Tap in, tap out is something
that we've developed.

00:07:08.482 --> 00:07:10.125
You can text someone and be like,

00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:12.803
hey can you cover my class,
can you give me a second.

00:07:12.803 --> 00:07:16.272
And we will gladly cover one another.

00:07:16.272 --> 00:07:19.594
You sometimes just need to ask for help.

00:07:19.594 --> 00:07:21.965
And it's okay and it's
really accepted here,

00:07:21.965 --> 00:07:23.465
and it's promoted.

00:07:24.954 --> 00:07:26.423
- This is gray.

00:07:26.423 --> 00:07:27.256
- That's gray?

00:07:27.256 --> 00:07:28.089
- [Mathew Portell] Operating in

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:28.935
trauma informed approach is a

00:07:28.935 --> 00:07:31.464
blanketed approach for all kids.

00:07:31.464 --> 00:07:33.655
- You all have done outstanding work.

00:07:33.655 --> 00:07:35.466
- [Mathew Portell] We have to be able to

00:07:35.466 --> 00:07:38.987
help them manage their
experiences in productive ways.

00:07:38.987 --> 00:07:40.100
- What's your favorite on there.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.639
- [Mathew Portell] It's
not compliance driven,

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:45.378
It's a we've got your back approach.

00:07:45.378 --> 00:07:48.128
