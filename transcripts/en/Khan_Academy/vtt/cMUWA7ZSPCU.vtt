00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:01.684
- In this video, we're going to talk about

00:00:01.684 --> 00:00:04.292
some terminology that we use to talk about

00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:06.647
how circuits are put together.

00:00:06.647 --> 00:00:08.620
In previous videos, we've talked about

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.694
the components or elements that are used

00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:13.419
to make up circuits, so for example,

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.419
resistor, capacitor, and inductor

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:22.152
are circuit components, we
also call those elements.

00:00:22.152 --> 00:00:24.893
In addition, we have some sources

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:31.085
like a voltage source or for
example, a current source.

00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:34.028
Those would be the components

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:43.833
or elements of a circuit, el-e-ments.

00:00:48.194 --> 00:00:49.862
Now we're going to start
assembling these things

00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:53.493
into circuits, and we need a
few more words to talk about.

00:00:53.493 --> 00:00:56.260
Here's some circuit
components that are laying

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.858
out on the tabletop,

00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:01.657
and we're going to connect
those up with a wire.

00:01:01.657 --> 00:01:06.044
For example, I could
connect this one to this one

00:01:06.044 --> 00:01:08.823
with this yellow ideal wire, and an ideal

00:01:08.823 --> 00:01:12.682
wire has zero resistance
and is perfect everywhere,

00:01:12.682 --> 00:01:17.647
and this forms a junction
between these two components

00:01:17.647 --> 00:01:21.524
and that is called a node.

00:01:21.524 --> 00:01:25.279
Node is the word for junction,
meaning the same thing.

00:01:28.577 --> 00:01:31.042
And that's what a node is.

00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:35.590
If I connect up these
two other components,

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.066
I still have one node
because I have one junction

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.379
that's the same voltage everywhere,

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:43.794
so that's what a node is.

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:46.126
We're going to go over
to this circuit here

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:47.451
and we'll identify the nodes.

00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:50.632
This is a little more
normal-looking, tidy circuit.

00:01:50.632 --> 00:01:54.598
Here's a junction right here between

00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:57.579
a resistor and this voltage source,

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.519
so that's one node.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.390
If I move over here, I see resistors

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.310
connected together by ideal wires,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.966
so that forms one single node like that.

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:11.328
So that's our second node, and down below,

00:02:11.328 --> 00:02:14.091
same sort of thing, I see an ideal wire

00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:17.359
connecting the resistors and the source.

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.664
So I can color that in and that's

00:02:20.664 --> 00:02:23.173
node number three.

00:02:23.173 --> 00:02:25.739
So this circuit has three nodes.

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:31.076
Now what's connecting the nodes?

00:02:31.076 --> 00:02:34.877
The thing that's connecting
the nodes is called a branch.

00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:39.482
And a branch is the same
thing as an element.

00:02:39.482 --> 00:02:43.255
We'll cap the... the branches
are elements in this thing.

00:02:43.255 --> 00:02:45.931
This voltage source
connects the third node

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:50.193
to the first node, so that's one element.

00:02:50.193 --> 00:02:52.976
This resistor connects
node one and node two,

00:02:52.976 --> 00:02:56.141
so that's the second branch.

00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:58.830
This resistor connects
node two and node three,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.136
so there's the third
branch, and this resistor

00:03:02.136 --> 00:03:05.161
with a separate current also
connects those two nodes

00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:07.133
so that's the fourth branch.

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:12.076
So this circuit has one, two, three, four

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:17.541
elements in it, and it also
means it has four branches.

00:03:17.541 --> 00:03:21.472
Four branches, so that's
what a branch and a node are.

00:03:22.554 --> 00:03:24.010
I can move the picture over a little bit

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.810
so that we can do this again on

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.870
a little more fancy circuit.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.452
So the first thing we're going to do again

00:03:31.452 --> 00:03:34.258
just to repeat the process,
we're going to count the nodes.

00:03:34.258 --> 00:03:37.839
Here's a junction between a resistor

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:41.187
and a source, here's three resistors

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:44.095
connected by a perfect wire.

00:03:44.095 --> 00:03:45.909
So that's the second node.

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.679
Here's three more resistors, connected

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:53.263
by a perfect wire, there's a third.

00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:55.553
Down here we have, there's a junction

00:03:55.553 --> 00:03:59.197
between two resistors, so
that's our fourth node.

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:02.375
And finally we have this node here

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:05.924
connecting these four elements

00:04:05.924 --> 00:04:09.397
with one node.

00:04:09.397 --> 00:04:12.520
This is sometimes called a distributed,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.611
a distributed node when
it's all spread out

00:04:14.611 --> 00:04:17.859
on the page like that, but
it's still just one node.

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.069
So this circuit has five nodes.

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:26.707
And if we count up the elements,

00:04:26.707 --> 00:04:29.005
that will tell us how
many branches there are.

00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:33.421
One element, two, three, four,

00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:38.065
five, six, seven.

00:04:38.065 --> 00:04:40.495
Seven elements.

00:04:46.798 --> 00:04:48.972
All right, there's our two, two key words.

00:04:48.972 --> 00:04:52.307
Elements and nodes.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.802
Now I'm going to quickly move again

00:04:57.802 --> 00:05:01.541
down, bring in another circuit here.

00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:05.698
Now we're going to talk
about the idea of a mesh.

00:05:08.525 --> 00:05:10.034
And the other thing
we're going to talk about

00:05:10.034 --> 00:05:13.120
is the word loop.

00:05:14.957 --> 00:05:17.601
The word mesh comes from screen doors

00:05:17.601 --> 00:05:20.186
or screens that you put on your windows

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:21.139
to keep the bugs out.

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.860
If I draw a screen like this, this is what

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.175
it looks like, a bunch of crossing wires

00:05:27.175 --> 00:05:29.682
and this little space
right here, that little gap

00:05:29.682 --> 00:05:34.020
is called a mesh, that's
what that word comes from.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.012
So we're going to find
the meshes of our circuit,

00:05:36.012 --> 00:05:38.678
and what we look for, here's the branches,

00:05:38.678 --> 00:05:42.777
and the mesh, it is a kind of a loop

00:05:42.777 --> 00:05:46.289
that fills up this open space.

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.328
This circuit has one mesh,

00:05:49.954 --> 00:05:54.863
two mesh, three meshes.

00:05:54.863 --> 00:05:56.226
That's how that looks.

00:05:56.226 --> 00:05:58.615
To draw a mesh, you start on a node,

00:05:58.615 --> 00:06:01.203
you go through elements
until you come back

00:06:01.203 --> 00:06:02.820
to where you started.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.234
That's how we did those three,

00:06:04.234 --> 00:06:07.090
and they fill the open
windows of the circuit.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.693
So this circuit has three meshes.

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:14.129
Now a mesh is a loop, and we can have

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:16.413
other kinds of loops too.

00:06:16.413 --> 00:06:18.019
They don't have to be just the ones

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:20.834
that fill the windows, so in general,

00:06:20.834 --> 00:06:23.051
this circuit has other
loops, and we'll identify

00:06:23.051 --> 00:06:26.807
some of those, let's just start
at one of these nodes here,

00:06:26.807 --> 00:06:30.758
and go around like that
and this is a loop.

00:06:32.413 --> 00:06:33.927
And I could draw other loops in here.

00:06:33.927 --> 00:06:35.720
We'll make them all different colors.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.854
There's a loop if I start right here,

00:06:39.854 --> 00:06:43.176
I can draw a loop through these elements.

00:06:46.593 --> 00:06:48.608
And finally, if I have a sharp eye,

00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:51.005
there's one more loop in this circuit.

00:06:51.005 --> 00:06:53.265
Let's just start right
here, and it actually

00:06:53.265 --> 00:06:56.138
goes all the way around the outside.

00:06:59.014 --> 00:07:01.859
So this circuit has three, actually,

00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:04.818
if I add them together,
this has three loops

00:07:04.818 --> 00:07:07.192
that I drew here plus the three loops

00:07:07.192 --> 00:07:11.033
that were the meshes, so
this circuit has six loops.

00:07:12.878 --> 00:07:14.423
Circuits always have a lot of loops,

00:07:14.423 --> 00:07:17.120
and so usually we don't talk about these.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.871
More often, it's more
organized and straightforward

00:07:19.871 --> 00:07:23.243
to talk about how many
meshes are in a circuit.

00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:26.039
All right, so that does it for this video.

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:29.486
We got mesh and loop, we talked

00:07:29.486 --> 00:07:33.163
about components and elements.

00:07:41.555 --> 00:07:44.393
And we finished up with the idea

00:07:46.146 --> 00:07:48.996
also of nodes

00:07:51.568 --> 00:07:53.451
and branches.

00:07:59.773 --> 00:08:01.818
So that'll do it, there's
our new vocabulary

00:08:01.818 --> 00:08:03.354
for talking about circuits.
