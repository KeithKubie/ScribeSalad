00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.660
 You know, honesty is often something we see as a good thing, right? 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.440
 We want our friends to be honest 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.280
 What do you think? Is it too exaggerated? 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.060
 That outfit should be burned ... 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.000
 .... because he is hot! 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.980
 * stupid laughs * 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.660
 We want our partners to be honest 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.180
 Kelly, uhm ... I have something to tell you 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.520
 Ugh, I'm so nervous! 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.440
 I have never said this to anyone, but .. 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.460
 ...I love you! 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.080
 Oh my God, Anna, are you serious !? - Yes! 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.180
 Omg, thank you! I do not love you. 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.360
 but .... you are a nice girl! 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.300
 ...Okay... 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.080
 But sometimes when people are honest, that comes across as hard. 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.800
 I was at a friend's dinner when someone said to me: 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.460
 Anna, you shouldn't get too drunk! You are noisy when you are drunk and I don't want to have to move. 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.880
 And I mean, she was right, when I get drunk, I am very loud 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.580
 Speaking to me, I believe most are ... 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.940
 ... but it felt so mean at the time. Even while I knew she wasn't trying to hurt me. 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.480
 Because I was so; what should i say now? 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.400
 You know how did I have to respond? 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.440
 There was no way to continue the evening without keeping my mouth shut, sitting still, and feeling that I wasn't allowed to have fun. 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.920
 And so I wondered: 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.340
 Where is the line between just being honest and being mean? 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.360
 Is it the intention of the person? 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.240
 Because a guest once said to me: 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.160
 Yo, did you poke before I saw you yesterday? Your pussy stank of poo. 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.880
 And that is by far the meanest thing anyone has ever said to me in my entire life. 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.860
 Especially because he knew that I had problems getting people close to my vagina. 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.480
 I mean, it just felt weird, and it's fragile and scary 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.860
 So I was: why would you say something like that to me ?! 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.760
 And he honestly thought he wasn't mean. 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.340
 He thought he was honest and sincere and that I would appreciate that. 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.020
 What? I'm just being honest, right? Isn't that what people do when they are in love? 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.160
 No, we all have stupid, terrible thoughts. Every day. 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.900
 but that doesn't mean we should express them all? 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.280
 I mean every time I have a knife in my hands I think: 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.860
 Wow, I could just go completely free and stab everyone 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.540
 And what could they do about it? 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.680
 I could knock them all down 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.020
 I mean, I'm not going to do it because I love them .. 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.580
 but it could just be. Their lives are in my hands, 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.580
 I could just stab and cut and kill them all. Hm ... 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.820
 But I'm not going to "be honest" and tell all people right away. 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.860
 Guys, isn't it strange that I could kill you all now? 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.380
 I mean, is it possible? None of you have a weapon. 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.000
 I could just sprint to you, Mary, and cut your throat open. 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.540
 And put you in your heart, Jenny. And then just pick it up at Caitlyn, and then cut off Melissa's face. 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.200
 * laughs * 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.400
 and what would you do? 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.760
 You would just die. 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.260
 Maybe people just use honesty as an excuse to be a bastard. 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.940
 and I'm certainly guilty of that 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.380
 I did that anyway 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.300
 but I really want to stop that 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.200
 I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings just because I think I have the right to be honest with them. 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.680
 and vice versa, if people are honest with me, hope it is for a good intention. 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.640
 For example, that I date a violent person, or that I might become an alcoholic? 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.440
 I don't want anyone telling me that, in their opinion, I did something wrong. 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.120
 because my vagina didn't smell bad. And even if that were true, God commands, you should never say anything like that to me. 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.380
 So I encourage you to think about all the times that you were honest 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.600
 and then ask yourself: wasn't I just mean? 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.500
 Are you ever honest when it's hard? 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.020
 For example, when you need to tell someone that they may not want to hear and you don't want to say? 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.980
 And not something that you simply don't like. 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.520
 I'm Anna Akana, stay awesome Gotham! 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.780
 And also a Shout out to Kelly for playing in my video! 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.800

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.560

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.340
