00:00:00.336 --> 00:00:01.010
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.520
So how do we find
these stable marriages?

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.730
Well there's out
procedure for doing it,

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.530
which is kind of elegantly
described as a day

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.090
by day mating ritual that the
boys and girls cooperate in.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.030
So let's see what
happens on the first day.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.180
On the morning of the
first day, each boy

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.000
looks at his list
of girls and picks

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.190
the one that he likes the
best, at the top of this list,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.150
and he goes off and serenades
her or proposes to her.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.700
So here we have Billy Bob and
Brad proposing to Angelina.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.170
That means that on
the first day Angelina

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.170
was at the top of both Brad's
list and Billy Bob's list.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.380
And they're both going to
be proposing and asking

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.260
if she's willing to marry them.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.110
Well in the afternoon,
each girl rejects all but

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.310
her favorite suitor.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.360
So in this case, Angelina
likes Brad best of all.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.980
So she says to everybody else,
if you're not Brad take a hike.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.739
And that's what
happens at that stage.

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.280
And then in the
evening, here we look

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.810
at rejected boy, Billy Bob.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.350
A boy who's rejected crosses
off the girl who rejected him.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.950
So Billy Bob is going to
cross Angelina off his list.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.670
And then the whole
ritual is going

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.250
to repeat starting
the next morning.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.250
Except now Billy Bob will
have a different woman

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.690
at the top of his list because
Angelina's gone forever.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.440
This mating ritual continues
until nothing changes.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.160
And that's going to happen
exactly when each girl has

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.740
at most one suitor.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.620
Because if she has
more than one suitor,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.380
she's going to reject
the less favorite ones.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.740
So that is the definition
of the stopping condition.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.510
And on that day, by
definition, no girl

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.280
can have more than one suitor.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.520
So she will marry the
one suitor she has.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.110
And that's the definition of
the marriages that result,

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.620
if and when, the
mating ritual stops.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.010
And we claim that they are
going to be stable marriages.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.400
Now if we think
about this process,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.750
it's really a state machine.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.169
In fact, if you think about
it, what the states are

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.270
is the set of girls on the
boys list on any given morning.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.890
And then those states
evolve to a new list

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.560
after the crossing out
happens on the next morning.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.290
So this is kind
of a memorable way

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.110
to tell a story about the
transitions of a state machine.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.470
And we can bring our state
machine concepts to bear.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.928
So the first thing
we want to prove

00:02:30.928 --> 00:02:33.170
is that this state
machine terminates.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.870
That is to say, there
exists a wedding day.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.880
Then we want to
prove that this state

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.350
machine is partially correct.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.900
And what that means that
when the machine stops,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.250
everyone is married and that
the marriages are stable.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.250
So that's our task.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.530
Well termination's easy.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.650
Because if you
look at the state,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.910
the state is the boys
lists on a given morning.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.620
And things evolve
because boys get rejected

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.480
and they cross
girls off the list.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.510
So what that means, if we
take the total number of names

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.740
remaining on the boys lists
on any given morning, that

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.480
is a strictly decreasing and
non-negative integer valued

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.390
variable.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.410
So by the well-ordering
principle,

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.090
that's strictly decreasing.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.440
Well-ordered derived variable
will reach a minimum value.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.290
And by definition,
that's when the algorithm

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.220
has to stop because it's
strictly increasing.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.890
So it can't move once
it's reached its minimum.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.610
So there's a wedding day.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.110
All right.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.860
So now let's examine
correctness of this procedure

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.600
and figure out what's supposed
to happen on the wedding day.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.810
We want to show that
everybody's married

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.370
and that the
marriages are stable.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.870
And in order to do
that, we're going

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.050
to look at some more derived
variables and an invariant that

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.930
explains why the
mating ritual works.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.480
So the first remark is that
the girls improve day by day,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.370
or at least they
don't get any worse.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.050
Namely, a girl's
favorite tomorrow

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.340
will be at least as desirable
to her as her favorite today.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.790
That's for any given day.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.769
If you look at a girl's
favorite on this day,

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.970
and if there is a tomorrow,
then her favorite tomorrow

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.010
is going to be at least as
good as the one she has.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.450
And why is that?

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.670
Well because today's favorite
will keep serenading her

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.300
until he gets rejected.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.390
And he only gets rejected when
the girl that he's serenading

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.520
gets yet a better suitor.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.370
And so the girls are
always going to improve.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.680
We could reformulate this
in state machine language

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.670
by saying that the rank
of a girl's favorite,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.180
where she rates the boy
that's serenading her

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.320
on her own list of preferences,
is a weekly increasing

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.300
variable.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.680
It never gets any worse
from one day to the next.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.800
By the same reasoning
or similar reasoning,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.371
a boy's favorite tomorrow is
going to be no better than

00:05:07.371 --> 00:05:07.870
today's.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.130
It might be worse.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.795
And so it's no more-- the
woman that he's going to say,

00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:14.420
tomorrow is no more desirable to
him than today's, is basically

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.920
because he works
straight down his list.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.430
If he hasn't been
rejected, he'll

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.420
keep serenading the
same woman tomorrow.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.550
If he has been
rejected, then he's

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.150
going to be working
on somebody lower

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.210
on his list that's
less desirable.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.510
So again, the rank of a girl
on a boy, that a boy serenades,

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.670
is a weekly decreasing derived
variable of this process.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.530
And these observations lead
us to an invariant that

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.270
holds for the mating ritual.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.770
And the invariant is that
if you look at any girl G,

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.200
and if there's a
boy B and G is not

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.250
on B's list, that is G
must've been crossed off

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.120
by B at some point, then the
invariant is that the girl

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.360
G has a favorite that
is better than B.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.480
And the reason is that
again, when G rejected B,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.240
she had a better suitor
than B. And her suitors keep

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.010
getting better by
the weekly increasing

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.720
property of her suitors.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.810
And therefore,
she's going to have

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.160
a suitor that she likes better
than B, whose list she's not

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.660
on.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.930
This holds for all G's and B's.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.890
And that is an invariant
from one day to the next.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.130
So let's look at what
happens on the wedding day

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.770
and use the invariant to
prove that everybody's married

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.360
and that stability holds.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.670
So the first remark is that each
girl has at most one suitor,

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.990
and we've observed that's by
definition of a wedding day.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:51.750
And now what we want to prove
is that each boy gets married.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.370
Well what's going on with a
boy, a boy is either married

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.970
because he's serenading
the top woman on his list,

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.840
or maybe all the women on his
list have been crossed off,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.260
then he's not
serenading anybody.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.961
So that's the only way
he could be not married.

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:10.460
Now the reason that
this is the case

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.980
is that there's no bigamy here.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.770
So boys serenade only
one girl at a time.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:22.880
So if a boy is married,
there's only one possible woman

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.120
that he can be married to.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.120
And a woman's married
to one possible boy.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.635
So let's now put these
facts together and argue

00:07:29.635 --> 00:07:31.510
that everybody is married
on the wedding day.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.640
And the proof is
by contradiction.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.270
Suppose there's some boy
B that's not married.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.700
Well that happens exactly
when his list is empty.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.170
Otherwise, he'd be serenading
somebody and be married to her.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.670
But if his list is
empty by the invariant,

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:50.100
every girl has a
suitor that she likes

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.290
better than B, which means she's
going to be married to somebody

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.530
that she likes better than B.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:56.591
Every girl's married.

00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:58.590
But there are the same
number of boys and girls.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.560
So in fact, given that
there's no bigamy,

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.710
all the boys have
to be married too.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.610
And that settles that one.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.340
So the next crucial property
that we're interested in

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.360
is stability.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.250
That in fact this
set of marriages,

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.400
which must come into
being on the wedding day,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.630
are all stable.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.410
And the argument for
stability has two cases,

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.740
both of them trivial that follow
immediately from the invariant.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.720
First of all, let's look
at an arbitrary boy, Bob.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.210
I claim that he won't
be in a rogue couple

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:36.840
with case one, any girl G
that's on his final list.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.740
Because if a girl is
on his final list,

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.740
then he's already married
to the best of them.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.600
He marries the girl at
the top of his list.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.600
So he's not going to
be tempted to switch--

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.770
to be part of a rogue couple
with some girl that's still

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:54.920
on his list.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.920
Case two is, he's not going
to be in a rogue couple

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.590
with a girl that's
not on his list.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.370
Because, by the invariant,
she's married to somebody

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.360
she likes better than him.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.400
So there's no available
girl either way for Bob

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.680
to be in a rogue couple with.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.840
Bob, of course, is
an arbitrary boy.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.190
And therefore, no boy
is in a rogue couple.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.450
And indeed, there
are no rogue couples.
