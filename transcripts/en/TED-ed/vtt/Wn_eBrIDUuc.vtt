00:00:06.648 --> 00:00:09.226
You're telling a friend an amazing story,

00:00:09.226 --> 00:00:13.637
and you just get to the best part
when suddenly he interrupts,

00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:17.819
"The alien and I," not "Me and the alien."

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:19.813
Most of us would probably be annoyed,

00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:21.907
but aside from the rude interruption,

00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:23.713
does your friend have a point?

00:00:23.713 --> 00:00:26.837
Was your sentence actually 
grammatically incorrect?

00:00:26.837 --> 00:00:30.867
And if he still understood it,
why does it even matter?

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:32.722
From the point of view of linguistics,

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:36.547
grammar is a set of patterns 
for how words are put together

00:00:36.547 --> 00:00:39.096
to form phrases or clauses,

00:00:39.096 --> 00:00:41.905
whether spoken or in writing.

00:00:41.905 --> 00:00:44.090
Different languages 
have different patterns.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.433
In English, the subject 
normally comes first,

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:48.689
followed by the verb,

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:50.007
and then the object,

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:52.554
while in Japanese 
and many other languages,

00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:55.898
the order is subject, object, verb.

00:00:55.898 --> 00:01:00.151
Some scholars have tried to identify
patterns common to all languages,

00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:02.496
but apart from some basic features,

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:04.593
like having nouns or verbs,

00:01:04.593 --> 00:01:08.939
few of these so-called 
linguistic universals have been found.

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.026
And while any language needs consistent
patterns to function,

00:01:12.026 --> 00:01:17.306
the study of these patterns opens up
an ongoing debate between two positions

00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:20.913
known as prescriptivism
and descriptivism.

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:22.198
Grossly simplified,

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:26.061
prescriptivists think a given language 
should follow consistent rules,

00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:30.692
while descriptivists see variation
and adaptation as a natural

00:01:30.692 --> 00:01:33.880
and necessary part of language.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.321
For much of history, the vast majority
of language was spoken.

00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:42.286
But as people became more interconnected
and writing gained importance,

00:01:42.286 --> 00:01:46.341
written language was standardized
to allow broader communication

00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:51.081
and ensure that people in different parts
of a realm could understand each other.

00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:56.741
In many languages, this standard form
came to be considered the only proper one,

00:01:56.741 --> 00:02:00.665
despite being derived from just one
of many spoken varieties,

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:03.078
usually that of the people in power.

00:02:03.078 --> 00:02:07.426
Language purists worked to establish
and propagate this standard

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:13.021
by detailing a set of rules that reflected
the established grammar of their times.

00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:17.245
And rules for written grammar were applied
to spoken language, as well.

00:02:17.245 --> 00:02:21.683
Speech patterns that deviated from the
written rules were considered corruptions,

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:24.090
or signs of low social status,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.675
and many people who had grown up
speaking in these ways

00:02:26.675 --> 00:02:30.570
were forced to adopt 
the standardized form.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.886
More recently, however,

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:36.140
linguists have understood that speech
is a separate phenomenon from writing

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.287
with its own regularities and patterns.

00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:42.891
Most of us learn to speak at such an early
age that we don't even remember it.

00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:46.468
We form our spoken repertoire through
unconscious habits,

00:02:46.468 --> 00:02:48.828
not memorized rules.

00:02:48.828 --> 00:02:52.621
And because speech also uses mood
and intonation for meaning,

00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:54.775
its structure is often more flexible,

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:58.727
adapting to the needs of speakers
and listeners.

00:02:58.727 --> 00:03:03.241
This could mean avoiding complex clauses
that are hard to parse in real time,

00:03:03.241 --> 00:03:06.037
making changes to avoid awkward
pronounciation,

00:03:06.037 --> 00:03:09.388
or removing sounds to make speech faster.

00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:13.571
The linguistic approach that tries
to understand and map such differences

00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:17.945
without dictating correct ones
is known as descriptivism.

00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:20.301
Rather than deciding how language
should be used,

00:03:20.301 --> 00:03:23.131
it describes how people actually use it,

00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:27.259
and tracks the innovations 
they come up with in the process.

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:28.878
But while the debate between

00:03:28.878 --> 00:03:31.175
prescriptivism 
and descriptivism continues,

00:03:31.175 --> 00:03:33.598
the two are not mutually exclusive.

00:03:33.598 --> 00:03:37.072
At its best, prescriptivism is useful
for informing people

00:03:37.072 --> 00:03:41.675
about the most common established
patterns at a given point in time.

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:44.471
This is important, 
not only for formal contexts,

00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:48.432
but it also makes communication easier
between non-native speakers

00:03:48.432 --> 00:03:50.620
from different backgrounds.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.194
Descriptivism, on the other hand,

00:03:52.194 --> 00:03:54.447
gives us insight into how our minds work

00:03:54.447 --> 00:03:58.855
and the instinctive ways in which we 
structure our view of the world.

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:03.461
Ultimately, grammar is best thought of
as a set of linguistic habits

00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:06.751
that are constantly being negotiated
and reinvented

00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:09.966
by the entire group of language users.

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:11.352
Like language itself,

00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:13.217
it's a wonderful and complex fabric

00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:17.080
woven through the contributions
of speakers and listeners,

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.565
writers and readers,

00:04:18.565 --> 00:04:20.781
prescriptivists and descriptivists,

00:04:20.781 --> 00:04:22.663
from both near and far.
