[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.940
GEENA DAVIS: When my daughter
was two, I started watching

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.930
little kids videos and programs
with her, and now I

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.880
had this incredible
spidey sense about

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.430
how women are portrayed.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.340
And I was absolutely stunned to
see what I perceived to be

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.340
a huge dearth of female
characters in these

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.100
entertainments made for kids.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.440
I decided I needed the
numbers if I was

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.840
going to have an impact.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.000
Just my impression was not
having any impact on them, so

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.240
maybe if I got the numbers.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.320
This is where my life took on
a whole new direction as a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.570
datahead, like you all, and I
know what the ratio of male

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.990
and female characters
is in movies and TV.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.310
Because about eight years ago,
I founded my Research

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.440
Institute on Gender in Media
because I wanted the answer to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.310
one very specific question.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.940
I wanted to know how many female
characters there were

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.160
in these entertainments that
were made for kids.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.560
And so we now have conducted
the most extensive research

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.360
ever done on gender depictions
in media covering a 20-year

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.340
span, and the results
were stunning.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.540
In family films, for every one
female character, there were

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.690
three male characters.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.900
And of the female characters
that did exist, the majority

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.240
were either highly stereotyped
or hyper-sexualized.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.800
Get this.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.220
In G-rated animated movies, the
female characters wear the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.180
same amount of sexually
revealing clothing as the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.220
female characters in
R-rated movies.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.670
So by now you might be thinking,
what the heck?

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.770
These numbers are appalling.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.670
I didn't even know this.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.550
What could be going on here?

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.650
But I want to assure you that,
through our research, we have

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.670
some positive news.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.400
We found that if we add female
characters to these

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.160
entertainments at the rate that
we have been, we will

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.670
achieve parity in 700 years.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.949
My organization is dedicated
to cutting that in half.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.325
GEENA DAVIS: And we will
not stop until we

00:02:15.325 --> 00:02:17.030
have achieved that.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.890
So we have to ask ourselves,
what message are we sending to

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.150
boys and girls at a very
vulnerable age if the female

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.590
characters are one-dimensional,
sidelined,

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.470
stereotyped, hyper-sexualized,
or not even there at all?

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.760
Right?

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.880
We're saying that women and
girls are a little bit less

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.480
important to us than
men and boys.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.310
So what do we do with
all of this?

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.620
What we do is take the research
directly, because I'm

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.800
in the industry, directly to the
studios, the networks, the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.280
guilds, and present
it to them.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.990
And they have had a consistent
reaction,

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.040
which is utter shock.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.220
Their jaws are on the ground.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.750
They had no idea that they were
leaving out that many

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.590
female characters.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.660
And, in fact, they're like--

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.640
why would we do that?

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.680
We're making stuff for kids.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.070
Why on earth would we do that?

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.820
The cure for seeing negative
images that impair girls'

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.030
self-esteem is to show better
images, to show empowering

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.220
images, to show women and girls
taking up half the space

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.930
in the world.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.590
So the media itself can
be the cure for

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.160
the problem it created.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.450
The most fabulous thing, of
course, that happened to us

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.160
recently was to receive one of
the Global Impact Awards,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.960
which is incredibly, incredibly
meaningful to us,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.500
not only in itself but because
of the extra attention that it

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.850
brings to the work
we're doing.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.160
Because right now, we
do the research in

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.400
the traditional way.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.320
It's very time consuming
and labor intensive.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.600
We have like 60 grad students
watching all the films and TV

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.390
and taking the numbers down.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.250
For a big study like the ones
we do, it can take almost a

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.620
year to get it completed.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.750
But with this grant, it's going
to be aimed at creating

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.240
the software that will allow
us to do the research much

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.209
faster, much more precisely,
effectively, and, obviously,

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.860
cost effective.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.140
We'll be able to, for the first
time, gather global data

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.050
because it won't cost us a
fortune to be able to do that.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.510
We'll be able to research
in real time.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.650
In other words, we can create
a new future through what

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.920
people see in the media.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.600
If they can see it,
they can be it.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.283
[APPLAUSE]
