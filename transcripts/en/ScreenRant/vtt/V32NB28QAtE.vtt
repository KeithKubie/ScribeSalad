00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.600
Blockbuster films may be billion-dollar affairs
these days, but no matter how big the action

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.830
and spectacle may get, slip-ups are bound
to happen.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.740
Studios do their best to keep those flaws
from making the final cut, but luckily for

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.330
movie buffs, some incredible mistakes still
slip through the cracks.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.580
Here are ScreenRant's Biggest Movie Mistakes
You Missed.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.939
The Last Samurai

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.540
The Last Samurai�s tale of 19th century
Japan may rewrite several historical events

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.310
and figures, but it's actually star Tom Cruise's
horse who delivers the biggest on-screen gaff.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.340
As the film's hero arrives to muster his samurai
before battle, his horse comes to a full stop

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.480
before suddenly unleashing a crushing blow
to a nearby extra.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.100
It seems the horse didn�t care for the way
it was handled, and chose to take its anger

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.170
out on an unsuspecting samurai � a decision
every viewer can now appreciate with a laugh

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.710
(or a shudder).

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.710
Jurassic Park

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.370
It�s no secret that Jurassic Park has its
fair share of mistakes, mostly continuity

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.390
errors or props appearing onscreen.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.530
Then there�s the magical T-Rex enclosure
that a dinosaur can walk out of, despite the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.479
massive plunge shown later.

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.569
But one would think that a film capable of
bringing dinosaurs to life would also be able

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:28.280
to set up an actual live camera feed for programmer
Dennis Nedry before he double-crosses John

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.420
Hammond.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.180
But when Nedry is speaking with his contact
at the Isla Nublar docks, no attempt is made

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.380
to conceal the fact that he and the viewer
are watching a pre-recorded video, which would

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.470
have ended not long after the shot.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.189
Quantum of Solace

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.070
James Bond adventures are famous for their
physics-defying action and over-the-top science,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.729
but Quantum of Solace showed it isn't just
007 who can turn reality on its head.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.390
As star Daniel Craig tracks his prey in the
sun-baked harbor of Haiti, a background maintenance

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.810
worker does his best to look casual - and
fails miserably.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.000
Making sure not to fill the set with clouds
of dust or sand is understandable, but how

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.290
this floating broom pantomime made it into
the finished film is anyone�s guess.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.700
Quantum of Solace

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.790
An overzealous extra is one thing, but Quantum
of Solace is also home to one baffling error

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.080
placed center stage.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.230
During a high speed boat chase, James decides
to cut power unexpectedly, causing the pursuing

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.400
boat to slam up onto the back of his own.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.400
Without a weapon, James grabs a nearby grappling
hook, and tosses it over into his enemies�

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.799
inflatable boat.

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.489
The rope catches, and the bad guys are sent
flying into the air, ending the chase.

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.180
The problem is: the hook was never actually
attached to anything � there�s no reason

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.810
for the rope to be pulled out of the boat
in the first place.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.280
Audiences are left to scratch their heads
at what just took place, and what the filmmakers

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.879
could have been thinking when they filmed
it.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:05.879
Gladiator

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.629
Ridley Scott's Gladiator pushed visual effects
and swords-and-sandal drama into a whole new

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.730
generation, but it wasn't without a few rough
spots.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.140
Star Russell Crowe begins his journey from
salve to revolutionary by uniting his fellow

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.680
gladiators during a re-enactment of the Battle
of Carthage, in which opposing chariots are

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.349
beaten by spear and teamwork.

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.650
Yet when a chariot loses a wheel and tips
on its side, a curtain drops, revealing the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.040
entire gas canister rig used for the stunt.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.989
It�s nearly impossible to miss, making it
even more out of place in such an award-winning

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.750
drama.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.069
Transformers: Age of Extinction

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.120
Director Michael Bay may have his critics,
but he�s also responsible for the slick

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.129
action now standard in every summer blockbuster
- with the Transformers series being his most

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.750
successful to date.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.500
But in the storm of giant alien robots fighting
to destroy the Earth, some smaller mistakes

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.500
have slipped through.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.590
One of the strangest can be seen during the
closing fight of Transformers: Age of Extinction,

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.689
as star Mark Wahlberg runs to the aid of Optimus
Prime, drawing fire from Megatron in the process.

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:17.000
A brick wall takes the brunt of the villain�s
attack - along with a completely unknown man

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.310
suddenly appearing at Wahlberg's side.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:27.630
Whether a member of the crew or a cast member,
his instant arrival is a total mystery.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.250
The Dark Knight Rises

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.780
The final chapter of Christopher Nolan's Batman
trilogy threw more than a few curveballs at

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.750
fans, including Catwoman's shift from villain
to heroine.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.400
But when Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle first
join forces for a rooftop fistfight, their

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.270
skills prove too much for one background henchman
� who drops to the ground without being

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.710
touched.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.650
It's clearly a case of stunt team members
missing their mark, but it�s not the only

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.180
one in the film.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.840
When Batman emerges to save Gotham from the
brink in the film�s final act, yet another

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:08.160
henchman decides that hitting the deck without
reason is the best course of action.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.520
Batman Begins

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.699
Extras can occasionally make their presence
well-known, but doing too good a job can also

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:15.950
lead to some problems.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.710
Take, for instance, one Gotham City police
officer seen in Christopher Nolan�s Batman

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.900
Begins.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.240
No fan will forget the first time Bruce Wayne
took his Tumbler to the streets, but some

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.770
might not have noticed one mindboggling mistake
contained in the sequence.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.199
Moments before Batman sends the Tumbler jumping
from the top of a parking structure, a police

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.800
officer demands that he get out of his vehicle.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.860
Just a minute later, that same police officer
is shown across town demanding a description

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.470
of Batman�s wheels.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:57.210
Apparently, he was just too good an actor
to waste on ONE gag.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.210
Star Wars

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.599
Every film buff knows that the release of
Star Wars: A New Hope changed the world, not

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:06.940
only for its box office success, but also
for the clumsy stormtrooper slamming his head

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.560
into a Death Star doorway that instantly became
the stuff of legend.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.910
Rather than fixing the mistake, director George
Lucas called out the gaff in later re-releases,

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.110
adding a sound effect and line of dialogue.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.440
But it didn't stop there: the clumsiness was
carried over to the prequel movie, Attack

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.340
of the Clones, where Jango Fett - the man
from whom the Clone Troopers were copied - was

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:37.880
shown to be just as clumsy.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.220
As Lucas explained in the film's DVD commentary:

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.830
"I thought, 'Wouldn't it be funny if that's
a trait that Jango has?'

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.949
When he puts his helmet on he can't really
see that we'll, so he's constantly bumping

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.910
his head - and that trait gets cloned into
all the stormtroopers."

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:51.910
Captain America: The Winter Soldier

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:52.910
Superhero movie fans were shown that there�s
more to Steve Rogers than patriotism and old-fashioned

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:53.910
values when he was put in charge of a S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:54.910
strike team in Captain America: The Winter
Soldier.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:55.910
Although Cap was able to take down an entire
ship�s worth of armed guards � in one

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:56.910
of the most memorable hand-to-hand combat
sequences comic book films have ever produced

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:57.910
� his moves weren�t all perfect.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:58.910
When Steve first boards the S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:59.910
vessel, he dispatches a number of guards with
so much ferocity, he�s able to knock out

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:00.910
one henchman despite the foot or two between
his fist and the goon�s face.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:01.910
Later, Cap can be seen switching sides of
the ship in the middle of a combat roll.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:02.910
These mistakes can be forgiven, but in an
otherwise flawless sequence, they show even

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:03.910
movie magic has its limits.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:04.910
Conclusion
