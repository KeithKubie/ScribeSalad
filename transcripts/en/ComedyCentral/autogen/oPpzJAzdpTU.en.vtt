IN THE FINEST RESTAURANT
IN THE WORLD.

THIS IS NOT FIT

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:38.465
NO, THIS SHOULD BE EATEN
BY A HIGHER LIFE-FORM

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:42.402
WITH A MORE COMPLEX PALATE,
BUT ALSO AN ALTRUISTIC DRIVE

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:45.839

FROM DISHES LIKE THIS.

00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:48.809
JOKING. NOT!
YOU DESERVE TO DIE!

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:51.812

SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO ENDURE
A LIFE IN WHICH YOU WILL

00:01:55.115 --> 00:02:00.087
NEVER EXCEED WHAT
