00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:05.970
Death is still a mysterious and unknown subject
for all of us.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.520
We see it often in our favorite films and
books, but what's the real scoop on it?

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.180
Here are five surprising facts about death
you would have never guessed.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.180
One: When a person dies, their hearing is
the last sense to go.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.150
Although not scientifically proven, Zachary
Pallas, a medical director, believes that

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.460
hearing is the last sense to go when we die.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.910
He states that when death seems near, family
and friends always share their last thoughts.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.440
Although it becomes clear that blood pressure
is dropping and the person is fading out,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.909
we often believe they can still hear what
we're saying.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.030
Two: You can't actually die of old age.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.210
You've probably heard this many times, but
you can't actually die because you're getting

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.280
old.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.730
Instead, people often die from inactivity
or disease that comes with aging.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.920
As far as records show, old age hasn't been
scientifically recognized as a direct cause

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.469
of death.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.500
Three: People see a white light at the end
of the tunnel before they die.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.680
Give us a thumbs up if you always thought
movies only did this to be dramatic, but this

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.299
is actually true.

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.909
David Hovda from the UCLA brain injury research
center, says that most of your regions in

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.070
your brain shut down right before it's time
to go, making it hard for you to process things

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.340
visually.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.179
This is why it's only possible for people
to see a white light and nothing else.

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.890
Four: Out-of-body experiences are common in
near-death cases.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.590
Researchers in Switzerland can explain this.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.229
Apparently, when you have a near-death experience,
it causes the right side of your brain to

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.329
be stimulated giving you those sixth sense
fives.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.530
It can feel so intense that you may get the
sensation that your body is floating in space.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.229
Five: Facing death will give you transformational
potential.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.549
We understand that death is scary for many
of us, but our attitudes towards death can

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.600
play a big role on a transformational potential.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.300
Dr. Steven Taylor says that when we face death
directly and accept it for what it is, we

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.600
can surpass anxiety's and live our lives to
the fullest.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.380

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.030
