okay very good question and surprisingly

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
okay very good question and surprisingly
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.510
okay very good question and surprisingly
i would guess that if you surveyed New

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.520
i would guess that if you surveyed New
 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.070

fraction of them would actually know

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430
fraction of them would actually know
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.950

where their water comes from they might

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
where their water comes from they might
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.240
where their water comes from they might
have some vague idea that comes from

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250
have some vague idea that comes from
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.690

1,500 acres sorry 1,500 square miles of

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
1,500 acres sorry 1,500 square miles of
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.860
1,500 acres sorry 1,500 square miles of
that of that is in the Catskill

that of that is in the Catskill
 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.200
that of that is in the Catskill
Mountains and then the other 500 square

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210
Mountains and then the other 500 square
 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.630
Mountains and then the other 500 square
miles is is throughout Putnam in

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640

Westchester County the system is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680
Westchester County the system is
 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.100
Westchester County the system is
basically based on capturing rainwater

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110
basically based on capturing rainwater
 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.190
basically based on capturing rainwater
from rainfall that is moved down the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200
from rainfall that is moved down the
 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.450
from rainfall that is moved down the
mountainside and obviously gets

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
mountainside and obviously gets
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.310
mountainside and obviously gets
collected through the system of streams

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
collected through the system of streams
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.100

19 of them in total they capture that

19 of them in total they capture that
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.310
19 of them in total they capture that
water and then through a series of

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
water and then through a series of
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.739

Catskills down to New York City there is
 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.630
Catskills down to New York City there is
an elevation drop it is very very small

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640
an elevation drop it is very very small
 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.959
an elevation drop it is very very small
you know per foot per mile but it isn't

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969
you know per foot per mile but it isn't
 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.609
you know per foot per mile but it isn't
enough to keep the water moving through

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619
enough to keep the water moving through
 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.700
enough to keep the water moving through
gravitation down to the cities uh you

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710
gravitation down to the cities uh you
 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.859
gravitation down to the cities uh you
know buildings and internal pipes so

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
know buildings and internal pipes so
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.510
know buildings and internal pipes so
that's essentially where the water comes

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
that's essentially where the water comes
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.270
that's essentially where the water comes
from about ninety percent of the supply

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
from about ninety percent of the supply
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.149
from about ninety percent of the supply
the 1.5 billion gallons that come to new

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159
the 1.5 billion gallons that come to new
 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.399
the 1.5 billion gallons that come to new
york city every day comes from the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409
york city every day comes from the
 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.550
york city every day comes from the
Catskill Delaware system essentially

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560
Catskill Delaware system essentially
 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.020
Catskill Delaware system essentially
which is basically the Catskill

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030
which is basically the Catskill
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.999
which is basically the Catskill
watershed which is the one of the falls

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
watershed which is the one of the falls
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.219
watershed which is the one of the falls
east off of the Catskill Mountains and a

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
east off of the Catskill Mountains and a
 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.559
east off of the Catskill Mountains and a
Delaware watershed which falls West off

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569
Delaware watershed which falls West off
 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.330
Delaware watershed which falls West off
the Catskill Mountains and eventually

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
the Catskill Mountains and eventually
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.059
the Catskill Mountains and eventually
would have made it its way down to the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069

Delaware River were not captured in

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679
Delaware River were not captured in
 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.949
Delaware River were not captured in
these upstate reservoirs so ninety

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959
these upstate reservoirs so ninety
 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.780
these upstate reservoirs so ninety
percent comes from that source it's a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790
percent comes from that source it's a
 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.640
percent comes from that source it's a
very very clean source because of the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650
very very clean source because of the
 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.699
very very clean source because of the
relatively minor amount of development

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709
relatively minor amount of development
 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.039
relatively minor amount of development
up in that region to ten percent roughly

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049
up in that region to ten percent roughly
 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:22.250
up in that region to ten percent roughly
the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260
the

the problem is you've got to then

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049
the problem is you've got to then
 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.259
the problem is you've got to then
protect the water at its source up in

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269
protect the water at its source up in
 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.410

to build a filtration plant that's the

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389
to build a filtration plant that's the
 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.860
to build a filtration plant that's the
only way you can absolutely safeguard

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870
only way you can absolutely safeguard
 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.869
only way you can absolutely safeguard
that part of the water supply the

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879
that part of the water supply the
 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.490
that part of the water supply the
problem is of course is once you build

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500
problem is of course is once you build
 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.470
problem is of course is once you build
that filtration plant it takes pressure

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480
that filtration plant it takes pressure

at source and a filtration plant is not

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599
at source and a filtration plant is not
 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.110

certainly that would disrupt the city
