00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.760
I'm Dana Britt.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.050
I'm Jennifer Wang.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.100
I'm Laura Parody.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.450
And I'm Dalia Abbas.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.200
And we're Kid Collab!

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.437
Have you been part
of a group project

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.020
where you felt like
your printers were

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.100
doing all the work?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.450
Maybe you felt like you
were doing all of the work?

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.730
Well, so have we.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.320
I'm sick of doing all of
the group work by myself.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.460
I'm tired of always having to
delegate every single task when

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.480
it comes to group work.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.140
I'm tired, as a teacher, of
having to collect 1,000 papers

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.870
and not knowing which things
came from which student

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.210
and who did all of the work.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.860
My teammates and I,
we created Kid Collab

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.250
to help kids practice the
21st century skills that are

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.890
necessary in today's society.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.490
When each kid gets
their own information

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.470
that they have to
learn to contribute,

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.739
they have something unique
to share with their group.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:13.719

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.340
All students play
a valuable role

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.180
in being a part of the activity.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.660
So for my activity,
I was the historian.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.920
I really felt like I was
valued as a team player.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.780
And I love Kid Collab
because it merges adventure

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.790
with problem-solving.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.740
Nobody felt awkward stepping
into a leadership role.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.410
And the structure was
really clearly defined.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.710
It provided an authentic context
for collaborative learning

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.320
for students to come
together and to solve

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.400
a modern-day problem
using evidence.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.190
Hi, I'm Sarah, and I've
been a teacher for 10 years.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.940
So it was really interesting
doing this activity,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.635
seeing technology
for our group work.

00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:03.510
And one of the things
I found with group work

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.820
is that kids often
sit back and let

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.130
other people do all the work,
whereas for this, there's

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.438
not that possibility.

00:02:09.438 --> 00:02:10.979
Everyone has their
own role, and they

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.850
get to explore different
elements of those roles

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.870
as well.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.630
I thought Kid Collab did a
really good job of making sure

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.920
that all of that logistical
stuff got taken care of,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.070
but making sure that people
had substantive things

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.400
to do as well.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.640
We've created Kid
Collab so that students

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.100
will have the
opportunity to in-person

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.980
have a virtual
collaboration experience.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.290
And there are few
products out there

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.700
that are able to provide that.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.010
We don't think we have
all the answers to how

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.330
to facilitate
effective group work,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.450
but we do think we're
onto something when

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.050
we highlight what
it is that could

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.550
make group work more effective.
