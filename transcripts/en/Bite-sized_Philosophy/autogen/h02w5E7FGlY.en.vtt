00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540
thing that you can do with antisocial
 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.809
thing that you can do with antisocial
people is to group them together which

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819
people is to group them together which
 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.210
people is to group them together which
is what we do in prisons so so that's a

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220
is what we do in prisons so so that's a
 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.059
is what we do in prisons so so that's a
whole mess anyways one of the things we

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069
whole mess anyways one of the things we
 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.349
whole mess anyways one of the things we
were doing was trying to see if there

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359
were doing was trying to see if there
 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.629
were doing was trying to see if there
might be cognitive predictors of

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639
might be cognitive predictors of
 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.119
might be cognitive predictors of
antisocial behavior and so we used this

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129
antisocial behavior and so we used this
 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.369
antisocial behavior and so we used this
battery of neuropsychological tests that

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379
battery of neuropsychological tests that
 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.689
battery of neuropsychological tests that
was put together at the Montreal

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699
was put together at the Montreal
 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.909
was put together at the Montreal
Neurological Institute took about 11

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919
Neurological Institute took about 11
 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.069

hours to administer and hypothetically

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079
hours to administer and hypothetically
 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.039
hours to administer and hypothetically
assess prefrontal cortical function we

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049
assess prefrontal cortical function we
 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.600
assess prefrontal cortical function we
computerized out reduced

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610
computerized out reduced
 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.540
computerized out reduced
to about ninety minutes and then assess

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550
to about ninety minutes and then assess
 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.600
to about ninety minutes and then assess
antisocial adolescents in in Montreal

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610
antisocial adolescents in in Montreal
 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.800
antisocial adolescents in in Montreal
and found out that they did show

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810
and found out that they did show
 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.260
and found out that they did show
deficits in the problem-solving ability

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270
deficits in the problem-solving ability
 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.200

that we associated with with prefrontal

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210
that we associated with with prefrontal
 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.399
that we associated with with prefrontal
ability when I got to Harvard I thought

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:40.409
ability when I got to Harvard I thought
 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.100
ability when I got to Harvard I thought
well that's interesting we could use the

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110
well that's interesting we could use the
 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.920
well that's interesting we could use the
neuro psych battery to predict negative

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930
neuro psych battery to predict negative
 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.740
neuro psych battery to predict negative
behavior perhaps we could use it to

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750
behavior perhaps we could use it to
 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.719
behavior perhaps we could use it to
predict positive behavior so I thought

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729
predict positive behavior so I thought
 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.429
predict positive behavior so I thought
well what if we turned the neuro psych

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439
well what if we turned the neuro psych
 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.700
well what if we turned the neuro psych
battery and over and thought well can we

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710
battery and over and thought well can we
 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.769
battery and over and thought well can we
predict grades for example because you

00:04:57.769 --> 00:04:57.779
predict grades for example because you
 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:59.480
predict grades for example because you
know that's a decent thing to predict so

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490
know that's a decent thing to predict so
 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.600
know that's a decent thing to predict so
we ran a study we ran a study that

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610
we ran a study we ran a study that
 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.550
we ran a study we ran a study that
looked at Harvard kids University of

neuropsychological tests they were kind

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580
neuropsychological tests they were kind
 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.429

know so in one in one test you had there

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:22.529
know so in one in one test you had there
 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:24.050
know so in one in one test you had there
were five lights in the middle of the

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060
were five lights in the middle of the
 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.390
were five lights in the middle of the
screen and a box was associated with

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400
screen and a box was associated with
 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.490
screen and a box was associated with
each light and you had to learn by trial

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500
each light and you had to learn by trial
 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.290
each light and you had to learn by trial
and error which box was associated with

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300
and error which box was associated with
 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.029
and error which box was associated with

with each light that was one of the
 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:37.339
with each light that was one of the
tests so we took people's average score

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349
tests so we took people's average score
 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.140
tests so we took people's average score
across the tests because they seemed to

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150
across the tests because they seemed to
 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.899
across the tests because they seemed to
clump together into a single structure

you can do you can find that out

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500
you can do you can find that out
 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.959
you can do you can find that out
statistically if you take a bunch of

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:44.969
statistically if you take a bunch of
 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.969
statistically if you take a bunch of
tests you can find out how they clump

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979
tests you can find out how they clump
 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.649
tests you can find out how they clump
together statistically by looking at

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659
together statistically by looking at
 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.029
together statistically by looking at
their patterns of correlations and you

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039
their patterns of correlations and you
 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.950
their patterns of correlations and you
might get multiple clumps which is what

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960
might get multiple clumps which is what
 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.629
might get multiple clumps which is what
happens with personality research where

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639
happens with personality research where
 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.670
happens with personality research where
you get five or you might get a singular

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680
you get five or you might get a singular
 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.829
you get five or you might get a singular
clump which is what happens in cognitive

00:05:57.829 --> 00:05:57.839
clump which is what happens in cognitive
 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:00.050
clump which is what happens in cognitive
research and we got a single clump

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060
research and we got a single clump
 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.659
research and we got a single clump
essentially and then we were trying to

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669
essentially and then we were trying to
 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.179
essentially and then we were trying to
figure out if at the same time I was

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:05.189
figure out if at the same time I was
 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:06.709
figure out if at the same time I was
reading the literature on performance

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719
reading the literature on performance
 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:08.990
reading the literature on performance
prediction and there's an extensive

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000
prediction and there's an extensive
 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.490
prediction and there's an extensive
literature on performance prediction a

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500
literature on performance prediction a
 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.809
literature on performance prediction a
lot of it generated by the Armed Forces

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819
lot of it generated by the Armed Forces
 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:15.409

good predictor of long-term life success
 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.429
good predictor of long-term life success
and so here's that here's the general

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:19.439
and so here's that here's the general
 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:23.420
and so here's that here's the general
rule if your job is simple which means

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430
rule if your job is simple which means
 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.769
rule if your job is simple which means
you do the same thing every day

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:24.779
you do the same thing every day
 

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:27.079
you do the same thing every day
then IQ predicts how fast you'll learn

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:27.089
then IQ predicts how fast you'll learn
 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:29.059
then IQ predicts how fast you'll learn
the job but not how well you you do it

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:29.069
the job but not how well you you do it
 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:31.639
the job but not how well you you do it
but if your job is complex which means

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:31.649
but if your job is complex which means
 

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:33.439
but if your job is complex which means
that the demands change on an ongoing

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:33.449
that the demands change on an ongoing
 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:35.689
that the demands change on an ongoing
basis then the best predictor of success

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699
basis then the best predictor of success
 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:37.189
basis then the best predictor of success
is general cognitive ability

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199
is general cognitive ability
 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.670
is general cognitive ability
and and I learned that the general

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680
and and I learned that the general
 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.230
and and I learned that the general
cognitive ability test clumped together

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240
cognitive ability test clumped together
 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.999
cognitive ability test clumped together
into a single factor that's fluid

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009
into a single factor that's fluid
 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:46.730
into a single factor that's fluid
intelligence or IQ and then we didn't

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740
intelligence or IQ and then we didn't
 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.070
intelligence or IQ and then we didn't
know if the factor that we had found was

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080
know if the factor that we had found was
 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.159
know if the factor that we had found was
the same factor as IQ and it and we

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169
the same factor as IQ and it and we
 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:53.450
the same factor as IQ and it and we
still haven't really figured out whether

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460
still haven't really figured out whether
 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.950
still haven't really figured out whether
or not that was the case because it kind

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960
or not that was the case because it kind
 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.420
or not that was the case because it kind
of depends on how you do the analysis

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430
of depends on how you do the analysis
 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.059
of depends on how you do the analysis
but anyways I I got deeply into the

00:06:59.059 --> 00:06:59.069
but anyways I I got deeply into the
 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:00.619
but anyways I I got deeply into the
performance prediction literature and I

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:00.629
performance prediction literature and I
 

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:02.149
performance prediction literature and I
found oh well if you wanted to predict

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:02.159
found oh well if you wanted to predict
 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:03.860
found oh well if you wanted to predict
people's performance in life there's

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870
people's performance in life there's
 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.390
people's performance in life there's
there's a couple of things you need to

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400
there's a couple of things you need to
 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.709
there's a couple of things you need to
know you need to know their general

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:06.719
know you need to know their general
 

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:08.269
know you need to know their general
cognitive ability if they're going to do

cognitive ability if they're going to do
 

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:10.700
cognitive ability if they're going to do
a complex job you need to know their

a complex job you need to know their
 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.189
a complex job you need to know their

might have heard that rebranded as grit

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:15.389
might have heard that rebranded as grit
 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:18.860
might have heard that rebranded as grit

social science claims whatsoever are
 

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:51.050
social science claims whatsoever are
correct then the IQ claims are correct

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:51.060
correct then the IQ claims are correct
 

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.210
correct then the IQ claims are correct
because the IQ claims are more

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:53.220
because the IQ claims are more
 

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.360
because the IQ claims are more
psychometrically rigorous than any other

phenomena phenomenon that's been
 

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.050
phenomena phenomenon that's been
discovered by social scientists now the

discovered by social scientists now the
 

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.630

fun little fact for you

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:08.460
fun little fact for you
 

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.160
fun little fact for you
for liberals and conservatives alike

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:10.170
for liberals and conservatives alike
 

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.600
for liberals and conservatives alike
because conservatives think there's a

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:11.610
because conservatives think there's a
 

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.280
because conservatives think there's a
job for everyone if people just get off

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:13.290
job for everyone if people just get off
 

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.380
job for everyone if people just get off
their asses and get to work and liberals

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:15.390
their asses and get to work and liberals
 

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.970

think while you can train anyone to do
anything it's like no there isn't a job

anything it's like no there isn't a job
for everyone and no you can't train

and here's one of the consequences of

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:26.220
and here's one of the consequences of
 

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.580
and here's one of the consequences of
that so as I mentioned the Armed Forces

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:28.590
that so as I mentioned the Armed Forces
 

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.770
that so as I mentioned the Armed Forces
has done a lot of work on IQ and they

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:30.780
has done a lot of work on IQ and they
 

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.440
has done a lot of work on IQ and they
started back in 1919 and the reason they

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:33.450
started back in 1919 and the reason they
 

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.570
started back in 1919 and the reason they
did that was because well for obvious

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.580
did that was because well for obvious
 

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.150
did that was because well for obvious
reasons say let's say there's a war and

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160
reasons say let's say there's a war and
 

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.910
reasons say let's say there's a war and
you want to get qualified people into

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920
you want to get qualified people into
 

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.560
you want to get qualified people into
the officer positions as rapidly as

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:42.570
the officer positions as rapidly as
 

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.110
the officer positions as rapidly as
possible or you'll lose so that's a

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120
possible or you'll lose so that's a
 

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.960
possible or you'll lose so that's a
reason now the Armed Forces has

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:47.970
reason now the Armed Forces has
 

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.470
reason now the Armed Forces has
experimented with IQ test since 1919 and

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480
experimented with IQ test since 1919 and
 

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.430
experimented with IQ test since 1919 and
in the last 20 years a law was passed as

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440
in the last 20 years a law was passed as
 

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.470
in the last 20 years a law was passed as
a consequence of that analysis which was

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480
a consequence of that analysis which was
 

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.450
a consequence of that analysis which was
that it was illegal to induct anyone

00:09:59.450 --> 00:09:59.460
that it was illegal to induct anyone
 

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.340
that it was illegal to induct anyone
into the Armed Forces who had an IQ of

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:01.350
into the Armed Forces who had an IQ of
 

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.270
into the Armed Forces who had an IQ of
less than 83 now the question is why and

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:05.280
less than 83 now the question is why and
 

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.510
less than 83 now the question is why and
the answer was all of that effort put in

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:08.520
the answer was all of that effort put in
 

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.310
the answer was all of that effort put in
by the armed forces indicated that if

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320
by the armed forces indicated that if
 

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.290
by the armed forces indicated that if
you had an IQ of 83 or less there wasn't

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:12.300
you had an IQ of 83 or less there wasn't
 

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.850
you had an IQ of 83 or less there wasn't
anything that you could be trained to do

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:13.860
anything that you could be trained to do
 

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.650
anything that you could be trained to do
in the military that wasn't positively

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:15.660
in the military that wasn't positively
 

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.840
in the military that wasn't positively
counterproductive now you got to think

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:17.850
counterproductive now you got to think
 

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.420
counterproductive now you got to think
about that a because the military is

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:20.430
about that a because the military is
 

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.060
about that a because the military is
chronically desperate for people right

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:23.070
chronically desperate for people right
 

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.320
chronically desperate for people right
there it's not like they're it's not

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:24.330
there it's not like they're it's not
 

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.510
there it's not like they're it's not
like people are lining up to be inducted

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:26.520
like people are lining up to be inducted
 

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.520
like people are lining up to be inducted
right they have to go out and recruit

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:28.530
right they have to go out and recruit
 

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.230
right they have to go out and recruit
and it's not easy and so they're

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240
and it's not easy and so they're
 

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.760
and it's not easy and so they're
desperate to get their hands on every

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:31.770
desperate to get their hands on every
 

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.220
desperate to get their hands on every
body they can possibly manage and then

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:34.230
body they can possibly manage and then
 

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.740
body they can possibly manage and then
especially in wartime but also in

especially in wartime but also in
 

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.730
especially in wartime but also in
peacetime but then there was another

also set up from a policy perspective to
 

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.050
also set up from a policy perspective to
take people in the underclass let's say

middle class so there's a policy element

implication was that Jews are
 

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.710
implication was that Jews are
over-represented in positions of

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720
over-represented in positions of
 

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.450
over-represented in positions of
authority and power and and I was had

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:38.460
authority and power and and I was had
 

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.370
authority and power and and I was had
just spoken for like an hour and a half

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:40.380
just spoken for like an hour and a half
 

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.290
just spoken for like an hour and a half
and you know this guy had an axe to

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:42.300
and you know this guy had an axe to
 

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.940
and you know this guy had an axe to
grind and I thought there's no goddamn

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:43.950
grind and I thought there's no goddamn
 

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.800
grind and I thought there's no goddamn
way I'm getting into this at the moment

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:45.810
way I'm getting into this at the moment
 

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:49.010
way I'm getting into this at the moment
and so I said I said I can't answer that

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:49.020
and so I said I said I can't answer that
 

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.930
and so I said I said I can't answer that
question but that's not a very good

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940
question but that's not a very good
 

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.060
question but that's not a very good
answer so I wrote a blog post this week

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:53.070
answer so I wrote a blog post this week
 

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.770
answer so I wrote a blog post this week
and I said look here's the here's the

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:54.780
and I said look here's the here's the
 

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.680
and I said look here's the here's the
situation all right

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:56.690
situation all right
 

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.420
situation all right
Jews are over-represented in positions

00:14:59.420 --> 00:14:59.430
Jews are over-represented in positions
 

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.850
Jews are over-represented in positions
of power and authority but then let's

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:01.860
of power and authority but then let's
 

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.130
of power and authority but then let's
open her eyes a little bit and think for

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:04.140
open her eyes a little bit and think for
 

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.960
open her eyes a little bit and think for
like two or three seconds and think hey

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:05.970
like two or three seconds and think hey
 

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.060
like two or three seconds and think hey
guess what they're also over-represented

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:08.070
guess what they're also over-represented
 

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.460
guess what they're also over-represented
in positions of competence and it's not

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:10.470
in positions of competence and it's not
 

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.800
in positions of competence and it's not
like we have more geniuses than we know

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:12.810
like we have more geniuses than we know
 

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.140
like we have more geniuses than we know
what to do with and if the Jews happen

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:15.150
what to do with and if the Jews happen
 

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.880
what to do with and if the Jews happen
to be producing more of them which they

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:16.890
to be producing more of them which they
 

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.100
to be producing more of them which they
are by the way then that's a pretty good

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:19.110
are by the way then that's a pretty good
 

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.050
are by the way then that's a pretty good
thing for the rest of us so let's not

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:21.060
thing for the rest of us so let's not
 

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.970
thing for the rest of us so let's not
confuse competence with power and

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:22.980
confuse competence with power and
 

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.500
confuse competence with power and
authority even though that's a favorite

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:24.510
authority even though that's a favorite
 

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:26.420
authority even though that's a favorite
trick of the radical leftist who always

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:26.430
trick of the radical leftist who always
 

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.300
trick of the radical leftist who always
failed to make that distinction well why

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:29.310
failed to make that distinction well why
 

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.100
failed to make that distinction well why
does this over-represent

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:31.110
does this over-represent
 

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.800
does this over-represent
you know kur because it does it also

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:33.810
you know kur because it does it also
 

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.110
you know kur because it does it also
there's also over-representation in

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120
there's also over-representation in
 

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.569
there's also over-representation in
political movements including radical

00:15:38.569 --> 00:15:38.579
political movements including radical
 

00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:40.730
political movements including radical
political movements okay why

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:40.740
political movements okay why
 

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:44.509
political movements okay why
well answer one Jewish conspiracy okay

00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519
well answer one Jewish conspiracy okay
 

00:15:44.519 --> 00:15:46.819
well answer one Jewish conspiracy okay
that's not a very good answer we've had

00:15:46.819 --> 00:15:46.829
that's not a very good answer we've had
 

00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:49.550
that's not a very good answer we've had
we've used that answer before alright

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560
we've used that answer before alright
 

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.040
we've used that answer before alright
but but do we have an alternative well

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.050
but but do we have an alternative well
 

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.680
but but do we have an alternative well
here's an alternative the average

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:54.690
here's an alternative the average
 

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.560
here's an alternative the average
Ashkenazi IQ is somewhere between 110

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:57.570
Ashkenazi IQ is somewhere between 110
 

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:00.139
Ashkenazi IQ is somewhere between 110
and 115 which is about one standard

00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:00.149
and 115 which is about one standard
 

00:16:00.149 --> 00:16:02.449
and 115 which is about one standard
deviation above the population average

00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:02.459
deviation above the population average
 

00:16:02.459 --> 00:16:04.160
deviation above the population average
and so what that means is that the

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.170
and so what that means is that the
 

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:08.240
and so what that means is that the
average Ashkenazi / European Jew has an

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:08.250
average Ashkenazi / European Jew has an
 

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.449
average Ashkenazi / European Jew has an
IQ that's higher than 85% of the

00:16:11.449 --> 00:16:11.459
IQ that's higher than 85% of the
 

00:16:11.459 --> 00:16:15.470
IQ that's higher than 85% of the
population that's a lot higher now that

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480
population that's a lot higher now that
 

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.940
population that's a lot higher now that
doesn't make that much difference in the

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:16.950
doesn't make that much difference in the
 

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.490
doesn't make that much difference in the
middle of the distribution okay but

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500
middle of the distribution okay but
 

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.319
middle of the distribution okay but
geniuses don't exist at the middle of

00:16:21.319 --> 00:16:21.329
geniuses don't exist at the middle of
 

00:16:21.329 --> 00:16:23.480
geniuses don't exist at the middle of
the distribution they exist at the tails

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:23.490
the distribution they exist at the tails
 

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.550
the distribution they exist at the tails
of the distribution and you don't need

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560
of the distribution and you don't need
 

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.639
of the distribution and you don't need
much of a move at the mean to produce

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:28.649
much of a move at the mean to produce
 

00:16:28.649 --> 00:16:31.190
much of a move at the mean to produce
walloping differences at the tails and

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:31.200
walloping differences at the tails and
 

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.259
walloping differences at the tails and
the tails are important because a lot of

00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:33.269
the tails are important because a lot of
 

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:36.290
the tails are important because a lot of
where we draw we draw exceptional people

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300
where we draw we draw exceptional people
 

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.519
where we draw we draw exceptional people
from the exceptions right so here's an

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:39.529
from the exceptions right so here's an
 

00:16:39.529 --> 00:16:43.310
from the exceptions right so here's an
example of the same thing most engineers

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:43.320
example of the same thing most engineers
 

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.509
example of the same thing most engineers
are male why because men are more

00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519
are male why because men are more
 

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:49.639
are male why because men are more
interested in things and women are more

00:16:49.639 --> 00:16:49.649
interested in things and women are more
 

00:16:49.649 --> 00:16:51.860
interested in things and women are more
interested in people and you might say

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:51.870
interested in people and you might say
 

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.230
interested in people and you might say
well that's socio-cultural it's like no

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240
well that's socio-cultural it's like no
 

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.990
well that's socio-cultural it's like no
it's not and we know that because if you

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000
it's not and we know that because if you
 

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.780
it's not and we know that because if you
stack up countries by their by their

00:16:59.780 --> 00:16:59.790
stack up countries by their by their
 

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:02.630
stack up countries by their by their
egalitarian social policies which you

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:02.640
egalitarian social policies which you
 

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.640
egalitarian social policies which you
can do quite effectively and then you

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:04.650
can do quite effectively and then you
 

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.189
can do quite effectively and then you
look at the over-representation of men

00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199
look at the over-representation of men
 

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:10.120
look at the over-representation of men
in STEM fields the over-representation

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:10.130
in STEM fields the over-representation
 

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.770
in STEM fields the over-representation
increases as the countries become more

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:12.780
increases as the countries become more
 

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.520
increases as the countries become more
egalitarian so it's not socio-cultural

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:16.530
egalitarian so it's not socio-cultural
 

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:20.000
egalitarian so it's not socio-cultural
okay now men aren't that much more

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.010
okay now men aren't that much more
 

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.100
okay now men aren't that much more
interested in things than women it's one

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:22.110
interested in things than women it's one
 

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:23.750
interested in things than women it's one
standard deviation which is about the

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760
standard deviation which is about the
 

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.579
standard deviation which is about the
same difference by the way between the

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:25.589
same difference by the way between the
 

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:27.470
same difference by the way between the
population norm and the Ashkenazi Jews

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480
population norm and the Ashkenazi Jews
 

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.450
population norm and the Ashkenazi Jews
but if you're looking at the person the

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:29.460
but if you're looking at the person the
 

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.630
but if you're looking at the person the
one person in 20 or the one person in 50

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640
one person in 20 or the one person in 50
 

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.480
one person in 20 or the one person in 50
who's most who's hyper interested in

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:35.490
who's most who's hyper interested in
 

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.030
who's most who's hyper interested in
things and thus likely to become an

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:38.040
things and thus likely to become an
 

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.280
things and thus likely to become an
engineer then most of them are men

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:40.290
engineer then most of them are men
 

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.040
engineer then most of them are men
here's another example of the same thing

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:43.050
here's another example of the same thing
 

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:44.430
here's another example of the same thing
men are more

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440
men are more
 

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.909
men are more
aggressive than women now you might ask

00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919
aggressive than women now you might ask
 

00:17:47.919 --> 00:17:51.029
aggressive than women now you might ask
how much an answer that is best place to

00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039
how much an answer that is best place to
 

00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:53.009
how much an answer that is best place to
look at that is in Sweden where the

00:17:53.009 --> 00:17:53.019
look at that is in Sweden where the
 

00:17:53.019 --> 00:17:54.869
look at that is in Sweden where the
Galit Aryan policies have been laid out

00:17:54.869 --> 00:17:54.879
Galit Aryan policies have been laid out
 

00:17:54.879 --> 00:17:56.549
Galit Aryan policies have been laid out
for a long period of time and you can

00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559
for a long period of time and you can
 

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:58.799
for a long period of time and you can
you can get a more direct inference

00:17:58.799 --> 00:17:58.809
you can get a more direct inference
 

00:17:58.809 --> 00:18:01.350
you can get a more direct inference
about biology if you took a random man

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360
about biology if you took a random man
 

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.539
about biology if you took a random man
and a random woman out of the population

00:18:03.539 --> 00:18:03.549
and a random woman out of the population
 

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:05.669
and a random woman out of the population
and you had to bet on who was more

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679
and you had to bet on who was more
 

00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:07.499
and you had to bet on who was more
aggressive and you bet on the man you'd

00:18:07.499 --> 00:18:07.509
aggressive and you bet on the man you'd
 

00:18:07.509 --> 00:18:10.259
aggressive and you bet on the man you'd
be right 60% of the time so that's not

00:18:10.259 --> 00:18:10.269
be right 60% of the time so that's not
 

00:18:10.269 --> 00:18:12.240
be right 60% of the time so that's not
that much right it's it's deviates from

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:12.250
that much right it's it's deviates from
 

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.850
that much right it's it's deviates from
50/50 but it's not like ninety ten it's

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:14.860
50/50 but it's not like ninety ten it's
 

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:19.080
50/50 but it's not like ninety ten it's
60/40 okay so so what does that mean

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:19.090
60/40 okay so so what does that mean
 

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:21.869
60/40 okay so so what does that mean
well we got a tail problem here again

00:18:21.869 --> 00:18:21.879
well we got a tail problem here again
 

00:18:21.879 --> 00:18:23.820
well we got a tail problem here again
let's say that now you decide to go out

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:23.830
let's say that now you decide to go out
 

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.649
let's say that now you decide to go out
onto the extremes of aggression and you

00:18:25.649 --> 00:18:25.659
onto the extremes of aggression and you
 

00:18:25.659 --> 00:18:28.590
onto the extremes of aggression and you
identify the most aggressive one in a

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:28.600
identify the most aggressive one in a
 

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.029
identify the most aggressive one in a
hundred persons they're all men guess

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039
hundred persons they're all men guess
 

00:18:33.039 --> 00:18:36.810
hundred persons they're all men guess
who's in prison those people that's why

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:36.820
who's in prison those people that's why
 

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.450
who's in prison those people that's why
most of the people in prison are men and

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:39.460
most of the people in prison are men and
 

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.389
most of the people in prison are men and
so this is elementary part of the

00:18:42.389 --> 00:18:42.399
so this is elementary part of the
 

00:18:42.399 --> 00:18:44.009
so this is elementary part of the
problem in our society is that we don't

00:18:44.009 --> 00:18:44.019
problem in our society is that we don't
 

00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:46.409
problem in our society is that we don't
understand statistics we don't

00:18:46.409 --> 00:18:46.419
understand statistics we don't
 

00:18:46.419 --> 00:18:48.090
understand statistics we don't
understand that you can have relatively

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:48.100
understand that you can have relatively
 

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.549
understand that you can have relatively
small differences at the population

00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559
small differences at the population
 

00:18:50.559 --> 00:18:52.470
small differences at the population
level that produce walloping

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480
level that produce walloping
 

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.330
level that produce walloping
consequences at the tails of the

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:54.340
consequences at the tails of the
 

00:18:54.340 --> 00:19:00.090
consequences at the tails of the
distribution okay so back to IQ one

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:00.100
distribution okay so back to IQ one
 

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:04.110
distribution okay so back to IQ one
final thing to say about IQ the ethnic

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120
final thing to say about IQ the ethnic
 

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.930
final thing to say about IQ the ethnic
differences are difficult to dispense

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:06.940
differences are difficult to dispense
 

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.080
differences are difficult to dispense
with it's not easy to make them go away

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:10.090
with it's not easy to make them go away
 

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.360
with it's not easy to make them go away
you can say well the tests aren't

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:12.370
you can say well the tests aren't
 

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.700
you can say well the tests aren't
culture fair well here's a test of that

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:14.710
culture fair well here's a test of that
 

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.519
culture fair well here's a test of that
so imagine you you test Group A with an

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:17.529
so imagine you you test Group A with an
 

00:19:17.529 --> 00:19:19.619
so imagine you you test Group A with an
IQ test and you test Group B with an IQ

00:19:19.619 --> 00:19:19.629
IQ test and you test Group B with an IQ
 

00:19:19.629 --> 00:19:22.049
IQ test and you test Group B with an IQ
test and then you look at their actual

00:19:22.049 --> 00:19:22.059
test and then you look at their actual
 

00:19:22.059 --> 00:19:23.999
test and then you look at their actual
performance in whatever you're

00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:24.009
performance in whatever you're
 

00:19:24.009 --> 00:19:26.460
performance in whatever you're
predicting if the test was biased

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:26.470
predicting if the test was biased
 

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.889
predicting if the test was biased
against ethnic group a then it would

00:19:28.889 --> 00:19:28.899
against ethnic group a then it would
 

00:19:28.899 --> 00:19:31.710
against ethnic group a then it would
under predict their performance and that

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:31.720
under predict their performance and that
 

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.230
under predict their performance and that
doesn't happen now you could say well

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240
doesn't happen now you could say well
 

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.149
doesn't happen now you could say well
there's systemic bias in the performance

00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:36.159
there's systemic bias in the performance
 

00:19:36.159 --> 00:19:38.700
there's systemic bias in the performance
measures and the potential measures and

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:38.710
measures and the potential measures and
 

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:43.230
measures and the potential measures and
that's a possibility all right now one

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.240
that's a possibility all right now one
 

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.320
that's a possibility all right now one
other thing about that there's a real

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:46.330
other thing about that there's a real
 

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.200
other thing about that there's a real
danger in the ethnicity IQ debate and

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:49.210
danger in the ethnicity IQ debate and
 

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:52.200
danger in the ethnicity IQ debate and
they the danger is that we confuse

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.210
they the danger is that we confuse
 

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.590
they the danger is that we confuse
intelligence with value or that we

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600
intelligence with value or that we
 

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.710
intelligence with value or that we
include we we confused

00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720
include we we confused
 

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.810
include we we confused
with ya with human value that's a better

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:00.820
with ya with human value that's a better
 

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.570
with ya with human value that's a better
way of thinking about it and one of the

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:03.580
way of thinking about it and one of the
 

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.070
way of thinking about it and one of the
things that we're going to have to

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080
things that we're going to have to
 

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.140
things that we're going to have to
understand here is that that's a mistake

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:07.150
understand here is that that's a mistake
 

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:09.390
understand here is that that's a mistake
is that being more intelligent doesn't

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.400
is that being more intelligent doesn't
 

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.030
is that being more intelligent doesn't
make you a better person that's not the

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:12.040
make you a better person that's not the
 

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.950
make you a better person that's not the
case it makes me you more useful for

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:13.960
case it makes me you more useful for
 

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.590
case it makes me you more useful for
complex cognitive operations but you can

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:16.600
complex cognitive operations but you can
 

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.740
complex cognitive operations but you can
be pretty damn horrific as a genius son

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:19.750
be pretty damn horrific as a genius son
 

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:22.050
be pretty damn horrific as a genius son
of a bitch right it's morally neutral

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:22.060
of a bitch right it's morally neutral
 

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.550
of a bitch right it's morally neutral
and we also know that from the

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:23.560
and we also know that from the
 

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.960
and we also know that from the
psychometric data by the way there

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:24.970
psychometric data by the way there
 

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:26.100
psychometric data by the way there
doesn't seem to be any relationship

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.110
doesn't seem to be any relationship
 

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.810
doesn't seem to be any relationship
whatsoever between intelligence and

whatsoever between intelligence and
 

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.680
whatsoever between intelligence and
virtue and so if it does turn out that

nature and the fates do not align with
our egalitarian presuppositions which is

our egalitarian presuppositions which is
highly probable

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:37.150
highly probable
 

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.730
highly probable
we shouldn't therefore make the mistake

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:38.740
we shouldn't therefore make the mistake
 

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:42.180
we shouldn't therefore make the mistake
of assuming that if group a or person a

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:42.190
of assuming that if group a or person a
 

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.520
of assuming that if group a or person a
is lower on one of these attributes than

is lower on one of these attributes than
 

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.160
is lower on one of these attributes than
group B or person B that that is somehow

reflective of their intrinsic value as
 

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.860
reflective of their intrinsic value as
human beings that's a big mistake
