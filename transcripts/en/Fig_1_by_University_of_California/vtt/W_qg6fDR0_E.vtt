00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.210
Do you think you could go a whole week
without producing any garbage?

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.300
It's a hard thing to do.
The average American produces around

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.650
4.5 pounds of trash each day.
Almost everything in our lives is

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.050
single-use or single-packaged: bags, straws, coffee cups. But it doesn't have to be

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.970
this way. This is Lauren singer and she
lives a zero-waste life.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.140
"It wasn't like yesterday I made 4.5 pounds of trash and today makes

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.120
zero it was a gradual step-by-step thing."
Lauren has cut out all the stuff that

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.399
you can't easily compost, reuse or
recycle. And see this little mason jar

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.000
inside is all of the trash she's made in
the past four years.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.840
The U.S. is the number-one trash
producing country in the world.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.410
This means that four percent of the
world's population is responsible for

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.720
nearly twenty percent of the world's
waste. So we said M. Sanjayan, a UCLA

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.259
visiting researcher and the head of
Conservation International, to meet with

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.240
Lauren. "You would, like, freak out if you,
like, saw my life. I mean you really would."

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.590
"I was an average consumer four years ago."
"No, no... you would be freaking out." The two of them

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.630
compared their toiletry kits... "What is all this?" 
...to see if there are some simple

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.890
ways that Sanjayan could reduce his trash
impact. "I don't even know what's in here,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.547
now I'm like, 'Oh my god!'"

00:01:25.547 --> 00:01:29.867
"Toothpaste."  "Toothpaste."
"But mine's got 'Sensi-relief."

00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:31.649
"I don't even know what that means."

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.830
Lauren makes her own toothpaste and the

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.789
recipe is actually pretty easy. One
tablespoon of baking soda, two

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.979
tablespoons of coconut oil, 1/4 teaspoon
of stevia and then 15 to 20 drops of

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.030
peppermint oil. "If you wonder, you know
why is toothpaste peppermint-flavored

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.140
or cinnamon-flavored, it's not like
arbitrary, random. It's because peppermint

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.000
oil and cinnamon oil are really great
antimicrobial and antibacterial agents.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.170
so this, actually, I'll just put some
peppermint oil in water and use it as a

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.090
mouthwash.
So you just stir everything together."

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.079
"This is crazy
it really is toothpaste?"  "Yeah."

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.870
"How different is this from what I buy in the tube?" "So this won't foam up, there's

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.829
no foaming agent. Most toothpastes will
use sodium lauryl sulfate." "And why do

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.250
they do that?" "So companies do that
because they're simple shortcuts and they

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.840
think that's what people want ,but they
dictate, kind of, what people want. So for

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.380
instance, this might taste salty to you..." 
"No, actually it taste actually pretty good."

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.060
And it smells good, and it's easy, and it's a lot less expensive than

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.700
buying toothpaste. So like, I shave with
this so this is my razor and then the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.370
blades are just stainless steel like super,
super recyclable, come packaged in paper. Easy."

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.360
'OK. That I've had for a long time. But  these do get replaced and they are expensive." "I can buy 100

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.860
blades for like $20 and that's enough
for the next ten years of my life. And like

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.720
four of those are $20." "Like I could do
this, but definitely when you travel

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.400
they're going to be all over you for the blade. I have a funny feeling TSA treats you

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.330
slightly differently than they treat me.
Can you imagine if I try to bring this on a plane?"

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.430
"But they're really easy to find in
any city at any like barber shop or

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.950
whatever. So actually baking soda works
really well as deodorant and sometimes

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.540
you can just use that, but this is a mix
of shea butter, coconut oil, baking soda,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.370
arrowroot powder, and essential oils." "So
there's deodorant and there's

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.690
antiperspirant." "You should not make
yourself not sweat. It's how your body

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.819
eliminates toxins and cools itself
naturally." "Yeah but but isn't there a

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.260
practicality to this?" "Sweating can be
sexy." "I know, but you don't want, like

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.190
you can't sit on a plane with some
sweaty guy next to you. It's not going to be

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.410
sexy trust me. Like this is a genuine
challenge, right? So I don't like using

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.829
this stuff
partly because it's got aluminum as one

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:00.549
of the active ingredients." 
"You definitely should not use that at all. You should probably change that real quick."

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.591
But there isn't anything?" 
"Can you wear an undershirt?"

00:04:03.591 --> 00:04:07.090
'OK..." 
"But lots of men do that lots of women do

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.852
that." 
"Yeah, yeah. I could."

00:04:09.852 --> 00:04:15.099
"Did you make that or did you...?"
"My friend made it for me."
"OK."

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.620
"You use the same soap for as shampoo as well as soap?"
"Shampoo, soap, face wash." 
"Isn't there

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.999
like a difference?" 
"Nope...marketing. This is conditioner that I buy

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:28.449
in bulk." 
"What's in conditioner?"
"Conditioner is essentially just like a

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.039
lotion, but you can use aloe vera or
coconut oil and it works just as well." 
"So

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.060
of all these things that you've shown me,
the one that I'm really convinced about

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.719
and to be absolutely honest I would
probably incorporate into my own life

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:47.159
is the toothpaste. One, because that
tastes actually pretty good and it's easy."

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.830
There's definitely not a
one-size-fits-all way to reduce your

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.430
waste. "I think the best place to start is
just by looking at your trash and seeing

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.669
what you're already throwing away and
seeing if they're simple ways to

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.610
remediate those problems. If there's
something that you notice you're

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.750
throwing away a significant amount of,
it's as simple as doing a search on my

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.889
blog Trash as for Tossers, or a really
simple Google search asking, you know,

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.389
'What's the sustainable alternative to...'
 There's also lots of one-time

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.930
changes that can be made that have a
large-scale and long-term positive

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.550
impact. So using reusable bags, Using
reusable coffee cups. So it's just

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.599
identifying what the problems are and
then finding simple sustainable

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.259
solutions to them." And the University of
California wants to make some of these

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:34.060
simple changes too. UC is committed to
going zero waste by 2020. Across the UC

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.649
system, we've already diverted 69 percent
of our solid waste from landfills. But

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:42.219
getting all the way to zero waste,
especially at this scale is a real

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:46.779
challenge. To learn more about UC's zero
waste initiative and how you can help,
