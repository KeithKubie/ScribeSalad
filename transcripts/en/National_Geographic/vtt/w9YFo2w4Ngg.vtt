00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:02.567
MICHAEL WARE: For the
people who don't know,

00:00:02.567 --> 00:00:05.233
what's the goal
of your movement?

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:06.133
MOHAMMAD: The goal of--

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:06.967
[laughing]

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:08.233
[all laughing]

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:10.400
It's obvious that the
goal of our movement

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.767
is to overthrow the
regime and bring

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:18.066
about a democratic,
pluralistic, secular, uh--

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:18.900
MICHAEL WARE: Right.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.066
Regime change.

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.734
MOHAMMAD: Regime
change inside Iran.

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:23.200
But by what method?

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.500
MOHAMMAD: We pray God
that we can change

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.266
the regime absolutely
peacefully,

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:33.367
because we have enough martyrs.

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:38.700
120,000 of our
members and supporters

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.400
have been killed by
the regime, and we

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.000
don't want to add to this list.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.100
We are trying to
increase the support

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.133
of Iranian people inside Iran.

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.533
Mm-hm.

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.767
Very much depends on
what will happen in Iran.

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:58.100
When I first met
you in Ashraf, I mean,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.467
you had entire tank
battalions and brigades.

00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:05.367
You had a fervent belief
that through military action

00:01:05.367 --> 00:01:08.533
you could spark the
fire of revolution.

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:12.800
Have you abandoned that
now, the prospect of armed

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.100
resistance, armed revolution?

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.800
It's many years that
we have not been engaged

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.867
in any military activities--

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:20.133
MOHAMMAD: Yes.

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.000
--and that has been
publicly announced.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.200
MICHAEL WARE: OK.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.767
So why does a
political organization

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:26.667
still need to have a
paramilitary organization,

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:27.800
then?

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.066
I mean-- it has never
been a paramilitary--

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.500
MICHAEL WARE: Paramilitary--
- But--

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.633
MICHAEL WARE: Well,
you've had a political--

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:33.934
Well, that--

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:35.200
MICHAEL WARE: --face, and
you've had a military face.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.166
- There was [inaudible].
- Yes.

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.300
You were very well armed.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.400
You were very well trained.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.700
As a fighting force, you were
a very impressive organization.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.100
Exactly.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.567
You have, what, 3,800 members
still in uniform, so to speak.

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:51.200
I mean--

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.200
MICHAEL WARE: Right?

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.233
Because they're in uniform.

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:54.400
No.
MICHAEL WARE: Basically.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.667
- No.
- Not really.

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:57.066
This is not really--

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:58.433
MICHAEL WARE: What, not today?
- No, no.

00:01:58.433 --> 00:01:59.900
Actually--
- No, no.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.300
- No, they're not in uniform.
- Because once upon a--

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.333
I mean--
- There was a time that there--

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.166
- There was.
- There were.

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:04.033
But not anymore.

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:04.934
- No.
- No, no.

00:02:04.934 --> 00:02:06.433
It's now a few years.

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:09.100
MICHAEL WARE: Nonetheless,
you still have not abandoned

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.767
the notion of armed resistance.

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:14.867
Should the moment arise,
should the opportunity

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:16.133
present itself--

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:18.467
If you ask me as a
matter of principle,

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:20.967
I believe the people's
right to resistance.

00:02:20.967 --> 00:02:22.500
[inaudible]

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.133
But that's in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:26.533
That's in the
American independence.

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:28.200
You can see it everywhere.
- American Constitution.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.734
Exactly.

00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:31.266
Now he's gone all the way
to the American Constitution.

00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:32.266
(LAUGHING) So that's
a matter of principle.
