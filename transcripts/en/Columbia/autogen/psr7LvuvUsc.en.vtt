good afternoon today we're going to talk

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300
good afternoon today we're going to talk
 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.810
good afternoon today we're going to talk
about evolution or is it evolution

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820
about evolution or is it evolution
 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.279
about evolution or is it evolution
evolution this is a tough one because

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289
evolution this is a tough one because
 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.929
evolution this is a tough one because
they're more questions than answers on

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939
they're more questions than answers on
 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.929
they're more questions than answers on
this one today the questions we're going

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939
this one today the questions we're going
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.130
this one today the questions we're going
to answer or try to address let's say

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140
to answer or try to address let's say
 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.490
to answer or try to address let's say
where did viruses come from no idea just

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500
where did viruses come from no idea just
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.229
where did viruses come from no idea just
speculations where are they going no

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239
speculations where are they going no
 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.619
speculations where are they going no
idea just speculations but we have ideas

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629
idea just speculations but we have ideas
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.260
idea just speculations but we have ideas
but it's hard to predict how are they

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270
but it's hard to predict how are they
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.330
but it's hard to predict how are they
getting there that we I can tell you a

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
getting there that we I can tell you a
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.520
getting there that we I can tell you a
bit about and I can also tell you about

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
bit about and I can also tell you about
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.950
bit about and I can also tell you about
how would we know so for me that's a

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960
how would we know so for me that's a
 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.080
how would we know so for me that's a
little unsettling to not know half of

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
little unsettling to not know half of
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.310
little unsettling to not know half of
the answers that we're going to talk

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320
the answers that we're going to talk
 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.479
the answers that we're going to talk
about but that's evolution though the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
about but that's evolution though the
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.020
about but that's evolution though the
techniques of modern biology lets us get

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
techniques of modern biology lets us get
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.870
techniques of modern biology lets us get
at least halfway to the answer of some

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880
at least halfway to the answer of some
 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.039
at least halfway to the answer of some
of these questions we know that as host

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
of these questions we know that as host
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.460
of these questions we know that as host
populations multiply there are viruses

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
populations multiply there are viruses
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.490
populations multiply there are viruses
that are selected for that can infect

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
that are selected for that can infect
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.289
that are selected for that can infect
them and this has happened since the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299
them and this has happened since the
 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.050
them and this has happened since the
beginning of life we now know that new

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
beginning of life we now know that new
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.030
beginning of life we now know that new
populations emerge every day this really

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040
populations emerge every day this really
 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.609
populations emerge every day this really
wasn't something that was appreciated in

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
wasn't something that was appreciated in
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.300
wasn't something that was appreciated in
the 50s or even in the 60s we also know

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
the 50s or even in the 60s we also know
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.100
the 50s or even in the 60s we also know
that viral populations can shape the way

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110
that viral populations can shape the way
 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.440
that viral populations can shape the way
hosts evolve they can change them

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450
hosts evolve they can change them
 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.140
hosts evolve they can change them
extensively so they are a big force in

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150
extensively so they are a big force in
 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.469
extensively so they are a big force in
evolution and of course if you can't

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
evolution and of course if you can't
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.139
evolution and of course if you can't
adapt to a virus that it's particularly

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149
adapt to a virus that it's particularly
 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.690
adapt to a virus that it's particularly
lethal virus infection then you're going

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700
lethal virus infection then you're going
 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.760
lethal virus infection then you're going
to be made extinct and this is really a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770
to be made extinct and this is really a
 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.520
to be made extinct and this is really a
theoretical issue because I don't

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530
theoretical issue because I don't
 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.030
theoretical issue because I don't
believe we have any proof for any such

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040
believe we have any proof for any such
 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.780
believe we have any proof for any such
extinction caused by viruses but I'm

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
extinction caused by viruses but I'm
 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.310
extinction caused by viruses but I'm
sure it has happened over time now the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
sure it has happened over time now the
 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.999
sure it has happened over time now the
public interestingly is confronted with

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009
public interestingly is confronted with
 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.400
public interestingly is confronted with
the consequences of

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
the consequences of
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.910
the consequences of
illusion on a daily basis even though a

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920
illusion on a daily basis even though a
 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.620
illusion on a daily basis even though a
good part of the public doesn't believe

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630
good part of the public doesn't believe
 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.870
good part of the public doesn't believe
in evolution it's happening right in

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880
in evolution it's happening right in
 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.780
in evolution it's happening right in
front of them so new diseases are

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790
front of them so new diseases are
 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.150
front of them so new diseases are
emerging like AIDS which emerged in the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160
emerging like AIDS which emerged in the
 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.440
emerging like AIDS which emerged in the
80s West Nile coming to the US hepatitis

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450

is evolution so I don't understand how

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260
is evolution so I don't understand how
 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.560
is evolution so I don't understand how
you cannot believe in it when it's right

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570
you cannot believe in it when it's right
 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.140
you cannot believe in it when it's right
in front of you flu every year common

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150
in front of you flu every year common
 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.570
in front of you flu every year common
colds new common cold virus is not just

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580
colds new common cold virus is not just
 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.280
colds new common cold virus is not just
the same old ones but new ones are

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290
the same old ones but new ones are
 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.320
the same old ones but new ones are

basis drug resistance as we talked about

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020
basis drug resistance as we talked about
 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.590
basis drug resistance as we talked about
last time this is all evolution so

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600
last time this is all evolution so
 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.780
last time this is all evolution so
evolution is happening right in front of

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790
evolution is happening right in front of
 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.480
evolution is happening right in front of
us and I think part of the problem is

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490
us and I think part of the problem is
 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.250
us and I think part of the problem is
that viruses evolve faster than many

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260
that viruses evolve faster than many
 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.460
that viruses evolve faster than many
people can understand if as an

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470
people can understand if as an
 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.730
people can understand if as an
evolutionary biologist once said to me a

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740
evolutionary biologist once said to me a
 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.450
evolutionary biologist once said to me a
virus is not a cow the point is that

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460
virus is not a cow the point is that
 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.360
virus is not a cow the point is that
cows take a long time to reproduce and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370
cows take a long time to reproduce and
 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.760
cows take a long time to reproduce and
when they do they make another cow but a

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770
when they do they make another cow but a
 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.890
when they do they make another cow but a
virus reproduces very quickly and it

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900
virus reproduces very quickly and it
 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.320
virus reproduces very quickly and it
makes billions of viruses so even when

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330
makes billions of viruses so even when
 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.810
makes billions of viruses so even when
you think about how these two organisms

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820
you think about how these two organisms
 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.060
you think about how these two organisms
evolved they are very different and the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070
evolved they are very different and the
 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.160
evolved they are very different and the
other thing is that you know viruses you

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170
other thing is that you know viruses you
 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.810
other thing is that you know viruses you
can't even see so how can people believe

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820
can't even see so how can people believe
 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.690
can't even see so how can people believe
that they are evolving or that they can

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700
that they are evolving or that they can
 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.380
that they are evolving or that they can
have these effects on host populations

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390
have these effects on host populations
 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.870
have these effects on host populations
so the diversity is incredible it's

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880
so the diversity is incredible it's
 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.190
so the diversity is incredible it's
actually something I didn't appreciate

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200
actually something I didn't appreciate
 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.570
actually something I didn't appreciate
until not too long ago just how diverse

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580
until not too long ago just how diverse
 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.810
until not too long ago just how diverse
the viral is and as a consequence we are

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820
the viral is and as a consequence we are
 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.260
the viral is and as a consequence we are
just beginning to understand the forces

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270
just beginning to understand the forces
 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.210
just beginning to understand the forces
the selection forces that drive

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220
the selection forces that drive
 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.920
the selection forces that drive
evolution we'll talk a little bit about

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930
evolution we'll talk a little bit about
 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.160
evolution we'll talk a little bit about
that today why infections emerge and

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170
that today why infections emerge and
 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.380
that today why infections emerge and
next time we will talk about specific

viruses emerging today we're going to
 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.110
viruses emerging today we're going to
talk about the nuts and bolts the other

the third point there is very

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590
the third point there is very
 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.530
the third point there is very
interesting the participation of viruses

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540
interesting the participation of viruses
 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.810
interesting the participation of viruses
in the ecosystem viruses have huge roles

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820
in the ecosystem viruses have huge roles
 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.380
in the ecosystem viruses have huge roles
to play in the carbon cycles and other

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390
to play in the carbon cycles and other
 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.900
to play in the carbon cycles and other
cycles nitrogen sulfur cycles as well

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910
cycles nitrogen sulfur cycles as well
 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.700

and the turnover of
 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.620
and the turnover of
various life-forms very interesting

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630
various life-forms very interesting
 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.090
various life-forms very interesting
we're just beginning to understand this

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100
we're just beginning to understand this
 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.279
we're just beginning to understand this
and what does all this mean for our own

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289
and what does all this mean for our own
 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.790
and what does all this mean for our own
survival just think if you took away all

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800
survival just think if you took away all
 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.450
survival just think if you took away all
the viruses she can somehow do that if

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460
the viruses she can somehow do that if
 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.070
the viruses she can somehow do that if
you could take away all the viruses just

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080
you could take away all the viruses just
 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.439
you could take away all the viruses just
like that what would happen I think that

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449
like that what would happen I think that
 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.430
like that what would happen I think that
we would all perish most likely but we

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440
we would all perish most likely but we
 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.620
we would all perish most likely but we
don't know someone will model this on a

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630
don't know someone will model this on a
 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.860
don't know someone will model this on a
computer someday so what is viral

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870
computer someday so what is viral
 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.379
computer someday so what is viral
evolution it's simply the constant

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389
evolution it's simply the constant
 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.629
evolution it's simply the constant
change of a viral population in the face

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639
change of a viral population in the face
 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.550
change of a viral population in the face
of selection pressures and if this viral

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560
of selection pressures and if this viral
 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.800
of selection pressures and if this viral
population cannot adapt do we know now

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810
population cannot adapt do we know now
 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.920
population cannot adapt do we know now
it will disappear so the viruses are

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930
it will disappear so the viruses are
 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.529
it will disappear so the viruses are
engineered to be able to change and

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539
engineered to be able to change and
 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.960
engineered to be able to change and
adapt we know that they do change we've

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970
adapt we know that they do change we've
 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.159
adapt we know that they do change we've
talked about it a lot in this course

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169
talked about it a lot in this course
 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.260
talked about it a lot in this course
we'll get a little bit at the nuts and

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270
we'll get a little bit at the nuts and
 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.040
we'll get a little bit at the nuts and
bolts today diversity is amazing if you

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050
bolts today diversity is amazing if you
 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.350
bolts today diversity is amazing if you
learn one thing in this course it is

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360
learn one thing in this course it is
 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.110
learn one thing in this course it is
that they display incredible diversity

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120
that they display incredible diversity
 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.450
that they display incredible diversity
and that's the main reason why viruses

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460
and that's the main reason why viruses
 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.089
and that's the main reason why viruses
are so successful so we don't have great

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099
are so successful so we don't have great
 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.120
are so successful so we don't have great
diversity we do other things to be

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130
diversity we do other things to be
 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.399
diversity we do other things to be
successful but viruses the key is to

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409
successful but viruses the key is to
 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:38.640
successful but viruses the key is to
make a lot of viruses and eventually one

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650
make a lot of viruses and eventually one
 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.790
make a lot of viruses and eventually one
or two of those will succeed so today

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800
or two of those will succeed so today
 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.230
or two of those will succeed so today
we're going to talk about the sources of

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240
we're going to talk about the sources of
 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.529
we're going to talk about the sources of
this diversity which is mutation and

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539
this diversity which is mutation and
 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.089
this diversity which is mutation and
recombination and these are things you

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099
recombination and these are things you
 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:50.700
recombination and these are things you
already know about so much of this

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710
already know about so much of this
 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.290
already know about so much of this
should be a review for you so when we

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300
should be a review for you so when we
 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.360
should be a review for you so when we
talk about populations I also want you

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370
talk about populations I also want you
 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.649
talk about populations I also want you
to know that we're talking always about

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659
to know that we're talking always about
 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.879
to know that we're talking always about
when we talk about it evolution we're

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889
when we talk about it evolution we're
 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:04.740
when we talk about it evolution we're
always talking about populations not

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750
always talking about populations not
 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.629
always talking about populations not
individual virus particles this will

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639
individual virus particles this will
 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.999
individual virus particles this will
become more clear in a moment as when we

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009
become more clear in a moment as when we
 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.490
become more clear in a moment as when we
define a few terms so not the individual

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500
define a few terms so not the individual
 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.080
define a few terms so not the individual
particles populations are a raise of

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090
particles populations are a raise of
 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.020
particles populations are a raise of
mutants okay think of the virus

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030
mutants okay think of the virus
 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.029
mutants okay think of the virus
population as a collection of mutants

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039
population as a collection of mutants
 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.010
population as a collection of mutants
and that is what evolves not the

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020
and that is what evolves not the
 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.290
and that is what evolves not the
individual particles and again these

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300
individual particles and again these
 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.610
individual particles and again these
mutants are made in huge quantities

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620
mutants are made in huge quantities
 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.320
mutants are made in huge quantities
don't think of an individual virion as

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330
don't think of an individual virion as
 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.320
don't think of an individual virion as
an average okay we used to think this

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330
an average okay we used to think this
 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.390
an average okay we used to think this
way we used to get a sequence and we

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400
way we used to get a sequence and we
 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.399
way we used to get a sequence and we
said this is influenza virus but it's no

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409
said this is influenza virus but it's no
 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:39.839
said this is influenza virus but it's no
longer the case

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849
longer the case
 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:41.459
longer the case
so we have to always think about the

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:41.469
so we have to always think about the
 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:44.459
so we have to always think about the
population as we say we are really

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:44.469
population as we say we are really
 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:46.290
population as we say we are really
population biologists even though we

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300
population biologists even though we
 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.449
population biologists even though we
don't want to be them because that's

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:48.459
don't want to be them because that's
 

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:49.499
don't want to be them because that's
what you're measuring when you're

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:49.509
what you're measuring when you're
 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:51.689
what you're measuring when you're
studying virus infections the whole

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:51.699
studying virus infections the whole
 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:55.519
studying virus infections the whole
population and so this famous biologist

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:55.529
population and so this famous biologist
 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:58.109
population and so this famous biologist
Stephen Jay Gould said when it comes to

00:06:58.109 --> 00:06:58.119
Stephen Jay Gould said when it comes to
 

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:00.719
Stephen Jay Gould said when it comes to
viral evolution the median is not the

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:00.729
viral evolution the median is not the
 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:03.600
viral evolution the median is not the
message I don't know if any of you know

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610

who Marshall McLuhan is do they still

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:05.409
who Marshall McLuhan is do they still
 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:08.010
who Marshall McLuhan is do they still
teach him anybody know who Marshall

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020
teach him anybody know who Marshall
 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.790
teach him anybody know who Marshall
McLuhan is vision had no it's amazing

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800
McLuhan is vision had no it's amazing
 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.139
McLuhan is vision had no it's amazing
Marshall McLuhan was a guy who analyzed

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:16.149
Marshall McLuhan was a guy who analyzed
 

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:19.290
Marshall McLuhan was a guy who analyzed
media back in the 60s his famous saying

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300
media back in the 60s his famous saying
 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.679
media back in the 60s his famous saying
was the medium is the message so he said

00:07:22.679 --> 00:07:22.689
was the medium is the message so he said
 

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:25.589
was the medium is the message so he said
if you watch television it's not so much

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599
if you watch television it's not so much
 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:28.679
if you watch television it's not so much
the content on TV but it's actually the

00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:28.689
the content on TV but it's actually the
 

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:30.689
the content on TV but it's actually the
TV itself that gives you the experience

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:30.699
TV itself that gives you the experience
 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:34.409
TV itself that gives you the experience
and so even Jay cool google made a

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:34.419
and so even Jay cool google made a
 

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.359
and so even Jay cool google made a
clever take off on that the median is

00:07:36.359 --> 00:07:36.369
clever take off on that the median is
 

00:07:36.369 --> 00:07:38.100
clever take off on that the median is
not the message the median of a viral

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.110
not the message the median of a viral
 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.859
not the message the median of a viral
population is not what's important it's

00:07:40.859 --> 00:07:40.869
population is not what's important it's
 

00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:42.809
population is not what's important it's
not the average it's the entire

00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:42.819
not the average it's the entire
 

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:45.899
not the average it's the entire
population because it's the population

that provides the avenues for survival

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:48.579
that provides the avenues for survival
 

00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:50.339
that provides the avenues for survival
it could be any of the many virus

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:50.349
it could be any of the many virus
 

00:07:50.349 --> 00:07:53.219
it could be any of the many virus
particles in a yield could be the

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:53.229
particles in a yield could be the
 

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:56.519
particles in a yield could be the
survivor and even the most rare genotype

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:56.529
survivor and even the most rare genotype
 

00:07:56.529 --> 00:07:58.829

maybe the most common after a single

00:07:58.829 --> 00:07:58.839
maybe the most common after a single
 

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:01.319
maybe the most common after a single
selection event and often you don't see

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:01.329
selection event and often you don't see
 

00:08:01.329 --> 00:08:04.589
selection event and often you don't see
this and even if we try and measure it

00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599
this and even if we try and measure it
 

00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:06.779
this and even if we try and measure it
we don't see it in the laboratory but

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:06.789
we don't see it in the laboratory but
 

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:09.119
we don't see it in the laboratory but
this is happening all the time so when

00:08:09.119 --> 00:08:09.129
this is happening all the time so when
 

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:10.679
this is happening all the time so when
you think about viruses don't think

00:08:10.679 --> 00:08:10.689
you think about viruses don't think
 

00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:12.389
you think about viruses don't think
about the average think about the entire

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:12.399
about the average think about the entire
 

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:15.499
about the average think about the entire
population and what's possible from that

00:08:15.499 --> 00:08:15.509
population and what's possible from that
 

00:08:15.509 --> 00:08:19.319
population and what's possible from that
now virus evolution has four main

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:19.329
now virus evolution has four main
 

00:08:19.329 --> 00:08:24.179
now virus evolution has four main
drivers and you could almost see this as

00:08:24.179 --> 00:08:24.189
drivers and you could almost see this as
 

00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:27.629
drivers and you could almost see this as
a multiple choice question with a fifth

weighted average a large number of

00:12:58.650 --> 00:12:58.660
weighted average a large number of
 

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.049
weighted average a large number of
different individual sequences so this

00:13:01.049 --> 00:13:01.059
different individual sequences so this
 

00:13:01.059 --> 00:13:03.449
different individual sequences so this
was really never appreciated for any

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:03.459
was really never appreciated for any
 

00:13:03.459 --> 00:13:07.410
was really never appreciated for any
organism so it came as a surprise the

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:07.420
organism so it came as a surprise the
 

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.059

reason why it was discovered is because

00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:09.069
reason why it was discovered is because
 

00:13:09.069 --> 00:13:10.740

techniques were developed that could be
 

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.319
techniques were developed that could be
used to say there's a lot of variation

00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:13.329
used to say there's a lot of variation
 

00:13:13.329 --> 00:13:15.780
used to say there's a lot of variation
in this genome sequencing the genome is

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:15.790
in this genome sequencing the genome is
 

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.370
in this genome sequencing the genome is
not enough to give you a sense of the

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:17.380
not enough to give you a sense of the
 

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.340
not enough to give you a sense of the
variation so this was ahead of it

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:20.350
variation so this was ahead of it
 

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.020

today a lot of biologists don't
 

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.610
today a lot of biologists don't

species so again the virus populations

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:35.980
species so again the virus populations
 

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.010
species so again the virus populations
are dynamic distributions which means

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:38.020
are dynamic distributions which means
 

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.790
are dynamic distributions which means
they're always changing of non-identical

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:41.800
they're always changing of non-identical
 

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.860

influenza virus replicating in a Cell
 

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.240
influenza virus replicating in a Cell
the sequence is always an influenza

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:48.250
the sequence is always an influenza
 

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.620
the sequence is always an influenza
virus sequence but there's a huge

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:49.630
virus sequence but there's a huge
 

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.170
virus sequence but there's a huge
variation in what is going on the number

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:52.180
variation in what is going on the number
 

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.150
variation in what is going on the number
of progeny produced I shouldn't say the

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160
of progeny produced I shouldn't say the
 

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.310
of progeny produced I shouldn't say the
number the number of different sequences

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320
number the number of different sequences
 

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.710
number the number of different sequences
among the progeny is huge they're all

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720
among the progeny is huge they're all
 

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.050

would be recognizable as influenza virus

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:01.060
would be recognizable as influenza virus
 

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.660
would be recognizable as influenza virus
if you sequence them all but they're

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:03.670
if you sequence them all but they're
 

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.940
if you sequence them all but they're
incredibly variants and that's what we

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:05.950
incredibly variants and that's what we
 

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.360
incredibly variants and that's what we
mean by a quazy species a species had

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:09.370
mean by a quazy species a species had
 

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.380
mean by a quazy species a species had
come to to evolve to mean that in an

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:13.390
come to to evolve to mean that in an
 

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.420
come to to evolve to mean that in an
organism that can reproduce with other

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:15.430
organism that can reproduce with other
 

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.070
organism that can reproduce with other
members of the same organism and the

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:17.080
members of the same organism and the
 

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.070
members of the same organism and the
idea was that the sequence was fixed

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:20.080
idea was that the sequence was fixed
 

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.430
idea was that the sequence was fixed
with within a certain range and so this

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440
with within a certain range and so this
 

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.650
with within a certain range and so this
went way beyond that and hence it was

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:25.660
went way beyond that and hence it was
 

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.460
went way beyond that and hence it was
called a quazy species yeah okay now

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:29.470
called a quazy species yeah okay now
 

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.520
called a quazy species yeah okay now
this is a picture of a quazy species as

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:32.530
this is a picture of a quazy species as
 

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.570
this is a picture of a quazy species as
best we can do it we actually haven't

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:36.580
best we can do it we actually haven't
 

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.490
best we can do it we actually haven't
been yet able to sequence the entire

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:38.500
been yet able to sequence the entire
 

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.980
been yet able to sequence the entire
virus population and say this is the

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:40.990
virus population and say this is the
 

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.830
virus population and say this is the
quazy species because the error rate of

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:43.840
quazy species because the error rate of
 

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.900
quazy species because the error rate of
sequencing technology is still too high

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:45.910
sequencing technology is still too high
 

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.420
sequencing technology is still too high
to be able to do this we'll get there in

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:48.430
to be able to do this we'll get there in
 

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.120
to be able to do this we'll get there in
the next few years I think this is the

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:51.130
the next few years I think this is the
 

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.760
the next few years I think this is the
best we can do this is a part of an RNA

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:53.770
best we can do this is a part of an RNA
 

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.800
best we can do this is a part of an RNA
virus population obviously it's not the

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:55.810
virus population obviously it's not the
 

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.450
virus population obviously it's not the
entire population because there are less

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:57.460
entire population because there are less
 

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.610
entire population because there are less
than a hundred members here but you can

00:14:59.610 --> 00:14:59.620
than a hundred members here but you can
 

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.040
than a hundred members here but you can
see each of them is the genome and it

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.050
see each of them is the genome and it
 

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.710
see each of them is the genome and it
shows you that every genome is unique in

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720
shows you that every genome is unique in
 

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.320
shows you that every genome is unique in
this population has different changes

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:07.330
this population has different changes
 

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.910
this population has different changes
with respect to another and that's what

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:08.920
with respect to another and that's what
 

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.070
with respect to another and that's what
the different symbols mean if you take

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:11.080
the different symbols mean if you take
 

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.200
the different symbols mean if you take
an average of this population you get

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:13.210
an average of this population you get
 

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.600
an average of this population you get
the virus sequence on the bottom and

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:15.610
the virus sequence on the bottom and
 

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.570
the virus sequence on the bottom and
what's important is that that looks like

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:18.580
what's important is that that looks like
 

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.820
what's important is that that looks like
very few members of the entire

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:20.830
very few members of the entire
 

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.050
very few members of the entire
population so the average isn't really

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060
population so the average isn't really
 

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.760
population so the average isn't really
making up the entire population if you

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:26.770
making up the entire population if you
 

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.730
making up the entire population if you
sequence this genome this is the

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:29.740
sequence this genome this is the
 

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.320
sequence this genome this is the
sequence at the bottom that you will get

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:31.330
sequence at the bottom that you will get
 

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.280
sequence at the bottom that you will get
because sequencing techniques

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:33.290
because sequencing techniques
 

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.650
because sequencing techniques
aren't sensitive enough to pick up

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:35.660
aren't sensitive enough to pick up
 

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.620
aren't sensitive enough to pick up
beyond a certain amount of change now

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:37.630
beyond a certain amount of change now
 

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.629
beyond a certain amount of change now
when i was doing sequencing in the 70s

00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639
when i was doing sequencing in the 70s
 

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:43.780
when i was doing sequencing in the 70s
and aiding you could not detect anything

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:43.790
and aiding you could not detect anything
 

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.879

that was less than fifteen percent of a

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:45.889
that was less than fifteen percent of a
 

00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:48.009
that was less than fifteen percent of a
population so you always got an average

00:15:48.009 --> 00:15:48.019
population so you always got an average
 

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:49.749
population so you always got an average
which was this year we can now do better

00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759
which was this year we can now do better
 

00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:51.280
which was this year we can now do better
but as i said we can't get down to

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:51.290
but as i said we can't get down to
 

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.259
but as i said we can't get down to
individual molecules yet although we

00:15:53.259 --> 00:15:53.269
individual molecules yet although we
 

00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:57.550
individual molecules yet although we
will get there now because of this fact

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:57.560
will get there now because of this fact
 

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.439
will get there now because of this fact
that there is a quazy species and RNA

00:15:59.439 --> 00:15:59.449
that there is a quazy species and RNA
 

00:15:59.449 --> 00:16:02.139

because the nature of experiments are

00:17:35.169 --> 00:17:35.179
because the nature of experiments are

such that the cells are relatively
 

00:17:36.559 --> 00:17:39.370
such that the cells are relatively
homogeneous and so forth and so in

because you can have selections on small

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:45.650
because you can have selections on small
 

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:46.960
because you can have selections on small
populations and as you will

then you can pick up variations but the

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:44.450
then you can pick up variations but the
 

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.720
then you can pick up variations but the
the sequences you see in GenBank which

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:46.730
the sequences you see in GenBank which
 

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:49.930
the sequences you see in GenBank which
are typical of this you go on to GenBank

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:49.940
are typical of this you go on to GenBank
 

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.340
are typical of this you go on to GenBank
and you search for a viral sequence you

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:51.350
and you search for a viral sequence you
 

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.649
and you search for a viral sequence you
will get a printout and it's a little

00:18:53.649 --> 00:18:53.659
will get a printout and it's a little
 

00:18:53.659 --> 00:18:55.570

this is this is the sequence of this

00:18:57.159 --> 00:18:57.169
this is this is the sequence of this
 

00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:58.960
this is this is the sequence of this
influenza virus isolated from this

it's not the virus looked nothing like
 

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.220
it's not the virus looked nothing like
this that's what I want you to remember

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:05.230
this that's what I want you to remember
 

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.750
this that's what I want you to remember
that the sequence is just some kind of a

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760
that the sequence is just some kind of a
 

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.340
that the sequence is just some kind of a
representation that we use as a starting

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:09.350
representation that we use as a starting
 

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:14.620
representation that we use as a starting
point so the sequence again clusters

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:14.630
point so the sequence again clusters
 

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.299
point so the sequence again clusters
around an average which is what you get

00:19:16.299 --> 00:19:16.309
around an average which is what you get
 

00:19:16.309 --> 00:19:18.250
around an average which is what you get
when you use your techniques but every

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:18.260
when you use your techniques but every
 

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.460
when you use your techniques but every
genome can be different from every other

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:20.470
genome can be different from every other
 

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.750
genome can be different from every other
so it's really interesting when you

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760
so it's really interesting when you
 

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.029
so it's really interesting when you
think of it you have a sequence like

00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039
think of it you have a sequence like
 

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:27.190
think of it you have a sequence like
this and let's say you clone it when you

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200
this and let's say you clone it when you
 

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.159
this and let's say you clone it when you
clone an RNA genome as a DNA you

00:19:30.159 --> 00:19:30.169
clone an RNA genome as a DNA you
 

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.470
clone an RNA genome as a DNA you
restrict the sequence you no longer have

a quazy species you really do that DNA
 

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.840
a quazy species you really do that DNA

have a little variation because even as

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:39.650
have a little variation because even as
 

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.460
have a little variation because even as
a plasmid replicates in bacteria there

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:42.470
a plasmid replicates in bacteria there
 

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.590
a plasmid replicates in bacteria there
are some errors but nothing like the

are some errors but nothing like the
 

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.539

happen in
normal infection so this is something

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:02.660
normal infection so this is something
 

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.910

the end stage of age the viruses that
 

00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:10.210
the end stage of age the viruses that

these viruses RB are good at being

00:24:34.449 --> 00:24:34.459
these viruses RB are good at being
 

00:24:34.459 --> 00:24:36.999
these viruses RB are good at being
transmitted and these are good at

00:24:36.999 --> 00:24:37.009
transmitted and these are good at
 

00:24:37.009 --> 00:24:39.719
transmitted and these are good at
replicating extensively within the host

00:24:39.719 --> 00:24:39.729
replicating extensively within the host
 

00:24:39.729 --> 00:24:42.099
replicating extensively within the host
so what we say is that these genomes

00:24:42.099 --> 00:24:42.109
so what we say is that these genomes
 

00:24:42.109 --> 00:24:43.929
so what we say is that these genomes
have passed through a bottleneck and

00:24:43.929 --> 00:24:43.939
have passed through a bottleneck and
 

00:24:43.939 --> 00:24:46.839
have passed through a bottleneck and
only a few of the many many genomes that

00:24:46.839 --> 00:24:46.849
only a few of the many many genomes that
 

00:24:46.849 --> 00:24:49.269
only a few of the many many genomes that
are present have passed on to the new

00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279
are present have passed on to the new
 

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:53.709
are present have passed on to the new
host so the virions that eventually

00:24:53.709 --> 00:24:53.719
host so the virions that eventually
 

00:24:53.719 --> 00:24:57.459
host so the virions that eventually
cause the immunosuppression are in fact

00:24:57.459 --> 00:24:57.469
cause the immunosuppression are in fact
 

00:24:57.469 --> 00:25:00.519
cause the immunosuppression are in fact
not the ones that are the best to travel

00:25:00.519 --> 00:25:00.529
not the ones that are the best to travel
 

00:25:00.529 --> 00:25:02.289
not the ones that are the best to travel
from host to host which is shown by

00:25:02.289 --> 00:25:02.299
from host to host which is shown by
 

00:25:02.299 --> 00:25:04.239
from host to host which is shown by
these first two bullet points here

00:25:04.239 --> 00:25:04.249
these first two bullet points here
 

00:25:04.249 --> 00:25:06.339
these first two bullet points here
alright so that's what that's an example

00:25:06.339 --> 00:25:06.349
alright so that's what that's an example
 

00:25:06.349 --> 00:25:09.099
alright so that's what that's an example
of what I mean by selection from a very

00:25:09.099 --> 00:25:09.109
of what I mean by selection from a very
 

00:25:09.109 --> 00:25:14.709
of what I mean by selection from a very
large population yeah the earlier I said

00:25:14.709 --> 00:25:14.719
large population yeah the earlier I said
 

00:25:14.719 --> 00:25:18.519
large population yeah the earlier I said
that you can make various organisms with

00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:18.529
that you can make various organisms with
 

00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:20.739
that you can make various organisms with
a lower error rate and they don't do

00:25:20.739 --> 00:25:20.749
a lower error rate and they don't do
 

00:25:20.749 --> 00:25:23.859
a lower error rate and they don't do
well so if AG increased mutation rates

00:25:23.859 --> 00:25:23.869
well so if AG increased mutation rates
 

00:25:23.869 --> 00:25:27.459
well so if AG increased mutation rates
are selected for during evolution so not

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:27.469
are selected for during evolution so not
 

00:25:27.469 --> 00:25:29.379
are selected for during evolution so not
only do we select for mutants but we

00:25:29.379 --> 00:25:29.389
only do we select for mutants but we
 

00:25:29.389 --> 00:25:32.739
only do we select for mutants but we
select for the ability to make them it's

00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:32.749
select for the ability to make them it's
 

00:25:32.749 --> 00:25:34.599
select for the ability to make them it's
very important so you can engineer

00:25:34.599 --> 00:25:34.609
very important so you can engineer
 

00:25:34.609 --> 00:25:37.029
very important so you can engineer
mutations and viral polymerase is for

00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039
mutations and viral polymerase is for
 

00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:40.769
mutations and viral polymerase is for
example and these changes can reduce the

00:25:40.769 --> 00:25:40.779
example and these changes can reduce the
 

00:25:40.779 --> 00:25:44.109
example and these changes can reduce the
incorporation of errors these we call

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:44.119
incorporation of errors these we call
 

00:25:44.119 --> 00:25:45.849
incorporation of errors these we call
anti mutators also been done in

00:25:45.849 --> 00:25:45.859
anti mutators also been done in
 

00:25:45.859 --> 00:25:49.089
anti mutators also been done in
organisms like e.coli and what's learned

00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:49.099
organisms like e.coli and what's learned
 

00:25:49.099 --> 00:25:52.449
organisms like e.coli and what's learned
from these studies of these mutants they

00:25:52.449 --> 00:25:52.459
from these studies of these mutants they
 

00:25:52.459 --> 00:25:54.939
from these studies of these mutants they
don't have a selective advantage when

00:25:54.939 --> 00:25:54.949
don't have a selective advantage when
 

00:25:54.949 --> 00:25:57.519
don't have a selective advantage when
you mix together say a wild-type virus

00:25:57.519 --> 00:25:57.529
you mix together say a wild-type virus
 

00:25:57.529 --> 00:26:00.069
you mix together say a wild-type virus
and a virus with an anti mutator

00:26:00.069 --> 00:26:00.079
and a virus with an anti mutator
 

00:26:00.079 --> 00:26:02.289
and a virus with an anti mutator
together and you ask in a cell culture

00:26:02.289 --> 00:26:02.299
together and you ask in a cell culture
 

00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:04.269
together and you ask in a cell culture
which one wins an animal which one wins

00:26:04.269 --> 00:26:04.279
which one wins an animal which one wins
 

00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:09.309
which one wins an animal which one wins
these viruses with reduced with

00:26:09.309 --> 00:26:09.319
these viruses with reduced with
 

00:26:09.319 --> 00:26:11.829
these viruses with reduced with
increased fidelity just don't do well so

00:26:11.829 --> 00:26:11.839
increased fidelity just don't do well so
 

00:26:11.839 --> 00:26:13.809
increased fidelity just don't do well so
lower rates are neither invent Aegis nor

00:26:13.809 --> 00:26:13.819
lower rates are neither invent Aegis nor
 

00:26:13.819 --> 00:26:15.909
lower rates are neither invent Aegis nor
selected for those mutated viruses are

00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919
selected for those mutated viruses are
 

00:26:15.919 --> 00:26:17.799
selected for those mutated viruses are
never selected for in any experiments

00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:17.809
never selected for in any experiments
 

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:19.719
never selected for in any experiments
and often these viruses are less

00:26:19.719 --> 00:26:19.729
and often these viruses are less
 

00:26:19.729 --> 00:26:21.549
and often these viruses are less
pathogenic there's an excellent example

00:26:21.549 --> 00:26:21.559
pathogenic there's an excellent example
 

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:25.629
pathogenic there's an excellent example
in polio a single amino acid change in

00:26:25.629 --> 00:26:25.639
in polio a single amino acid change in
 

00:26:25.639 --> 00:26:27.549
in polio a single amino acid change in
the viral RNA polymerase which makes it

00:26:27.549 --> 00:26:27.559
the viral RNA polymerase which makes it
 

00:26:27.559 --> 00:26:32.889
the viral RNA polymerase which makes it
make less fewer errors that mutation

00:26:32.889 --> 00:26:32.899
make less fewer errors that mutation
 

00:26:32.899 --> 00:26:34.779
make less fewer errors that mutation
makes the virus less pathogenic and you

00:26:34.779 --> 00:26:34.789
makes the virus less pathogenic and you
 

00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:36.579
makes the virus less pathogenic and you
can't it cannot compete with wild-type

00:26:36.579 --> 00:26:36.589
can't it cannot compete with wild-type
 

00:26:36.589 --> 00:26:39.669
can't it cannot compete with wild-type
virus so increased mutations rates have

00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679
virus so increased mutations rates have
 

00:26:39.679 --> 00:26:40.090
virus so increased mutations rates have
been so

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:40.100
been so
 

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.460
been so
elected for an hour positive force in

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:42.470
elected for an hour positive force in
 

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.940
elected for an hour positive force in
virus evolution so many people think of

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:45.950
virus evolution so many people think of
 

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.070
virus evolution so many people think of
mutation is a bad thing but what I want

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080
mutation is a bad thing but what I want
 

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.130
mutation is a bad thing but what I want
you to understand is that for viruses

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:51.140
you to understand is that for viruses
 

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:52.690
you to understand is that for viruses
which we're talking about today they are

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:52.700
which we're talking about today they are
 

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.669
which we're talking about today they are
essential you have to make mutations

00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:54.679
essential you have to make mutations
 

00:26:54.679 --> 00:26:57.250
essential you have to make mutations
otherwise you can't survive and of

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:57.260
otherwise you can't survive and of
 

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.810
otherwise you can't survive and of
course in all other organism it's the

00:26:58.810 --> 00:26:58.820
course in all other organism it's the
 

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.200
course in all other organism it's the
same just that the rate is much lower

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:01.210
same just that the rate is much lower
 

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.500
same just that the rate is much lower
now the amount of mutation that a

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:04.510
now the amount of mutation that a
 

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.620
now the amount of mutation that a
organism or a virus can sustain or

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:07.630
organism or a virus can sustain or
 

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:10.409
organism or a virus can sustain or
withstand is called the error threshold

00:27:10.409 --> 00:27:10.419
withstand is called the error threshold
 

00:27:10.419 --> 00:27:14.620
withstand is called the error threshold
the capacity to make a lot of mutants is

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:14.630
the capacity to make a lot of mutants is
 

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:17.020
the capacity to make a lot of mutants is
an advantage as we have just told but

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:17.030
an advantage as we have just told but
 

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.230
an advantage as we have just told but
there is a point where you have

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:19.240
there is a point where you have
 

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.539
there is a point where you have
selection and survival balanced alright

00:27:22.539 --> 00:27:22.549
selection and survival balanced alright
 

00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:24.640
selection and survival balanced alright
so the fidelity in the mutation rate

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:24.650
so the fidelity in the mutation rate
 

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:26.230
so the fidelity in the mutation rate
have to be in balance with one another

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240
have to be in balance with one another
 

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.470
have to be in balance with one another
and in fact that mutation in polio

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:29.480
and in fact that mutation in polio
 

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.990
and in fact that mutation in polio
polymerase that I just talked about was

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000
polymerase that I just talked about was
 

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.909
polymerase that I just talked about was
selected as a consequence of this error

00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919
selected as a consequence of this error
 

00:27:33.919 --> 00:27:35.440
selected as a consequence of this error
threshold I'll tell you about that in a

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:35.450
threshold I'll tell you about that in a
 

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:38.529
threshold I'll tell you about that in a
moment so the limit is called the error

00:27:38.529 --> 00:27:38.539
moment so the limit is called the error
 

00:27:38.539 --> 00:27:40.630
moment so the limit is called the error
threshold it's the point beyond which

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640
threshold it's the point beyond which
 

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.120
threshold it's the point beyond which
you cannot go in terms of the frequency

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:43.130
you cannot go in terms of the frequency
 

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.070
you cannot go in terms of the frequency
of mutations if you go beyond it you are

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.080
of mutations if you go beyond it you are
 

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.279
of mutations if you go beyond it you are
dead if you live too far below it you

00:27:48.279 --> 00:27:48.289
dead if you live too far below it you
 

00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:50.110
dead if you live too far below it you
might not be able to survive because you

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120
might not be able to survive because you
 

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.720
might not be able to survive because you
don't produce enough variability so you

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:52.730
don't produce enough variability so you
 

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.180
don't produce enough variability so you
have to be at or near the error

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:55.190
have to be at or near the error
 

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:56.980
have to be at or near the error
threshold but you can't be above it

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:56.990
threshold but you can't be above it
 

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:58.270
threshold but you can't be above it
because that means you have too many

00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:58.280
because that means you have too many
 

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.220
because that means you have too many
mutations in your genome and you won't

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:00.230
mutations in your genome and you won't
 

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.980
mutations in your genome and you won't
make viable viruses so remember in a

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:02.990
make viable viruses so remember in a
 

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.680
make viable viruses so remember in a
genome of ten thousand bases you can you

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:05.690
genome of ten thousand bases you can you
 

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:07.270
genome of ten thousand bases you can you
can only sustain a certain number of

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:07.280
can only sustain a certain number of
 

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.730
can only sustain a certain number of
mutations otherwise the virus will not

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:09.740
mutations otherwise the virus will not
 

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.230
mutations otherwise the virus will not
be viable that number is the error

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:11.240
be viable that number is the error
 

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.919
be viable that number is the error
threshold so RNA virus has evolved very

00:28:14.919 --> 00:28:14.929
threshold so RNA virus has evolved very
 

00:28:14.929 --> 00:28:17.169
threshold so RNA virus has evolved very
close to it I'm going to show you some

00:28:17.169 --> 00:28:17.179
close to it I'm going to show you some
 

00:28:17.179 --> 00:28:20.620
close to it I'm going to show you some
data for that in a minute and DNA

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:20.630
data for that in a minute and DNA
 

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.930
data for that in a minute and DNA
viruses do not they evolved far below

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:22.940
viruses do not they evolved far below
 

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.760
viruses do not they evolved far below
their error threshold so that's why

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:24.770
their error threshold so that's why
 

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.950
their error threshold so that's why
they're a little bit less a lot less

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960
they're a little bit less a lot less
 

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:31.299
they're a little bit less a lot less
successful than RNA viruses so here's an

00:28:31.299 --> 00:28:31.309
successful than RNA viruses so here's an
 

00:28:31.309 --> 00:28:34.060
successful than RNA viruses so here's an
example of an experiment using a DNA

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:34.070
example of an experiment using a DNA
 

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:37.470
example of an experiment using a DNA
virus we infect cells and then we

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:37.480
virus we infect cells and then we
 

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.880
virus we infect cells and then we
affects those with the DNA virus and

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:39.890
affects those with the DNA virus and
 

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:43.330
affects those with the DNA virus and
then we add a base analogue which in

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:43.340
then we add a base analogue which in
 

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:47.830
then we add a base analogue which in
this case is five azasite adine and this

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840
this case is five azasite adine and this
 

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.770
this case is five azasite adine and this
is incorporated as a see into DNA it's a

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:50.780
is incorporated as a see into DNA it's a
 

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.950
is incorporated as a see into DNA it's a
modified see residue but when it's time

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:53.960
modified see residue but when it's time
 

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.340
modified see residue but when it's time
to copy it it looks like a t2 the

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:57.350
to copy it it looks like a t2 the
 

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:00.250
to copy it it looks like a t2 the
polymerase not a see so the polymerase

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:00.260
polymerase not a see so the polymerase
 

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.639
polymerase not a see so the polymerase
puts in an a instead of G because as the

00:29:03.639 --> 00:29:03.649
puts in an a instead of G because as the
 

00:29:03.649 --> 00:29:05.529
puts in an a instead of G because as the
polymerase to make more mistakes than it

00:29:05.529 --> 00:29:05.539
polymerase to make more mistakes than it
 

00:29:05.539 --> 00:29:07.450
polymerase to make more mistakes than it
normally would all right so the

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:07.460
normally would all right so the
 

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.909
normally would all right so the
structure of this base is such that it's

00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919
structure of this base is such that it's
 

00:29:09.919 --> 00:29:12.250
structure of this base is such that it's
recognized as a tee when it comes to

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:12.260
recognized as a tee when it comes to
 

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.220
recognized as a tee when it comes to
templating when you do this experiment

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:15.230
templating when you do this experiment
 

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.649
templating when you do this experiment
the mutation rate increases by several

00:29:17.649 --> 00:29:17.659
the mutation rate increases by several
 

00:29:17.659 --> 00:29:19.539
the mutation rate increases by several
orders of magnitude ten hundred a

00:29:19.539 --> 00:29:19.549
orders of magnitude ten hundred a
 

00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:22.930
orders of magnitude ten hundred a
thousand fold for a DNA virus so in

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:22.940
thousand fold for a DNA virus so in
 

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.610
thousand fold for a DNA virus so in
other words by adding this analog you

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:24.620
other words by adding this analog you
 

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.580
other words by adding this analog you
can really increase the mutation rate

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:26.590
can really increase the mutation rate
 

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:29.669
can really increase the mutation rate
but you do this with an RNA virus the

00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679
but you do this with an RNA virus the
 

00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:32.409
but you do this with an RNA virus the
error frequency only increases two or

00:29:32.409 --> 00:29:32.419
error frequency only increases two or
 

00:29:32.419 --> 00:29:34.539
error frequency only increases two or
three fold as compared to two or three

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:34.549
three fold as compared to two or three
 

00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:36.880
three fold as compared to two or three
orders of magnitude so these viruses

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:36.890
orders of magnitude so these viruses
 

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.039
orders of magnitude so these viruses
can't make any more mutations well they

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:39.049
can't make any more mutations well they
 

00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:43.570
can't make any more mutations well they
probably do but they're dead so adding

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:43.580
probably do but they're dead so adding
 

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.880
probably do but they're dead so adding

would make the errors go at a higher
 

00:30:35.059 --> 00:30:36.700
would make the errors go at a higher
frequency and would basically and

remember the drug pushes the virus over

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:10.270
remember the drug pushes the virus over
 

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:18.600

the error threshold the idea the

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:18.610
the error threshold the idea the
 

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.450
the error threshold the idea the
mutations increase the fidelity of the

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:21.460
mutations increase the fidelity of the
 

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.060
mutations increase the fidelity of the
polymerase so the mutation is that one

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:24.070
polymerase so the mutation is that one
 

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:26.010
polymerase so the mutation is that one
of the mutations is a single amino acid

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:26.020
of the mutations is a single amino acid
 

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.840
of the mutations is a single amino acid
change in the viral / malays polymerase

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:27.850
change in the viral / malays polymerase
 

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.930
change in the viral / malays polymerase
that makes it less error-prone so it

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:30.940
that makes it less error-prone so it
 

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.270
that makes it less error-prone so it
lowers the error thresh or lower it

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:33.280
lowers the error thresh or lower it
 

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.870
lowers the error thresh or lower it
moves the error threshold so that the

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880
moves the error threshold so that the
 

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.450
moves the error threshold so that the
virus can now accommodate what the drug

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:39.460
virus can now accommodate what the drug
 

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.220
virus can now accommodate what the drug
does so the drug can no longer push it

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:41.230
does so the drug can no longer push it
 

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.260
does so the drug can no longer push it
over the error threshold I guess it's

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:43.270
over the error threshold I guess it's
 

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.600
over the error threshold I guess it's
raised the error threshold so that the

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:45.610
raised the error threshold so that the
 

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:47.310
raised the error threshold so that the
virus lives at the error threshold

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320
virus lives at the error threshold
 

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.530
virus lives at the error threshold
initially the drug pushes it over and

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:49.540
initially the drug pushes it over and
 

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.200
initially the drug pushes it over and
kills it but now this mutation raises

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:52.210
kills it but now this mutation raises
 

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:54.060
kills it but now this mutation raises
the bar so the drug can't push it over

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:54.070
the bar so the drug can't push it over
 

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:55.440
the bar so the drug can't push it over
that's why it's resistant in fact that

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:55.450
that's why it's resistant in fact that
 

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.080
that's why it's resistant in fact that

you about that has been used to show

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:00.460
you about that has been used to show
 

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.000
you about that has been used to show
that viruses with more faithful blue

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:03.010
that viruses with more faithful blue
 

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:08.100
that viruses with more faithful blue
races cannot compete alright I mentioned

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:08.110

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.830
races cannot compete alright I mentioned
a genetic bottleneck before so let's

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840
a genetic bottleneck before so let's
 

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.620
a genetic bottleneck before so let's
talk a little bit about that when you

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:13.630
talk a little bit about that when you
 

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.660
talk a little bit about that when you
put selection pressures on small

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:15.670
put selection pressures on small
 

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:19.920
put selection pressures on small
populations this results in the loss of

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:19.930
populations this results in the loss of
 

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.590
populations this results in the loss of
diversity and the accumulation of non

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600
diversity and the accumulation of non
 

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.030
diversity and the accumulation of non
selective mutations this often happens

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:24.040
selective mutations this often happens
 

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.070
selective mutations this often happens
in a laboratory when your viruses are

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080
in a laboratory when your viruses are
 

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.130
in a laboratory when your viruses are
not as diverse as they are in a host so

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:29.140
not as diverse as they are in a host so
 

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.140
not as diverse as they are in a host so
for example to do this kind of

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:31.150
for example to do this kind of
 

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:33.360
for example to do this kind of
experiment we take a single RNA virus we

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:33.370
experiment we take a single RNA virus we
 

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:35.700
experiment we take a single RNA virus we
do a plaque assay we pick a plaque and

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:35.710
do a plaque assay we pick a plaque and
 

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:38.550
do a plaque assay we pick a plaque and
we grow up the virus from that plaque

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:38.560
we grow up the virus from that plaque
 

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.790
we grow up the virus from that plaque
and then we plaque it again and pick

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:41.800
and then we plaque it again and pick
 

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.950
and then we plaque it again and pick
another plaque and we keep doing this

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:43.960
another plaque and we keep doing this
 

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.660
another plaque and we keep doing this
over and over again so here's a

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:45.670
over and over again so here's a
 

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:49.770
over and over again so here's a
schematic of that so you plaque out your

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:49.780
schematic of that so you plaque out your
 

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.320
schematic of that so you plaque out your
virus you pick a single plaque and then

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:52.330
virus you pick a single plaque and then
 

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:53.940
virus you pick a single plaque and then
you could just directly plaque it again

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:53.950
you could just directly plaque it again
 

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:56.130
you could just directly plaque it again
and so forth you keep doing this so

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:56.140
and so forth you keep doing this so
 

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.050
and so forth you keep doing this so
these are very restricted populations

00:32:58.050 --> 00:32:58.060
these are very restricted populations
 

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.000
these are very restricted populations
because they're only a few thousand

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.010
because they're only a few thousand
 

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.120
because they're only a few thousand
viruses in each plaque so the quazy

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:03.130
viruses in each plaque so the quazy
 

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:05.190
viruses in each plaque so the quazy
species is really restricted so what you

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200
species is really restricted so what you
 

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.800
species is really restricted so what you
get is a bottleneck because you restrict

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:07.810
get is a bottleneck because you restrict
 

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:09.660
get is a bottleneck because you restrict
the virus to the progeny of a single

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:09.670
the virus to the progeny of a single
 

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:11.460
the virus to the progeny of a single
plaque and it's not enough variation in

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:11.470
plaque and it's not enough variation in
 

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:14.310
plaque and it's not enough variation in
that plaque to make the virus healthy so

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320
that plaque to make the virus healthy so
 

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.200
that plaque to make the virus healthy so
a few thousand progeny viruses derived

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:16.210
a few thousand progeny viruses derived
 

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.150
a few thousand progeny viruses derived
from a single virus the initial virus

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:18.160
from a single virus the initial virus
 

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.130
from a single virus the initial virus
that you plaque so here's the little

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:20.140
that you plaque so here's the little
 

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.310
that you plaque so here's the little
illustration of that parent population

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.320
illustration of that parent population
 

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.010
illustration of that parent population
of viruses you have a bottleneck you

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:26.020
of viruses you have a bottleneck you
 

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.320
of viruses you have a bottleneck you
only get a few surviving individuals and

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:28.330
only get a few surviving individuals and
 

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.840
only get a few surviving individuals and
those go on to seed the next generation

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:30.850
those go on to seed the next generation
 

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:33.170
those go on to seed the next generation
this would be better if there were a

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:33.180
this would be better if there were a
 

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:36.000
this would be better if there were a
thousand different colored balls in here

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:36.010
thousand different colored balls in here
 

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:37.680
thousand different colored balls in here
right and then you would shake out a few

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:37.690
right and then you would shake out a few
 

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:39.090
right and then you would shake out a few
colors and then those colors would

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:39.100
colors and then those colors would
 

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:42.000
colors and then those colors would
predominate but this was written for

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:42.010
predominate but this was written for
 

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.700
predominate but this was written for
non-viral situation so it's not as good

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:44.710
non-viral situation so it's not as good
 

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.650
non-viral situation so it's not as good
so that's what is a genetic bottleneck

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:46.660
so that's what is a genetic bottleneck
 

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:48.630
so that's what is a genetic bottleneck
you are restricting the diversity of the

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:48.640
you are restricting the diversity of the
 

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.550
you are restricting the diversity of the

passages so what happens in practicality

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:53.860
passages so what happens in practicality
 

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:57.090
passages so what happens in practicality
is if you do this 20 to 30 times you

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:57.100
is if you do this 20 to 30 times you
 

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.680
is if you do this 20 to 30 times you
will end up with a virus that can barely

00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:58.690
will end up with a virus that can barely
 

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:01.560
will end up with a virus that can barely
grow because the genetic variation is so

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:01.570
grow because the genetic variation is so
 

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:05.130
grow because the genetic variation is so
low that these viruses are not able to

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:05.140
low that these viruses are not able to
 

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.260
low that these viruses are not able to
propagate under different conditions so

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:07.270
propagate under different conditions so
 

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:08.820
propagate under different conditions so
they're markedly less 50 in the original

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:08.830
they're markedly less 50 in the original
 

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:11.640
they're markedly less 50 in the original
population now the environment is

away so the answer is Muller's ratchet

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:26.880

viruses were studied in this way that
 

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:34.560

viruses may quazy species they exist at
the loop error threshold and that's

the loop error threshold and that's
 

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.380
the loop error threshold and that's
important for survival if we restrict

many mutations accumulate that fitness

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:12.190
many mutations accumulate that fitness

many mutations accumulate that fitness
decreases so there's very little

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:13.420

over again you have a limited population
 

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:22.050
over again you have a limited population
and you get a lot of mutations

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:22.060
and you get a lot of mutations
 

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.060

eventually they they kill the virus more
 

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:28.620
eventually they they kill the virus more
or less because there isn't a huge pool

so there it's a ratchet because of the

00:35:36.839 --> 00:35:36.849
so there it's a ratchet because of the

this mechanical metaphor each mutation
works like a ratchet which allows the

this is a ratchet you turn this knob you
 

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:48.030
this is a ratchet you turn this knob you
push the gear forward it can't go back

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.040
push the gear forward it can't go back
 

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.460
push the gear forward it can't go back
because it has this lock here so each

because it has this lock here so each
round of error prone replication works

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:52.450
round of error prone replication works
 

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:55.500
round of error prone replication works
like a ratchet and adds mutation at

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:55.510
like a ratchet and adds mutation at
 

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:57.780
like a ratchet and adds mutation at
every replication cycle and you can't

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:57.790
every replication cycle and you can't
 

00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:59.609
every replication cycle and you can't
remove the deleterious ones because you

00:35:59.609 --> 00:35:59.619
remove the deleterious ones because you
 

00:35:59.619 --> 00:36:01.470
remove the deleterious ones because you
have a very restricted population of

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:01.480
have a very restricted population of
 

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:06.450
have a very restricted population of
viruses so this is what we've done in

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:06.460
viruses so this is what we've done in
 

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.760
viruses so this is what we've done in
that experiment so here we start out

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:08.770
that experiment so here we start out
 

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:10.980
that experiment so here we start out
with an initiative initial population of

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:10.990
with an initiative initial population of
 

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:14.280
with an initiative initial population of
genomes if you do a plaque purification

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:14.290
genomes if you do a plaque purification
 

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:20.010
genomes if you do a plaque purification
say you now restrict the new viruses

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:20.020
say you now restrict the new viruses
 

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.329
say you now restrict the new viruses
that grow up to something that looks

00:36:21.329 --> 00:36:21.339
that grow up to something that looks
 

00:36:21.339 --> 00:36:23.880
that grow up to something that looks
like this they will all have the these

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:23.890
like this they will all have the these
 

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:26.010
like this they will all have the these
three changes and they have a few others

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:26.020
three changes and they have a few others
 

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.400
three changes and they have a few others
but if you keep applying the bottleneck

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:29.410
but if you keep applying the bottleneck
 

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:30.960
but if you keep applying the bottleneck
which in this case is the plaque the

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:30.970
which in this case is the plaque the
 

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:33.089
which in this case is the plaque the
plaque passage you will have

00:36:33.089 --> 00:36:33.099
plaque passage you will have
 

00:36:33.099 --> 00:36:35.400
plaque passage you will have
accumulations of mutations but not a big

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:35.410
accumulations of mutations but not a big
 

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.920
accumulations of mutations but not a big
enough pool of viruses to correct those

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:37.930
enough pool of viruses to correct those
 

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:40.470
enough pool of viruses to correct those
mutations so as a result you lose

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480
mutations so as a result you lose
 

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.960
mutations so as a result you lose
infectivity so this may seem

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:42.970
infectivity so this may seem
 

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:45.210
infectivity so this may seem
counterintuitive to you but in practice

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:45.220
counterintuitive to you but in practice
 

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.010
counterintuitive to you but in practice
it works we have seen this happen in the

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:47.020
it works we have seen this happen in the
 

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:50.370
it works we have seen this happen in the
laboratory here are some examples of

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:50.380
laboratory here are some examples of
 

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.440
laboratory here are some examples of
fitness decline doing to bottleneck

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:52.450
fitness decline doing to bottleneck
 

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:54.300

decrease in fitness so yeah you have to

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440
decrease in fitness so yeah you have to
 

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.230
decrease in fitness so yeah you have to
keep this in mind if you are doing a lot

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240
keep this in mind if you are doing a lot
 

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.150
keep this in mind if you are doing a lot
of passages which you may want to do to

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160
of passages which you may want to do to
 

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.770
of passages which you may want to do to
adapt viruses to different kinds of

adapt viruses to different kinds of
 

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:17.180
adapt viruses to different kinds of
cells but at some point you have to

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:17.190
cells but at some point you have to
 

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:21.720
cells but at some point you have to
relieve the bottleneck now in the real

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:21.730
relieve the bottleneck now in the real
 

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:24.660
relieve the bottleneck now in the real
world there are often infections that

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:24.670
world there are often infections that
 

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:28.079
world there are often infections that
impose bottlenecks so the the key would

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:28.089
impose bottlenecks so the the key would
 

00:37:28.089 --> 00:37:29.970
impose bottlenecks so the the key would
be infection by a limited virus

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:29.980
be infection by a limited virus
 

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.910
be infection by a limited virus
population and if you get infected with

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:32.920
population and if you get infected with
 

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.160
population and if you get infected with
small droplets of a virus produced by

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:35.170
small droplets of a virus produced by
 

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:36.569
small droplets of a virus produced by
someone else that's the bottleneck

00:37:36.569 --> 00:37:36.579
someone else that's the bottleneck
 

00:37:36.579 --> 00:37:37.890
someone else that's the bottleneck
because there's not many viruses in that

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:37.900
because there's not many viruses in that
 

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.190
because there's not many viruses in that
droplet when latent viruses are

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200
droplet when latent viruses are
 

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.079

00:37:43.089 --> 00:37:45.390
activated from a limited population of
cells that's also similar to a

when an insect bites you you're getting

00:37:48.329 --> 00:37:48.339
when an insect bites you you're getting
 

00:37:48.339 --> 00:37:50.400
when an insect bites you you're getting
a small amount of virus all of these are

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:50.410
a small amount of virus all of these are
 

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:54.000
a small amount of virus all of these are
similar bottlenecks but these are not

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.010
similar bottlenecks but these are not
 

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:57.599
similar bottlenecks but these are not
subjected to Muller's ratchet and in

00:37:57.599 --> 00:37:57.609
subjected to Muller's ratchet and in
 

00:37:57.609 --> 00:37:59.490
subjected to Muller's ratchet and in
nature viruses do very well they make

00:37:59.490 --> 00:37:59.500
nature viruses do very well they make
 

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.290
nature viruses do very well they make
quazy species and animals so why is that

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:01.300
quazy species and animals so why is that
 

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.960
quazy species and animals so why is that
and how do you would avoid the ratchet

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:03.970
and how do you would avoid the ratchet
 

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:06.260
and how do you would avoid the ratchet
well you subject the more diverse

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:06.270
well you subject the more diverse
 

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:09.630
well you subject the more diverse
population to serial passage right you

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:09.640
population to serial passage right you
 

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.160
population to serial passage right you
don't pick us if you're doing this in

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:11.170
don't pick us if you're doing this in
 

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:12.750
don't pick us if you're doing this in
the laboratory don't pick just one

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760
the laboratory don't pick just one
 

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.300
the laboratory don't pick just one
plaque pick 10 or 20 or 30 and pool them

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:15.310
plaque pick 10 or 20 or 30 and pool them
 

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.910
plaque pick 10 or 20 or 30 and pool them
if you need to do this and that way you

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920
if you need to do this and that way you
 

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.800
if you need to do this and that way you
have more diversity so why is more

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:19.810
have more diversity so why is more
 

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:22.440
have more diversity so why is more
diversity good in this situation why is

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:22.450
diversity good in this situation why is
 

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:24.990
diversity good in this situation why is
if you pick 20 or 30 plaques and pool

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:25.000
if you pick 20 or 30 plaques and pool
 

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.700
if you pick 20 or 30 plaques and pool
them and passage then why would that be

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:26.710
them and passage then why would that be
 

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.650
them and passage then why would that be
better because when you have more

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:28.660
better because when you have more
 

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.839
better because when you have more
diversity you can construct a mutation

00:38:30.839 --> 00:38:30.849
diversity you can construct a mutation
 

00:38:30.849 --> 00:38:32.910
diversity you can construct a mutation
free genome by either recombination or

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:32.920
free genome by either recombination or
 

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.730
free genome by either recombination or
reassortment and that gets rid of the

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:35.740
reassortment and that gets rid of the
 

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.099
reassortment and that gets rid of the
bad mutations and substitutes for ones

00:38:38.099 --> 00:38:38.109
bad mutations and substitutes for ones
 

00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:40.980
bad mutations and substitutes for ones
that allow viral growth okay so the

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:40.990
that allow viral growth okay so the
 

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:43.589
that allow viral growth okay so the
simple fact of adding a greater

00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599
simple fact of adding a greater
 

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:46.170
simple fact of adding a greater
diversity in this experiment allows you

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:46.180
diversity in this experiment allows you
 

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.290
diversity in this experiment allows you
to escape the ratchet so you just pick

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:49.300
to escape the ratchet so you just pick
 

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:55.170
to escape the ratchet so you just pick
more plaques instead of one so you may

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:55.180
more plaques instead of one so you may
 

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.260
more plaques instead of one so you may
think that how likely is it that

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:57.270
think that how likely is it that
 

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:01.079
think that how likely is it that
recombination would restore the fitness

00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:01.089
recombination would restore the fitness
 

00:39:01.089 --> 00:39:03.329
recombination would restore the fitness
well you only need one viral viral

00:39:03.329 --> 00:39:03.339
well you only need one viral viral
 

00:39:03.339 --> 00:39:05.250
well you only need one viral viral
genome in the entire population that's

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:05.260
genome in the entire population that's
 

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.040
genome in the entire population that's
fit and it will over grow all the others

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:08.050
fit and it will over grow all the others
 

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:11.069
fit and it will over grow all the others
and predominate so if that one genome is

00:39:11.069 --> 00:39:11.079
and predominate so if that one genome is
 

00:39:11.079 --> 00:39:12.540
and predominate so if that one genome is
produced by a recombination just

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:12.550
produced by a recombination just
 

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.460
produced by a recombination just
randomly between two viruses and it

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:14.470
randomly between two viruses and it
 

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:17.550
randomly between two viruses and it
happens to produce a genome that is now

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:17.560
happens to produce a genome that is now
 

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.530
happens to produce a genome that is now
fit for whatever reason that will take

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:19.540
fit for whatever reason that will take
 

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.680
fit for whatever reason that will take
over so even a very rare event will win

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:22.690
over so even a very rare event will win
 

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:24.540
over so even a very rare event will win
the progeny will take over the

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:24.550
the progeny will take over the
 

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:26.910
the progeny will take over the
population so well this means diversity

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920
population so well this means diversity
 

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.710
population so well this means diversity
is important for the survival of

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720
is important for the survival of
 

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.410
is important for the survival of
individual members so remember we're

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:31.420
individual members so remember we're
 

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:32.940
individual members so remember we're
talking about virus infections on a

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:32.950
talking about virus infections on a
 

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:35.490
talking about virus infections on a
population basis but the population is

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:35.500
population basis but the population is
 

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.230
population basis but the population is
important for individual virus because

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:37.240
important for individual virus because
 

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.270
important for individual virus because
what comes out is really an individual

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280
what comes out is really an individual
 

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.780
what comes out is really an individual
genome that goes on to the next cell so

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:42.790
genome that goes on to the next cell so
 

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.960

00:43:40.099 --> 00:43:43.210
different ages and ends gives us new
pandemic influenza viruses every 20 or

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:43.220
pandemic influenza viruses every 20 or
 

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.940
pandemic influenza viruses every 20 or
30 or 40 years and that's what you see

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:45.950
30 or 40 years and that's what you see
 

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:52.269
30 or 40 years and that's what you see
in this slide let's start in 1918 for

00:43:52.269 --> 00:43:52.279
in this slide let's start in 1918 for
 

00:43:52.279 --> 00:43:53.950
in this slide let's start in 1918 for
which we have a virus is the first

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960
which we have a virus is the first
 

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.200
which we have a virus is the first
outbreak or pandemic of influenza where

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:56.210
outbreak or pandemic of influenza where
 

00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:57.849
outbreak or pandemic of influenza where
we actually have the virus because we

00:43:57.849 --> 00:43:57.859
we actually have the virus because we
 

00:43:57.859 --> 00:44:00.339
we actually have the virus because we
constructed it we don't have any viruses

00:44:00.339 --> 00:44:00.349
constructed it we don't have any viruses
 

00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:05.049
constructed it we don't have any viruses
for the pandemics of 1900 or 1889 but

00:44:05.049 --> 00:44:05.059
for the pandemics of 1900 or 1889 but
 

00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:07.089
for the pandemics of 1900 or 1889 but
from studying the serum of people who

from studying the serum of people who
 

00:44:07.099 --> 00:44:08.920
from studying the serum of people who
live them we suspect that these were the

live them we suspect that these were the
 

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:10.569
live them we suspect that these were the
kinds of viruses that cause these

00:44:10.569 --> 00:44:10.579
kinds of viruses that cause these
 

00:44:10.579 --> 00:44:13.210

pandemic and h 2 and 2 and an h3 na but
 

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:16.329
pandemic and h 2 and 2 and an h3 na but
we're not sure so in 1918 that pandemic

00:44:16.329 --> 00:44:16.339
we're not sure so in 1918 that pandemic
 

00:44:16.339 --> 00:44:19.059
we're not sure so in 1918 that pandemic
was caused by the so-called Spanish

00:44:19.059 --> 00:44:19.069
was caused by the so-called Spanish
 

00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:23.259
was caused by the so-called Spanish
influenza it was an h1n1 strain and by

00:44:23.259 --> 00:44:23.269
influenza it was an h1n1 strain and by
 

00:44:23.269 --> 00:44:25.059
influenza it was an h1n1 strain and by
studying viruses that circulated and

00:44:25.059 --> 00:44:25.069
studying viruses that circulated and
 

00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:27.700
studying viruses that circulated and
ducks it looks like this is an AV

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:27.710
ducks it looks like this is an AV
 

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.800
ducks it looks like this is an AV
virus that somehow jumped into humans so

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:29.810
virus that somehow jumped into humans so
 

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:31.930
virus that somehow jumped into humans so
all the RNAs are read to show that it

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:31.940
all the RNAs are read to show that it
 

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:35.800
all the RNAs are read to show that it
came from this red duck ok now this

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:35.810
came from this red duck ok now this
 

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:37.660
came from this red duck ok now this
virus circulated for many years until

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:37.670
virus circulated for many years until
 

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:39.670
virus circulated for many years until
nineteen fifty-seven it caused yearly

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680
nineteen fifty-seven it caused yearly
 

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.310
nineteen fifty-seven it caused yearly
outbreaks of influenza because every

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:42.320
outbreaks of influenza because every
 

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.710
outbreaks of influenza because every
year or two the h.a would change one or

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720
year or two the h.a would change one or
 

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.050
year or two the h.a would change one or
two amino acid changes imposed by

antibodies in the hosts but then in 1957
 

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:55.089
antibodies in the hosts but then in 1957
there was a major pandemic of a totally

00:44:55.089 --> 00:44:55.099
there was a major pandemic of a totally
 

00:44:55.099 --> 00:44:58.720
there was a major pandemic of a totally
different strain and h2n2 strain so this

00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:58.730
different strain and h2n2 strain so this
 

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:00.130
different strain and h2n2 strain so this
is not recognized by any of the

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:00.140
is not recognized by any of the
 

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:03.160
is not recognized by any of the
population what happened was the h1n1

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:03.170
population what happened was the h1n1
 

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:06.700
population what happened was the h1n1
riya sorted with a duck h2n2 and the

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:06.710
riya sorted with a duck h2n2 and the
 

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:09.430
riya sorted with a duck h2n2 and the
yellow jeans came from the duck so this

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440
yellow jeans came from the duck so this
 

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.470
yellow jeans came from the duck so this
is now a random reassortment that

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:11.480
is now a random reassortment that
 

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.030
is now a random reassortment that
happened somewhere we don't know what

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040
happened somewhere we don't know what
 

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.070
happened somewhere we don't know what
species had occurred in and then that

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:15.080
species had occurred in and then that
 

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.260
species had occurred in and then that
virus somehow got into people and we

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:17.270
virus somehow got into people and we
 

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:18.700
virus somehow got into people and we
didn't have antibodies to them because

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:18.710
didn't have antibodies to them because
 

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:20.500
didn't have antibodies to them because
the H in the end were totally different

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:20.510
the H in the end were totally different
 

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:22.150
the H in the end were totally different
so it caused the global epidemic or

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160
so it caused the global epidemic or
 

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:25.780
so it caused the global epidemic or
pandemic 1968 so that virus circulated

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:25.790
pandemic 1968 so that virus circulated
 

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:30.280
pandemic 1968 so that virus circulated
from 57 268 again in 1968 this virus

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:30.290
from 57 268 again in 1968 this virus
 

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:33.190
from 57 268 again in 1968 this virus
Rhea sorted with another duck virus the

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200
Rhea sorted with another duck virus the
 

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.720
Rhea sorted with another duck virus the
blue jeans you can see a couple of blue

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:34.730
blue jeans you can see a couple of blue
 

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:39.130
blue jeans you can see a couple of blue
jeans and now this is an h3n2 so it has

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:39.140
jeans and now this is an h3n2 so it has
 

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.400
jeans and now this is an h3n2 so it has
a brand new hemagglutinin same

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:42.410
a brand new hemagglutinin same
 

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:44.170
a brand new hemagglutinin same
neuraminidase as the previous virus but

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:44.180
neuraminidase as the previous virus but
 

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.780
neuraminidase as the previous virus but
that was enough to cause a pandemic same

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:46.790
that was enough to cause a pandemic same
 

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:51.400
that was enough to cause a pandemic same
thing happened in 1977 now just in 2009

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:51.410
thing happened in 1977 now just in 2009
 

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:54.040
thing happened in 1977 now just in 2009
again we had a pandemic of influenza

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:54.050
again we had a pandemic of influenza
 

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:58.210
again we had a pandemic of influenza
virus the 2009 h1n1 which was a swine

00:45:58.210 --> 00:45:58.220
virus the 2009 h1n1 which was a swine
 

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:01.930
virus the 2009 h1n1 which was a swine
derived virus and this virus again was

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:01.940
derived virus and this virus again was
 

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:04.900
derived virus and this virus again was
derived by reassortment in animals it

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:04.910
derived by reassortment in animals it
 

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:09.670
derived by reassortment in animals it
had four different parents it had one

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680
had four different parents it had one
 

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.849
had four different parents it had one
parent was a virus that infected

00:46:11.849 --> 00:46:11.859
parent was a virus that infected
 

00:46:11.859 --> 00:46:14.859
parent was a virus that infected
Eurasian swine these are pigs raised for

Asia is it extensive trade between those
two countries so thats all these green

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:22.790
two countries so thats all these green
 

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:24.609

segments and you see two of those ended

00:46:24.609 --> 00:46:24.619
segments and you see two of those ended
 

00:46:24.619 --> 00:46:29.230

where antibody is usually bind to
 

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.329
where antibody is usually bind to
neutralize infectivity and so this is

00:47:49.329 --> 00:47:49.339
neutralize infectivity and so this is
 

00:47:49.339 --> 00:47:51.039
neutralize infectivity and so this is
why we have to change the vaccine every

00:47:51.039 --> 00:47:51.049
why we have to change the vaccine every
 

00:47:51.049 --> 00:47:53.200
why we have to change the vaccine every
few years because you have a gradual

can tolerate these changes so it slowly

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:01.010
can tolerate these changes so it slowly
 

00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:03.339
can tolerate these changes so it slowly
escapes the antibody response and you

00:48:03.339 --> 00:48:03.349
escapes the antibody response and you
 

00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:04.900
escapes the antibody response and you
have to make a new vaccine because the

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:04.910
have to make a new vaccine because the
 

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:06.789
have to make a new vaccine because the
old one doesn't work anymore so that's

00:48:06.789 --> 00:48:06.799
old one doesn't work anymore so that's
 

00:48:06.799 --> 00:48:10.690

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:38.759
reassortment give rise to new viruses an
interesting question which we haven't

00:51:38.759 --> 00:51:38.769
interesting question which we haven't
 

00:51:38.769 --> 00:51:41.039
interesting question which we haven't
really talked about in this course is

00:51:41.039 --> 00:51:41.049
really talked about in this course is
 

00:51:41.049 --> 00:51:43.289
really talked about in this course is
while we're talking about selection is

00:51:43.289 --> 00:51:43.299
while we're talking about selection is
 

00:51:43.299 --> 00:51:46.229
while we're talking about selection is
virulence a positive or negative trait

00:51:46.229 --> 00:51:46.239
virulence a positive or negative trait
 

00:51:46.239 --> 00:51:48.269
virulence a positive or negative trait
of selection is this something that is

00:51:48.269 --> 00:51:48.279
of selection is this something that is
 

00:51:48.279 --> 00:51:51.449
of selection is this something that is
selected for or against we're all

00:51:51.449 --> 00:51:51.459
selected for or against we're all
 

00:51:51.459 --> 00:51:53.370
selected for or against we're all
familiar with virulent viruses that

00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:53.380
familiar with virulent viruses that
 

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:56.430
familiar with virulent viruses that
devastate populations but it's that good

00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:56.440
devastate populations but it's that good
 

00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:00.449
devastate populations but it's that good
for a virus to be so very well and one

00:52:00.449 --> 00:52:00.459
for a virus to be so very well and one
 

00:52:00.459 --> 00:52:02.039
for a virus to be so very well and one
of the considerations is that increased

00:52:02.039 --> 00:52:02.049
of the considerations is that increased
 

00:52:02.049 --> 00:52:04.439
of the considerations is that increased
virulence reduces transmissibility

00:52:04.439 --> 00:52:04.449
virulence reduces transmissibility
 

00:52:04.449 --> 00:52:06.809
virulence reduces transmissibility
because if the host dies too quickly it

00:52:06.809 --> 00:52:06.819
because if the host dies too quickly it
 

00:52:06.819 --> 00:52:09.180
because if the host dies too quickly it
can't transmit the infection so this is

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:09.190
can't transmit the infection so this is
 

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:11.939
can't transmit the infection so this is
one argument why increased evolving

00:52:11.939 --> 00:52:11.949
one argument why increased evolving
 

00:52:11.949 --> 00:52:13.769
one argument why increased evolving
towards increased virulence really isn't

00:52:13.769 --> 00:52:13.779
towards increased virulence really isn't
 

00:52:13.779 --> 00:52:17.939
towards increased virulence really isn't
a good idea so if you accept that that

00:52:17.939 --> 00:52:17.949
a good idea so if you accept that that
 

00:52:17.949 --> 00:52:20.039
a good idea so if you accept that that
increased virulence isn't good you would

00:52:20.039 --> 00:52:20.049
increased virulence isn't good you would
 

00:52:20.049 --> 00:52:21.989
increased virulence isn't good you would
think that all virus has evolved to be

00:52:21.989 --> 00:52:21.999
think that all virus has evolved to be
 

00:52:21.999 --> 00:52:24.059
think that all virus has evolved to be
maximally infectious or transmissible

00:52:24.059 --> 00:52:24.069
maximally infectious or transmissible
 

00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:27.120
maximally infectious or transmissible
and a virulent right why should there be

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:27.130
and a virulent right why should there be
 

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:29.489
and a virulent right why should there be
any virulent viruses at all if they have

00:52:29.489 --> 00:52:29.499
any virulent viruses at all if they have
 

00:52:29.499 --> 00:52:32.160
any virulent viruses at all if they have
no advantage to the virus but we don't

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:32.170
no advantage to the virus but we don't
 

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:33.809
no advantage to the virus but we don't
actually observe this where there are

00:52:33.809 --> 00:52:33.819
actually observe this where there are
 

00:52:33.819 --> 00:52:35.670
actually observe this where there are
lots of viruses that are quite virulent

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680
lots of viruses that are quite virulent
 

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.709
lots of viruses that are quite virulent
so there must be a reason for that and

00:52:37.709 --> 00:52:37.719
so there must be a reason for that and
 

00:52:37.719 --> 00:52:39.870
so there must be a reason for that and
one idea is that perhaps virulence

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:39.880
one idea is that perhaps virulence
 

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.779
one idea is that perhaps virulence
increases transmissibility so if you if

00:52:42.779 --> 00:52:42.789
increases transmissibility so if you if
 

00:52:42.789 --> 00:52:44.939
increases transmissibility so if you if
a virus causes you to cough and sneeze a

00:52:44.939 --> 00:52:44.949
a virus causes you to cough and sneeze a
 

00:52:44.949 --> 00:52:47.009
a virus causes you to cough and sneeze a
lot which is an increase in virulence

00:52:47.009 --> 00:52:47.019
lot which is an increase in virulence
 

00:52:47.019 --> 00:52:51.630
lot which is an increase in virulence
that will help it to transmit we see

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:51.640
that will help it to transmit we see
 

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.339
that will help it to transmit we see
also persistent infections that are

00:52:53.339 --> 00:52:53.349
also persistent infections that are
 

00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:55.380
also persistent infections that are
rather dormant for years so they're not

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:55.390
rather dormant for years so they're not
 

00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:56.910
rather dormant for years so they're not
virulent but then at the end of the

00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:56.920
virulent but then at the end of the
 

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.680
virulent but then at the end of the
infection they kill the host so there

00:52:58.680 --> 00:52:58.690
infection they kill the host so there
 

00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:00.599
infection they kill the host so there
must be some advantage to that kind of

00:53:00.599 --> 00:53:00.609
must be some advantage to that kind of
 

00:53:00.609 --> 00:53:04.529
must be some advantage to that kind of
viral lifecycle we also see cases where

00:53:04.529 --> 00:53:04.539
viral lifecycle we also see cases where
 

00:53:04.539 --> 00:53:06.120
viral lifecycle we also see cases where
there are viruses that are quite

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:06.130
there are viruses that are quite
 

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:08.009
there are viruses that are quite
virulent for one species but at another

00:53:08.009 --> 00:53:08.019
virulent for one species but at another
 

00:53:08.019 --> 00:53:12.359
virulent for one species but at another
animal very symptomatic so here the same

00:53:12.359 --> 00:53:12.369
animal very symptomatic so here the same
 

00:53:12.369 --> 00:53:14.430
animal very symptomatic so here the same
virus in two different species has a

00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:14.440
virus in two different species has a
 

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:17.269
virus in two different species has a
very different variants phenotype so

00:53:17.269 --> 00:53:17.279
very different variants phenotype so
 

00:53:17.279 --> 00:53:20.130
very different variants phenotype so
we're not quite sure what the

00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:20.140
we're not quite sure what the
 

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.180
we're not quite sure what the
relationship is

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:21.190
relationship is
 

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:23.819
relationship is
between selection of a virulence as a

00:53:23.819 --> 00:53:23.829
between selection of a virulence as a
 

00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:26.760
between selection of a virulence as a
positive or negative trait as i said

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:26.770
positive or negative trait as i said
 

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:28.349
positive or negative trait as i said
earlier maybe increased virulence

00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:28.359
earlier maybe increased virulence
 

00:53:28.359 --> 00:53:30.870
earlier maybe increased virulence
increases transmissibility and that's I

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880
increases transmissibility and that's I
 

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:33.150
increases transmissibility and that's I
think transmissibility is probably the

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:33.160
think transmissibility is probably the
 

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.210
think transmissibility is probably the
most important selection factor so maybe

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:35.220
most important selection factor so maybe
 

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:38.160
most important selection factor so maybe
virulent sometimes comes along there's

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:38.170
virulent sometimes comes along there's
 

00:53:38.170 --> 00:53:40.650
virulent sometimes comes along there's
no answer to that of course but those

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:40.660
no answer to that of course but those
 

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:43.050
no answer to that of course but those
are some interesting points now I want

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:43.060
are some interesting points now I want
 

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:44.460
are some interesting points now I want
to tell you about an experiment and

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:44.470
to tell you about an experiment and
 

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:46.829
to tell you about an experiment and
evolution that addresses this virulence

00:53:46.829 --> 00:53:46.839
evolution that addresses this virulence
 

00:53:46.839 --> 00:53:49.250
evolution that addresses this virulence
and selection issue this was done in

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260
and selection issue this was done in
 

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:54.150
and selection issue this was done in
Australia and in 1859 the australians

00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160
Australia and in 1859 the australians
 

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.490
Australia and in 1859 the australians
brought in some european rabbits so they

00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:56.500
brought in some european rabbits so they
 

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.410
brought in some european rabbits so they
could hunt them they liked to hunt

00:53:58.410 --> 00:53:58.420
could hunt them they liked to hunt
 

00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:00.599
could hunt them they liked to hunt
rabbits so they brought in these rabbits

00:54:00.599 --> 00:54:00.609
rabbits so they brought in these rabbits
 

00:54:00.609 --> 00:54:02.700
rabbits so they brought in these rabbits
and they multiplied but unfortunately

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:02.710
and they multiplied but unfortunately
 

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:04.740
and they multiplied but unfortunately
there were no predators of these rabbits

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:04.750
there were no predators of these rabbits
 

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:06.300
there were no predators of these rabbits
so they got out of control they were

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:06.310
so they got out of control they were
 

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:07.620
so they got out of control they were
just millions and millions of them and

00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:07.630
just millions and millions of them and
 

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:11.160
just millions and millions of them and
this is one photograph from Australia

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:11.170
this is one photograph from Australia
 

00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:12.690
this is one photograph from Australia
showing how many of these guys there

00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:12.700
showing how many of these guys there
 

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:15.120
showing how many of these guys there
were so the Australians got upset they

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:15.130
were so the Australians got upset they
 

00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:16.559
were so the Australians got upset they
said we have to do something about these

00:54:16.559 --> 00:54:16.569
said we have to do something about these
 

00:54:16.569 --> 00:54:20.790
said we have to do something about these
these rabbits so what they did is

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800
these rabbits so what they did is
 

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.609
these rabbits so what they did is
release a virus a pox virus called

00:54:23.609 --> 00:54:23.619
release a virus a pox virus called
 

00:54:23.619 --> 00:54:25.770
release a virus a pox virus called
myxoma virus they said this move this

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:25.780
myxoma virus they said this move this
 

00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:28.230
myxoma virus they said this move this
virus is quite lethal for these European

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240
virus is quite lethal for these European
 

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:31.140
virus is quite lethal for these European
rabbits so the natural host of this

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:31.150
rabbits so the natural host of this
 

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:34.530
rabbits so the natural host of this
virus is from California and Central and

00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:34.540
virus is from California and Central and
 

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:40.170
virus is from California and Central and
South America in those rabbits the virus

00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:40.180
South America in those rabbits the virus
 

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:42.180
South America in those rabbits the virus
infection is not very harmful it is

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:42.190
infection is not very harmful it is
 

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:44.670
infection is not very harmful it is
spread by mosquitoes in the European

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:44.680
spread by mosquitoes in the European
 

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.410
spread by mosquitoes in the European
rabbits though which is not their

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:46.420
rabbits though which is not their
 

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:49.230
rabbits though which is not their
natural host the viruses ninety to

00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.240
natural host the viruses ninety to
 

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.390
natural host the viruses ninety to
ninety percent fatal so that's why the

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:51.400
ninety percent fatal so that's why the
 

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:54.000
ninety percent fatal so that's why the
Australian has decided to bring myxoma

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:54.010
Australian has decided to bring myxoma
 

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:56.190
Australian has decided to bring myxoma
in and release it the mosquitoes would

00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:56.200
in and release it the mosquitoes would
 

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.630
in and release it the mosquitoes would
pick it up and spread it among these

00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:57.640
pick it up and spread it among these
 

00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:00.510
pick it up and spread it among these
rabbits and get rid of them okay so how

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:00.520
rabbits and get rid of them okay so how
 

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:04.170
rabbits and get rid of them okay so how
did that work out first year of the

00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:04.180
did that work out first year of the
 

00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:06.300
did that work out first year of the
virus killed ninety nine point eight

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:06.310
virus killed ninety nine point eight
 

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:08.460
virus killed ninety nine point eight
percent of the rabbits but the point two

00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:08.470
percent of the rabbits but the point two
 

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:11.760
percent of the rabbits but the point two
percent who survived they multiplied

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:11.770
percent who survived they multiplied
 

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:14.460
percent who survived they multiplied
like rabbits the second year mortality

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:14.470
like rabbits the second year mortality
 

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:19.040
like rabbits the second year mortality
dropped the twenty-five percent and then

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:19.050
dropped the twenty-five percent and then
 

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:21.480
dropped the twenty-five percent and then
the rate of killing and subsequently is

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:21.490
the rate of killing and subsequently is
 

00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:23.220
the rate of killing and subsequently is
ended up being lower than the

00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:23.230
ended up being lower than the
 

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:25.079
ended up being lower than the
reproductive rate so the rabbits are

00:55:25.079 --> 00:55:25.089
reproductive rate so the rabbits are
 

00:55:25.089 --> 00:55:27.510
reproductive rate so the rabbits are
still in Australia to this day this is

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520
still in Australia to this day this is
 

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:31.589
still in Australia to this day this is
actually a topic that's been extensively

00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599
actually a topic that's been extensively
 

00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:34.140
actually a topic that's been extensively
reported on in the press by the number

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:34.150
reported on in the press by the number
 

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:36.180
reported on in the press by the number
biologists so you can go back and look

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:36.190
biologists so you can go back and look
 

00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:38.789
biologists so you can go back and look
at all this old literature so it was

00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799
at all this old literature so it was
 

00:55:38.799 --> 00:55:40.260
at all this old literature so it was
it's an interesting example of

00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:40.270
it's an interesting example of
 

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.089
it's an interesting example of
coevolution of the host and the virus

00:55:42.089 --> 00:55:42.099
coevolution of the host and the virus
 

00:55:42.099 --> 00:55:43.620
coevolution of the host and the virus
the virus doesn't want to kill all the

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:43.630
the virus doesn't want to kill all the
 

00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:45.569
the virus doesn't want to kill all the
toast as far as viruses can want

00:55:45.569 --> 00:55:45.579
toast as far as viruses can want
 

00:55:45.579 --> 00:55:49.140
toast as far as viruses can want
anything so it evolved and the host also

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:49.150
anything so it evolved and the host also
 

00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:50.819
anything so it evolved and the host also
evolved to be more resistant so there

00:55:50.819 --> 00:55:50.829
evolved to be more resistant so there
 

00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:52.559
evolved to be more resistant so there
are changes in the rabbits you select

00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:52.569
are changes in the rabbits you select
 

00:55:52.569 --> 00:55:54.120
are changes in the rabbits you select
for the survivors that can resist

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:54.130
for the survivors that can resist
 

00:55:54.130 --> 00:55:55.890
for the survivors that can resist
infection there were changes in the

00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:55.900
infection there were changes in the
 

00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:58.289
infection there were changes in the
viruses so they wouldn't wipe out all of

00:55:58.289 --> 00:55:58.299
viruses so they wouldn't wipe out all of
 

00:55:58.299 --> 00:56:02.190
viruses so they wouldn't wipe out all of
the hosts as well so this is interesting

00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:02.200
the hosts as well so this is interesting
 

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.380
the hosts as well so this is interesting
both rabbits and viruses produce large

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:04.390
both rabbits and viruses produce large
 

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:06.059
both rabbits and viruses produce large
numbers of offsprings probably why this

00:56:06.059 --> 00:56:06.069
numbers of offsprings probably why this
 

00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:08.720
numbers of offsprings probably why this
could be observed in such a short period

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:08.730
could be observed in such a short period
 

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:11.519
could be observed in such a short period
so the virus evolved as I've said to

00:56:11.519 --> 00:56:11.529
so the virus evolved as I've said to
 

00:56:11.529 --> 00:56:14.490
so the virus evolved as I've said to
kill fewer rabbits and then extend the

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:14.500
kill fewer rabbits and then extend the
 

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.650
kill fewer rabbits and then extend the
life so the virus could be spread in

00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:16.660
life so the virus could be spread in
 

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:19.500
life so the virus could be spread in
mosquitoes so those virus is present in

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:19.510
mosquitoes so those virus is present in
 

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:21.240
mosquitoes so those virus is present in
the population that had this property

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:21.250
the population that had this property
 

00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:23.519
the population that had this property
just randomly it was one of the quazy

00:56:23.519 --> 00:56:23.529
just randomly it was one of the quazy
 

00:56:23.529 --> 00:56:26.309
just randomly it was one of the quazy
species in the population were selected

00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319
species in the population were selected
 

00:56:26.319 --> 00:56:27.500
species in the population were selected
for and those were the ones that

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:27.510
for and those were the ones that
 

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:33.510
for and those were the ones that
predominated and this is exactly what I

00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520
predominated and this is exactly what I
 

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:36.150
predominated and this is exactly what I
would predict an evolving host coming to

00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160
would predict an evolving host coming to
 

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.769
would predict an evolving host coming to
equilibrium with the pathogen so the

00:56:37.769 --> 00:56:37.779
equilibrium with the pathogen so the
 

00:56:37.779 --> 00:56:39.240
equilibrium with the pathogen so the
rabbit the European rabbit was a new

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:39.250
rabbit the European rabbit was a new
 

00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:41.819
rabbit the European rabbit was a new
host for this virus so this is an

00:56:41.819 --> 00:56:41.829
host for this virus so this is an
 

00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:44.370
host for this virus so this is an
evolving relationship so both the host

00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:44.380
evolving relationship so both the host
 

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:47.069
evolving relationship so both the host
and the virus you've also that both can

00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:47.079
and the virus you've also that both can
 

00:56:47.079 --> 00:56:49.680
and the virus you've also that both can
satisfy their needs so what was learned

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:49.690
satisfy their needs so what was learned
 

00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:51.839
satisfy their needs so what was learned
from this you always get what you select

00:56:51.839 --> 00:56:51.849
from this you always get what you select
 

00:56:51.849 --> 00:56:54.349
from this you always get what you select
but you often don't get what you want

00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359
but you often don't get what you want
 

00:56:54.359 --> 00:56:56.760
but you often don't get what you want
okay so they wanted to wipe out all the

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:56.770
okay so they wanted to wipe out all the
 

00:56:56.770 --> 00:56:58.710
okay so they wanted to wipe out all the
rabbits but they didn't but the instead

00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720
rabbits but they didn't but the instead
 

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.569
rabbits but they didn't but the instead
imposed the selection which allowed both

00:57:00.569 --> 00:57:00.579
imposed the selection which allowed both
 

00:57:00.579 --> 00:57:04.220
imposed the selection which allowed both
to survive so this is a really bad idea

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:04.230
to survive so this is a really bad idea
 

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:08.400
to survive so this is a really bad idea
Tula try and eliminate any animal with a

rabbits using other viruses there's the

00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359
rabbits using other viruses there's the

calicivirus Khaleesi viruses are RNA
viruses and they're trying to

00:57:24.809 --> 00:57:24.819
viruses and they're trying to
 

00:57:24.819 --> 00:57:26.460
viruses and they're trying to
exterminate the rabbits with them and

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:26.470
exterminate the rabbits with them and
 

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:28.710
exterminate the rabbits with them and
last year when I taught this course

last year when I taught this course
 

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.690
last year when I taught this course
there was just an article in the paper

00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:30.700
there was just an article in the paper
 

00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.970
there was just an article in the paper
where this virus had accidentally gone

00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:32.980
where this virus had accidentally gone
 

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.650
where this virus had accidentally gone
out of the containment station where

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:34.660
out of the containment station where
 

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:36.569
out of the containment station where
they were doing limited experiments on

they were doing limited experiments on
 

00:57:36.579 --> 00:57:38.730
they were doing limited experiments on
rabbits so another accident happening in

00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:38.740
rabbits so another accident happening in

Australia so the European rabbits are

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440
Australia so the European rabbits are
 

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.950
Australia so the European rabbits are
still there and the moral is that you

00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:43.960
still there and the moral is that you
 

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.450
still there and the moral is that you
really can't get rid of them with this

00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:45.460
really can't get rid of them with this
 

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:47.579
really can't get rid of them with this
approach because the evolution will

00:57:47.579 --> 00:57:47.589
approach because the evolution will
 

00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:50.729
approach because the evolution will
go its own way all right where did

00:57:50.729 --> 00:57:50.739
go its own way all right where did
 

00:57:50.739 --> 00:57:53.519
go its own way all right where did
viruses come from as I said we don't

know but we have some theories and
 

00:57:55.359 --> 00:57:57.209
know but we have some theories and
they're worth discussing there's the

00:57:57.209 --> 00:57:57.219
they're worth discussing there's the
 

00:57:57.219 --> 00:57:59.459
they're worth discussing there's the
regressive theory which says that

00:57:59.459 --> 00:57:59.469
regressive theory which says that
 

00:57:59.469 --> 00:58:01.890
regressive theory which says that
viruses are derived from intracellular

parasites that have lost most of their
genes there's the cellular origin theory

00:58:07.799 --> 00:58:07.809
genes there's the cellular origin theory
 

00:58:07.809 --> 00:58:10.440

says that viruses arose from cellular

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:10.450
says that viruses arose from cellular
 

00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:12.509
says that viruses arose from cellular

actually like this one I think that
 

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:26.849
actually like this one I think that
viruses were there before cellular life

00:58:26.849 --> 00:58:26.859
viruses were there before cellular life
 

00:58:26.859 --> 00:58:29.670
viruses were there before cellular life
evolved he may say how is that possible

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680
evolved he may say how is that possible
 

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.489
evolved he may say how is that possible
because viruses need cells but that's

00:58:32.489 --> 00:58:32.499
because viruses need cells but that's
 

00:58:32.499 --> 00:58:34.499
because viruses need cells but that's
our definition today of a virus it may

00:58:34.499 --> 00:58:34.509
our definition today of a virus it may
 

00:58:34.509 --> 00:58:36.269
our definition today of a virus it may
have been they exist in a very different

00:58:36.269 --> 00:58:36.279
have been they exist in a very different
 

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:39.479
have been they exist in a very different
form before cellular life evolved there

00:58:39.479 --> 00:58:39.489
form before cellular life evolved there

is a little bit of evidence for a few of

00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:41.380
is a little bit of evidence for a few of
 

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:43.229
is a little bit of evidence for a few of
these when you look at the evolution of

00:58:43.229 --> 00:58:43.239
these when you look at the evolution of
 

00:58:43.239 --> 00:58:45.120
these when you look at the evolution of
viral genes which we'll talk about in a

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:45.130
viral genes which we'll talk about in a
 

00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:46.799
viral genes which we'll talk about in a
moment but obviously we can't prove any

00:58:46.799 --> 00:58:46.809
moment but obviously we can't prove any
 

00:58:46.809 --> 00:58:49.529
moment but obviously we can't prove any
of it so we don't have any fossil record

00:58:49.529 --> 00:58:49.539
of it so we don't have any fossil record
 

00:58:49.539 --> 00:58:52.620
of it so we don't have any fossil record
not like we have of vertebrates we do

00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:52.630
not like we have of vertebrates we do
 

00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:55.799
not like we have of vertebrates we do
have genetic fossils we have viruses and

00:58:55.799 --> 00:58:55.809
have genetic fossils we have viruses and
 

00:58:55.809 --> 00:58:57.749
have genetic fossils we have viruses and
genomes of animals we can tell by that

how many millions of years ago those
 

00:58:59.559 --> 00:59:02.039
how many millions of years ago those
viruses were around but we don't have

viruses were around but we don't have
 

00:59:02.049 --> 00:59:04.200
viruses were around but we don't have
old virus stocks it's very hard to test

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:04.210
old virus stocks it's very hard to test
 

00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:08.099
old virus stocks it's very hard to test
hypotheses but we do study contemporary

00:59:08.109 --> 00:59:11.339
hypotheses but we do study contemporary
viruses and and get some ideas and so

00:59:11.339 --> 00:59:11.349
viruses and and get some ideas and so
 

00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:13.890
viruses and and get some ideas and so
here are some ideas from that about the

00:59:13.890 --> 00:59:13.900
here are some ideas from that about the
 

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:16.829
here are some ideas from that about the
origins of viruses first of all there

00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839
origins of viruses first of all there
 

00:59:16.839 --> 00:59:19.079
origins of viruses first of all there
are viruses of all three domains of life

00:59:19.079 --> 00:59:19.089
are viruses of all three domains of life
 

00:59:19.089 --> 00:59:21.359
are viruses of all three domains of life
the bacteria that eukaryotes the archaea

00:59:21.359 --> 00:59:21.369
the bacteria that eukaryotes the archaea
 

00:59:21.369 --> 00:59:25.650
the bacteria that eukaryotes the archaea
and they will have homologous features

00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:25.660
and they will have homologous features
 

00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:27.749
and they will have homologous features
to have things that make them look like

00:59:27.749 --> 00:59:27.759
to have things that make them look like
 

00:59:27.759 --> 00:59:31.319
to have things that make them look like
viruses and this suggests that the virus

00:59:31.319 --> 00:59:31.329
viruses and this suggests that the virus
 

00:59:31.329 --> 00:59:34.229
viruses and this suggests that the virus
has predate the last Universal cellular

00:59:34.229 --> 00:59:34.239
has predate the last Universal cellular
 

00:59:34.239 --> 00:59:36.329

presumed to be ancestral to the three
 

00:59:39.219 --> 00:59:42.299
presumed to be ancestral to the three
domains of life so maybe viruses were

00:59:42.299 --> 00:59:42.309
domains of life so maybe viruses were
 

00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:45.529
domains of life so maybe viruses were
there before these three branched out

00:59:45.529 --> 00:59:45.539
there before these three branched out
 

00:59:45.539 --> 00:59:51.660
there before these three branched out

eukaryotic sequences they are ancestral

00:59:58.650 --> 00:59:58.660
eukaryotic sequences they are ancestral
 

00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.640
eukaryotic sequences they are ancestral
to everything we know of in

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:00.650
to everything we know of in
 

01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:03.160
to everything we know of in
eukaryotic world so we think these are

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:03.170
eukaryotic world so we think these are
 

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:06.329

probably the oldest eukaryotic viruses

01:00:06.329 --> 01:00:06.339
probably the oldest eukaryotic viruses
 

01:00:06.339 --> 01:00:10.420
probably the oldest eukaryotic viruses
and as we sequence more and more viral

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:10.430
and as we sequence more and more viral
 

01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:13.359
and as we sequence more and more viral
genomes we find more genes that have no

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:13.369

Kingdoms so that makes it hard to say

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:21.950
Kingdoms so that makes it hard to say
 

01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:24.220

that viruses came from something living

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:24.230
that viruses came from something living
 

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:25.900
that viruses came from something living
because they have genes that aren't in

because they have genes that aren't in
 

01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:28.480
because they have genes that aren't in
any of these things so they're more

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:28.490
any of these things so they're more
 

01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:31.990
any of these things so they're more
likely to be around before them so

01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000
likely to be around before them so
 

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.940

very old viruses they happen to be among
 

01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.720
very old viruses they happen to be among
the largest and that may be why they are

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:13.730
the largest and that may be why they are
 

01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:15.730
the largest and that may be why they are
so big maybe they were even bigger at

01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:15.740
so big maybe they were even bigger at
 

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:18.099
so big maybe they were even bigger at

probably even more today we can put all
 

01:01:31.099 --> 01:01:34.990
probably even more today we can put all
those sequences on a glass chip and it's

01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:35.000
those sequences on a glass chip and it's
 

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.549
those sequences on a glass chip and it's
called a viral chip and then we can use

01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559
called a viral chip and then we can use
 

01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:38.829
called a viral chip and then we can use
that to probe environments for the

presence of some of those viruses we
don't have to grow all the viruses

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:41.690
don't have to grow all the viruses
 

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:43.720
don't have to grow all the viruses
anymore this has been a really powerful

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:43.730

development we can sample viral

01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:46.700

the water so all the viruses in the

01:02:00.039 --> 01:02:00.049
the water so all the viruses in the
 

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:02.220
the water so all the viruses in the
oceans have been sequence this way and

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:02.230
oceans have been sequence this way and
 

01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:04.510
oceans have been sequence this way and
sequence the DNA and just see what's

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:04.520
sequence the DNA and just see what's
 

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.720

own we haven't seen them in any virus
 

01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:17.049
own we haven't seen them in any virus

and we certainly haven't seen anything
 

01:02:17.059 --> 01:02:19.749
and we certainly haven't seen anything
like them in cells so there's a huge

01:02:19.749 --> 01:02:19.759
like them in cells so there's a huge
 

01:02:19.759 --> 01:02:22.089
like them in cells so there's a huge

interesting story of the evolution of
herpes viruses now you can sequence the

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:39.410
herpes viruses now you can sequence the
 

01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:41.799
herpes viruses now you can sequence the
all the known herpes viruses and create

01:02:41.799 --> 01:02:41.809
all the known herpes viruses and create
 

01:02:41.809 --> 01:02:44.529
all the known herpes viruses and create
a time scale of evolution and when you

a time scale of evolution and when you
 

01:02:44.539 --> 01:02:46.569
a time scale of evolution and when you
do that the three major groups the alpha

million years ago so that's not very

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:54.380
million years ago so that's not very
 

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:57.759
million years ago so that's not very
long ago in in life on earth so here's

01:02:57.759 --> 01:02:57.769
long ago in in life on earth so here's
 

01:02:57.769 --> 01:03:01.059
long ago in in life on earth so here's
formation of Earth 4.5 billion years ago

01:03:01.059 --> 01:03:01.069
formation of Earth 4.5 billion years ago
 

01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:04.410
formation of Earth 4.5 billion years ago
and the emergence of life may be 3.5

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:04.420
and the emergence of life may be 3.5
 

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:08.769
and the emergence of life may be 3.5
billion years and then here we have the

01:03:08.769 --> 01:03:08.779
billion years and then here we have the
 

01:03:08.779 --> 01:03:11.829
billion years and then here we have the
dinosaurs right about here 200 would be

01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839
dinosaurs right about here 200 would be
 

01:03:11.839 --> 01:03:14.739
dinosaurs right about here 200 would be
250 million years ago and so we're

01:03:14.739 --> 01:03:14.749
250 million years ago and so we're
 

01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:16.719
250 million years ago and so we're
saying the herpes viruses probably arose

01:03:16.719 --> 01:03:16.729
saying the herpes viruses probably arose
 

01:03:16.729 --> 01:03:19.239
saying the herpes viruses probably arose
during the time of the dinosaurs not

01:03:19.239 --> 01:03:19.249
during the time of the dinosaurs not
 

01:03:19.249 --> 01:03:21.370
during the time of the dinosaurs not
very long ago but we don't have anything

01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:21.380
very long ago but we don't have anything
 

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:25.059
very long ago but we don't have anything
before that so far also there are other

01:03:25.059 --> 01:03:25.069
before that so far also there are other
 

01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:27.039
before that so far also there are other
herpes viruses that infect fish and

01:03:27.039 --> 01:03:27.049
herpes viruses that infect fish and
 

01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:29.559
herpes viruses that infect fish and
oysters and amphibians they have no

viruses they have a capsid like him and

01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599
viruses they have a capsid like him and
 

01:03:35.599 --> 01:03:36.910
viruses they have a capsid like him and
that's why they're placed in the herpes

01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:36.920
that's why they're placed in the herpes
 

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.219
that's why they're placed in the herpes
virus family but these may represent a

01:03:39.219 --> 01:03:39.229
virus family but these may represent a
 

01:03:39.229 --> 01:03:41.579
virus family but these may represent a
very early branch of the herpes family

01:03:41.579 --> 01:03:41.589
very early branch of the herpes family
 

01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:44.259
very early branch of the herpes family
because they have no gene homology to

that is a pox virus from gerbils so the

01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799
that is a pox virus from gerbils so the
 

01:04:12.799 --> 01:04:15.339
that is a pox virus from gerbils so the
idea has originated smallpox virus arose

01:04:15.339 --> 01:04:15.349

within each genotype so you can actually
 

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:03.000
within each genotype so you can actually
map the movement of populations by what

genome that they have in them it's
 

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:20.400
genome that they have in them it's
really amazing and in this case the

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:20.410
really amazing and in this case the

rinderpest virus and we think measles

01:05:40.319 --> 01:05:40.329
rinderpest virus and we think measles
 

01:05:40.329 --> 01:05:42.770
rinderpest virus and we think measles
arose from rinderpest when humans first

01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:42.780
arose from rinderpest when humans first
 

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:46.020

began to domesticate cattle so we got

01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:46.030
began to domesticate cattle so we got
 

01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:47.790
began to domesticate cattle so we got
close to the cattle as opposed to them

infections and in fact domestication of

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:56.050
infections and in fact domestication of
 

01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:57.329

cattle happened in the Middle East about

01:05:57.329 --> 01:05:57.339
cattle happened in the Middle East about
 

01:05:57.339 --> 01:06:01.109
cattle happened in the Middle East about
5,000 years ago and then the virus after

01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119
5,000 years ago and then the virus after
 

01:06:01.119 --> 01:06:03.630
5,000 years ago and then the virus after
being introduced into humans spread

01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:03.640
being introduced into humans spread
 

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.940
being introduced into humans spread
around the world like colonization and

now an important point at the end of all

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:20.770
now an important point at the end of all
 

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:23.460
now an important point at the end of all
this is that viruses remain viruses no

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:23.470
this is that viruses remain viruses no
 

01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:26.250
this is that viruses remain viruses no
matter how much they evolve okay this

we can see a herpes virus we can see an

01:06:30.359 --> 01:06:30.369
we can see a herpes virus we can see an
 

01:06:30.369 --> 01:06:32.040
we can see a herpes virus we can see an
influenza virus we just look at the

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:32.050
influenza virus we just look at the
 

01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:33.930
influenza virus we just look at the
genome that's why a quazy species all

what kind of virus they are

01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:37.600
what kind of virus they are
 

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.110
what kind of virus they are
so there's a lot of opportunity for

01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:40.120
so there's a lot of opportunity for
 

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.360
so there's a lot of opportunity for
variation but you do vary within a

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:42.370
variation but you do vary within a
 

01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:45.120
variation but you do vary within a
master sequence of some kind how is this

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:45.130
master sequence of some kind how is this
 

01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:49.560
master sequence of some kind how is this
so why do I retain well they are defined

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:49.570
so why do I retain well they are defined
 

01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:51.810
so why do I retain well they are defined
by their capsids and their genomes and

01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:51.820
by their capsids and their genomes and
 

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:53.160
by their capsids and their genomes and
the way they replicate so we think

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:53.170
the way they replicate so we think
 

01:06:53.170 --> 01:06:56.550
the way they replicate so we think
that's a very strong restriction there

01:06:56.550 --> 01:06:56.560
that's a very strong restriction there
 

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.590
that's a very strong restriction there
there's they all share fundamental

01:06:58.590 --> 01:06:58.600
there's they all share fundamental
 

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.270
there's they all share fundamental
characteristics and it constrains them

01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:00.280
characteristics and it constrains them
 

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.310
characteristics and it constrains them
so you any virus that can function

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:02.320
so you any virus that can function
 

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.380
so you any virus that can function

RNA virus apparently so we have now

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:09.730
RNA virus apparently so we have now
 

01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:11.670
RNA virus apparently so we have now
seven different genotypes and no more

01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680
seven different genotypes and no more
 

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.260
seven different genotypes and no more
than that and that's probably all we

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:13.270
than that and that's probably all we
 

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:17.130
than that and that's probably all we
will ever see so any extreme alterations

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:17.140

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:19.690
don't survive selection going from DNA
 

01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:21.750
don't survive selection going from DNA
to RNA and of course as I've said the

we see so what is the number of all

01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680
we see so what is the number of all
 

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.650

that it can never be tested in nature

that it can never be tested in nature
when you sequence RNA viruses you see

01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160
when you sequence RNA viruses you see
 

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.830
when you sequence RNA viruses you see
that over half of all the nucleotides

01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:13.840
that over half of all the nucleotides
 

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:18.300
that over half of all the nucleotides
can be changed in any given RNA virus so

01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:18.310
can be changed in any given RNA virus so
 

01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:20.580
can be changed in any given RNA virus so
let's do some numbers for a ten kilobase

mutants so we're assuming half of the

01:08:30.150 --> 01:08:30.160
mutants so we're assuming half of the
 

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.980

genome can be substituted so how many

01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:31.990

01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:33.840

substitutions is at four to the five

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:33.850
substitutions is at four to the five
 

01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:37.440
substitutions is at four to the five
thousand and then it's probably bigger

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:37.450
thousand and then it's probably bigger
 

01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:39.599

reassortment would add to it but we're

the total number of viruses in the ocean
 

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:57.140
the total number of viruses in the ocean
which tend to the 30th I think which is

200 light-years away if you line up all
 

01:08:59.950 --> 01:09:02.700
200 light-years away if you line up all
those viruses so this is even bigger so

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:02.710
those viruses so this is even bigger so
 

01:09:02.710 --> 01:09:06.329
those viruses so this is even bigger so
what that's why we can't predict the

mutation rate is such that every genome

01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:28.390
mutation rate is such that every genome
 

01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:31.130
mutation rate is such that every genome
has a mutation and every human produces

has a mutation and every human produces
 

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:34.530

from mutation recombination and
 

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:37.849
from mutation recombination and
selection so that's why we have

percent of its genetic structure in five
days and that is the time it takes the

01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:56.020
days and that is the time it takes the
 

01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:57.930
days and that is the time it takes the
virus to pass from your mouth to your

01:10:57.930 --> 01:10:57.940
virus to pass from your mouth to your
 

01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:00.840
virus to pass from your mouth to your
gut five days and it will change two

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:00.850
gut five days and it will change two
 

01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:03.690
gut five days and it will change two
percent of its genome so that's why you

01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:03.700
percent of its genome so that's why you
 

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:05.310
percent of its genome so that's why you
see that viruses

01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320
see that viruses
 

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:07.800
see that viruses
can be so successful because they change

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:07.810
can be so successful because they change
 

01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:09.930
can be so successful because they change
so rapidly so viruses are not cows

01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:09.940
so rapidly so viruses are not cows
 

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:12.089
so rapidly so viruses are not cows
they're not humans and they're not to a

01:11:12.089 --> 01:11:12.099
they're not humans and they're not to a
 

01:11:12.099 --> 01:11:16.379
they're not humans and they're not to a
Drosophila a million years is really

01:11:16.379 --> 01:11:16.389
Drosophila a million years is really
 

01:11:16.389 --> 01:11:18.450
Drosophila a million years is really
nothing in terms of evolution and it's

01:11:18.450 --> 01:11:18.460
nothing in terms of evolution and it's
 

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:20.490
nothing in terms of evolution and it's
unfortunate that we can't study that but

01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:20.500
unfortunate that we can't study that but
 

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.439
unfortunate that we can't study that but
life has been around a lot longer so you

01:11:22.439 --> 01:11:22.449
life has been around a lot longer so you
 

01:11:22.449 --> 01:11:31.260
life has been around a lot longer so you
can imagine what viruses have done

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:31.270
 
 

01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:33.300
