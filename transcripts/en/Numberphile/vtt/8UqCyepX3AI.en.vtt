00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.340
JAMES GRIME: I'm
thrilled today.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.720
We've got a present.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.950
One of our viewers has
sent us a present,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.550
this mysterious box.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.710
And check out the warning
on the box. "Warning--

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.780
Contains numbers." Exciting?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.700
I think so.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.780
So shall we open up the box and
see what this present is?

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.720
We actually got two of these,
one for Brady, one for me.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.220
We really appreciate that.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.030
Thank you very much
for sending this.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.500
There we go.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.240
We have got some mysterious
object here.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.930
I'm not sure what it
is yet, Brady.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.180
BRADY: That's awesome.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.490
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, what do you
think it's going to be?

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.408
We're going to have
to plug it in.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.280
Now, this one's yours, Brady.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.280
I think you should have
the first press

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.200
of the big red button.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.998
BRADY: I have no idea what's
going to happen here.

00:00:56.998 --> 00:00:58.414
JAMES GRIME: Oh!

00:00:58.414 --> 00:01:00.340
[CLICKING]

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.590
JAMES GRIME: Try again?

00:01:04.128 --> 00:01:05.044
[CLICKING]

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:06.300
JAMES GRIME: Now, have
you worked out

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.300
what it's doing yet?

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.230
These are prime numbers.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.640
Each one is a new
prime number.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.880
It's a prime number generator.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.890
This was made by our viewer
Karl Lautman, and he makes

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.810
kinetic sculptures, these
sculptures that move and do

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.170
exciting things.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.410
And he's made a short
series of these, and

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.340
he sent us a couple.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.230
And you'll get the next
prime number.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.160
It's so satisfying, especially
if you like having a big red

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.515
button to press.

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:43.110
And it gives you a feeling
of the gaps between

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.410
the primes, as well.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.060
You see that some are short.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.364
[FAST CLICKING]

00:01:49.364 --> 00:01:50.940
JAMES GRIME: Oh,
that was nice.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.030
That was satisfying,
a nice, long gap.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.020
It's really nice.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.890
I mean, it's a bit
of silly fun.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.000
There's no practical use
to it or anything.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.967
But I love it.

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:04.236
[CLICKING]

00:02:04.236 --> 00:02:05.690
JAMES GRIME: You
can't reset it.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.470
You're stuck now.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.570
You have to go through all the
primes until you reach

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.410
999,999, and it will
wrap back to zero.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.810
Now we're about 251,000 here.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.280
Now, the prime number theorem,
one of the big theorems in

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.270
mathematics, says that the
average gap between the primes

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.180
should be round about the
natural log of 251,000.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.060
I know that's about 12,
so the average gap

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.060
should be about 12.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.250
Some are going to be bigger
than 12, some are smaller.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.620
Sometimes you get
a twin prime.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.510
[CLICKING]

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.780
JAMES GRIME: And sometimes
you get a long gap.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.630
But the really exciting number
to wait four is 492,113,

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.510
because at 492,113 you get the
longest prime gap that this

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.340
machine can generate.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.780
It's a gap of 114, so I think
that will be an exciting day,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.180
when we can get to 492,113.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.530
So Karl's put in a
microprocessor in this.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.900
I don't think it's doing
anything clever.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.430
I think it counts the gaps
between the primes.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.530
And he only has a
few of these.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.040
Perhaps we can put a link to his
websites, and he can tell

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.730
people about his work.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.660
That would be nice.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.810
But when they're gone, they're
gone, I'm afraid.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.700
It was such a surprise.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.190
I got a huge box delivered to
my work, and I had no idea

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.990
what it was.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.180
I wasn't told it was coming.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.780
So I had this huge box,
and I was digging

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.410
through all this packaging.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.140
And then this is what comes
out the other side.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.620
I plugged it in.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.050
It was given to me with a
letter, so I did kind of know

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.090
what it was.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.330
But it's the--

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.256
[CLICKING]

00:04:01.256 --> 00:04:03.200
JAMES GRIME: Oh, it's
the clicking noise.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.640
I mean, I was so thrilled.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.150
You do realize I had to pay
the import tax for this.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.850
BRADY: Really?

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.200
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.050
He paid me back.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.890
He paid me back.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.110
BRADY: Do you know what
I really want?

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.150
A twin prime.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.250
Give us a twin prime.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.370
JAMES GRIME: Of course.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.765
Of course I'll do
that for you.

00:04:20.765 --> 00:04:22.706
BRADY: Well, it won't be this.

00:04:22.706 --> 00:04:24.020
It could be this.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.445
[CLICKING]

00:04:25.445 --> 00:04:26.550
BRADY: Could be--

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.289
no.

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.112
JAMES GRIME: What about
a sexy prime?

00:04:31.112 --> 00:04:33.080
[CLICKING]

00:04:47.348 --> 00:04:51.776
[LAUGHING]

00:04:51.776 --> 00:04:54.236
[CLICKING]

00:04:54.236 --> 00:04:56.240
BRADY: Was that a twin prime?

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.375
JAMES GRIME: I think that
might have been

00:04:57.375 --> 00:04:58.510
a twin prime then.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.892
BRADY: Woo!

00:04:58.892 --> 00:04:59.656
Twin prime!

00:04:59.656 --> 00:05:02.890
JAMES GRIME: And it actually
shows you something about the

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.700
randomness of the primes.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.580
They turn up frequently,
but they're kind of

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.850
unpredictable as well.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.750
Karl has very kindly
signed it for us.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.800
He's dated it, and he's
numbered the primer.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.910
That's what he's called it.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.720
It's Primer Number 4.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.500
And I just showed this to
Brady, and he was very

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.820
disappointed because he hasn't
got a prime number.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.950
I got Number 3.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.410
I got Primer Number 3.
