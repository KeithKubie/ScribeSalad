00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.640
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Good afternoon.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.030
We're going to get started here.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.530
Thanks for your patience.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.360
I'm John Fenn, the head
of research and programs

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.770
at the American Folklife Center
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.050
And I'd like to welcome you
on behalf of all the staff

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.350
to the latest presentation

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.370
in our ongoing Benjamin
A. Botkin lecture series.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.400
The Botkin series allows
us to highlight the work

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.790
of leading scholars in the
discipline of folklore,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.570
ethnomusicology, oral
history, and cultural heritage,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.580
while enhancing our collections.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.880
For the center and the library,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.730
the Botkin lectures
form an important facet

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.410
of acquisition activities.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.620
Each lecture is video
recorded and becomes part

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.260
of our permanent collection.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.640
In addition, the lectures
are later posted as webcasts

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.440
in the library's website where
they are available for viewing

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.290
to internet patrons
throughout the world.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.180
So, now would be
an excellent time

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.020
to turn off your electronic
devices, and or put them

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.420
in airplane mode, lest you
become part of the recording.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.720
Today I have the honor

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.790
of introducing the distinguished
folklorist, Billy Jean Ancelet,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.580
a professor emeritus
at the University

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.480
of Louisiana at Lafayette.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.400
Over the years, we have
presented many eminent

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.560
colleagues, but few of them have
made a significant an impact

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.970
on the documentation, public
awareness, and revitalization

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.280
of their chosen areas
of interest

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.380
as has Professor Ancelet.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.600
Even fewer of them have
been officially knighted

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.830
by the Government of France
for their efforts [gasps].

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.740
Dr. Ancelet was born in Church
Point, Louisiana and grew

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.740
up in the epicenter of
Cajun and Creole culture.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.670
He French as an undergraduate
at what was then University

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.060
of Southwestern Louisiana, later
to be renamed the University

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.480
of Louisiana Lafayette, and
received a Master's in folklore

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.290
from Indiana University.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.700
At IU he taught for a few years
before moving on to a doctorate

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.780
in Etudes Creoles,
anthropology and linguistics,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.460
from the Universite de
Provence in Marseille in 1984.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.310
Professor Ancelet's
life-long commitment

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.110
to Louisiana culture has
served as a touchstone

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.590
for his many landmark
contributions as a scholar

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.850
and a culture activist, both
inside and outside the academy.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.110
He cofounded the Tribute
to Cajun Music in 1974,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.940
which developed into the
annual Festivals Acadiens.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.980
And for more than a decade
hosted the Rendez-vous des

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.340
Cajuns, an influential weekly
music radio program on KRVS.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.660
He has authored an impressive
number of books and articles,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.290
has been involved in
a number of recordings

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.960
and documentary films, and,
as an educator, has trained

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.010
and guided a generation of
scholars specializing in Cajun,

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.590
Creole, and Franco-American
culture.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.840
Ancelet has served as
chair of the University

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.450
of Louisiana Modern
Languages Department,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.560
as well as the founding
director of its renowned Center

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.650
for Acadian and Creole Folklore.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.270
His many other awards and honors
include being named the Willis

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.640
Granger and Tom Debaillon
Professor of Francophone Studies

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.250
in 2005 and being
made a Chevalier

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.530
in l Ordre des Arts et des
Lettres de la Republique

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.710
Francaise in 2006 by
the Governor of France

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.720
for important contributions
to French art and literature.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.690
In 2008 he was awarded the
prestigious Americo Paredes

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.980
Prize by the American
Folklore Socient.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.740
And, in 2009, he was named
Louisiana Humanist of the Year

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.050
by the Louisiana Endowment
for the Humanities.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.030
I would go on, but I think I've
given you a sense of why we are

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.980
so delighted to have Dr.
Ancelet here today with us.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.650
Please join me in welcoming
him for his talk on the theory

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.510
and practice of folklore in
Cajun and Creole Louisiana.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.500
[ Applause ]

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.570
&gt;&gt; Billy Jean Ancelet:
Thank you.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.260
It kind of made me
tired hearing all that.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.660
The first part of this
talk deals with how I got

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.210
into the study and
practice of folklore.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.770
The second deals with
what I learned and tried

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.100
to do after that happened.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.740
I will ramble.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.280
The story is pretty wild and
woolly, but I had a blast

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.830
and I got paid to do much of it.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.550
I grew up in Cajun -- in a
Cajun French-speaking family

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.920
in south Louisiana.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.470
As a child, I spent a lot
of time with the family

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.150
of my father's sister
in Vatican, Louisiana.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.150
They took care of me
while my parents worked.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.590
Only one person in the house
spoke a little English,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.600
so I grew up speaking French.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.710
When I was in the eighth
grade, I found myself

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.410
in an academic French
class for the first time.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.410
In it, French was taught

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.660
as though it were
a foreign language.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.220
In in the summer of 1967 I spent
six weeks in a study program

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.720
in Switzerland and France.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.250
When I returned, I
called my aunt in Vatican

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.130
to tell her about my trip.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.120
I was talking a mile a minute

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.220
about [speaking foreign
language] using the grammar

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.350
and vocabulary I
had learned aboard.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.020
My aunt interrupted me saying,
[speaking foreign language]

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.060
in perfect Cajun French.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.990
Baby, baby, it seems

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.040
like I can't understand
a word you're saying.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.340
I immediately understood

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.760
that I was imitating an
imported style of French.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.080
That was my first epiphany
concerning the value

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.340
of the vernacular.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.940
Fast-forward to 1974,
I was in Mamou,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.070
Louisiana once again trying
to track down Hugh Reed,

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.540
who you see here with the
black eye, to try to get him

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.310
to tell me some more
of the fascinating,

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.010
tall tales that would eventually
make up a significant part

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.940
of my dissertation, and would
be the subject of several

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.900
of the conference
papers, articles,

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.620
and books that would
eventually contribute

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.800
to my tenure and promotions.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.620
I asked a waitress in the
Travelers Cafe if she knew

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.130
where I might find him.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.510
She shot back with a curious
grin, you're looking for him?

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.810
When I see him coming,
I hide in the kitchen.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.880
I don't want to hear
all that nonsense.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.900
Not long after, I found myself
in a graduate French course

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.050
at Indiana University
on the literature

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.350
of [speaking foreign language].

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.550
We were considering [speaking
foreign language] from the end

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.650
of the 17th century, in which
his character tries to get

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.400
to the moon by filling hundreds
of bottles with dew and rising

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.030
with them in the morning.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.650
The little people he dreams of
meeting eventually make comments

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.880
about life in his country
of origin and their --

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.230
from their unique perspective.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.880
I raised my hand and pointed

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.590
out that I had collected
remarkably similar oral stories

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.080
from Hugh Reed [assumed
spelling] and his brothers,

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.380
Irving [assumed spelling]
and Revon,

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.660
in one of which Jim
Israel goes to the moon

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.810
in a runaway hay
baler by accident

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.870
and meets little green men
there who comment on life

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.770
in the storyteller's
native Mamou.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.950
I was fascinated by the apparent
resilience of this tradition

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.590
and narrative strategy
among people who after --

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.270
who were, after all
the descendants

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.220
of the French settlers who left
France in the same 17th-century

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.520
to come to America --

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.810
North America, and
eventually to Louisiana.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.550
My professor did not
understand why I would bring

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.770
up such an unrelated issue in
her class on French literature.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.780
I realized I might be
in the wrong place.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.690
By then, my highly improvised
early research on Cajun

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.300
and Creole music, folktales, and
language had made me understand

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.950
that my study of French
was driven by my interest

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.740
in understanding the Frenchness
[phonetic] of Louisiana.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.380
I decided that I would drop
the class, do my best to finish

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.230
out the semester, and go back
home to rethink my plans.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.420
But I had a card in my
pocket from Ralph Rentschler,

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.290
the director of the Smithsonian
Institution's folklife program,

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.740
who had assisted us in preparing
and presenting the first tribute

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.110
to Cajun music concert
in March of 1974.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.870
There he is between
two ballad singers.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.530
When I had mentioned
to him that I was going

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:52.770
to Indiana University, he gave
me his card with a message on it

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.520
and said that I should say hello
to his friend, Henry Glassie,

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.480
at IU's Folklore Institute.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.320
Out of a sense of
obligation after that incident

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.910
in the French class, I
dropped in to the institute

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.340
and asked the receptionist,
[inaudible],

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.420
if there was someone
named Henry Glassie there.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.720
I didn't know that Professor
Glassie was an internationally

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.020
renowned folklorist.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.630
It would've been
kind like, you know,

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.540
going to the College
de France and saying,

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.380
is there some guy named Claude
Levi-Strauss here [laughter]?

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.070
She gasped, pointed
behind her to his office,

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.390
and said, yeah, he's in there.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:34.810
I heard Glassie chuckle
and say, who is that?

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:36.800
I said, I'm Barry
Ancelet from Louisiana.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.420
He said, come on in.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.950
I introduced myself, handing him
Rentschler's card, and he said,

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.350
oh, you're from Louisiana.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.480
Do you know Dewey Balfa?

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.610
I nearly screamed, yes, I did.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.700
And then I told him
what had just happened.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.430
He said, well, maybe this
is where you need to be.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.760
I transferred to the
folklore program and was able

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.660
to preserve my ties
with the French program

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.120
through other professors there,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.830
including linguist
Albert Valdman

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.520
and Africanist Emile
Snyder, who understood

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.680
and encouraged my
particular interests.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.240
Why folklore?

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.040
I didn't even know there was
such an academic discipline

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.460
until I arrived at
Indiana University in 1974.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.200
Soon enough, I found
myself taking classes

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.550
from Richard Dorson, Linda
Dague, Mary Ellen Brown,

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.100
Bruce Rose, a literal who's
who in American folklore.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.950
I didn't know who
any of them were.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.940
I found out.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.340
But I had already
come to understand,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.270
through my experiences
in Louisiana, that the --

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.790
that the language
was inseparable

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.840
from the culture
that it expressed.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.510
Another thing that was
obvious was that very little

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.510
of this could be found
on library shelves.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.410
Ultimately, getting at
Louisiana's French heritage

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.970
and culture would require
-- would require --

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.110
An improvised hybrid
approach involving real people

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.520
in real time.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.060
That approach turned
out to be folklore.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.770
And I must say, also, that
some of this had to do

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.890
with the counterculture
movement.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:17.520
This was, after all, you know,
the late '60s, early '70s.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:23.140
And, you know, we were
interested in protesting.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.440
Are we good?

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.090
We were interested
in protesting.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.620
And, for us, the
counterculture was protesting

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.870
against Americanization, and
it involved revitalization

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.030
of Louisiana French
language and culture.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.100
No accident that the Council
for the Development of French

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.370
in Louisiana was
founded in 1968,

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.050
1968 when so many
other things happened.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.640
The study of culture,
literature, and language

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.400
through the lens of folklore
has been the foundation

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.640
for my entire career, which
I admit I have improvised all

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.940
along the way.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.010
I left in the Indiana University
with a master's degree

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.930
in folklore, and eventually
continued my graduate studies

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.630
at Aix-en-Provence where
I received a doctorate

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.690
in Creole studies,
combining anthropology

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.170
and linguistics working

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.470
with Robert Sonoseau
[assumed spelling]

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.420
and Jean-Claude Bouvier [assumed
spelling], who were reinventing

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:29.410
and reinvigorating the
study of orality in France.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:33.560
My thesis included that story
about the accidental voyage

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.660
to the moon, among many others

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.070
that I collected
throughout south Louisiana.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.790
I guess that it was fitting
because my theoretical approach

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.860
to just about everything I have
ever studied has been based

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.060
on the rich and fecund
principles of storytelling,

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.710
including improvisation,
vernacular creation,

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.470
and carnivalesque humor.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:56.510
I also dedicated my
first ever article,

00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:00.580
published as a folklorist,
to the waitress

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.460
in the Travelers
Cafe [laughter],

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.750
who never understood what a
supposedly serious college

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.670
student was doing looking
for somebody she tried

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.260
to get away from every day.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.610
I've often found myself
exploring issues whose academic

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.770
value has not been
immediately evident.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:20.100
Much of my research is
based on fieldwork in bars,

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.830
in barbershops, and dance halls

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.170
and back porches
and Mardi Gras runs.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.830
Can you find me?

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.000
[ Inaudible ]

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.390
Am I there?

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.850
No. I will appear to you.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.920
There I am [laughter].

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.220
From that perspective,

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.010
you really understand
the Mardi Gras.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.530
[ Inaudible ]

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.630
Oh, I'll leave that
to you to find.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.580
It's Mardi Gras after all.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.050
As per the old saw, it
has not always been easy,

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.030
but somebody had to do it.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.750
My research has resulted in
the usual articles and books,

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.160
but also in documentary films,
television, and radio programs,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.260
festivals, museum and
photographic exhibitions,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.380
album liner notes, public
lectures, literary readings,

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.890
teacher training seminars,

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.320
reports to state and
federal agencies.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.730
I'm grateful and fortunate that
my colleagues and administrators

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.030
at the University of Louisiana

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.900
at Lafayette have
been flexible enough

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.130
to recognize the
value of what I do.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.640
I've had a remarkably
collaborative career

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.020
by the honor of good fortune
to work with generous,

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.810
inspiring colleagues,
including editors, filmmakers,

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:38.510
sound engineers, production
crews, fellow teachers,

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:43.740
folklorists, historians,
linguists, poets, playwrights,

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.450
screenplay writers,
photographers, journalists,

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:54.130
a few politicians,
lawyers, and even a chef.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.680
They've all provided me with
the countless opportunities

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.360
for collaboration and
years of inspiration

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.640
and dedication to
our common causes.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.710
They all taught me how to
read and write and look

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.090
and listen and wonder.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.570
I owe a debt -- a debt
of gratitude, as well,

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.840
to the singers and storytellers
and Mardi Gras runners

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.710
and dancers, including my
family and community of friends,

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.660
who have always so generously
shared what they know and do

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.550
with me, most of them
[speaking foreign language],

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.560
learn much of what
I have come to know

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.580
from vernacular professors, such
as Dewey Balfa and Ben Guine

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.550
and Clifton Chenier and
Canray Fontenot, [inaudible],

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.760
Hugh and Irvine Reed,
among many others.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.360
I've been honored to work
with them and learn from them,

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.860
and I've come to love
them all as friends.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.870
I've had the honor of
eulogizing many of them

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.840
when they passed away.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.530
It was never only the songs
and the stories and the crafts,

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.480
it was the coffee and
camaraderie, the bull sessions

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.120
and the jam sessions and the
fishing trips and the serious

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.100
and casual conversations
about almost everything

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.490
and nothing in particular.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.970
The rest of this talk focuses on
the relationship between theory

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.560
and the practice of folklore
between what folklorists think

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.350
and how they convey the results
of that thought to a range

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.450
of audiences from
other colleagues

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:08.750
to the general public.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.310
First, a word about
theory and practice.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:15.710
Some folklorists have seen
a dichotomy between the two.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:19.530
I have always seen them as
inextricably integrated.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:22.480
I'm typically more interested
in discussing the practice

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.340
than the theory, but
both are always in play.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.740
I came to understand,
for myself,

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.020
what Regina Bendix
eventually theorized in her --

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.330
in search of authenticity
in countless conversations

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:39.270
with musicians and storytellers
and the makers of things

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.950
about the [inaudible], as well

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:47.350
as what Elaine Lawless
eventually called reciprocal

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.810
fieldwork by negotiating
meaningful

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:53.550
and productive relationships
with countless,

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.430
generous collaborators,
whom I learned early

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.410
on were much more
than just informants.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:06.980
In my transcriptions of the
recorded interviews I made

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.720
with them, I still cannot bring
myself to identify them as L1

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.470
and L0 as linguistic
practice recommends.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.910
The most -- for example,

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.350
the most I will reduce
Eva Boudreaux,

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.140
with whom I shared
storytelling sessions

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.320
and watched shoot squirrels
out of her back door, is EB.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:30.590
I came to understand
what an implement --

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.780
and there she is
shooting squirrels

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.370
in the backyard [laughter].

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.760
I came to understand and
implement issues that scholars,

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.660
such as Walter Ong,
Paul Zumthor,

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.960
Pierre Borgia [assumed
spelling],

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.240
and Bruce Jackson
articulated concerning orality

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.540
and the challenge
of interpreting

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.300
and representing stories
in written form by trudging

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.280
through an evolution
of strategies

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.130
to resolve these
issues for my own --

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:53.460
for my use in my own work.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.470
I came to improvise takeoffs

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.270
on what Clifford
Geertz called deep play,

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.160
and what Mikhail Batin
[assumed spelling]

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.930
and Victor Turner called the
carnivalesque laughter while

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:08.260
lying face down in the middle

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.960
of the [inaudible] Mardi
Gras circle dressed

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.720
as a pregnant woman waiting
to be ritually flogged

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.860
and then giving birth to a
bottle of whiskey [laughter].

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:21.560
From that perspective,
you learn a lot.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.840
You understand a lot
about Mardi Gras.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.150
I came to understand the
importance of performance

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.600
and contextual considerations
described by scholars

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.870
such as Roger Abrahams, Kenny
Goldstein, and Nick Spitzer

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.800
by thinking through the very
real and evolving performance

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.730
and contextual issues
involved in documenting

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:44.860
and presenting folk performers
and putting those into practice

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.720
in festivals and
concerts, museum exhibitions

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.680
and documentary films,
in radio programs

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.980
and community presentations --

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.570
In what I have come to
call guerrilla academics,

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.820
sneaking education to people
while they think they're

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.950
being entertained.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.280
For me, theories are
not ends in themselves.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.410
They are, instead, the tools and
blueprints I need to understand

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.750
and present what I am studying.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.910
By any means necessary, to
borrow from Jean-Paul Sartre

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.740
and Malcolm X, I have imported
some, improvised variance

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.630
of others, and then I use them.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:25.280
For me, the pursuit

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.770
of the universal always
began with the local.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:33.700
The universe, after all, is made
up of an infinity of localities.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.240
The practice of folklore
generally starts with fieldwork,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.070
the process of gathering
information

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.370
from cultural sources.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:43.110
For me, it was the only way
to reach the information

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.720
that was otherwise
missing from the record.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.950
The most important, untapped
source for the information

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:55.150
on Cajuns and Creoles are
Cajuns and Creoles themselves.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.080
The fieldwork-based approach

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.810
of folkloristics provides a
method to reach that source.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.760
The naturally interdisciplinary
nature

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.100
of folkloristics necessarily
integrating considerations

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:11.530
of history and art, text and
context provides the wide range

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:15.260
of approaches that necessary
to understand the complexities

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.330
of culture and tradition,
including oral tradition,

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.280
traditional music, vernacular
architecture, folk art,

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.580
seasonal rituals, and
other cultural expressions.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.310
Folkloristics also
leads to considerations

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.210
of important cultural and social
issues, such as conservation,

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.720
transmission, and innovation
within the context of tradition.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.020
And folkloristics

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.400
and linguistics make perfect
partners in the effort

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.610
to understand the context
of French Louisiana.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.800
Now, getting back to earlier.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.460
The reason I knew Dewey Balfa

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.020
when Henry Glassie asked is
another part of the story.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:58.050
In 1972 I spent an academic
year in France, '72, '73.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.630
Homesick after nearly
a year away

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.630
from my native south Louisiana,
I was drawn to an announcement

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:07.140
of Roger Mason performing
[speaking foreign language].

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:12.970
There's the countercultural
connection.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.140
There, among many other songs,

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.490
I heard him playing
what I recognized

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.950
to be a simplified version
of the Crowley Two-Step.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:32.040
[ Music ]

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.840
I heard that when I
was buying my ticket.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:41.330
[ Music ]

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:46.540
And when I heard that, it
hit me like a ton of bricks.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.130
I said, that's what I'm missing.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.960
That's what's been missing here.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:55.360
And, so, I rushed down and had
a wonderful evening with him.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.640
After the concert, I met with
Mason, an American folk musician

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.090
who had encountered Cajun music
on the folk festival circuit,

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.730
and who was then
performing it in France.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.760
I told him how much I
appreciated hearing --

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.600
he was an Army brat and
traveled all over the world.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:16.490
I told him how much I
appreciated hearing the music

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:17.790
from home.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.080
Growing up in the late 1950's
and '60s, I listened to rock

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.870
and roll like the
rest of my generation,

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:25.800
but we heard Cajun music on
the radio, on television,

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.770
and when it was daddy's
turn to choose the records.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.070
Mason said, if you're

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:31.950
from Louisiana you must know
the people I learned from,

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.950
Dewey Balfa, Nathan Abshire.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.470
I didn't know any of
them at that point.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.860
They had not come up in any
of my classes back home.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.870
Mason suggested if I was
interested in learning more,

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:46.550
I should look up Dewey Balfa
upon my return to Louisiana.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.960
That's exactly what I did.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.030
I want to Dewey Balfa's
house just south of Basile,

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.950
introduced myself, telling him

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.490
about the experience
I had in France.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:56.790
I said, are you Dewey Balfa?

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.620
Yeah. Well, my name
is Barry Ancelet

00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.920
and I [making sounds
with mouth].

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.000
I was talking like
an auctioneer.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.920
He said, calm down,
son [laughter].

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.820
Come on in, said the spider
to the fly [laughter].

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:14.150
And the rest, as
they say, is history.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:20.760
We started a conversation
that went on -- sorry.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.060
That's him.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.440
We started a conversation that
went on for nearly two decades.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.370
I learned at least
as much from Dewey

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:30.360
as from any professor I ever had
in any formal academic setting.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.820
People are most aware of my
work in Cajun and Creole music,

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.900
perhaps because of
the high visibility

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.220
of Festivals Acadiens et
Creoles, which I helped found

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.080
and still direct, and the weekly
Liberty Theater live radio show,

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.900
which I did for 24 years.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.110
But what first drew me
to the study of Cajun

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:49.060
and Creole folk cultures
was oral tradition.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.220
My first book, Cajun
and Creole Music Makers,

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.200
grew out of my work with
musicians, but it was based more

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.660
on their stories
than their music.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.190
Elemore Morgan Junior
and I got the idea

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.810
to visit the musicians
involved in the first festival

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.630
to visit them where they
lived, worked, and played,

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.100
to interview them about
their lives and experiences,

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.970
and to photograph them
in their own worlds.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:21.080
This is Vares Connor [assumed
spelling], well-known, or,

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.090
not so well-known fiddler.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:26.170
Nathan Abshire on
his front porch.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.130
What we were doing
was indeed fieldwork,

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.030
but it felt more like visiting.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:38.980
It was our intention to see
and hear in their own terms,

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.850
as I wrote in the introduction,
these barbers and bus drivers

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.370
and farmers and firefighters
and mechanics and masons,

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.630
who sell discount furniture
and discount gas and insurance

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.140
and insulation work nine to
five and seven to seven, onshore

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:55.330
and offshore, and make
art out of everyday life,

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:57.920
because they were
becoming important figures

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.290
in this cultural
self-preservation experiment.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.390
Elemore and I worked for
10 years on the project,

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.340
collecting oral histories
and taking photographs

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.340
of these remarkable
performers in various contexts,

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.850
from their kitchens and front
porches, to festival stages

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.940
and concert halls, in
Louisiana and far beyond.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:18.510
Around the same time,
I became interested

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.050
in Louisiana French
fictional tales.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.350
French-speaking Cajuns

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:24.990
and Creoles had virtually
no literary tradition

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:27.840
since most did not have
the opportunity to learn

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.880
to read or write French.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.940
Yet, we did have a tradition
of oral poetry in songs

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.290
and oral stories in tales.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:38.830
And just because
the storytellers

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:41.780
and singers could not themselves
write their own stories

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.620
and songs, this did not
mean that the stories

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.690
and songs could not be written
by someone who had learned

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.430
to write the language
of their expression.

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:51.820
In an attempt to place these
traditions and [inaudible]

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:56.780
that they represent
on the record,

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.260
I began recording folktales,
as well as folksongs

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.390
and transcribing them.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.350
Lacking any formal
training in the beginning,

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:09.210
I improvised my own first
fieldwork forays based

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:12.040
on instinct and good intentions.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.020
You know, that road
to hell [laughter]?

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.080
I found that identifying
potential singers was

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.380
fairly easy.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:23.010
Friends and family members
were generally aware of those

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.820
in their midst who can sing.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:28.440
Identifying storytellers proved
to be more of a challenge.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.750
Everybody tells stories,
but who knows who does?

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:37.840
At least initially, when --
like some of my predecessors,

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.630
Alcee Fortier, Elizabeth
Brandon, Corinne Saucier.

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:46.020
I was using fieldwork techniques
designed to elicit the kind

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.240
of animal tales and magic tales

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.450
that clearly illustrate
the connection

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:52.920
between French Louisiana
and its historical

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.200
and cultural roots
in France and Africa.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.860
I was confounded by
this curious difficulty

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.050
in finding those
kinds of stories,

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.420
found some, but it was hard.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:07.490
And it began to occur to me
that something must be wrong.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.690
Corinne Saucier had
written in the introduction

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:14.220
to her collection of 33
Louisiana French folktales

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.990
that her collection of
33 stories was small,

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:21.670
but representative of a culture
that was fast disappearing

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.650
in our mechanized age.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:27.370
I thought, there's
something wrong with this,

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:32.730
because my admittedly activist
perspective made me unwilling

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.990
to admit that the tradition
was dying and, second,

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:37.840
I knew that there
were stories out there

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:42.580
because of the thousands
I had heard over the years

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:46.430
in my father's barbershop
where I spent many afternoons

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:49.980
after school and around barbecue
pits and in shipping boats --

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:56.480
in fishing boats and lots
of other places, in bars.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.480
So, I rethought my fieldwork
strategy and I realized

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.260
that it was more
effective to look

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.760
for storytellers than stories.

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:10.750
That information

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:13.850
about carnivalesque humor was
more likely to come from folks

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.590
in a bar or a barbershop
or a garage

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.420
than from those running
City Hall

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.210
or local museums or churches.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.960
An essential aspect of my change

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.760
in methodology involved
being open to any context

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.060
and form of storytelling.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.640
I found people remembered
from long ago --

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.240
I found that my early method
had exposed the tradition

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.240
of memory stories that some
people remembered from long ago,

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.450
but no longer really
actively told.

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:45.440
While my new approach exposed
a more active tradition,

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:49.140
jokes and tall tales and
personal experience narratives

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.280
that people were telling
each other on their own,

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.890
unprompted by a folklorist
question.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.850
I basically learned
to shut up and listen.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.370
It became -- quickly
became clear

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.710
that stories were not
ends in themselves.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.340
The storytellers themselves
were the real treasures.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.510
My aim was to consider their
ability to adapt, innovate,

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.940
create new forms of stories

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.940
through their talent
and personality.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.630
Their willingness to share
their knowledge was essential

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.250
to the progress of my research.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:24.060
The first time I met Mrs.
Eva Boudreaux, for example,

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:28.260
she told me four stories, that's
the lady shooting the gun back

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.780
in -- she told me four stories,

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.680
including an animal tale
featuring [speaking foreign

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.490
language], a version of
[speaking foreign language],

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:40.440
the first from African origins,
the second from French origins,

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.870
responding to my
request for such tales.

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:44.750
By the time I visited
her one year later,

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:48.160
I had had my epiphany and
opened my consideration of tales

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.200
to include anything
she wanted to tell.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.980
She told me seven more stories.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.930
Some of them jokes,
personal experience stories.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:58.640
When I returned home that
night, I found a message

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.420
that Mrs. Boudreaux had
called saying she wanted --

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.910
she had some more stories
she wanted to tell me.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.210
I said, I know.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:08.170
I went earlier today
to record her.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:10.950
My mother said, no, no, she just
called and said she wants you

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:13.000
to go back tomorrow because
she's got some more she forgot

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.990
to tell you today.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:18.780
I returned the next day and
she told me eight more stories.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.030
Over the years, she dredged up
dozens and dozens and dozens

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:25.120
of stories from her
memory to tell me,

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:30.240
many of them while waiting for
the bass to bite in her pond.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.660
Similarly, I first met Ben
Guine while tracking down leads

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:38.040
on storytellers the old way,
in Parks, Parks, Louisiana,

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.660
a place called Promised Land.

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:42.790
A little boy who had won
the foot race to my truck

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:47.060
when I asked a group of children
for help in finding where people

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.560
on my list lived,
eventually took me

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.070
to his grandfather's house.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:52.760
He went with us to
the last house

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.310
and heard what we
were asking for and,

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.610
when we left disappointed

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.230
because the lady didn't tell
those kinds of stories, he said,

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.690
my grandfather tells
those stories.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.480
So, we took -- went to
his grandfather's house

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:10.530
and there I met Ben Guine, who
quite literally left a plate

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.530
of steaming crawfish stew
on his kitchen table to come

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:17.510
into the living room to tell
us tales, literally preferring

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:20.260
to tell stories than eat.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.260
Over the years he, too, told me
dozens of stories of all sorts.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:26.560
His remarkable storytelling
talents and wide repertoire

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.980
of stories eventually attracted
considerable attention,

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:34.240
including a filming session by
Louisiana Public Broadcasting

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.750
on the porch of his little house

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.880
in Promised Land
along the Bayou Teche.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:44.190
To the astonishment and eventual
delight of his neighbors,

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:47.880
who had stopped listening
to his stories years before,

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.990
but now LPB was there, and
a few weeks later he appears

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:55.970
on television and, so,
Ben gets reconsidered

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.080
in his own community.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.320
Based on a philosophy of
cultural activism again,

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:05.590
I tried to find ways to
integrate people like this

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:06.890
into the ongoing effort

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.500
to preserve Louisiana's
French language and culture.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.800
Mrs. Boudreaux, Ben Guine,

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.140
and several other storytellers
appeared in storytelling events

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.890
at festivals and
schools, thrilling crowds

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:20.670
and schoolchildren with
their impressive repertoires

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:23.670
and masterful styles.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.830
Sometimes in addition to,
sometimes instead of documenting

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:30.260
and analyzing past performances
within the scholarly community,

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:34.140
some folklorists strive
to program and present one

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:37.750
of those next performances in a
setting that will communicate it

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:42.340
to a wider audience, not
on the page but on a stage.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.500
This practice brings
challenges of its own.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.580
For example, the most
sensitively programmed cultural

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.730
presentation at a folk
festival is not the same

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.930
as the natural performance
in its own time and place.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:57.660
But some of these
concerns can be resolved,

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.400
or at least mitigated, with
the same sort of careful

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.650
and serious study of performance
and context as that produced

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:07.250
in the academic setting.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.660
Programming issues
were directly related

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.810
to the activist fieldwork
and archival philosophies

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.740
at the heart of the University
of Louisiana Center for Acadian

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.070
and Creole Folklore,
now a part of the Center

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:19.660
for Louisiana Studies.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.230
The theoretical issues
underpinning the fieldwork

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:26.160
that initially led to the
production of the first tribute

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:32.100
to Cajun Music Festival, March
26, 1974, as well as the issues

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:36.670
that emerged and evolved as the
concert became an annual event,

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.830
were directly related
to the establishment

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:41.560
of the center's archives.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.680
The programming of the festival
was based on an integration

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.190
of ideas that grew out
of two distinct camps.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:53.040
On the one hand, activist
folklife-based considerations

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:56.280
as influenced by the Smithsonian
Institution's Festival

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.140
of American Folklife
and, on the other,

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.940
linguistic-based considerations
that grew out of the Council

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.980
for the development of French
and Louisiana's language

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.870
and cultural preservation
initiatives.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:11.240
Fieldwork and programming
practices evolved based

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.930
on a desire to discover

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.360
and present excellent
folk performers

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:20.610
from real life context, avoiding
more self-conscious public

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:23.190
purveyors of folkloric culture.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.690
The fieldwork practices
that grew

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.770
out of the festival
experience also contributed

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:33.190
to the fieldwork practices
that address the collection

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:35.830
and analysis of other
traditional genres

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:37.810
in French Louisiana,
including oral tradition

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:39.120
and material culture.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.150
Selecting the collection
of performers

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:45.600
who would essentially define
the moment in Cajun music

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.540
and zydeco each year
posed interesting problems

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.740
and opportunities for
festival producers,

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.470
including the incorporation
of young performers

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:56.920
and the new emerging styles
that are a necessary part

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.330
of any living tradition.

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:02.870
Dewey Balfa put it best.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:06.970
He said, I'm interested in the
very life of this culture --

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.240
And how it continues to
evolve its own terms.

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.970
I don't want to freeze dry
it or pin it to the wall

00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:19.410
like a dead butterfly.

00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:22.570
Dewey was not only a musician,
but what folklorists have come

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:24.470
to call a community scholar.

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:27.520
That is, a member of a folk
community who has learned

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:31.310
to address the issues that
are at the heart of the study

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:34.260
and practice of folklore,
such as cultural equity

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.120
and the relationship between
preservation and innovation

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.540
within the traditional context.

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.000
Inspired by Dewey and
enriched by his connections

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.230
to the Smithsonian folklife
program staff, including,

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.520
especially, Ralph Rentschler,
who had first recorded him

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:59.160
in 1964 as a fieldworker for
the Newport Folk Festival,

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:03.960
we prepared the first tribute to
Cajun Music Festival together.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.650
The fieldwork we did for the
festival was a natural extension

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:09.400
of the fieldwork that had
begun with John and Alan Lomax,

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.760
who collected folksongs in
Louisiana for the Library

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.510
of Congress in 1930
-- in the 1930's.

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:15.810
The Lomax's had a sort

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:19.390
of new deal style
activist agenda intending

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:21.050
for their collection
to serve as the basis

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:22.810
for cultural recycling projects

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:24.980
in regions throughout
the country.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.660
Based on his experience in
French Louisiana in 1934,

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.450
and from his position on the
Newport Folk Festival board

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:35.880
in 1964, Alan sent Ralph
Rentschler and Mike Seeger

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.320
to Louisiana to identify
musicians who would be invited

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.970
to perform at Newport
later that year.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:44.920
Following leads from Harry
Auster, who had collected

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.770
in the area a few years before,
they found Gladdie Thibodeaux,

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:51.520
Louis Venesse LeJeune,
and Dewey Balfa,

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.750
who served as a last-minute
replacement

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:56.140
on guitar, by the way.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.400
Dewey noted that they initially
thought the crowd hated their

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.020
music because they
weren't dancing [laughter].

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:09.410
Then, at the end of that first
song, the crowd applauded.

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:14.070
It was an experience the dance
hall musicians had never had,

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.350
but also one they never forgot.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.610
Dewey reported turning
to Venesse and saying,

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.910
what are they doing [laughter]?

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:25.940
He was overwhelmed
by this reception

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.590
for what was often
dismissed as nothing

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.510
but chanky-chank
[phonetic] back home.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.640
Came back home to
Louisiana determined

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.940
to spread the good news,

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.140
that Cajun music was
appreciated outside the area.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.170
He maintained close contact with
Rentschler, who became director

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:43.540
of folklife programs at
the Smithsonian in '68.

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.770
There, Rentschler went on to
produce the annual Festival

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.070
of American Folklife,

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:51.090
celebrating the country's
rich, cultural diversity.

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:53.840
These festivals often
featured Cajun and Creole music

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.190
that Rentschler had encountered
during his early fieldwork.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:59.920
Through his steady
contact with Rentschler

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.520
and other folklorists,
Balfa learned to articulate

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.270
such issues as cultural
conservation

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:07.980
and the process of tradition.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:13.380
The first Cajun music festival
was an overwhelming success,

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:19.390
surprising even the most
enthusiastic of his organizers.

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:21.260
Musicians were selected
according to the --

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.740
to notions of cultural
authenticity established

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.330
by Rentschler and Balfa.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:29.800
No crooners, Rentschler
cautioned.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.870
His preference for the high,
clear, the high-pitched vocals

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:35.900
and unadorned instrumental
styles

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:39.260
of early Cajun music
dominated the evening.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.560
The concert was structured

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.380
to feature the historical
development of Cajun

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.130
and Creole music, ballad
singers, Inez Catalan

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:48.820
and Marcus Landry, twin fiddlers
Dennis McGee and Sady Courville,

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.010
early stylists, Mark
Savoir [assumed spelling],

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:53.290
Lionel Leleux, and Vares
Connor, Nathan Abshire,

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:56.360
the Balfa brothers, the Ardwin
[assumed spelling] family,

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.760
as well as more modern
sounds of Clifton Chenier,

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.910
[inaudible], and the Cajun Aces.

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:03.900
Cajun country star, Jimmy
Newman, originally from Mamou,

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.720
but then living in Nashville,
whose hit Lache Pas La Patate,

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.940
was in full swing, was used

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:14.870
to anchor the concert despite
his sophisticated instrumental

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:17.510
arrangements and silky vocals.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:22.340
Even Rentschler saw the wisdom
of Dewey's brilliant plan

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:25.530
to use Newman's popularity
to attract a crowd

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:28.630
that would then be there to
hear the rest of the evening.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.910
It worked.

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:33.600
The many in attendance
commented then and later

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.880
that they had come to
hear Newman and were,

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.020
in some cases reminded of,
and in others, surprised,

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:42.320
by the power of the more
traditional performers.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:47.390
The festival packed Lafayette's
Blackham Coliseum far past

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:48.720
fire code.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.690
Despite lightning,
thunder, and driving rain,

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:54.700
it turned out to be the
largest mass rally of what came

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.260
to be called the Louisiana
French Renaissance Movement.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:00.260
I knew the fire -- you
can see the crowd there.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.680
I knew the fire marshal
wouldn't shut us

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.960
down because his dad was playing
in the third group [laughter].

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.710
Southern politics.

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:11.620
Organizers also saw
the opportunity

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.300
to use the energy produced
by this initial concert

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.670
to fuel a long-term project.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:18.230
In the momentum of the moment,

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.920
the university created
the Center for the Acadian

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.600
and Creole Folklore to integrate
this new field of study

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.400
into the academic community.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.580
Balfa, who had seen the benefit
of the archives at the Library

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.580
of Congress, and at the
Smithsonian Institution,

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:34.490
insisted that we needed a
similar bank of information

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:37.070
on ourselves in Louisiana.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.860
When I pointed out that I didn't
have the financial resources

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.010
to produce an archive,
Balfa pointedly asked,

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.630
do you have enough
money to buy one tape?

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:46.930
I said, yeah.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.460
He continued, then buy one.

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:51.580
Go out and record an interview
and put that tape on the shelf.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.280
Then record another one
when you can afford it.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.550
And when you put that second
tape next to the first one

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:59.310
on the shelf, you have the
beginnings of an archive.

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:01.440
He was right, as usual.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.330
The beginnings of
the archive were just

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:05.900
that homemade, and it worked.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.340
But, at the same time, counsel
for the development of French

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.010
in Louisiana bought
dozens of tapes

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:14.270
and funded early recording
efforts using fieldwork tapes

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:15.880
in French radio programming.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.370
Soon enough, we also
received financial support

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:21.910
from the Rockefeller Foundation
that paid for hundreds of tapes,

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.160
which were recorded and
gathered on the shelves

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.800
to extend the archive.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.030
We also contacted folklorists
who had worked in Louisiana

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:33.620
in the past, such as Lomax,
Auster, and Rentschler,

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.260
who were all happy
to provide copies

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:39.670
of their fieldwork collections.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:43.680
So, gathered -- finally gathered
in one place for the first time,

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.810
the center's archives provided
a sense of the evolution

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:50.330
and development of
Cajun and Creole music

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:52.700
from unaccompanied
ballad tradition

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.560
to contemporary dance
band styles.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:56.940
Fieldwork on oral tradition

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.150
and material culture
was added as well.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:02.160
The field work of students

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.220
and colleagues enriched our
understanding of who we were

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.700
and how we had come
to be that way.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.270
But the collection was not
meant to be an end in itself.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.940
Instead, it was always intended
to serve as a resource --

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:18.140
a resource for cultural
recycling.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.690
For example, when the
center acquired copies

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:25.800
of Lomax's 1934 field
recordings, it was not only

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:30.530
to repatriate this important
research for archival purposes.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:33.320
Copies were also
provided to the families

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.050
of the original performers

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:39.600
and contemporary musicians were
encouraged to use the collection

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:44.660
as a source for new,
brand-new old songs.

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.640
This eventually happened.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.340
Where's my cursor?

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:04.790
Well. I was going
to let you hear it.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.030
&gt;&gt; You can see it on the screen.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:08.330
&gt;&gt; Billy Jean Ancelet: You
can see it on the screen?

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:09.630
[ Inaudible ]

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.930
Okay.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:22.360
[ Music ]

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:26.510
This is [inaudible] from the
Lomax recordings from '34.

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:32.290
[ Music ]

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:34.790
Oops, sorry.

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:39.510
And this is from 2007.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:53.040
[ Music ]

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:56.450
Isn't that remarkable?

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:58.880
As Anna Chairetakis,
Alan's daughter,

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.540
said when I played
some of this for her,

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.550
my God, it worked [laughter].

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:07.910
In the spirit of cultural
recycling, scholars

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:12.120
and staffers associated
with the Center for Acadian

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.850
and Creole Folklore have
participated in the production

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:16.000
of festivals and special
performances, television,

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.250
radio programs, and offered
classes and workshops

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:21.470
through the university's
French and Francophone studies

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.780
and music school programs,
produced books and articles,

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:27.770
communicate new discoveries,
and interpretations

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:30.440
to the local community, as well
as the scholarly community.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.110
There were precious few books
and articles available on Cajun

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:36.250
and Creole culture, and most of
the few that there had been done

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:39.060
by outsiders who often
misunderstood the culture.

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:42.090
I became interested in writing
so that there would be some,

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:44.620
but books and articles do
not reach the larger --

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:48.460
the large audience of Cajuns
and Creoles themselves,

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:50.130
who especially needed
to have access

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:52.010
to information about themselves.

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:55.600
So, center associates
explored other ways

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.270
to disseminate our findings.

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:00.070
We joined forces
with record producers

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.340
to release archival recordings.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.330
We worked with radio
producers and filmmakers

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:07.400
to produce special programs
and documentaries, collaborated

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.570
with educational
institutions to make singers

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:12.460
and storytellers
available for classes

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.380
and special lecture series.

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:17.850
This research typically
focuses on contemporary,

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:20.370
as well as historical
aspects of these issues,

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:23.450
considering folklore as a
vital ongoing process rather

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:25.940
than a stagnant product.

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.820
Of particular interest is
the process of Creolization,

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.700
the unique blending of cultures
that occurred in Louisiana

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.460
to produce the folk
architecture, music,

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:37.130
oral tradition, and
cuisine of the region.

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:39.220
Through this range
of activities,

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.940
we try to integrate both sides
of folkloristics, the scholarly,

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.690
and the public without
getting caught

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:47.800
in the perceived
trap between the two.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.340
Folk festivals have often --

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:54.870
tend to follow a high-energy
model oriented toward large

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.560
audiences developed
decades ago at such events

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:00.510
as the National Folk Festival
and the Newport Folk Festival.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:02.800
This method of presentation
is had positive effects,

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.860
not the least of which has been
providing the national level

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.370
validation for regional
folk performers

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.860
by having them perform on
stages high off the ground

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:16.100
with fancy electronic
amplification before large,

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.220
enthusiastic audiences,

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:21.390
often alongside nationally
known performers.

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:24.940
This method also has
certain limitations.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:29.690
A quieter, more intimate
performance genres are difficult

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:32.520
to program in such
high-energy settings.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.320
In most cultures, ballad singing
is intended for listeners,

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.320
that is, without dancing.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.590
It does not usually
happen before thousands,

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:41.310
or even hundreds, of people.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:43.440
In a large festival
setting, both audience

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.290
and performer must be prepared
for this change in format.

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:51.010
Smaller, more intimate so-called
workshops can provide a more

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:54.100
familiar intimate setting, but
even these may not be enough

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:59.780
to set a cultural event in
its best performance context.

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.960
By carefully -- drawing on
careful observation of the rules

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.960
in nature of cultural
performance

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.340
in a natural setting,
folklorists can develop better,

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.150
more sensitive, and
more effective

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:12.450
and less abusive methods
of presenting folklore

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.970
and folklife in public settings.

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:24.560
Storytelling, for
example, has been one

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.600
of the most difficult cultural
features to program effectively

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.090
in a festival setting.

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:32.910
Usually storytellers are
tacitly expected to perform

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:36.770
as standup comics, though
many do not possess the skills

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:40.170
for entertaining the masses, nor
are they necessarily interested

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:42.310
in developing those skills.

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:44.500
But settings can be
renegotiated to work better

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.640
for performer and
audience as well.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.800
Storytelling is generally, by
nature, an intimate performance

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.290
that occurs among a small group
of people who know each other

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:54.320
and share a common
language and references.

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:57.850
Some storytellers can go a long
way toward reaching a festival

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:00.940
or a concert size audience,
which may number in the hundreds

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:02.470
or thousands, but a crowd

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:05.830
that large will strain
even the most outstanding

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:07.540
traditional performer.

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:08.960
During a performance
of what used

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:13.390
to be our university's French
House, Creole storyteller,

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:18.170
Ben Guine, that I met that
night over crawfish etouffee,

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:21.330
renegotiated his audience
in a remarkable way.

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:25.530
A crowd of some 70 people showed
up to hear his extraordinary --

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:28.270
this extraordinary
storyteller perform.

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:30.750
He was pleased with the show
of interest, but, as he began,

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:32.860
I noticed that something
was off.

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:37.410
He was telling well,
but he wasn't taking off

00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:39.950
as I had heard him do so often
while listening to his stories

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:42.600
in his living room or
on his front porch.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.220
I realized later
that he was straining

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:46.380
to engage every person
in the room.

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.300
He realized this before I did.

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:49.600
I was sitting next to him.

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.630
About a third of the way through
the first story he accidentally

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:55.270
bumped my knee during one
of his expansive gestures.

00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:58.090
He was trying to hug everybody.

00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:03.490
When he noticed I was within
reach, he turned his chair

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:07.790
to face me and proceeded
to tell me the stories.

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:11.330
I was an audience he could
handle, tapping and pushing

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:13.460
and pinching me to make
appropriate points.

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:15.760
I was also an audience
he trusted,

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.100
because I understood
the stories.

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.410
He knew that.

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:22.150
He hit stride and the rest

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:27.730
of the evening the crowd
watched him tell me stories,

00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:30.500
which was much better
for everyone concerned.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.980
When I realize what had
happened, I began experimenting

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:35.700
with new formats for
programming storytelling based

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:40.240
on the concept that Ben had
instinctively put into practice.

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:43.340
This programming strategy, a
sort of theater in the round

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.810
where storytellers tell each
other stories while the audience

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:47.620
listens in, became the basis

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.300
for the Louisiana Storytellers'
Pavilion that travelled

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:54.010
to festivals throughout
the state in 1984.

00:48:55.770 --> 00:49:01.200
By 1974, when Dewey Balfa talked
the Council for the Development

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.990
of French in Louisiana into
sponsoring the first Tribute

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:06.410
to Cajun Music concert,
he had already come

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.590
to understand enough about
the dynamics of context

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:11.530
and performance from his
own experiences to know

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:15.700
that a Cajun crowd would dance
if it were at all possible,

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.210
as they did every Saturday night

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:20.300
in dance halls throughout
south Louisiana.

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.530
The intent of the concert
we were producing was

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:25.490
to enable Cajuns to appreciate
the value of their own music

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:27.380
by getting them to listen to it.

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:31.440
So, he strongly suggested
holding the concert in a setting

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.680
where dancing would
not be possible.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.780
That evening 12,000
Cajuns wiggled

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:42.000
in their seats [laughter] in
Lafayette's Blackham Coliseum

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.540
and listened to the sounds

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:46.970
that they had only heard
before while dancing.

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:54.350
Sometimes festival
organizers develop new ways

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:57.560
of presenting culture
based on own observations

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.040
of performance in
its own context.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.860
Sometimes participants can do --

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:03.210
can and do take over
with their own theories

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:05.230
about context and performance.

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:07.960
Over the years, Dewey Balfa
was visited by many folklorists

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.340
and invited to many festivals.

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.630
He learned from them
what he needed to know

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:14.850
to guide his own efforts to
regenerate interest and respect

00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:17.720
for Cajun music in his
native south Louisiana.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.740
This information also turned
Balfa into quite an expert

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:24.920
on folk festival theory,
sometimes to the chagrin

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:28.560
of festival organizers who
have not always thought

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.370
out the issues as
well as he had,

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.360
and certainly did not
feel them as he did.

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.600
There are many examples that
illustrate Dewey's understanding

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.640
of culture's process
rather than product.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:44.120
For years, he tried to convince
festival organizers to allow him

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.500
to come with his current
band as he performed

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.750
in dance halls every
Saturday night.

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:53.240
He eventually won a partial
victory coming with most

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.250
of his dance band, but
he was never allowed

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:57.820
to bring along his steel guitar

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:01.830
to the Smithsonian Festival
of American Folklife.

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:05.150
The argument was that the
steel guitar was too modern,

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:09.010
an inappropriate and
inauthentic addition

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:11.930
to traditional instrumentation.

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:14.300
That's tradition from
their perspective.

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.680
Never mind the fact that
Dewey Balfa, long recognized

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.240
as a pillar of cultural
preservation in America,

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:22.680
chose to perform weekly with
a steel guitar in his band,

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.950
just as dozens of
other Cajun bands did.

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:29.590
In 1978 he finally
confronted festival personnel,

00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:31.120
Smithsonian festival personnel

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:35.570
on the issue asking them
pointedly, are you trying

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:37.070
to present Cajun music

00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:40.780
as you wish it still
were, or as it really is?

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:47.900
And there was that exact same
deafening silence in the room.

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.250
He was allowed that year

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:54.040
to bring along fiddler Dick
Richard, who also played

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:57.540
to his own steel guitar.

00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:58.840
Small steps.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:05.270
In 1985, Dewey delivered a
brilliant extemporaneous address

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:07.430
on the traditional
process from the stage

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:11.150
of the cultural conservation
area of the Washington Festival.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:14.070
Invited as an outstanding
example of the effort

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:17.310
to conserve America's
traditional culture,

00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:20.750
he pointed out halfway
through a 45-minute set

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:24.320
that he had been playing some
traditional songs, songs that he

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.620
and his brothers had --

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:33.560
Learned from the
family tradition.

00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:37.800
He went on to say that he now
would like to play some songs

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:43.690
that he and his brothers
had composed recently.

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:48.700
He went on to say that he didn't
have to turn around to know

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.140
that what he just said had
made some people backstage very

00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:56.890
nervous, because he was there to
represent cultural conservation.

00:52:56.890 --> 00:53:00.440
But, for him, cultural
conservation did not mean

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.320
preserving things.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:06.100
For him, cultural conservation
meant preserving the life

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.790
of the culture, the process.

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:11.550
And, if he was successful,
then the culture was going

00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:14.220
to be alive and well
and continue to grow

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:16.150
and evolve it its own terms.

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:17.640
And, if this effort
was successful

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.630
in his native Louisiana,
then 50 or so years from now,

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:23.170
some young musicians were going
to need some songs that were 50

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:25.230
or so years old to play.

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:28.420
So, he had made some and
he was going to play one.

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:34.730
He did. He played [inaudible],
and the stage personnel

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:37.410
and audience were
delighted to hear

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:40.310
that his new song sounded
just like the old ones

00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:41.950
from his family tradition.

00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:45.230
He kept this remarkable
demonstration by pointing out,

00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:47.830
he was not one to
leave a point alone,

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:50.750
explaining that they
sounded like the old stuff

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:52.460
because they were coming
from the same tradition

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.890
and through the same process and
being performed by the same guy,

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:56.970
so why wouldn't they
sound familiar?

00:53:56.970 --> 00:54:00.280
But it was brand new.

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.910
Festival organizers should
never be afraid to be surprised.

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:05.310
The people we invite to perform

00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:08.870
at festivals sometimes are
undereducated, but never --

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:12.250
I've never found many
to be unintelligent.

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:15.650
In a sense, Dewey's presentation
was much more successful

00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:18.720
and authentic than
the authentic like one

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.350
that was originally intended

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:23.140
for the cultural
conservation stage that day.

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:25.220
The audience and festival
personnel alike had the

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:29.430
opportunity to learn a
fancy lesson about culture.

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:31.550
After years of performing
in such context,

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:35.610
Dewey learned well how
to operate the machinery.

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:37.350
In this case, he was
aiming his message

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:39.120
in two directions at once.

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:41.410
The immediate message was
aimed at the audience,

00:54:41.410 --> 00:54:46.370
but that message and its
reception was obviously meant

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:48.670
to rebound backstage.

00:54:54.210 --> 00:55:00.690
At the Liberty Theater we did
a lot of field work on the fly,

00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:02.260
sometimes discovering things

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:04.050
that were happening
right on stage.

00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.030
This is Mitch Reed playing
with Goldman Thibodeau.

00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:08.010
He was there to play with
another group and decided

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:10.850
to play with Goldman
and, so, why wouldn't he?

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:15.150
Sometimes the field work was
very close to the presentation,

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:17.100
as in the case of
Horace Trahan's debut.

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:22.020
Some of you may know Horace
Trahan, young Cajun musician.

00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:24.110
Helena Putnam, our
Liberty stage manager,

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:26.460
reported hearing a remarkable
young accordion player

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:28.000
and singer at a jam session

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.220
at the [inaudible] Acadian
Culture Center next door earlier

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:32.690
that afternoon.

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:34.380
During the Liberty
show that night,

00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:36.540
she recognized the young
man sitting in the audience

00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:37.840
and pointed him out to me.

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.790
I had learned to
trust her instincts.

00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:43.540
On a whim, and trusting
her based on years

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:46.740
of shared mutual observations
from our backstage perspective,

00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:50.070
I went down into the
audience while a song was on,

00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:51.750
was being played, and invited --

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:53.050
asked him if he would
be interested

00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:55.100
in performing a song or two.

00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:57.900
Yes, sir, he said.

00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:04.090
And he came up and we crowbarred
him into the proceedings

00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:06.860
that evening, the
performance that evening.

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:09.200
Got him alone sitting
on a chair in the middle

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.190
of the stage during
a stolen moment

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:12.760
between scheduled performances.

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:17.070
The crowd spontaneously
gave him a standing ovation.

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:19.660
Not bad for an improvised debut.

00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:22.240
He eventually returned
to perform many times

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.540
with his own band and others.

00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:33.530
Another example, and the
final one I'll give you, is --

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:36.370
has to do with negotiating
performance

00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:37.670
and context on the fly.

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:38.970
It comes from an idea I had

00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:40.270
when the [speaking foreign
language] was looking

00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:44.160
to include a Louisiana
French component

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:48.610
to their event in 1999.

00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:51.390
In an attempt to take
into consideration issues

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:54.670
that context-minded folklorists,
such as Frank Proschan

00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:56.270
and Charles Cantwell
[assumed spelling],

00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:59.910
have addressed calling for
more holistic community-based

00:56:59.910 --> 00:57:01.920
programming at folk festivals,

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:07.280
I suggested they invite the
Basile Mardi Gras as a group.

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.310
Within this group I suggested
they would have cultural

00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:13.310
critical mass that would
include culinary traditions,

00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:16.280
the communal gumbo, traditional
music, the ritual song,

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:19.170
and music played for
dancing at the host's houses,

00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:21.820
and material culture,
mask and costume making,

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.150
as well as the performance
of the ritual itself.

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:27.020
Festival organizers were
eventually convinced

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:29.160
to try this integrated
presentation,

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.690
rather than the more
typical approach

00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:33.990
that would involve
disparate bearers

00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:36.900
of various traditional arts.

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:38.800
So, Basile group went to --

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:42.310
went to Quebec where they
demonstrated the various aspects

00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:43.820
of their Mardi Gras.

00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:46.910
Visitors could watch the masks
being made then try them on.

00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:49.250
They could watch the making
of the gumbo then taste.

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:52.440
They could listen to the
music and dance to it.

00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:55.470
Then the Basile group was asked
to put the whole affair together

00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:58.340
and demonstrate a run.

00:57:58.340 --> 00:57:59.640
The museum organizers
said, well,

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:00.940
what does this --
how does this work?

00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:02.240
What does it look like?

00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:03.580
Which they were happy to do.

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:06.940
They had demonstrated their
tradition before at Liberty --

00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:12.770
at the Liberty Theater,
as well as a few outings

00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:14.300
at the Louisiana
Folklife Festival

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:16.700
in several cities
within the state.

00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:18.000
But the only real way

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.560
to demonstrate a Mardi Gras
run is to run Mardi Gras.

00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:24.480
It's the only way that the
carnivalesque dynamic can

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.860
be conjured.

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:29.690
So, they cracked up a
performance in the museum.

00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:34.960
Now, of course, Mardi
Gras runs are not static.

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.500
They move.

00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:39.160
The whole point is
to visit and disturb

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:43.130
or tickle what you determine
to be your host community.

00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:46.970
So, they headed out the back
door after this performance --

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:54.540
Formed up in the park
behind the museum,

00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:58.020
and headed out into the streets.

00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:01.310
They didn't have a clear
idea of where they were --

00:59:01.310 --> 00:59:03.840
where they were, but they
instinctively improvise the

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.660
route and headed down
the sidewalk looking

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:10.500
for the nearest bar [laughter]
doing their ceremonial begging

00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:14.820
routines for passersby who had
no clue what this was about.

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:21.090
Luckily, most seemed to
figure out fairly quickly

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:23.730
that this must be some
festive performance associated

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:25.610
with the nearby museum.

00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:28.150
I was pressed into
service to hastily explain

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:30.510
to those they encountered
what was going on.

00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:32.850
Some understood a
bit and smiled.

00:59:32.850 --> 00:59:35.130
Most had little or no idea
how to take the performance

00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:37.430
and shied away from the group --

00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:44.050
Clutching purses, bags,
and children [laughter].

00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:48.130
The museum and festival workers
didn't know this would happen

00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:50.640
either, but were reluctant
to restrain what they had,

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:52.980
after all, asked
the group to do.

00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:54.770
We were, quite frankly,
all intrigued

00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:58.350
to watch the spontaneous
carnivalesque improvisation.

00:59:58.350 --> 01:00:00.980
The group processed down the
street with a small entourage

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:05.110
of handlers trying to buffer
the public as much as possible.

01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:07.010
They finally made it to a bar,

01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:09.440
which should be familiar
territory, and went inside.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.240
They asked for permission to
perform, gathered together,

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.900
sang their song, danced
to the music provided

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:19.500
by their accompanying musicians,
and then genuinely begged

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:22.130
for donations from
everybody inside,

01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:25.520
including drinks
from the bartender.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:28.200
Alerted to the situation
and made aware

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.690
that this was a spillover
from the nearby [inaudible],

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:35.950
everybody happily cooperated
and the group left happily.

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.870
But Mardi Gras is also about
challenging thresholds.

01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:45.610
So, once back out of the street,
they escalated the stakes.

01:00:45.610 --> 01:00:47.200
They gathered at a
bus stop and waited

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.550
for the next bus [laughter].

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:51.780
I was able to convince Captain
Ryder [assumed spelling]

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:54.030
that this might not be a
good idea, since neither

01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:56.350
of us knew Quebec
City bus routes

01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:58.080
and how far the bus
would take them.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.030
They toyed with the idea
of boarding the bus anyway,

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:01.830
mostly to make me nervous,

01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:04.320
then they resumed their
procession along the sidewalk

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.830
after a brief standoff
with the bus driver

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:11.880
over who should be
collecting money.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:14.020
They hit the next bar they saw.

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:17.490
The experience from the first
bar was virtually repeated.

01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:19.710
When they left again I was
able to convince the captain

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:22.150
that this was just a
demonstration run after all

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:24.530
and that we could head
back to the museum now.

01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:26.750
He agreed and led
his contingent back,

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:28.050
but not without interacting

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:30.600
with everyone they
passed along the way.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.770
When they were safely
back into the museum --

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.060
They sang their song
again, danced a bit more,

01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.910
and then served and
ate the gumbo with all

01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:57.030
who were there according
to their tradition.

01:01:57.030 --> 01:02:01.700
To the relief of organizers,
no one had been lost or hurt

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:06.100
or too offended, but it was
definitely more Mardi Gras

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.400
than they had anticipated
[laughter].

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:11.360
It was probably less than the
participants would happily have

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.770
done if given more reign.

01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:15.360
The group had extracted
something

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.720
like a Mardi Gras feeling out
of this artificial experience

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.780
by insisting on going
out on their own terms

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:26.440
and temporarily ignoring
efforts to deter them.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:31.810
So, where does this leave us?

01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:38.480
All sorts of highly
technical studies have derived

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.990
from a study -- academic
study of folklore.

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:46.970
And, in my experience, I
found that the possibilities

01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:49.090
of focusing, especially
on performance

01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:51.690
and contextual theory
in folk arts programming

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:57.350
in the public sector, didn't
need to be conflictual.

01:02:57.350 --> 01:02:59.610
Their cultural imperatives
in each performance

01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:02.450
of traditional culture,
including setting, time,

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:05.000
constant negotiation between
performers and audience,

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.470
to consider -- the consideration

01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:10.390
of these complex features
have led to a lot of studies.

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:12.370
Many of these focus
on the capturing

01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:15.980
of traditional performance for
contemplation and analysis.

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:17.690
Folklore's espousing contextual

01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:20.120
and performance centered
approaches have insisted

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:23.390
on the importance of studying
the very life and nature

01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:24.690
of the cultural performance

01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:27.630
in its most natural
expression and setting.

01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:31.360
Well, that's what Dewey
Balfa was hoping for.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.870
Their discoveries and subsequent
theories can and do serve

01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:38.440
to adapt and improve public
presentation of folk arts,

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.870
whether within a community-based
cultural presentation,

01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:44.410
in a cultural presentation
destined for visitors,

01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:46.000
as well as members
of the community,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.170
or in a multicultural
presentation outside

01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:49.470
the community.

01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:51.860
Conversely, folk --
public folklore --

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:56.100
the public sector folklorists
can and do extract and engage

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:57.410
in performance theory

01:03:57.410 --> 01:04:00.120
by observing how
performers adapt themselves

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.420
to unfamiliar settings

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.440
and unfamiliar settings
to themselves.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:06.130
These strategies can be
identified to help refine

01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:10.080
and improvise future
presentations and settings.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:14.080
And we've studied
lots of things.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.580
I'm going to hastened
through the next few moments.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:21.160
We've studied lots of
things, such as the evolution

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.600
of house types, from what we
found in France and Acadia,

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.600
the Canadian Maritimes, and
how those got improvised

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.970
in Louisiana.

01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:35.450
The addition of porches, which
shows cultural confluence

01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:37.950
of the Acadian and
African [inaudible].

01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:41.230
And then, what happens
when that house type is

01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:46.440
in everybody's head and you
build a modern house on a slab?

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:51.060
And what happens when
Katrina and Rita blow

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:54.300
through and you get flooded?

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:59.370
Things are constantly being
negotiated in very smart

01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:05.920
and meaningful and
ways that make sense.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.700
Food, you know, some --

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:13.330
there are notions of
traditional food ways

01:05:13.330 --> 01:05:16.420
that didn't accommodate.

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:19.050
If you get stuck in history,
they don't accommodate

01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:25.490
for Cajun eggrolls, crawfish
tamales, microwave rue,

01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:28.970
and some other things that
strain the imagination.

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:34.040
[ Laughter ]

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:37.210
All the while, we also enjoy
hamburgers and fried chicken

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:39.280
with iced tea and Dr. Pepper

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.430
without feeling we are betraying
our Cajuness [phonetic].

01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:47.590
So, I was going to give
you a few examples of --

01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:52.430
in the world of Cajun music,
but let me just do one.

01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:55.010
Basically, it has to do
with, how do you get --

01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:58.570
how did we get from
performing here back in the '30s

01:05:58.570 --> 01:06:02.460
to performing here today?

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:04.320
There's a remarkable
difference between the music

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:09.000
that was played here and the
music that's played here.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.120
For one thing, there
was no electricity.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:16.400
For another thing, it was
essentially for dancers.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:20.560
It was in the dance
hall, closed off.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.570
Courting is going on.

01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:25.890
People are paying attention
to the music only to dance to.

01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:30.390
Here, as Dewey pointed
out, what's happening?

01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:34.200
Well, people are listening,
people are watching,

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:36.660
people are gathered in a
remarkably different way.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:43.050
And, so, musicians will
obviously renegotiate what

01:06:43.050 --> 01:06:44.430
they're playing.

01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:48.400
This is an example of what Ralph
Rentschler recorded the Balfa

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:55.510
brothers playing in 1964, a
song called Parlez-Nous a Boire.

01:06:55.510 --> 01:07:39.040
[ Music ]

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:43.090
So, what happens if
you're -- if you're young,

01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:46.760
a member of [inaudible],
and you're playing in front

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:51.990
of a crowd that looks more
like that festival crowd?

01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:54.240
What will you come up with?

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:56.580
Well, this is what
Chris Stafford

01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:59.720
and [inaudible] came up with.

01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:40.090
[ Music ]

01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:43.580
Now, you know, that probably
upsets the sensibilities

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.030
of some people who
think of Cajun music

01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:50.180
as historically traditional.

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:55.030
But I'm here to tell you from
my observations in Louisiana,

01:08:55.030 --> 01:09:00.150
if you don't do that, then it's
stuck in a preservation hall.

01:09:00.150 --> 01:09:01.450
It's dead.

01:09:01.450 --> 01:09:04.040
You may not always like it.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:07.350
Dewey Balfa famously said of
these kinds of matters, he said,

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:08.650
I don't like what they're doing,

01:09:08.650 --> 01:09:10.640
but I sure am glad
they're doing it,

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.740
which I thought an absolutely
brilliant observation.

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:19.820
Some of the stuff that
people do are designed

01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:22.510
to produce arouse from a crowd.

01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:30.170
[ Music ]

01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:31.970
You can hear --

01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:39.050
[ Music ]

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:41.200
In the opening of that
version of the Bosco Stomp,

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:48.290
he's letting the crowd have a
chance to cheer and get into it.

01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:55.810
People started doing all
sorts of reimagined songs.

01:09:55.810 --> 01:10:00.110
Style was shifting within
a traditional repertoire.

01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:04.600
People like Steve Riley and the
Mamou Playboys, would do things

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.510
like four-part harmonies
on old classics.

01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:42.300
[ Music ]

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:46.270
And something about it works.

01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:52.230
Rearrange openings for crowd
effect, stringing together two

01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:57.180
or more traditional tunes to
produce medleys, rearrange songs

01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:58.900
for obvious dramatic effect.

01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:02.690
These strategies have influenced
subsequent generations

01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:04.370
as is evident in
the arrangements

01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:09.720
of many contemporary
Cajun groups.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:13.580
Eventually, fiddler
David Greely learned

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:16.040
to play a swamp pop saxophone

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.760
to accompany accordionist
Steve Riley's forays

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:23.560
into zydeco and swap pop.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.370
People -- things were
changing even faster

01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:30.680
than some festival
organizers were expecting.

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:35.140
When Steve Riley, who was
sort of our, you know,

01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:37.780
hope for the future, stuck
in the past kind of guy,

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:45.970
imitating the past, heir to
Dewey Balfa, except actually,

01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:48.310
he ended up being heir to
do it because he continued

01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:50.710
to think about as Dewey did.

01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:55.510
When he -- in 1994 he pulled a
big, red, chromatic accordion

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:58.390
out of the bag on
stage at our festival.

01:11:58.390 --> 01:12:00.500
The south Louisiana crowd
experienced a moment,

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.020
not unlike the one experienced
by the Newport Folk Festival

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:08.430
in '65 when Dylan began
to play Maggie's Farm.

01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:13.760
But, as Bruce Jackson has
pointed out, that crowd in '65

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.060
in Newport was not mad at Dylan.

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:19.380
They were mad at Peter Yarrow
for trying to get him off.

01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:21.730
They were actually loving it.

01:12:21.730 --> 01:12:25.340
When festival producers
heard the new licks,

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.620
there was some consternation
and concern

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:30.600
that the traditional Cajun
music's fair-haired band was

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:33.650
sliding toward the
progressive side.

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:36.550
What was undeniable was,
that the crowd loved it.

01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:39.320
A remarkable exchange of e-mails
I had with Greely and Ben,

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.860
that band members were
keenly aware of these issues,

of changing context,

And, obviously, recycled and
rethought and regenerated.

But they all continue to
produce music that is playful

and thoughtful and challenging,
as we expect young music to be.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:21.970
At the same time, it's as
respectful and grounded

01:16:21.970 --> 01:16:23.980
as I hope it would be.

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.330
Young Cajun music
is a perfect example

01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:29.140
of what Dewey Balfa meant
when he said he wanted

01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:31.870
to preserve not the music
itself, but the process

01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:34.780
that produces the music, so
that musicians will continue

01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:38.810
to innovate and improvise new
forms that both surprise us

01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:41.980
and reassure us at
the same time.

01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:44.980
And this brings us
back to Henry Glassie.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:49.110
This an obviously ongoing
process, undoubtedly influenced

01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:51.220
by the past, but
not trapped in it.

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:53.710
In the spirit of Glassie's
definition of tradition,

01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:57.940
as quote, the creation of
the future out of the past.

01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:03.980
Dewey Balfa also said, a culture
is preserved one generation

01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:05.630
at a time.

01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:08.180
Cajun and Creole cultures have
endured in their own terms

01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:10.520
into the present
generation, what happens

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:13.740

to decide their futures.

They have remarkable
filtering systems.

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.180
Once again, it is
critically important

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:20.790
to consider the context,
especially those

01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:23.400
who consume all this
cultural activity.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:27.100
How long will young Cajun and
Creole bands play what they play

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:30.590
without some sort of
crowd to play for?

01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:34.900
Turning the fieldwork gaze
toward the crowds exposes a

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:38.880
simple truth, what works
doggedly it endures,

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:43.080
and what doesn't work
fades mercifully away.

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:46.040
Yet Dewey, who learned
about cultural activism

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:48.350
from the intellectual
descendants of Alan Lomax

01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:51.310
and Charles Seeger, realize
that we should not leave

01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:55.400
such things entirely to the
laws of natural selection,

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.640
and urge that we water the roots

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:02.270
so that the tree might
have a chance to live.

01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:05.230
Despite the admittedly activist
perspective that we share,

01:18:05.230 --> 01:18:09.250
we both know you can't force the
passage of tradition on anyone.

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:12.780
What I have tried to do is
to observe it, understand it

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:15.320
as well as I can, and
present the results

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.240
of that understanding in
as many ways as I can --

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:21.960
I can think of, including
academic reporting,

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:24.710
media presentation,
public presentation.

01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:28.960
In that public presentation I
have tried to make it attractive

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:33.230
and available, and then step
back and watch what happens,

01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:35.530
and then try to understand that.

01:18:35.530 --> 01:18:39.430
And folklore and fieldwork
continue to be the best ways

01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:43.650

evolves at the speed of life.

sometimes, you know,

musicians who are aware of this
have challenged the fourth wall.

01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:40.500
I remember back in
1980 something,

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:43.250
Rockin Dopsie had
a 50-foot cord.

01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:46.090
We were always wondering, why
does he have a 50-foot cord?

01:19:46.090 --> 01:19:49.830
And in the first song he stepped
back and took off and jumped

01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:51.840

like before mosh pits, right?

So, I think the -- to me, the
most important thing to take,

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.310
one of the most important
things to take out of --

01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:11.500
out of all of this is,
that it's a mistake

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:13.200
to confuse history
and tradition.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:16.880
You know, history is what
happened in the past,

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:20.420
and tradition is what came
from it, but is still going on,

01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:21.720
and it's still happening

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:25.610

we're experiencing today.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:32.290
it has a quality of the
present and even the future.

and started making spaces
in their restaurants.

01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:47.850
So, and more restaurants
were regularly [inaudible].

01:25:47.850 --> 01:25:49.740
So, dance halls started
[inaudible].

01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:51.840
But, you know, nobody --

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:54.510
there aren't any house
dances anymore either.

01:25:54.510 --> 01:26:28.600
[ Inaudible ]

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.510
Yes, yeah?

01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:58.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:03.020
And sometimes that stuff is
surprising, which is good.

01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:06.040
I often say that
when the process

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:11.160
that I was just describing is
really in stride and hitting

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:15.010
on all eight cylinders, it's
working well, it produces things

01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:18.390
that both surprise us and
reassure us in the same moment.

01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:21.860
We say, wow, I didn't
see that coming,

01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:24.160
but I see where it came from.

01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:28.510
&gt;&gt; One more question.

01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:30.310
&gt;&gt; Billy Jean Ancelet: Okay.

01:27:30.310 --> 01:28:05.180

01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:07.350
[ Laughter ]

01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:12.510
I could tell you, but --
no, there are people who --

01:28:12.510 --> 01:28:58.170
[ Inaudible ]

01:28:58.170 --> 01:29:01.520
And by the way, we
just last year,

01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:05.610
just this past year we revisited
something that we had done

01:29:05.610 --> 01:29:10.140
in the '80s, and that
is we did an exhibition,

01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:11.440
a museum exhibition

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:15.510
of traditional instruments
made in south Louisiana.

01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:19.050
[ Inaudible ]

01:29:19.050 --> 01:29:23.130
Steel guitars, drums, percussion
bands, violins, [inaudible].

01:29:23.130 --> 01:29:29.610
So, if you want -- if you want
to play that badly [inaudible].

01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:34.090
&gt;&gt; We probably should
wrap this up.

01:29:34.090 --> 01:29:38.660
But I wanted to thank
Professor Ancelet

01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:40.510
for coming and for [inaudible].

01:29:40.510 --> 01:29:43.940
