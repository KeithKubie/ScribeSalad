00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.590
A secret Soviet medical program may be resurfacing
and it could one day save your life.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.460
It’s all about fighting disease...with viruses.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.700
When we think of viruses, like the cold or
the flu, we tend to think of one thing: getting

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.700
sick.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.850
But it turns out there are actually viruses
that can keep us from getting sick.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.680
They’re called bacteriophages, literally
“bacteria eaters.”

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.119
But first, what’s a virus anyway?

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.960
Well, a virus is a microorganism that requires
a host to survive, like a human cell.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.980
When it finds one, the virus attaches itself
and starts to replicate until the cell is

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.980
destroyed.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.730
This process then repeats until your immune
system kicks in and the virus is killed off.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.230
Bacteriophages work the same way, but instead
of infecting human cells, they only infect

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.230
bacteria.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.230
And they’re very selective.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.680
A bacteriophage that can infect and destroy
E. Coli won’t go after another type of bacteria.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.559
So, scientists thought bacteriophages could
be used the same way we now use antibiotics,

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.840
to treat deadly bacterial infections.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.840
In fact, bacteriophages were discovered a
decade before penicillin was accidentally

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.840
stumbled upon in dirty petri dish.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.840
So, why aren’t we using them?

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.960
Well, in the West bacteriophages suffered
from some bad press from the American Medical

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.390
Association, and by the 1940’s antibiotics
were full-steam-ahead, treating soldiers in

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.390
WWII.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.200
But while Western medicine lost interest in
bacteriophages, the former Soviet Union as

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.990
well as Eastern Bloc countries couldn’t
get enough of them.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.570
The Soviet military used bacteriophages extensively,
and Georgia was pumping out 2 tons of phages

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.600
a week for military and civilian use.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.640
The thing is, we never heard about it because
of the secrecy behind the iron curtain.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.380
Phage therapy was funded by the Soviet Military,
making it classified information.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.470
And when we finally did get access to the
research, it lacked the rigorous protocols

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.220
found in Western medical journals, like double-blind
studies.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.829
But interest in bacteriophages is back, and
clinical trials have begun.

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.890
That’s because antibiotics, while responsible
for saving millions of lives, have hit a scary

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.840
bump in the road.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.060
Bacteria can evolve and become resistant to
antibiotics, and now the World Health Organization

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.960
has warned that humanity is at risk of a post-antibiotic
era.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.000
That would mean common infections could once
again be potentially deadly.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.560
This is why phage therapy is becoming relevant
again.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.930
In one case, a patient with an infection in
his leg that wouldn’t respond to antibiotics

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.430
avoided amputation with a successful treatment
of bacteriophages.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.850
So don’t be surprised when down the line,
your doctor prescribes you a virus to get

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.510
you back on your feet.
