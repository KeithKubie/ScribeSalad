00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.872
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:07.240
SPEAKER: Hey, everyone.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.900
Thanks for joining us today.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.770
My name is [INAUDIBLE], and I'm
managing the Social Good team

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.130
here in New York.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.420
And today, I'm
excited to introduce

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.030
Douglas Rushkoff, who's going
to talk about his new book,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.965
"Throwing Rocks at
the Google Bus."

00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:24.370
Douglas is a writer,
documentarian,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.540
lecturer whose focus is human
autonomy in the digital age.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.320
And he wrote 15
bestselling books,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.830
did many award-winning
documentaries.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.780
He was named one of
the World's 10 Most

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.600
Influential
Intellectuals by MIT.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.710
And he coined concepts
like "viral media"

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.940
or "social currency."

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.940
And when he's not giving talks
at Google or somewhere else,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.510
he's a professor at
CUNY Queens College.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.440
And today, he's going to
talk about his latest book

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.480
and how growth became
the envy of prosperity.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.928
Please join me in
welcoming Douglas.

00:01:03.928 --> 00:01:05.332
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:08.140
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: Thanks.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.562
Is that human or is that Google?

00:01:11.562 --> 00:01:12.930
AUDIENCE: Human.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.950
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: That's human?

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.820
Because it was very fast.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.317
I guess that's like a
court stenographer person.

00:01:20.317 --> 00:01:21.690
AUDIENCE: She's award-winning.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.060
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: Is she?

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.830
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.265
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: She's good.

00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:24.765
Hello.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.360
See?

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.510
That's almost the
whole thing I'm

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.800
thinking about these
days is humans creating

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.700
value, the ability of humans to
create value in a digital age.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.670
And what happens when
the humans are replaced?

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.440
Why are we replacing
certain humans

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.110
with technologies
and not others?

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.920
When is it better?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.670
When is it not?

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.290
And what's the real
underlying philosophy?

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.160
What's the underlying drive
for doing these things?

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.330
I first started to
think about this

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.890
when the human
receptionist was replaced

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.669
by a automatic answering
machine at a law firm.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.157
I was temping, back in
the days when no one knew

00:02:12.157 --> 00:02:13.240
how to do word processing.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.390
If you knew how to word process,
you could get $40, $50 an hour

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.790
for typing at
night in law firms.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.800
That's what we did
in the late '80s.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.390
And there was this
great receptionist

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.110
I was building up the
courage to ask out.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.500
And she got replaced before
I had the chance to do it.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.229
And she was replaced with an
automatic answering thing.

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.270
And it was the primitive
kind, where you really--

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.940
I mean, going through
the menus was hard.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.240
I mean, it still is, but it was
particularly hard back then.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.320
And I remember thinking
about the savings.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.680
And I understood that the
company was saving money

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.710
by having a machine instead
of a human receptionist

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.870
they had to pay and
give health insurance.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.650
But the amount of time it took
everybody else who was calling

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.580
into the company
got vastly expanded

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.420
going through all these menus.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.340
So the total cost,
the total man hours,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.560
and total corporate
money that was

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.010
being spent as a result of the
replacement of the receptionist

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.790
with the machine
actually went up.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.190
The law firm just externalized--
it's the corporate word.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.330
They externalized the
cost of phone answering

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.480
to the callers, which created
a kind of arms race then.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.390
Then, every other
company has to do that.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.740
Everyone has to externalize.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.960
Otherwise now, you're paying the
price of their phone machine,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.650
but not reaping the
benefits of having your own.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.050
So everyone ends up
externalizing these things.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.459
And in the end, I
thought of that--

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:46.750
and this was counter-intuitive.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.260
This was anti-Harvard Business
School, anti-General Electric.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.460
I thought of that as bad
business and still do.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.710
Because now, the
company's customers

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.940
have to spend more time.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.480
The company's shareholders
have to spend more time

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.450
to get shareholder information,
which makes them angry.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.340
The suppliers have
to spend more time.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.227
So it's costing more money
to the financial ecosystem,

00:04:13.227 --> 00:04:15.310
if we are allowed to use
that word anymore talking

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.620
about finance.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.649
The financial system in
which the company exists

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:24.310
ends up more stressed
rather than more healthy.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.060
But if we have a corporate
individualistic understanding,

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.330
more of a military sort of
strategy for the company,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.070
then there's no
other way for things

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.400
to go in this kind of
bastardized version

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.977
of Darwinian selection, where
you think that, oh, you've

00:04:45.977 --> 00:04:48.310
got to be the meanest company,
doing the meanest things,

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.690
and taking from other and all
that, in order to succeed.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.050
It's an infantile
understanding of--

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.070
I mean, we're seeing it
on many stages today.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.310
You know, a very primitive,
childlike understanding

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.980
of how business works.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.260
And I don't blame
people so much for it

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.850
as our inability to
recognize the operating

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.110
system on which we're
trying to run our companies

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.300
and do our work
and live our lives.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.230
So when I first wrote this
book, the original title

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.605
was very optimistic.

00:05:27.605 --> 00:05:30.460
It was called "Distributed:
A new OS for the Digital

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.320
Economy."

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.240
And what I was
arguing was that we

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.140
could move from an extractive,
growth-based paradigm

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.850
to a distributive
circulatory one.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:47.080
In my shorthand, I would
say rather than optimizing

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.920
for growth and
extraction, we optimized

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.380
for the velocity of money.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.990
We optimized for the
amount of transactions.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.100
So how do you really get the
economy off the hard drive

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.990
and into RAM when we're
working on it the other way?

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.690
I mean, that's the underlying
philosophy of this work,

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.190
of how I'm seeing things.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.980
And the thing that got me
the most upset, the most

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.890
kind of agitated, was that
developers, engineers,

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.570
programmers seemed oblivious to
the operating system on which

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.700
their companies were running.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.040
That they accepted
the underlying values

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.760
as if they were preexisting
conditions of nature

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.030
rather than a very specific
operating system that

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.760
was developed at a
specific moment in history

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.980
with specific needs in mind.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:52.120
And that it might actually be
obsolete in our current setup.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.360
And certainly, in a digital age.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.410
So I would look at a friend,
like Evan Williams, one

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.780
of the founders of
Twitter, and see him

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.610
on the cover of the
"Wall Street Journal"

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.820
with the number $4.3 billion
under his face, which

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.150
is the amount that he was
worth the day of the IPO.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.835
And I would think,
oh, this poor fucker.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.620
It's over.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.400
He's fucked.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.370
And anybody who
understands how this worked

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.700
understood he was fucked.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.200
Because Twitter-- it
turns out Twitter can only

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.530
make about $2 billion a year.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.360
That's about their limit.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.750
And you would think for
140-character messaging app, $2

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.090
billion a year is pretty good.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.000
Pretty good revenue.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.541
And you think about
what you actually

00:07:39.541 --> 00:07:41.140
need to maintain that app.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.930
It's not that much.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.990
Amazon for servers,
just [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.450
Once you've built
that, it's not that--

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.610
it doesn't cost
$2 billion a year

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.770
to maintain that messaging.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.180
It costs a whole lot less.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:00.190
You could reach sustainability
and great profitability.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:05.620
But we know that once Evan's got
$4.3 billion of investor money,

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.690
he's got to return
$400.3 billion.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.220
$430 billion.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.195
That these are investors,
who even at the IPO,

00:08:13.195 --> 00:08:16.810
are expecting 100x or 1,000x
returns on a growth-based

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:17.750
company.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.420
So now he's trapped.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.530
Now, Twitter is a failure.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.196
Twitter has to do,
what do they call it?

00:08:22.196 --> 00:08:23.830
Has to pivot.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.070
Twitter is going to have
to pivot into being--

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:30.441
they tried-- a video company,
an ad company, this company,

00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:30.940
or that.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.439
They're going to have to pivot
to something that can deliver

00:08:33.439 --> 00:08:34.900
that kind of growth.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.700
And if they don't, what?

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.570
They get bought
by Yahoo, I guess.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.000
And then, Jack Ma or
somebody buys that.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.520
And that's what this
moment was about for me,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.892
the "Throwing Rocks at
the Google Bus" moment.

00:08:51.892 --> 00:08:53.600
I mean, a lot of people
think I'm saying,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.310
oh, let's throw rocks
at the Google bus.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.470
No, I'm not saying that at all.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.320
I mean, throwing rocks at the
Google bus is this almost--

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.950
is meant as a poetic
metaphor for the situation

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.140
that we've gotten in.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:11.870
For the enmity and the inability
of our technology companies

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.670
to actually create
distributed value

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.140
for lots and lots of people.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.440
The fact that Google, which
I mean, those of you who

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.350
are old enough to
remember, Google

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.540
was two kids in their
Stanford dorm room

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.870
that came up with an
algorithm to take down Yahoo.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.000
We all resented Yahoo
in the early internet

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.400
because Yahoo was using
humans, and judgment,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.820
and values to
categorize the internet.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.740
This was a man-made
hierarchical system.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.910
And Yahoo seemed invincible.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.940
And then, this little algorithm.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.032
The idea was that
now the links that--

00:09:50.032 --> 00:09:51.740
I mean, you know guys
know Google, right?

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.310
The links that
people make are going

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.570
to decide in a bottom-up
fashion behaviorally

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.330
how are we going to
organize information.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:08.630
So it was this people-driven,
bottom-up, democratic,

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.530
populist, reorganization
of the world's information

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.680
by how we use it and how real
people think about it rather

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.320
than how some corporation
decides to divvy it out

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.050
in order to promote
sales of things,

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.110
and existing worldviews,
and all that.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.470
They got it, that we're
living in kind of a tag cloud.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.870
And that this could be fun.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.680
And then, what happens
though, is Google gets--

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.680
I mean, we know Google
gets all this investment.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.096
It becomes this
giant corporation.

00:10:36.096 --> 00:10:38.780
Then, Google has to show a
certain amount of growth.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.160
Google has to grow.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.710
And it has to grow it at a
weird, accelerating, giant

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:43.310
rate.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.059
So sure, they're based
not even in San Francisco.

00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:48.100
But if you're going to be
a Google program, where

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:48.740
are you going to live?

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.660
You're going to live
down near the airport,

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.450
or you're going to live in San
Francisco and get on the bus

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:54.260
and go down there.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.629
And as you know, people
who lived in San Francisco,

00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:59.420
their rents ended up
doubling and tripling.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.570
Because not just of Google,
but all the activity

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:03.960
that was going on there.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.120
And then Google, in
an appropriate way,

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.502
said, look, we're putting
so much traffic on the roads

00:11:10.502 --> 00:11:11.460
and all this pollution.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.480
Let's do these buses so that
we can actually make it easier,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.557
have less of an impact
on this community,

00:11:16.557 --> 00:11:18.890
and get more hours of work
out of our people, of course,

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.630
because they're going to work
on the way down and on the way

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.580
up with nice Wi-Fi.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.630
And what happened
is that, as we know,

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.570
if you're in walking distance
of a Google bus stop in San

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.610
Francisco, your
rent is 30% higher

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.370
even than it would have been.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.910
So here are these people.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.430
Their rents have gone up.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.070
The bodegas are out of business.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.040
The local shops can't
afford their rent anymore.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.660
And they're looking
at these buses

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.080
coming in as if it's an
alien invasion, bringing

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.360
these developers
from the mothership.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.120
And what they're
experiencing is this company

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.030
is getting much bigger,
but their actual lives

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.170
are getting worse.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:01.220
They're having to
leave their town.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.570
They see the private buses
on a public bus stop.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.740
Their rent's going up.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.320
And a company that seems to
be using San Francisco more

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.980
as a Hollywood backdrop
rather than as a place

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.590
that it's actually invested in.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:22.520
You would think if a business
is located somewhere,

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.760
that it contributes to the
prosperity of that place.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.500
But here, Google seemed to be
more like a foreign corporation

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.640
extracting value from this
place and leaving nothing there.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.680
So when people started
throwing rocks,

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.950
it was at an Oakland protest.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.610
They started throwing
rocks at the Google bus.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.430
People were messaging
me on Twitter saying,

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.770
isn't this cool?

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.840
Isn't this great?

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.630
I was like, no, it's not great.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.060
I know people on the--

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:51.934
you guys do, too.

00:12:51.934 --> 00:12:54.350
Howard Rheingold's daughter
was on one of those buses that

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:55.910
got stuff chucked at it.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.450
He's a writer friend of mine.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.741
And the Googlers
aren't to blame.

00:13:01.741 --> 00:13:03.490
I mean, most of the
people on those buses,

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.864
they just want to try to keep
their jobs for four or five

00:13:05.864 --> 00:13:07.460
years before they
burn out, right?

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.290
What's the average
time span for--

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:17.060
I don't know, but it's hard.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.690
So then you could blame their--

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:18.830
what?

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.600
You going to blame
their bosses for the way

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.433
they make them work?

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:22.970
Or you could blame
the CEO of Google

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.726
saying, oh, look the
way Google's impact.

00:13:24.726 --> 00:13:26.600
The CEO is just listening
to the shareholders

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.141
who are going to
sell the stock if he

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.592
doesn't make the stock grow.

00:13:29.592 --> 00:13:30.800
And who are the shareholders?

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.174
Some of the very
same people that

00:13:32.174 --> 00:13:34.490
are lying in front
of the Google bus,

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.950
who have Google in
their S&amp;P 500 fund.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.540
So who is to blame?

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.080
And I'm arguing that it's
not a human is to blame

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.410
or everyone is to blame.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.900
That we can exercise
human intervention

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.220
at any place along that chain.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:51.530
But at the same time, it's not
the effortful acts of humans,

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:55.700
but this obedience to
an economic operating

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.210
system that was invented by
people who have long since left

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.260
the building.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.110
And what I wanted to do,
the project of this book,

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.840
was to convince people that
this is a very particular

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.820
economic operating system.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.160
And the way to do that was
to use the tools of the media

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.160
theorist-- who invented
it, when did they do it,

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.570
and why did they do it.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.630
And what I found
out was that this

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:21.170
originated after the Crusades.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.870
It was right after the Crusades
that all the soldiers came

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.542
back to their towns
in Western Europe

00:14:25.542 --> 00:14:27.500
because they had gone to
Arab worlds, found out

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.060
all these other things, found
new technologies, new systems.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.059
They came back to their
towns in Western Europe,

00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:34.460
and they erected the
marketplace for the first time.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.620
It was an innovation from the
Arab world called the bazaar.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.770
The marketplace that was
there two days a week.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.350
Usually, Tuesdays and
Thursdays, Tuesdays and Fridays.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.720
People would bring all the
stuff they had made or grown

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.526
and they would trade
it with each other.

00:14:46.526 --> 00:14:47.900
Instead of just
giving everything

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.120
to the feudal lord
or the vassal now,

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.910
they started to trade in
a peer-to-peer fashion.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.470
And when bartering
wasn't enough,

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.050
they developed local
currencies, market monies.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.540
Not big central currencies,
little market monies

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.730
that were usually
invented in the morning,

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.970
and then expired by
the end of the day.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.530
So these were more
like poker chips.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.732
So we can look
into specific ones.

00:15:08.732 --> 00:15:10.190
There were a lot
of different ones.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.065
But they got those from
the Arab world, too.

00:15:12.065 --> 00:15:15.140
And it was interesting because
people never had money before.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.660
That money was for
long distance trade.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.130
You know, gold
florins, and things.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:20.570
Peasants didn't have that.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.311
They didn't have a
means of exchange.

00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:23.810
So now they had a
means of exchange,

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.280
and they started to get wealthy.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.230
This was the beginning
of what later

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.720
called the Burghers, the
Bourgeois, the middle class.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.360
The merchant class
got really wealthy.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.829
And no, it wasn't
the best of times.

00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:37.370
It was still the Middle Ages,
and there were rats, and death,

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.830
and people beating you up.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.820
It was a Game of Thrones-y.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:45.500
But it was the greatest
period of economic growth

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.670
that we've ever really seen
of organic, distributed

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:50.600
economic growth.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.850
People started to work only
three or four days a week.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.989
Women were taller in medieval
England with the marketplace

00:15:55.989 --> 00:15:57.530
than they were at
any time in history

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.960
until 1980, which is
an interesting one.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.400
It's just one
measure of the fact

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.700
that these people were eating
and healthy and doing well.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.440
The problem with
it, of course, was

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.440
that as the people got
wealthy, the aristocracy

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.600
got relatively poorer.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.120
These were families that
hadn't worked in 10 centuries.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.360
They had always-- it's true.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.830
These were the former
feudal lords and now

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:20.140
the proto-aristocracy.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.770
So what they did
was they came up

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:28.760
with two innovations,
two sort of core tenets

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.370
of a new operating
system to slow

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:35.030
the rise of the merchant class.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.270
This isn't just
my interpretation.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.830
Look at what they read.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.800
Look at what they read,
what they wrote down

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.530
about why they were establishing
chartered monopolies.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.690
Why they were establishing
central currency.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.880
This is the history
that for some reason

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:57.770
is not as celebrated or as
talked about as it should be.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.210
First invention
they came up with

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.370
was the chartered monopoly.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.530
The chartered
monopoly was a rule.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.702
A chartered monopoly.

00:17:05.702 --> 00:17:07.160
It was exactly what
it sounds like.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.460
So now, one business is
chartered by the King

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.589
to be in charge of
an entire industry

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:16.500
and everyone else has
to work for that person.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.900
So whoever's the King's friend.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.829
Let's say it's Irwin.

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:23.119
You're a shoemaker.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:26.329
And you're my favorite
shoemaker in all of my country.

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:28.820
So now, anybody who
wants to be a shoemaker,

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.790
you've got to work
for him, period.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:32.630
Or I'll kill you.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:36.410
I mean, we had swords and
knights and people to do that.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.530
So if you're working for him
rather than making shoes,

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:40.520
what does that mean?

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.070
Now instead of creating
shoes and exchanging

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:48.230
the value you created, now
you are working for him.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.900
This is really when
employment was invented.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.930
The only people who were
indentured by time before that

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:54.980
were slaves.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.940
Now, people knew that
the normal way to work

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.040
was for me to clock hours.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.770
So instead of selling
the value I created,

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:09.320
now I'm selling the
time I've spent.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.200
That's when the clock tower
went up on the tallest

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.180
building in medieval towns.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.980
Because now time was money.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.890
And the idea of the
clock made it feel fair.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.840
It's really an hour.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.907
I'm not working longer.

00:18:21.907 --> 00:18:23.240
It's not taking his word for it.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.520
There's a clock to
make it all fair.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.840
But it was fair what?

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.230
It was fair monopoly.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.080
The second invention they came
up with was central currency.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.900
They made all local currencies,
all of these market moneys

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:36.874
were illegal.

00:18:36.874 --> 00:18:39.290
Now if you wanted to have money
in order to buy something,

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:43.100
you had to borrow money from the
central treasury at interest.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.600
Very clever idea because
what did that do?

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.200
An interest-bearing
currency lets

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.430
people who have money make
money simply by lending money.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:52.300
That was the point.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.800
It allowed the
people who already

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.990
had capital make
money by lending

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:57.280
their capital to others.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.570
Because this was
interest-bearing currency.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.910
The other problem with
interest-bearing currency

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:07.187
is not only do you
have to borrow it,

00:19:07.187 --> 00:19:08.770
but you have to pay
back more than you

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:10.340
borrowed in the first place.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.840
And if everybody's going to pay
back more than they borrowed

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.310
in the first place, what does
that mean about the economy?

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.919
Economy has to grow.

00:19:16.919 --> 00:19:19.210
Either that or you end up
with a lot of bankrupt people

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.890
who can't pay back
what they borrowed.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:24.070
So interest-bearing
currency demands,

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.200
its bias is towards growth.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.880
And this worked well right then
because what was Western Europe

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.380
doing?

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:29.950
Growing.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.570
We were colonizing everywhere.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.390
Colonizing America,
colonizing South America,

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.300
colonizing Africa,
trying to colonize China.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.710
As long as we were
growing, that was great.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.860
So we had our great
chartered monopoly,

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.230
British East India Trading
Company, Dutch East India

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:45.160
Trading Company.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.080
We had them going out
taking over spaces

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.500
partnered with the monarchs
and their gunships.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.540
And it all looked
pretty good as long

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.460
as we could keep expanding
into other places.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.310
And that all finally
came crumbling down

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:01.090
around World War II, when these
countries started to push back.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.460
When little brown people
in brown places said,

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.910
no, you can't just extract our
value and enslave our people.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.590
We're going to push back.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.870
So England gives up
some of its colonies.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.690
And then, Eisenhower,
right after World War II,

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.610
he's faced with this problem.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:19.000
How do we continue
to grow as an economy

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.300
without these developing
nations to take over?

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.000
We can have Bretton Woods, and
some trade deals, and all that.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.920
And all everybody's money
pegged to our money.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.380
But what are we going to do?

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.960
And that's when Vannevar
Bush wrote the famous essay

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.180
"As We May Think,"
which most of us

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.220
just think is this great
description of computer

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:36.770
technology.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.080
It's not just that.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.970
"As We May Think" is
really an argument

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:44.050
saying these tools of
war can be repurposed

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:49.720
to tools to build our economy,
to tools of a civilization.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.640
And what was the idea was
that even though we'd run out

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.450
of physical territory, computer
technology could create

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.600
virtual territory,
virtual surface area

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.050
on the market, so the market
could continue to expand.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:06.730
But instead of
expanding physically,

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.020
now we expand in terms
of consciousness.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.830
That's why we moved into
an intention economy.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.700
The new resource
that we colonize

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:19.360
is human attention,
human time rather than

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.880
physical territory
and resources,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.930
which we still, of course,
have to go and extract.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:32.110
But what we ended up with
then were digital businesses,

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:36.310
if you will, from
not just Google.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.590
And Google is really not the
worst of it in some ways.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.960
Because at least Google
has the intention

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.420
to be here 10, 20,
30 years from now.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.140
So it has to take a
slightly different approach.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.890
Google is not flipping.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.290
You're not going to flip Google.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.942
It's kind of too big
to flip at this point.

00:21:53.942 --> 00:21:55.650
I mean, Uber or
somebody, they're still--

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:06.310
what sort of business model does
this operating system engender?

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:12.520
It promotes the
Wal-Mart model, which

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.730
is just colonialism writ small.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:16.900
What does Wal-Mart do?

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.690
Wal-Mart moves into a region.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:22.540
It uses its tremendous
war chest of capital

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.030
to undercut all the local
merchants, to put them

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.690
all out of business.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:27.980
That's good for two reasons.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.280
One, no one can buy
anything anywhere else.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.410
And two, no one can
work anywhere else.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.416
So now we can change
the terms of employment,

00:22:35.416 --> 00:22:36.790
so that if you
want a job, you've

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:41.530
got to work part-time
for Wal-Mart.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.480
And you don't get health care.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.460
And you don't get this,
you don't get that.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:50.020
So slowly over
time, the people who

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:54.220
are working in a Wal-Mart
town have to go on welfare.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.892
The town gets poorer and poorer.

00:22:55.892 --> 00:22:57.850
And eventually-- it takes
about 15 or 20 years,

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.260
the town goes bankrupt.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.790
And then, what does Wal-Mart do?

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:05.500
Closes and moves to the next
area and sucks their value out.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:10.060
I mean, that's the
scorched earth approach

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.124
of a company like that.

00:23:11.124 --> 00:23:12.540
That's the way
they understand it.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.370
And as long as they understand
the world to be infinite,

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:14.800
it's OK.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.720
We can move into China.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.060
We move into India.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.230
We'll find other places.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.020
And then when that economy there
is restored with the last place

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.478
that we closed,
we'll go back there

00:23:21.478 --> 00:23:24.630
and suck out the money again.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.120
That's the mindset.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:33.760
So when that mindset ends
up informing businesses

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.650
that are running on
digital platforms,

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.810
it no longer takes 20
years for that to happen.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.030
It only takes two years
for that to happen.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.550
So you look at a company like--

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.900
it's not about being evil.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:48.130
It's just about adopting an
operating system as the way

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:48.820
to do business.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.280
It's just understanding
it as the way things are.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.290
So you take a
company like Amazon.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:57.400
So why does Amazon choose the
book industry to go into first?

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.050
Is it because Bezos
and his friends

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:01.600
just love books and they want
to promote literature and help

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.651
authors and publishers
reach more people?

00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:04.150
No.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:05.500
It's because the
publishing industry--

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.060
I know this because
I'm part of it.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.370
The publishing industry
is low-hanging fruit.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:12.640
We are a motley, awful,
non-growth, inefficient

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.420
business.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.760
The brilliance of
the book industry

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.760
is we managed to hide the
fact that we don't make money

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.550
for the last 200 years.

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:22.210
We don't.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:22.740
It doesn't.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.500
It's this little
kind of just fudge

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:29.317
it and get to the next
book kind of industry.

00:24:29.317 --> 00:24:30.400
So why did they pick that?

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.300
Because it was an
easy one to take over.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.920
It wasn't to make
money with books.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.960
It was to establish
a platform monopoly

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.720
in books that could then
be leveraged to another one

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.890
and another one.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.284
Why did Uber pick cabs?

00:24:45.284 --> 00:24:47.200
Because they want to
stay in the taxi business

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.340
because that's such
a great industry

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.650
that's going to really promote
a multibillion dollar company?

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:51.310
No.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:54.010
It's because cabs were the
most inefficiently run,

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.580
awful, slow-growth,
ridiculously,

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.530
barely-sustainable industry.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.600
Meaning it was ripe
for takeover if you've

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.950
got a war chest of capital.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.820
So the poor guys, if you're
driving a car for Uber,

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.740
what are you really doing?

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:13.420
You are doing R&amp;D for
a robotic car company

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.390
that you don't even own.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.550
You're making your
own job obsolete,

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.110
that's the work
that you're doing.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.070
And they don't really care.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.220
They don't care
because-- so you go in

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.560
and you destroy
the existing taxi

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.120
economy and infrastructure.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.180
It doesn't matter if they can't
make the long-run money out

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:31.830
of that.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.310
But They're destroying
that market,

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:35.470
just as Amazon destroyed
the book market.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.200
You destroy the marketplace
because you're just using it

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.180
to leverage into another one.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.120
And that's the problem
is that we end up

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.050
putting destructive,
extractive corporate capitalism

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:47.935
on digital steroids.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.940
And then you see how
all this keeps going.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.010
And it's not just
a digital problem.

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:58.120
It's a finance problem.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.210
As Deloitte showed in
2011, corporate profit

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:05.750
over corporate size has been
going down for 75 years.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.960
Think about that in
terms of functions.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.990
Corporate profit over corporate
size has been going down.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.840
What does that mean?

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.590
It means that corporations
are really good at extracting

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.750
all the money from an
economy, but really

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.746
bad at deploying those
assets once they have them.

00:26:19.746 --> 00:26:22.120
It's not just because they're
stuck in some European bank

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.400
account and they can't bring
it over without taxation.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.710
It's that they're obese.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.060
It's that they're
storing the money in fat

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.550
rather than muscle.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:33.200
They don't know how to actually
do anything with the money.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.850
And that's because the
OS that they're using

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:41.140
is to extract money and
store it in share price

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.180
rather than to think
of how to create

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.750
a healthy, living, ongoing
circulatory economy.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:52.930
They would rather make $10
once than $1 ten times.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.970
They can't even conceive
of the $1 ten times,

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:56.595
because then you've
got to keep letting

00:26:56.595 --> 00:26:58.920
go of the money to make it.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.920
They're stuck.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.730
Like I said, they're stuck on
the hard drive and not in RAM.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.700
And then you look at the way
we deploy our developers,

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.910
our smartest kids.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:10.326
They come out of
Stanford and what

00:27:10.326 --> 00:27:11.560
job do you take if you
get out of Stanford?

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.022
The highest-paying one is going
to be working for Goldman.

00:27:14.022 --> 00:27:15.730
And what are you going
to do for Goldman?

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.420
Are you going to be helping
them use money to create value?

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.950
Help them deploy capital in
ways that is the most efficient

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:25.550
for the development
of an economy?

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:26.050
No.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:28.990
You're going to write algorithms
that help you extract money

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:32.020
from the stock exchange,
or write derivatives

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.417
of derivatives of derivatives
that help you compress time.

00:27:35.417 --> 00:27:37.000
Derivatives are
basically abstractions

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.166
of stock, which are
abstractions of the marketplace.

00:27:40.166 --> 00:27:42.040
So you can do derivatives
or meta-derivatives

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.230
and meta-derivatives of that.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.820
And of course, the
derivative market

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.830
has gotten so much bigger
than the real stock market,

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:50.890
that the New York Stock
Exchange was purchased

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.961
by its derivatives exchange.

00:27:53.961 --> 00:27:54.460
It was.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.820
A thing has been swallowed
by its own abstraction.

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:05.150
And that's the biggest
business in the world now.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.242
So what to do about this?

00:28:07.242 --> 00:28:09.700
I mean, this is what we can
talk about in our conversation.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:14.300
I mean, I think what to
do about this is to use--

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:17.270
develop technologies
that are optimized more

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:20.480
for the velocity of transaction,
for the velocity of money

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.810
rather than the
extraction of capital.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:27.170
Traditionally, there are
three factors of production--

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.700
land, labor, and capital.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.880
And right now, young
developers, in particular,

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.710
as soon as they
have a good idea,

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:35.780
they go to the
capitalist, who then

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.390
becomes his new daddy
figure or something.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:40.970
And they do everything
in the name of capital

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:43.910
and forget about
the land and labor.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.080
And that's why we have
disenfranchised labor force.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.440
It's why we-- are
we still allowed

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.050
to talk about global
warming and climate change?

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:54.230
And we have a climate
that some scientists

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:58.430
suspect may be changing.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.180
So I came up with some really
simple ideas for what to do.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.970
I mean, let's call
them principles.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:09.350
I mean, the first one
is make them rich.

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:11.510
Make everyone you
work with rich.

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:14.600
And Google is actually good
at this in some respect.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.180
If you look at Facebook, you
put your video up on Facebook

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.240
and they just pretty much charge
you to show it to anybody,

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.820
beyond the three
of your followers

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:26.574
who actually are sent the
thing, and they don't share

00:29:26.574 --> 00:29:27.740
any of the revenue with you.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:32.730
If you put YouTube up on
Google, what do you get?

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.090
Do you get half the revenue,
half the advertising?

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:35.705
50%?

00:29:35.705 --> 00:29:36.739
Does anyone?

00:29:36.739 --> 00:29:37.280
AUDIENCE: 45.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.270
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: 45%?

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:39.470
I mean, what is that?

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:43.730
That at least is saying, OK,
rather than charging people

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.820
to share their content, at least
we're going to include them.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.620
Because why is that smart?

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.720
Because then you're going
to get more healthy,

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.150
good people making content.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.800
It's worth sharing.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.350
And it's not just to be nice.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:02.971
It's not to be weak and nice
or to fall victim to socialism.

00:30:02.971 --> 00:30:03.470
No.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:06.050
It's about creating
a working economy,

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:09.560
then people can actually
live and develop stuff.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.560
Another way to
think about this is

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:17.360
to look at the techniques
or the strategies

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.550
that family businesses use.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:21.570
Traditional businesses
think about it,

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.720
or a traditional
CEO or chairman will

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.750
think, how can I extract
enough money from this business

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.966
in order to leave something
for my grandchildren?

00:30:29.966 --> 00:30:31.340
Someone in a family
business will

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.070
think, how can I make
this business so healthy

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:37.670
that it will still be
here spewing good revenue

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:39.380
when my grandchildren
take it over?

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:40.880
And when you have
a family business,

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.080
then you start
thinking about, well,

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.538
what is the relationship of
this business to its employees?

00:30:44.538 --> 00:30:47.240
My kids are going to the
same school as my employees.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.860
If I'm an asshole
to my employees,

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.420
they're going to beat up my kid.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.394
There's that sensibility.

00:30:53.394 --> 00:30:55.310
I mean, it's obviously
more complex than that.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:58.690
But that sensibility
is the reason why--

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.800
and nobody wants to
share this data either.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.845
Family businesses do better
than shareholder-owned business

00:31:03.845 --> 00:31:06.516
in every single
metric except one.

00:31:06.516 --> 00:31:08.390
And that is that
shareholder-owned businesses

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:11.090
grow faster during booms.

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:13.130
They grow faster during bubbles.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:17.180
Other than that,
shareholder-owned businesses

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.980
grow faster and they pop.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.235
Family businesses do better
on every other metric.

00:31:21.235 --> 00:31:23.360
They actually make more
revenue over the long term.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:29.090
They have more stability, better
alpha and beta, everything.

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:32.399
Another thing to look at
is whether it's possible,

00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:34.190
and how could it be
possible for a business

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:35.720
to become a
steady-state business?

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.600
It's what John Stuart
Mill talked about actually

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.516
back when, that an economy
reaches a carrying capacity.

00:31:41.516 --> 00:31:43.640
And once it does, you have
to start thinking about,

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.530
how do you maintain
a steady state?

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:47.900
This sort of an
equilibrium state.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:51.230
How could a company-- is it
even possible for a company

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:54.440
to reach a certain
level of sustainability,

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.030
and then stay there?

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.530
I did a talk for
one of the-- we'll

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:00.980
just call it one of the
world's very biggest, biggest

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.750
soft drink companies.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:09.670
They did their shareholder
rally thing, and then I came.

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:11.600
And for the
shareholder rally, they

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.820
got the shareholders
and the executives

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:17.540
and the vice presidents
all shouting 4.3, 4.3,

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:20.300
which was the growth rate that
they wanted to hit that year.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.816
They had banners coming
down from the thing.

00:32:22.816 --> 00:32:24.440
And I got up there
and I said, you guys

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.170
are one of the 50 biggest
companies in the world.

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:31.040
If you need to grow at
4.3% in order to be OK,

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.560
then we're all doomed.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:37.350
So how do you get
to a steady state?

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:42.950
And that's thinking now in
terms of things like dividends,

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:44.524
letting your
employees work less.

00:32:44.524 --> 00:32:46.940
If you start thinking about
land and labor as participants

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.631
rather than just the people
who have given the capital,

00:32:49.631 --> 00:32:51.380
then all of a sudden
you can start to see,

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.390
oh, we've gotten more efficient.

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:57.590
There's ways to share the
wealth and to sustain a company,

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.411
but you've got to bring in
different sorts of investors.

00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:00.910
It's

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:02.740
Look at the way Unilever
is talking to its investors

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.240
now, saying we're not going to
give you that kind of growth.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.970
If you want that, go.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:10.270
It's scary, but those ones go
and other investors come in.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.790
Ones who understand that
in order to have a planet,

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.310
we're going to have to think
of another way to do this.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:17.770
I'm arguing that companies
learn to experiment.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:19.720
You can't go to a
company and say, oh,

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.330
go from this company to be one
of those kind of companies.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:24.670
But you can slip things in.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:26.980
Call it public relations.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.720
So I went to a bank
and I was arguing

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.600
that what they should do
is rather than give, say,

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.990
$100,000 to a pizzeria
that wants to expand.

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:38.560
Why don't you give $50,000
to the pizzeria contingent

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.280
on their ability to crowdsource
$50,000 from their community?

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.780
And then you can
give them the tool,

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.040
give them an app or something,
that lets them do that.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.498
And the way they
crowdsourced would

00:33:47.498 --> 00:33:50.620
be if you give $100
to the pizzeria today,

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.500
you get $120 of pizza
at the restaurant

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.190
when the expansion is finished.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:57.730
So now you've gotten a
20% return on your value--

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.350
on your money in
less than a year.

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:01.810
And you've invested in your
town, making your town better

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:05.112
with that money rather than
in a Filipino mining company

00:34:05.112 --> 00:34:06.820
or something that's
just going to destroy

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.940
the planet with that money
and give you less return.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.100
Meanwhile, the bank
now is seen not just

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.590
as the extractor of capital
and value from the community,

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.699
not just as the bank,
but as a facilitator

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:20.620
of local economic reinvestment.

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:23.830
As someone who has an
expertise in the flow of money

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.850
rather than just a
monopoly on the extraction

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:29.440
and loaning of money,
which is something really

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.957
important for banks to be
able to develop as we move

00:34:31.957 --> 00:34:33.790
into a world where
people can't borrow money

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:36.429
and where there's
going to be some--

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:40.850
hopefully, a shift towards
local economic activity.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.719
But you don't tell Chase,
this is your new policy.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:45.969
You tell Chase, wouldn't
this be an interesting thing

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:50.080
to try in Lansing, Michigan,
for a six-month period

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.489
as a public relations thing?

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:56.969
And get MSNBC to come in and
do something about this trial.

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:58.060
So little trials.

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.850
When the little trials work,
they swallow the company.

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:01.420
Or they can.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.280
Remember GM with Saturn?

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.000
That was a trial.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.070
And what if we're actually nice
to labor and build good cars

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.860
and have customer service?

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.550
And it got so good that
GM had to shut it down.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.570
That the people in
regular GM got mad.

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:16.600
The same way people at Delta
got mad at Song airlines

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:20.600
because Song was doing all this
stuff that Delta couldn't do.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.610
Five.

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:24.070
Think about, what
does it mean to be

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:28.210
in a bounded economy rather
than an infinite economy?

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:29.850
There is no infinite economy.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:31.889
You can't externalize
everything.

00:35:31.889 --> 00:35:34.180
Eventually, all the crap that
they're burying in China,

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.190
that turns out is on
the same planet as us. .

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.680
All the workers there, the
revolutions, the angry--

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.960
the planet got small.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.500
There's no place to send stuff.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.550
The economy can't
keep growing forever.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:44.170
It just can't.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.220
We can't keep folding
in so much stuff.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.500
We'd have to all be--

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.200
God knows what we'd
have to do to ourselves

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.200
to maintain economic
growth all the time.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.700
We're consuming.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.440
We're working.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.930
Everything we do
is working somehow.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:02.140
When you unplug, it's
almost a revolutionary act

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.110
at this point.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:06.940
But a bounded economy, you would
start to think more in terms

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:11.080
of, how can I get the
same money moving around?

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:15.550
And I got the idea from
the US steel workers

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.820
who in 2007 after
the crash, they

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.610
were looking for where to invest
their retirement money to take

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:22.810
their pension funds.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:25.390
And what they did with
the pension funds was they

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:27.910
invested it in
construction projects

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:30.926
that hired steel workers.

00:36:30.926 --> 00:36:32.800
And people got really
upset at this at first,

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.720
saying wait a minute, are
they allowed to do that?

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.886
This is like double dipping.

00:36:35.886 --> 00:36:37.390
You're putting your
investment money

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:39.140
in a project that then
is going to pay you

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.230
back the money as salary?

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:42.980
Of course they're
allowed to do that.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:47.440
And then they thought, well,
why don't we now triple dip?

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.080
We'll invest our money in
construction projects that

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.394
hire steel workers
to build old age

00:36:52.394 --> 00:36:53.560
homes for their own parents.

00:36:56.455 --> 00:36:57.080
Which they did.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.330
So now they're triple dipping.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.400
And it sounds
illegal, but it's not.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.430
That's the way money works if
you think of it as bounded.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:07.444
How do we initiate that
boomerang effect in money?

00:37:07.444 --> 00:37:08.860
And the only way
to really do that

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.410
is to create some
sense of boundary.

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:12.580
And this is where--

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.330
although misguided
and mentally ill,

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:20.200
this is where Trump's
notion of nationalism

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.540
actually does make some sense.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:25.390
That people do have an
instinctual understanding

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:28.180
that the global economy
doesn't serve human beings

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.760
in scaled communities.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.980
How do we get boundaries?

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.360
Nationalist boundaries are fake.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.318
What you really want are
city-state boundaries.

00:37:36.318 --> 00:37:37.780
You want urban boundaries.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.450
Nationalism itself
was a construct.

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:43.060
You know, the nations,
those lines, those

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.400
are not organic
groupings of people.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.440
And a couple of the other
things I'm looking at

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.110
are platform cooperatives,
where worker's

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:52.240
own the means of production.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:56.440
What would it mean
if Uber drivers owned

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.970
the company rather
than someone they

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:01.220
don't know owning the company?

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.640
Will Juno work in New York?

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:06.300
Which is really a platform
co-operative version of Uber,

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.710
hopefully.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:08.550
And currencies.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:12.120
I'm really interested in local
and alternative currencies,

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.380
and using them for
exchange between people.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.410
If money has gotten
too expensive,

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:18.229
then screw their money.

00:38:18.229 --> 00:38:20.520
If you've got people with
needs and people with skills,

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.790
they can begin to
exchange value.

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:25.810
They just need a way
to keep track of it.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:30.340
And I don't mean Bitcoin,
which is just digital gold.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:30.870
It is.

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.550
Another scarcity-based currency.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:34.350
You could use the
blockchain to--

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:35.730
if you really
don't trust people,

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:38.950
you can use the
blockchain to create

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:41.250
a public verifiable ledger.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:46.110
But it's really much more Uber--

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:49.620
Bitcoin is the kind
of an Uber currency.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.590
But Bitcoin does
not engender trust

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:55.200
between people in new ways.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:59.620
Bitcoin replaces, it substitutes
for trust in a new way.

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:04.170
So as I see it, as we try
to evolve towards a more

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:10.410
communitarian, social,
peer-to-peer economic world,

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:17.100
I don't see more substitution
as really the way through it.

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.890
But I mean, as you
can tell, really

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:21.540
the whole argument
I'm making, which

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:27.510
is really my original cyberpunk
argument of 1994, if anything,

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:29.400
is we have to stop
thinking of ways

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:34.320
to optimize human beings
for digital technology.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.530
And instead, look at ways to
optimize digital technology

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.870
for human beings.

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:45.450
And the economy is
really the main landscape

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.180
that we're programming
at this point.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:56.640
We've internalized the values
of extractive growth-based

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:01.260
corporate capitalism as
a necessary component

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.660
of the innovations
that we develop.

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:04.740
And it's not.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.530
It's just one way to make money.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:10.970
And there are all these
other ways to make money.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:12.449
You know, all boats raise.

00:40:12.449 --> 00:40:14.490
But all boats raising is
not this terrible thing.

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:18.160
It's really OK for
everybody to be happy.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.880
This sort of scorched
earth competitive model

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.600
does not work in a
distributed digital economy.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:28.180
The effects of our causes
are much too great.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:31.230
We're all developing apps that
are potentially high leverage

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:34.440
points in entire economies.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.050
And that puts a different
kind of responsibility on us

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:39.660
to at least look at, what
is the economic impact

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.190
of this innovation?

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:43.440
Is this spreading wealth
or extracting wealth?

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.730
Is this making people richer?

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:46.080
Is it making people poor?

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.150
Is it helping
create circulation,

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.500
or is it taking
money off the table?

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.650
And when you start
thinking about it that way,

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:54.690
all of a sudden it becomes--

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:58.170
it's not like some crazy
socialist, Marxist insanity.

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:02.010
It's actually more consonant
with digital technology

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:07.110
than it is a threat to what
it is that we're trying to do.

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:08.160
OK, good.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.130
Thanks.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:12.128
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:12.128 --> 00:41:14.020
I went too long.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:14.520
I'm sorry.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.920
But we get to talk.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.000
SPEAKER: All right.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.799
So we have 15 minutes.

00:41:18.799 --> 00:41:20.840
Got some microphones, some
questions if you have.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.657
And I'm going to start by
asking you some questions.

00:41:24.657 --> 00:41:25.990
I had a whole list of questions.

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:30.430
And I have to trim it done,
so we keep to the tricky ones.

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:34.170
So you argued that we have to
go local instead of global.

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.870
And this is to increase
the velocity of money.

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:40.340
And now, the problem is
that there are some shocks--

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.920
and you mentioned
Wal-Mart, or whatever,

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.936
who can go into this local
economy and eat you alive.

00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:47.810
And you make a point,
I believe, in your book

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:50.930
that government has to
step in at some point

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:52.880
to make this work.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.510
So what concretely does
government need to do?

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:57.350
And if for whatever
reason we're not

00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:00.062
too hopeful in our
government abilities, what's

00:42:00.062 --> 00:42:01.100
the alternative?

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:01.670
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF:
Government can't

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:03.020
step in and make this work.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.490
I mean, government can--

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:07.160
especially because
government is--

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.620
as we know it, government
and corporatism

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.150
are really the same thing.

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:12.440
They co-evolved.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.400
They moved together.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.770
What government can do
is get out of the way.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:18.950
Right now, we live in
a economic landscape

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:23.240
that is regulated to
favor those with capital.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.710
Look at our tax code.

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:27.350
You are taxed low
for capital gains

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:34.430
and you're taxed high for
dividends and income and wages.

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:35.322
What does that mean?

00:42:35.322 --> 00:42:37.280
It means that the person
who works for a living

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.880
is the sucker and the person
who has others working for him,

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.080
or just has his capital working
for him, that's the winner.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.780
And that's the kinds of
regulations we can change.

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.350
But the regulations
are so easily

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:55.430
corrupted by the
larger players when--

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.230
I forgot which American
toy manufacturer

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:59.840
had lead paint on
their Dora toys.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.000
They had red lead paint.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.520
They established a new
regulatory commission

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.620
to come up with new rules
that will stop there

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.954
from ever being lead paint
getting to American children.

00:43:08.954 --> 00:43:10.495
And of course, what
they did was they

00:43:10.495 --> 00:43:12.560
invited government, and
then the five biggest toy

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.750
companies in America,
to come to this meeting.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:18.500
And they come up with
rules that say, oh, you

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.100
have to spend $40,000
of testing on any toy

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.890
that you want to promote--

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:25.760
that you want to
sell in America.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.040
Now, why did they come up
with a regulation like that?

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.590
Because it put every small
player out of business.

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:32.270
If you're making
30 trains a year,

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:34.250
30 little toy
trains by hand, how

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.860
are you going to do $40,000
of testing on that train?

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:37.550
You can't.

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:39.120
And each is one of a kind.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:43.850
So the temptation of
regulation is for the players

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:46.080
to use regulation
to favor themselves.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.700
So I would say no, it's a matter
of municipalities developing

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.520
alternative mechanisms
of exchange.

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.950
The only reason why Wal-Mart
sells its stuff cheaper

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:56.960
is because money is
cheaper for them.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.779
Money is cheaper for Wal-Mart
than it is for you or me.

00:43:59.779 --> 00:44:01.820
But if we had our own
money, it could be as cheap

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.030
as we wanted it to be.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.530
I mean, no.

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:05.363
We're still going to
have to get some stuff.

00:44:05.363 --> 00:44:08.030
You're still going to need
to get your iPhones and--

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.030
what are they called now,
the new Android phone?

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:11.070
SPEAKER: Pixel.

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:14.030
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: Pixel?

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:16.589
We'll talk about it.

00:44:16.589 --> 00:44:19.130
I guess they're saying it's a
better camera with that, right?

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:21.830
That's the idea?

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:23.430
Or something-- more visual?

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.930
No.

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:24.660
But your Pixel.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.550
You're still going to get that.

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:28.100
You're still going to need
little slave children in Africa

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.550
to go and get your rare earth
metals and other kids in China

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:33.440
lose their fingers
to make this stuff.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:37.040
So you still get to buy your
big, abusive, international

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.930
corporate stuff

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:49.190
By inventing means of exchange
between people in real places,

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:51.560
I think it's more of
a bottom-up phenomenon

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:55.509
than it is something that
government regulates.

00:44:55.509 --> 00:44:57.050
If we're going to
lobby for anything,

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:58.940
it's things like
changing the tax code,

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:03.620
doing things to make it less
expensive to generate revenue.

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.350
SPEAKER: So if we go local--

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:07.550
and this is going to
be progressive, right?

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:10.790
Not everyone is going
to go local overnight.

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:13.680
So some places will still do
the global game, and the capital

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.540
game, and whatever.

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:19.245
And today, some of the advances
we make around health care

00:45:19.245 --> 00:45:22.160
or sending satellites,
they are very expensive

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.410
and require a lot of capital.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:26.450
So are we going to have
a two-speed society

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:29.780
where the people who do the
sharing and live happily

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:34.580
don't get to benefit from
the advances of longer

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.735
life and those crazy,
fast cars, or whatever?

00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:39.110
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF:
I think there's

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:41.750
going to be two approaches
toward longer life.

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:46.250
One approach toward longer
life is living the kind of life

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.110
where you live longer.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:54.140
Eating organic, local, CSA food.

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:58.070
Having a chiropractor, or
homeopath, or naturopath

00:45:58.070 --> 00:45:59.670
in your world.

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:04.130
A more sustainable maintenance,
healthy way of living.

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:07.100
Then, you could
live on jet planes

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:08.469
and traveling around the world.

00:46:08.469 --> 00:46:10.010
And luckily, you'll
make enough money

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.880
to get chemotherapy
and gene replacement,

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:17.200
and you'll go about it that way.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.440
So you will see a
two-tiered world.

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:24.990
I wonder who will actually live
longer in such an environment.

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:27.360
But in the period
of the late Middle

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.280
Ages that I was
talking about, we

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:33.960
had two economies
that coexisted.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.240
You still had the florin.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.614
You still used gold and
long-distance trade for things

00:46:39.614 --> 00:46:40.530
that you couldn't get.

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.870
For spices, for
gunpowder, for whatever

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:44.910
it is that you got
from far away places.

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:48.540
And you had local currencies
that you used for your food,

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:52.320
for your babysitting,
for local things.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.020
It's just that so many things
that could be supplied locally

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:58.230
are now being supplied
through big agra

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:01.350
and big pharma and
big-- so unnecessarily.

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:03.140
So it's a matter of
creating balance.

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.070
I don't think you live
in one world completely

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:06.069
or the other completely.

00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:08.610
It's just a matter of shifting
the balance a little bit.

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:12.390
And digital technology actually
promotes local activity

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:14.490
more than it does national.

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:19.920
The nationalism, the Brexit, the
divisiveness that you're seeing

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.110
are all products
of the digital age.

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:25.230
This is important media
theory for anybody

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:27.450
in the digital
landscape to understand.

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:29.490
Television was global.

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:34.380
Television was the simultaneous
real around-the-world satellite

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:39.550
images of man landing on
the moon and Olympics.

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:41.400
These were embracing.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:44.550
The peak of the television
age was Ronald Reagan

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:47.670
in front of the Brandenburg
Gate on CNN saying,

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:50.010
Mr. Gorbachev, tear
down this wall.

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:52.650
It was about globalism.

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:54.030
What's the digital age about?

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:56.340
It's Donald Trump saying,
let's build a wall.

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.480
Let's divide our country.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.070
Let's get out of the euro.

00:47:59.070 --> 00:47:59.950
What were we?

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:01.840
It's built on memory.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.660
That's why they
always keep saying,

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:05.010
make America great again.

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:06.510
Remember when Britain was great?

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:08.544
There's all this
sense of false memory

00:48:08.544 --> 00:48:10.710
of where things were, because
this whole platform is

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:11.970
living on memory.

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:14.070
And second, it's because
digital is discrete.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:15.240
Not just ones and zeros.

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.950
But you think of
a snap-to it grid.

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:17.790
You're either here or there.

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:18.956
Are you Mexican or American?

00:48:18.956 --> 00:48:20.200
Are you Canadian or American?

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.616
Are you on that side of the
wall or this side of the wall?

00:48:22.616 --> 00:48:26.340
That sense of individual,
of divisiveness,

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:31.810
is actually more local
than it is universal.

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:35.640
I feel like that's
what's being retrieved.

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.670
And initially, it's being
treated in an infantile way,

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:42.060
but we could do it in a more
intelligent, articulated way

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:43.319
later.

00:48:43.319 --> 00:48:45.360
SPEAKER: Let's take a
question from the audience.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.980
AUDIENCE: What would
the proposition

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:49.290
be to individuals
and companies who

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:52.260
are embedded in the
current operating system?

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:55.050
Is a new operating system
something altruistic,

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:57.180
that's necessary for
the good of mankind,

00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.830
or is it something
that's necessary

00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:01.500
because we've reached the
limits of global scale?

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:04.050
Or is this something
where you can actually

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:08.070
increase your profits by getting
a 20% return on your dollar

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:11.660
investing in local
pizzerias at scale?

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:12.160
Which is it?

00:49:13.847 --> 00:49:15.930
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: I don't
know which one it's not.

00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:23.910
Extract of corporate capitalism
has reached its limit.

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:25.230
It actually has.

00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:28.500
I mean, that's why I
quoted the Deloitte study,

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:33.490
that corporate profit over
corporate growth failed.

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:35.940
So you know, Jack
Welch and GE, when

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:38.640
they realized we can make
more money lending someone

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.980
to buy a washing machine
than we can selling them

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.830
a washing machine, GE sold
their appliance business

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:46.350
and became more like a bank.

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:47.130
And they did.

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:49.014
And Harvard Business
School, that's--

00:49:49.014 --> 00:49:50.430
I think it still
is-- what they're

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:52.170
teaching as how to do business.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:53.610
Become a holding company.

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:54.320
Like Google did.

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:54.960
It became Alphabet.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:55.890
Become a holding company.

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:57.306
Buy and sell
companies rather than

00:49:57.306 --> 00:50:00.720
do internal
technological innovation.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.420
But that reached its peak.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:08.610
So I think it's actually better
business teaching companies how

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:13.800
to return to
revenue-based models

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.630
rather than what they're doing.

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:18.240
I mean, the soft drink
company, they were--

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:21.930
at that point, they were selling
their most productive assets

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:25.830
in order to show short-term
growth on the balance sheet.

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:28.440
So that's not a good
long-term strategy.

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:33.510
That's self-cannibalization at
that point to show the growth.

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:36.910
But it never plays
to say it's altruism.

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:38.250
Oh, this is good for the world.

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:41.220
Oh, there might be a planet for
your grandchildren to live on.

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:42.790
No one wants to hear that.

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:43.290
They don't.

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:44.370
That's not my job.

00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:45.690
That's not my job.

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:46.601
I do that at home.

00:50:46.601 --> 00:50:47.350
That's not my job.

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:48.510
My job is to be--

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:50.250
make money.

00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:53.287
But a lot of it's shareholder
communication, too.

00:50:53.287 --> 00:50:54.870
How do you communicate
to shareholders

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:57.180
that getting dividends
might be better

00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:00.109
than just the growth
in their stock?

00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:02.400
And the way to convince them
that is to get the tax law

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:05.020
changed on dividends so they
don't hate them so much.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.179
SPEAKER: Question.

00:51:06.179 --> 00:51:06.720
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.000
So you mentioned a few
times that you thought

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.880
it would be good for
people or corporations

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.590
to optimize more for money
moving around or circulating,

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:16.310
but it's not immediately clear
to me why that's a good thing.

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:17.530
Can you talk about that?

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:18.488
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: Yeah.

00:51:18.488 --> 00:51:21.600
I mean, the problem with
extractive corporate capitalism

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:27.180
is if you take the money out of
the economy, then the people--

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.640
your customers no
longer have any money

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.370
to buy stuff from you.

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:34.770
So you want them to be able--

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:39.930
Wal-Mart's strategy of pushing
people down to the poverty line

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:42.660
in order to take all the
money that's on the table

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:45.090
ends up being a bad
idea because no one is

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:47.970
going to loan these people
money because they have no jobs.

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:51.090
And they can't spend money
because they don't have cash.

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:55.740
So what I'm suggesting is
that if companies circulated

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:58.109
or thought of ways to
circulate the money faster,

00:51:58.109 --> 00:52:00.650
they end up with just as much
money coming through their toll

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:03.690
booth, but they don't take
it off the table the minute

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:05.400
it goes through the toll booth.

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.640
The vacuum cleaner effect
of an Amazon or an Uber

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.220
destroys the marketplaces
on which those companies are

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:14.280
ultimately depending in
order to have revenue, which

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.430
is why Google, by
helping to try to make

00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:20.520
video makers rich rather
than poor, at least

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:24.720
they have a model for
a sustainable market

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.450
rather than one that needs
to get its money coming in

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:29.592
from elsewhere.

00:52:29.592 --> 00:52:31.568
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:52:31.568 --> 00:52:33.392
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:33.392 --> 00:52:34.350
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: Yeah.

00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:36.100
AUDIENCE: You keep the
goose around rather

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:37.170
than killing it once.

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:38.169
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: Right.

00:52:38.169 --> 00:52:39.944
And eating it.

00:52:39.944 --> 00:52:40.610
But you have to.

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:43.051
If you've got to show 100x
returns, kill the goose.

00:52:43.051 --> 00:52:43.550
Here.

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:44.870
Get out.

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:49.750
I mean, will Travis be at
Uber when it has its IPO?

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.140
That's the question.

00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:54.350
There's a point at which you're
playing flip this business.

00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:55.970
You have an idea
from the dorm room.

00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:57.170
You bring it to the VC.

00:52:57.170 --> 00:53:01.220
And the VC says, now take that
idea and pivot toward something

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:04.280
that we can sell for
100 times what we just

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:08.330
spent within 2 years.

00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:10.520
So you throw away
that great idea.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.710
Think of all the
great apps that got

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:15.134
dispensed with because they
had to do this one thing.

00:53:15.134 --> 00:53:16.550
You know, that's
what we're doing.

00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:19.580
We're building software to
extract money from marketplaces

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.020
and store it in share price.

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.940
And that's a strange
thing to be using

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.910
all of this technological
know-how to do.

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:28.430
AUDIENCE: So you paint a
pretty compelling picture

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:31.670
of the impact of
capitalism for centuries,

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:35.295
and how it effects the
digital economy today.

00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:37.875
But when you were talking about
the Middle Ages, for example,

00:53:37.875 --> 00:53:39.500
I was thinking about
what was happening

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.630
in some other non-European
parts of the world

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:44.060
at the time who were not
necessarily colonizing.

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:45.170
They were expanding.

00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:49.650
So for example, feudal
Russia and feudal China.

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:53.360
And it's perhaps not entirely
a historical accident

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:56.690
that those countries wound
up for a period of time

00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:58.970
in their histories
experimenting with communism

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:00.560
rather than capitalism.

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.170
So how do you think
those countries and just

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:05.330
the existence of
this not necessarily

00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:08.990
parallel, but distinct economic
structure is going to affect

00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:11.072
and is already affecting
the digital age?

00:54:11.072 --> 00:54:12.530
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF:
It's interesting.

00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:14.300
I mean, I feel like
in a digital age,

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:17.330
we have more room for
the retrieval of some

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:19.040
of these alternative models.

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.480
One of them I was looking at--

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:24.400
I don't talk about that much,
but was the Arab millet system.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.770
They had a completely different
currency system than we did.

00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:29.600
We were the Crusaders
going there.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:37.390
But we had a colonial
mandate because we

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:38.390
had to grow our economy.

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:41.660
When they didn't have a
colonial mandate, as China say,

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:45.180
they end up looking at things
with a much longer-term

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:45.680
strategy.

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:50.060
I mean, China now,
why would China

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:54.380
care more about global warming,
say, than America would?

00:54:54.380 --> 00:55:00.545
Because China's economic
model is bounded.

00:55:00.545 --> 00:55:02.420
Yeah, they think of
themselves as the empire,

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:05.150
but it's not about
becoming global.

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:09.500
It's about China as this thing.

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.260
The millet system, which
was a whole other currency

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:18.285
system in the Arab world,
you don't grow your money.

00:55:18.285 --> 00:55:20.660
It was a sustainable money
that stayed at the same value,

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:21.680
or even had demarrage.

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.540
It even devalued over time.

00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:26.390
And different localities could
really generate as much money

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:31.460
as they needed to accomplish
their economic goals,

00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:36.170
not that the Arab world is doing
totally great philosophically

00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:36.780
right now.

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:37.446
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:55:37.446 --> 00:55:40.090
So to follow-up on
that, in that same vein,

00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:42.920
I mean, do you not agree
with the Western mentality

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.800
that we're taught that all of
those experiments have failed

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:46.510
or are failing?

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:48.890
I mean, we tend to think--

00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:52.970
I mean, obviously,
Russia is whatever.

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:55.760
I'm Russian, so I'm allowed
to say it, but I won't.

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:59.990
And then, the Arab
world is experiencing

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:04.820
cultural issues and religious
extremism, et cetera.

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:07.710
And you know, China is--

00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:10.220
in the United States,
we're not necessarily

00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:14.479
taught by our mentality
that China is doing well.

00:56:14.479 --> 00:56:16.020
We're taught that
it's going to fail.

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:17.320
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: Right.

00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.900
Well, now that
we're going to fail,

00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:20.680
it's going to be interesting.

00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.410
Now that we're just
one of everybody,

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:23.660
it's an interesting moment.

00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:26.243
But you know who got asked the
question, interestingly enough,

00:56:26.243 --> 00:56:27.890
was the Pope got
asked that question.

00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:30.410
Not this one, but
one right after Marx.

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:32.529
The Pope was asked, well,
do you agree with Marx

00:56:32.529 --> 00:56:34.820
about the worker, or do you
agree with the capitalists?

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:36.319
And the Pope is
trying to be global.

00:56:36.319 --> 00:56:38.810
And the Pope came up with
a different economic model

00:56:38.810 --> 00:56:40.820
he called distributism.

00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:42.590
And the idea with
distributism was

00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:45.800
that no business
should be bigger

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:49.730
than it needs to be in
order to serve its function.

00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:51.350
So you don't grow
for growth's sake.

00:56:51.350 --> 00:56:54.026
A business becomes as big as it
needs to be to do what it does.

00:56:54.026 --> 00:56:56.150
And then if someone else
wants to do that business,

00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:57.680
then they do it somewhere else.

00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:00.830
If it's going to scale, it's
going to scale laterally

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:01.910
by other people.

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:03.830
The other idea of
distributism, what

00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:06.130
the Pope said was the
object of the game

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:09.320
is not to redistribute
the spoils of capitalism

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:11.190
after the fact.

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:14.990
What we do is pre-distribute
the means of production

00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:16.130
before the fact.

00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:18.350
So distributism held
that the worker should

00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:20.450
own the means of production.

00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:24.320
The worker should
own his own tools.

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.660
By inference, the cab
driver should own Uber

00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:29.120
instead of working for Uber.

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.515
And it's an interesting model.

00:57:30.515 --> 00:57:32.720
And one that I don't
think worked then,

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.640
but is actually one
that could work now.

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.830
That's why I'm hopeful that
a digital economy could

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:38.750
be distributist in its nature.

00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:40.760
So if we own the
platform through platform

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:43.220
co-operativism, then
we end up with--

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:45.410
I mean, what if the
YouTubers owned YouTube?

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:50.190
I mean, it's when it gets to
that place, you start thinking,

00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:52.560
oh, the Pope maybe
understood something.

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:57.110
And Pope Francis, for the
first time in 100 years,

00:57:57.110 --> 00:57:58.730
he retrieved some
of the language

00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:01.825
from that original kind
of distributist manifesto

00:58:01.825 --> 00:58:06.080
in the last thing, [INAUDIBLE],
his little treaties.

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.470
Because he understands
that distributism at least

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:11.030
is an economic
model that doesn't

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:15.339
depend on the destruction
of the planet.

00:58:15.339 --> 00:58:16.130
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:17.630
We're running out of time.

00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:20.660
So we have some books
you can get there.

00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:21.500
They're subsidized.

00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:22.640
And I think Douglas is
going to stay around.

00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.860
If you have more questions,
you can come and ask

00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:25.190
some questions.

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.450
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: Thank you.

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:26.520
SPEAKER: So again,
thank you for coming.

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:27.686
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: Good luck.

00:58:27.686 --> 00:58:31.070
[APPLAUSE]
