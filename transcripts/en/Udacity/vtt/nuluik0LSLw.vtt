00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.920
So far we've really only discussed the similarities between regular cars and

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.760
cop cars, and not any differences.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.760
So if our program was actually that simple,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.800
we wouldn't really need to differentiate.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.730
Both regular cars and cop cars just have a location and the ability to move.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.400
In that case, we could simply use our car function to build the new cop car cal.
