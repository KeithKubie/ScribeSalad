TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.340
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is your update

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.260
about the coolest developer news
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.600
It's DevFest season
again, which means

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.810
there's likely to be a
community-run developer

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.970
event near you sometime
in the next three months.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.720
Head on over to the post
to find your local DevFest

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.390
so you can hang out with other
developers and share ideas

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.130
about Firebase, the
Google Cloud Platform,

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.540
machine learning with
TensorFlow, web development,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.670
and more.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.820
The Closure Compiler is now
available in pure JavaScript.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.410
It's a JavaScript optimizer
trans compiler and type checker

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.690
which compiles your code into
a high-performance minified

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.560
version.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.810
Nearly every web
front end at Google

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.930
uses it to serve the smallest,
fastest code possible.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.440
And now you can run
it under Node.js

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.870
with support for some
popular build tools.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.720
Check out the post for links
to the docs, a demo project,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.146
and some getting started tips.

00:00:56.146 --> 00:00:57.520
If you have an
app you're getting

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.260
ready to launch on
Google Play, you

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.180
can nominate it to be part of
the Early Access collection.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.120
It's the place for
new Android titles

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.170
that are running in open beta,
available for anyone to try

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.300
before they officially launch.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.900
For more info, including
who is using this and why,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.060
check out the post linked below.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.510
Hutch is a London-based mobile
studio focusing entirely

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.170
on racing games, with more
than 10 million players

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.045
on Google Play.

00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:26.030
For their latest
game, MMX Hill Climb,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.460
they used AB testing
and game analytics

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.940
to improve the game
design and experience,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.450
resulting in more
than 48 minutes

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.960
of daily active usage per user.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.760
Check out the video on this
post to hear them explain how.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.300
Google Cloud Endpoints is a
distributed API management

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.850
suite that lets you
deploy, protect, monitor,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.520
and manage APIs
written in any language

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.017
and running on the
Google Cloud Platform.

00:01:52.017 --> 00:01:53.850
Check out this post to
read about the newest

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.390
set of features and open source
components now in open beta.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.740
This is a post by
a web engineer here

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.630
at Google who used the
Google Cloud Platform

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.770
Stack to create a bespoke
machine learning system.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.949
It's a really cool look at
how to use multiple cloud

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.759
components together
for prototyping

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.984
full end-to-end systems.

00:02:12.984 --> 00:02:15.150
And as long as we're talking
about machine learning,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.460
here's a post on the release
of Inception Resnet v2.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.740
It's a convolutional
neural network

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.600
that achieves a new state of
the art in terms of accuracy

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.240
on the ImageNet large-scale
visual recognition challenge

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.700
image classification benchmark.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.820
For an explanation of what that
means and links to the GitHub

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.290
project, check out the post.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.580

I'll see you next week.
