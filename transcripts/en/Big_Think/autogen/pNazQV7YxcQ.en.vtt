00:21:44.529 --> 00:21:44.539 align:start position:0%
think by and large it's mostly a
 

00:21:44.539 --> 00:21:48.190 align:start position:0%
think by and large it's mostly a

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.200 align:start position:0%

we<00:21:48.710><c> get</c><00:21:48.889><c> lots</c><00:21:49.039><c> of</c><00:21:49.190><c> knowledge</c><00:21:49.549><c> that</c><00:21:49.970><c> it's</c><00:21:50.299><c> hard</c>

we get lots of knowledge that it's hard
 

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
we get lots of knowledge that it's hard

to figure out whether it is reliable and
 

00:21:52.489 --> 00:21:54.669 align:start position:0%
to figure out whether it is reliable and
