00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.490
more respect has been given the TV
lately than it used to be totally do you

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500
lately than it used to be totally do you
 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.160
lately than it used to be totally do you
think that writing TV pilots is becoming

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170
think that writing TV pilots is becoming
 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.780
think that writing TV pilots is becoming
harder or something that's actually more

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790
harder or something that's actually more

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010
sought-after oh no I think it's it's
 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.940
sought-after oh no I think it's it's
more sought-after than than ever I think

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950
more sought-after than than ever I think
 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.789
more sought-after than than ever I think
that you know TV pilots give give

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799
that you know TV pilots give give
 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.890
that you know TV pilots give give
someone to an opportunity to really

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900
someone to an opportunity to really
 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.340
someone to an opportunity to really
showcase their storytelling skills

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350
showcase their storytelling skills
 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.990
showcase their storytelling skills
I think the demands of what you do in a

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000
I think the demands of what you do in a
 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.360
I think the demands of what you do in a
pilot you have to simultaneously be able

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370
pilot you have to simultaneously be able
 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.300
pilot you have to simultaneously be able
to you know create the world set the

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310
to you know create the world set the
 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.550
to you know create the world set the
characters off on their journey but also

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560
characters off on their journey but also
 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.199
characters off on their journey but also
really give a sense of kind of what the

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209
really give a sense of kind of what the
 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.759
really give a sense of kind of what the
show is and where it's going and that's

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769
show is and where it's going and that's
 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.580
show is and where it's going and that's
a it's harder than it looks

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590
a it's harder than it looks
 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.260
a it's harder than it looks
you know and

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270
you know and
 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.570
you know and
unlike a film or something where you're

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580
unlike a film or something where you're
 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.450
unlike a film or something where you're
resolving it as effectively resolving it

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460
resolving it as effectively resolving it
 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.260
resolving it as effectively resolving it
at the end you know you TV pilot has to

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270
at the end you know you TV pilot has to
 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.090
at the end you know you TV pilot has to
have some sort of sense of I think a

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100
have some sort of sense of I think a
 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.240
have some sort of sense of I think a
satisfying conclusion at least you know

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250
satisfying conclusion at least you know
 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.270
satisfying conclusion at least you know
in the micro but in the macro you see

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280
in the micro but in the macro you see
 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.640
in the micro but in the macro you see
that this world could just continue to

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650
that this world could just continue to
 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.340
that this world could just continue to
open up and that's it's conceptually I

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350
open up and that's it's conceptually I
 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.020
open up and that's it's conceptually I
think writing TV pilots is a lot harder

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030
think writing TV pilots is a lot harder
 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.660
think writing TV pilots is a lot harder
than then film I agree with you because

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670
than then film I agree with you because
 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.760
than then film I agree with you because
I personally tried it because films have

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770
I personally tried it because films have
 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.190
I personally tried it because films have
a simple three-act structure TV pilots

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200
a simple three-act structure TV pilots
 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.050
a simple three-act structure TV pilots
it's like you have characters you're

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060
it's like you have characters you're
 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.190
it's like you have characters you're
setting them up and then they can go

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200
setting them up and then they can go
 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.410
setting them up and then they can go
anywhere and even for an actor is that

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420
anywhere and even for an actor is that
 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.450
anywhere and even for an actor is that
kind of interesting to not exactly know

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460
kind of interesting to not exactly know
 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.310
kind of interesting to not exactly know
where your character could go it's one

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320
where your character could go it's one
 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.810
where your character could go it's one
of those things to where it's definitely

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820
of those things to where it's definitely
 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.600
of those things to where it's definitely
interesting as an actor the only part

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610
interesting as an actor the only part
 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.390
interesting as an actor the only part
about it that I like is that I do get to

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400
about it that I like is that I do get to
 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.610
about it that I like is that I do get to
pick up the script each week and not

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620
pick up the script each week and not
 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.300
pick up the script each week and not
know right but then as an actor the part

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310
know right but then as an actor the part
 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.040
know right but then as an actor the part
the aspect of it that I don't like about

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050
the aspect of it that I don't like about
 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.010
the aspect of it that I don't like about
is that we can't like to know where

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020
is that we can't like to know where
 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.360
is that we can't like to know where
we're going so we kind of plant the

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370
we're going so we kind of plant the
 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.490
we're going so we kind of plant the
seeds and kind of subtly do things that

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500
seeds and kind of subtly do things that
 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.050
seeds and kind of subtly do things that
would you know lead to the direction

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060
would you know lead to the direction
 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.850
would you know lead to the direction
that we're going so that's the hard part

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860
that we're going so that's the hard part
 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.110
that we're going so that's the hard part
is like oh man if I know that my

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120
is like oh man if I know that my
 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.640
is like oh man if I know that my
character was gonna do this I would have

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650
character was gonna do this I would have
 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.890
character was gonna do this I would have
made this choice last episode when this

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900
made this choice last episode when this
 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.260
made this choice last episode when this

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.480
that and I do understand it doesn't make
it I think it does make it more

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490
it I think it does make it more
 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.390
