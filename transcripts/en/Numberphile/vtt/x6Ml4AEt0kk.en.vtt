00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.660
BRADY HARAN: So that's the
Eurostar bringing people from

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.390
the continent here to London
for the Olympics.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.200
And if you're in London,
you can't far

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.450
without seeing these.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.860
Now, the Olympic rings are
pretty cool, but they're

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.340
joined in a bit of a
disappointing way, each one

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.960
joined to the one next to it.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.730
It's not very creative.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.710
Here at Numberphile, we like our
rings joined in a bit more

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.660
of a clever way.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.110
JOHN HUNTON: We all know how
two rings can be linked.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.042
So if I've got one ring and I
can link it with another one.

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:34.335
And that's how I can start
to form a chain.

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:37.640
And I can't pull those
two rings apart.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.750
But the cute idea of a Borromean
ring is that you end

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.410
up with three rings.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.370
Let's see if I can draw.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.460
So that's going to
be my first ring.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.630
And my second ring isn't
linked to it.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.270
Like that.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.110
See that one, if I filled in
the gaps, would be just

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.830
sitting on top of this one.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.730
And then I put a
third ring in.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.260
And this third ring is going to
go underneath my first one

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.810
and over my second one.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.010
Now.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.870
If you made that out of physical
pieces of metal,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.710
you'd find that you couldn't
pull it apart.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.480
Because take any two of those
rings, and it looks like they

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.430
could be pulled apart.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.520
But the third one acts as some
sort of tie joining them

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.810
together in a way that
they can never

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.410
be physically expanded.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.840
And I've got one here.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.265
I took a course in silver
smithing some years ago, so I

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.370
used to make things like this.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.490
And here we have three rings.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.200
Arrange it like that so they're
each at 90 degrees to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.730
each other.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.820
And each one goes outside one
ring and inside the other.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.700
But as you go around the rings
one, two, three, each is

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.370
inside outside, outside
inside, and so on.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.990
So the whole thing hones
together, and you can't take

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.530
them apart.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.940
So this is an example of
what mathematicians

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.840
call the higher linkage.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.400
So this is a more complicated
way in which three things

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.400
could be band together,
than the two rings.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.650
No two rings are linked together
in this sense.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.030
BRADY HARAN: Does this only work
with the number three?

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.940
JOHN HUNTON: No.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.430
Once you start playing with
these things, you realize you

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.500
could make a corresponding
entity out of any

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.610
odd number of rings.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.680
It has to be odd.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.170
Yes, it gets a bit fiddly if
you try to go beyond five,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.760
unless you're making
it much bigger.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.080
The other thing that you might
want to know about it is this

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.500
is much more familiar
as a braid.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.380
And everyone knows how
to braid three

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.240
strips, three wires.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.350
So if I had three ropes and I
braid by taking the middle

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.270
one, putting it over onto
the outer ones.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:05.200
And then I will swap over
down this row, won't I?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.210
So by that stage, I've swapped
everything around once.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.270
I've got two overlaps.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.900
Under, and then back to there.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.040
So if you chase this blue one,
this first blue one.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.970
So it's gone all the way
to the other side

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.870
and all the way back.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.070
So this one is an under.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.690
This other outer one going all
the way around here, and

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.310
that's come back to its end.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.130
If I now join it up, if I solder
this end to this end,

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.820
and that end to that end, and
that end to that end, I'd have

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.910
three rings, and they'd
be linked in

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.620
exactly the same fashion.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.640
BRADY HARAN:I tell you what
I take from that.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.233
I think the professor is much
better at making rings than he

00:03:47.233 --> 00:03:48.870
is at braiding hair.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.280
JOHN HUNTON: Yes.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.650
BRADY HARAN: If you want
to see a bit more about

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.570
interlinking rings, I've
actually done another video

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.890
just last week about how
chemicals can link

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.340
like this as well.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.050
Hopefully floating there, you
can see a little preview of

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.310
the video, and you
can click on it.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.770
There will also be a link
under the video.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.020
So have a look at
that one also.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.700
So I'm here in London, and I'm
going to beat up Henry.
