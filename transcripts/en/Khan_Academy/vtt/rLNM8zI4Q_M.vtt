00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.650
What I want to do in this
video is give ourselves

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.630
a basic introduction to
the phenomenon of light.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.950
And light is, at least
to me, mysterious.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.800
Because on one level it
really defines our reality.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.920
It's maybe the most defining
characteristic of our reality.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.570
Everything we see, how
we perceive reality,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.350
is based on light
bouncing off of objects

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.360
or bending around objects or
diffracting around objects,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.630
and then being
sensed by our eyes,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.890
and then sending signals
into our brain that

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.090
create models of the
world we see around us.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.740
So it really is, almost,
the defining characteristic

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.870
of our reality.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.300
But at the same time, when you
really go down to experiment

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.110
and observe with
light, it starts

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.840
to have a bunch of
mysterious properties.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.420
And to a large degree it is
not fully understood yet.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.012
And probably the most
amazing thing about light--

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.470
well, actually there's tons of
amazing things about light--

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.114
but one of the mysterious things
is when you really get down

00:00:59.114 --> 00:01:01.280
to it-- and this is actually
not just true of light,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.310
this is actually true
of almost anything

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.290
once you get onto a small enough
quantum mechanical level--

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.680
light behaves as both
a wave and a particle.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.010
And this is probably not
that intuitive to you,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.020
because it's not
that intuitive to me.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.930
In my life, I'm used to certain
things behaving as waves,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.430
like sound waves or
the waves of an ocean.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.070
And I'm used to certain things
behaving like particles,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.130
like basketballs or-- I
don't know-- my coffee cup.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.510
I'm not used to things
behaving as both.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.730
And it really depends on
what experiment you run

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.889
and how you observe the light.

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:38.430
So when you observe
it as a particle,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.725
and this comes out
of Einstein's work

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:43.350
with the photoelectric effect--
and I won't go into the details

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.766
here, maybe in a
future video when

00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:47.140
we start thinking about
quantum mechanics--

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.000
you can view light as a
train of particles moving

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.730
at the speed of light, which
I'll talk about in a second.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.990
We call these particles photons.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.990
If you view light in other
ways-- and you see it

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.220
even when you see light being
refracted by a prism here--

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.509
it looks like it is a wave.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.400
And it has the
properties of a wave.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.460
It has a frequency, and
it has a wavelength.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.700
And like other waves,
the velocity of that wave

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.010
is the frequency
times its wavelength.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.200
Now even if you ignore this
particle aspect of light,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.600
if you just look at the
wave aspect of the light,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.090
it's still fascinating.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.560
Because most waves require
a medium to travel through.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.580
So for example, if I think about
how sound travels through air--

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.250
so let me draw a bunch
of air particles.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.740
I'll draw a sound wave traveling
through the air particles.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.000
What happens in a sound wave
is you compress some of the air

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.870
particles and those compress
the ones next to them.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.405
And so you have points in
the air that have higher,

00:02:57.405 --> 00:02:59.180
I guess you could
say, higher pressure

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.679
and points that
have lower pressure,

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.080
and you could plot that.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.910
So we have high
pressure over here.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.180
High pressure, low pressure,
high pressure, low pressure.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.960
And as these things
bump into each other,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.574
and this wave essentially
travels to the right--

00:03:11.574 --> 00:03:13.740
and if you were to plot
that you would see this wave

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.430
form traveling to the right.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.460
But this is all
predicated, or this is all

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.700
based on, this energy
traveling through a medium.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.440
And I'm used to visualizing
waves in that way.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.145
But light needs no medium.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.790
Light will actually travel
fastest through nothing,

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.210
through a vacuum.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.830
And it will travel at an
unimaginably fast speed--

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.582
3 times 10 to the eighth
meters per second.

00:03:47.582 --> 00:03:49.123
And just to give
you a sense of this,

00:03:49.123 --> 00:03:51.930
this is 300 million
meters per second.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.590
Or another way of
thinking about it is it

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.130
would take light less
than a seventh of a second

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.310
to travel around the earth.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.020
Or it would travel around the
earth more than seven times

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.430
in one second.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.080
So unimaginably fast.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.540
And not only is this
just a super fast speed,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.470
but once again it
tells us that light

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.240
is something fundamental
to our universe.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.290
Because it's not just an
unimaginable fast speed.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.930
It is the fastest speed not just
known to physics, but possible

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.570
in physics.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.700
So once again something
very unintuitive to us

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.830
in our everyday realm.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.170
We always imagine
that, OK, if something

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.795
is going at some speed, maybe if
there was an ant riding on top

00:04:31.795 --> 00:04:34.211
of that something and it was
moving in the same direction,

00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:35.590
it would be going even faster.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.660
But nothing can go faster
than the speed of light.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.510
It's absolutely impossible based
on our current understanding

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.130
of physics.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.010
So it's not just
a fast speed, it

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.220
is the fastest speed possible.

00:04:55.674 --> 00:04:57.340
And this right here
is an approximation.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.570
It's actually 2.99
something something times 10

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.910
to the eighth meters per second.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.880
But 3 times 10 to the
eighth meters per second

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.820
is a pretty good approximation.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.540
Now within the visible
light spectrum-- and I'll

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.240
talk about what's beyond
the visible light spectrum

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.840
in a second-- you're probably
familiar with the colors.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.230
Maybe you imagine them as
the colors of the rainbow.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.470
And rainbows really
happen because the light

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.940
from the sun, the white
light, is being refracted

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.310
by these little water particles.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.980
And you can see that
in a clearer way when

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.500
you see light being refracted
by a prism right over here.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.530
And the different wavelengths
of light-- so white light

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.320
contains all of the
visible wavelengths--

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.860
but the different wavelengths
get refracted differently

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.080
by a prism.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.210
So in this case the
higher-frequency wavelengths,

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.520
the violet and the blue,
get refracted more.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.580
Its direction gets bent
more than the low-frequency

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.560
wavelengths, than the reds and
the oranges right over here.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.520
And if you want to look at the
wavelength of visible light,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.870
it's between 400 nanometers
and 700 nanometers.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.471
And the higher the frequency,
the higher the energy of that

00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:09.970
light.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.290
And that actually
goes into when you

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.370
start talking about the
quantum mechanics of it--

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.550
that the higher frequency means
that each of these photons

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.660
have higher energy.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.460
They have a better ability
to give kinetic energy

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.430
to knock off electrons or
whatever else they need to do.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.000
So higher frequency--
let me write

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.185
that down-- higher frequency
means higher energy.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.470
Now I keep referring to this
idea of the visible light.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.950
And you might say, what
is beyond visible light?

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.980
And what you'll find
is that light is just

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.500
part of a much
broader phenomenon,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.520
and it's just the part
that we happen to observe.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.320
And if we want to broaden
the discussion a little bit,

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.790
visible light is
just really part

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.290
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.290
So light is really just
electromagnetic radiation.

00:07:09.632 --> 00:07:11.840
And everything that I told
you about light just now--

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.090
it has a wave property and
it has particle properties--

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.930
this is not just specific
to visible light.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.150
This is true of all of
electromagnetic radiation.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.930
So at very low frequencies
or very long wavelengths--

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.920
we're talking about
things like radio waves,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.220
the things that allow a
radio to reach your car;

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.110
the things that
allow your cellphone

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.460
to communicate with cell towers;
microwaves, the things that

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.830
start vibrating water
molecules in your food

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.160
so that they heat
up; infrared, which

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.040
is what our body
releases, and that's

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.890
why you can detect
people through walls

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.180
with infrared cameras; visible
light; ultraviolet light,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.080
the UV light coming from the
sun that'll give you sunburn;

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.810
X-rays, the
radiation that allows

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.630
us to see through the soft
material and just visualize

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.960
the bones; gamma rays,

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.190
the super high energy
that comes from quasars

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.870
and other certain types of
physical phenomena-- these

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.890
are all examples of
the exact same thing.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.870
We just happen to perceive
certain frequencies

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.035
of this as visible light.

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:15.910
And you might say, hey,
Sal, how come we only

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.280
perceive certain
frequencies of this?

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.050
How can we only see
these frequencies?

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.060
Literally we can see
those frequencies

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.520
with our unaided eye.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.390
And the reason, or at
least my best guess

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.700
of the reason of that, is
that's the frequency where

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.960
the sun dumps out a lot of
electromagnetic radiation.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.320
So it's inundating the Earth.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.870
And if, as a species, you
wanted to observe things

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.559
based on reflected
electromagnetic energy,

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:46.065
it is most useful to be able to
perceive the things where there

00:08:46.065 --> 00:08:48.520
is the most
electromagnetic radiation.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.590
So it is possible that in other
realities or other planets

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.090
there are species
that perceive more

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.540
in the ultraviolet range
or the infrared range.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.050
And even on Earth,
there are some

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.720
that perform better at
either end of the range.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.370
But we see really well in
the part of the spectrum

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:08.099
where the sun just happens to
dump a lot of radiation on us.

00:09:08.099 --> 00:09:09.140
Now I'll leave you there.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.780
I think that's a pretty
good overview of light.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.290
And if any of this
stuff seems kind

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.220
of unintuitive or
daunting, or really

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.150
on some level confusing--
this wave-particle duality,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:25.570
this idea of a transfer of
energy through nothing--

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.700
and it seems
unintuitive, don't worry.
