ADAM STEWART: Welcome to
Musicians at Google.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.640
I am Adam Stewart, and
I'm very proud to

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.240
introduce John Taylor.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.070
John is the bass player of Duran
Duran, founding member

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.000
of the iconic British band that
was actually referred to

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.480
as the Fab Five.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.350
So if you're going to get a
compliment, get compared to

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.410
the Fab Four, for sure.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.600
John's book came out on
Tuesday the 16th.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.850
"In the Pleasure Groove: Love,
Death, and Duran Duran." I

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.540
highly recommend the book.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.720
The book has been the best
seller in the UK, where it was

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.080
released a couple weeks ago.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.590
Currently number six
on the New York

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.350
Times bestseller list.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.160
So what we're going to do today
is John and I will talk

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.020
a little bit, and then John's
also going to read a couple

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.180
passages from the books.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.610
John will stay afterwards to
sign a book, so they're

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.410
sitting outside, so please
be sure to get

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.860
a copy of the book.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.210
And just a couple of requests.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.370
We ask no flash photography
or recording, and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.480
if you could, everyone--

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.140
I know this is hard to
do at Google-- please

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.810
silence your phones.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.570
John, 1978 was the year that
Duran Duran was formed, and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.090
you have an amazing career.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.906
What made you decide to
write the book at this

00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:04.610
point in your life?

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.480
JOHN TAYLOR: A couple
of things.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.890
On the one hand, I lost my dad
coming up on three years ago

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.030
this Christmas, and he passed
away in the house

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.380
that I grew up in.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.140
And I sold the house, drove away
from the neighborhood.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.850
He was the last of
his generation.

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:32.100
I mean, I live in the fast lane,
like all of us here, and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.780
I find that constantly, I have
to really fight to hold onto

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.600
my memory these days, because
there's so much information

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.150
coming at me.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.340
And I found that from the moment
my dad was buried, the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.960
forgetting what was happening
so quickly.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.160
And so that kind of motivated
me to think about

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.080
memorializing my parents
in some way.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.990
I wasn't quite sure what that
was going to be, but I'm an

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.210
artist, so it's natural.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.092
I was thinking, should I
write some songs, or--

00:02:02.092 --> 00:02:03.750
I didn't know what it
was going to be.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.620
And then I was approached,
actually, at the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.790
beginning of last year.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.070
There's been quite a boom in
music memoirs in the last

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.610
couple years.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.695
We've got Keith Richards
to thank for that.

00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:18.410
And I was approached by an agent
in London who said, if

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.350
you were to be interested in
writing a book, this would be

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.120
a really good time.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.660
And I thought, well, maybe
that's what it is.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.720
So I kind of started formulating
the idea for the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.490
book, which is kind
of in three parts.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.960
There's growing up in the '60s
in the Midlands of England and

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.480
becoming John.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.010
And then the second section of
the book's hysteria, and

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.100
that's really about the first
five years of the '80s and

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.850
this wild ride that
Duran Duran took.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.940
And then the third part of the
book is the bit I call

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.480
becoming an adult human being,
and that's really been some of

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.180
the more profound highlights
of the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.690
last 15 years, I suppose--

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.440
losing parents, gaining
children, marriages, divorces,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.950
all of that sort of stuff.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.130
Real life stuff, but through
the lens of an ex-pop star.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.010
ADAM STEWART: Could you talk a
little bit about your process

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.510
for the book?

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.960
I know you partnered with Tom
Sykes, and Tom's a freelance

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.710
journalist, "Men's Health,"
"GQ," a bunch of other

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.230
publications.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.080
And at the same time, you're
going back 30 plus years, and

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.890
you've got all of these things,
and the book really

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.790
kind of tells a chronological
story, as you mentioned.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.300
So how did that all
come together?

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.220
JOHN TAYLOR: Well, when I did
move everything out of my

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.780
parents' house, I did come
out with a dozen boxes of

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.730
memorabilia from my early life,
which I thought a lot of

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.380
it was just gold.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.550
I thought, wow, I've got to
use this for something.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.950
So I knew that I was
going to have some

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.910
really, really good evidence.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.580
I had to sift through that,
and sort of organize it.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.500
Tom Sykes, you mentioned, he's
the ghost writer on the book,

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.040
and he was fantastic.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.440
I don't think I could have
done it without him.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.860
I thanked him in the back of the
book for holding the torch

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.510
steady as we went through
the attics.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.019
And he just kept me rolling.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.589
We couldn't descend
into neuroses.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:25.330
Once we made the decision to do
it, and we had a schedule,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.470
and we had to stick to it.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.200
And there was a couple of times
I thought, what am I

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.940
doing this for?

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.000
I knew I was going to have
to get into some

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.540
kind of murky stuff.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.990
It wasn't all going
to be happy.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.570
But I felt that for the book
to have any sense of

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.800
authenticity to it, it was going
to have to touch on some

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.330
of the darker sides
of success.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.700
But yeah, we had a pretty good
working ethic, and when things

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.400
got really tough, we'd just get
on our bikes and go for a

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.800
ride, burn it off.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.910
ADAM STEWART: Sources
of inspiration

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:01.640
while you were writing.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.850
Were you going back
and listening

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.625
to some of the music?

00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:05.120
Were you reading something
in particular?

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.890
I know you mentioned Keith's
book, although I think your

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.800
book takes a different tone,
because Keith dishes a lot on

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.440
his bandmates.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.670
And you didn't necessarily
take that tactic.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.630
JOHN TAYLOR: Well, I've
read a lot of books.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.380
I've read a lot of books.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.180
I'm a huge fan, first, of
popular culture, so I've read

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.670
a lot of books over the years.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.640
And generally, the better books
about music are written

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.550
by writers.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.020
But there are one or two memoirs
that really work.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.650
I mean, actually, I remember
when I was about 14, Ian

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.890
Hunter, who was the singer with
Mott the Hoople, and he

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.440
wrote this book called "Diary of
a Rock and Roll Star." And

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.920
it was a very pragmatic, day
by day breakdown of what a

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.850
band did when it was on
the road in America.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.710
It wasn't a sex, drugs, and
rock and roll thing.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.420
It was just really basic.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.690
But to me, wow, it was just so
glamorous and evocative.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.020
I mean, it was all about
finding a voice.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.170
I mean, I guess I've done enough
blogging, and I've done

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.700
enough interviews to know that
when I'm in the mood, I can

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.220
tell a story well.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.420
It's just finding the way to
put that down to actually

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.180
record that in the computer.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.580
And once we got the right
attitude, the right tempo, it

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.540
all started to flow.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.400
ADAM STEWART: What do you think
might be the biggest

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.980
surprise for someone who
picks up the book?

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.560
JOHN TAYLOR: I think there's a
number of surprises in there.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.530
I mean, it's not just
about fame.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.230
It's not just about,
well, we did this,

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.020
and then we did that.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.920
It's a very personal,
very human account.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.710
Frank is a word that is used
to describe it a lot.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:57.320
I mean, it's a coming of age
book, in a way, and I was able

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.460
to disconnect from the character
quite a bit, really,

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.520
because just watching this
little kid, an only child,

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.410
mother raging Catholicholic took
him to church every day

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.180
of his life for the first
five years, and

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.420
how he got into music.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.810
How music just took
over for him.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:23.630
But I mean, I didn't have the
kind of parents that made me

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.380
take piano lessons.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.460
My parents were completely
clueless when it came to

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.890
school and education.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.305
I had to find it for myself.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:41.160
And it was at that time, 12,
13, 14, where the desire to

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.630
remake my identity was so
strong, and music at that time

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.310
in the UK--

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.550
we were talking about
this earlier--

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.840
I mean, there were a lot
of very, very strong

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.580
personalities.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.870
David Bowie, Freddie Mercury,
Rod Stewart, Bryan Ferry.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.530
I mean, these guys
coming out--

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.740
I mean, I'm not going to say was
a golden age, but it was a

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.640
very strong age in terms
of personalities.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.280
And for a kid that was just
not really connecting in

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.365
school, was an only child, I
just started connecting with

00:08:13.365 --> 00:08:14.480
these guys in a big way.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.870
And even though I couldn't play
an instrument, I just

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.720
wanted to be in that club.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.630
And so by the time I was
17, I knew that's

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.550
what I wanted to do.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.330
ADAM STEWART: So your career is
really amazing, and I think

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.630
when people look at a career
like yours, they think--

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.840
there's probably three things.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.630
Is it luck, is it timing,
or is it hard work?

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:33.840
JOHN TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.919
Well, I think also, part of the
book is demystifying that.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:41.270
I mean, a lot of collaborators,
people come and

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.020
they work with us, and they're
looking for the magic.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.796
They're looking for how did you
guys-- what do you guys--

00:08:46.796 --> 00:08:47.210
what's the thing?

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.530
And it's like, you
just show up.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.220
You just show up at the
studio and start

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.470
hitting chords around.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.750
I mean, I was humbled, actually,
looking at the--

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.950
I really got into the first few
years of the '80s, because

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.870
apart from the fact it was a
fantastic time to be in Duran

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.840
Duran, I think it was a really
great time for pop culture,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.900
and a very under-appreciated
time in the culture.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.760
I mean, maybe we'll start
looking at it more as the

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.960
beginning of techno.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.260
It was the period when fashion,
photography, video,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.940
things were starting to connect
in music in a more

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.510
formal way.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.140
It was a renaissance
time, in a way.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.120
And I really wanted
to look at that.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.500
And I don't write about
it in any great

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.620
depth, but it's there.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.300
I was humbled by the amount
of work we did, man.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:37.790
Oh my god.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.490
I mean, the funniest thing,
actually-- it was 1982, which

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:47.400
was the year of "Rio." And we
were in the studio in London,

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.590
I think, for about two,
maybe three months

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.830
recording that album.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:56.050
And we came out of Air Studios
and flew straight to Sri

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.800
Lanka, where we did videos for
"Hungry Like The Wolf," and

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.800
"Save A Prayer."

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.870
We went from there to Australia
for our first time,

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.470
and Australia was like
Beatlemania.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.660
And then we went from there
to Japan, which was like

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.680
Beatlemania but with
Japanese accents.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.220
Madness!

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:09.495
Madness!

00:10:09.495 --> 00:10:12.310
And then we came to America, and
America, obviously, is a

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.610
very hard territory to break.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:15.660
Very, very hard.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.450
And that summer, we really
went for it.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.800
We crisscrossed the country
several times.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.620
Fortunately, at the time, our
record company, Capital, was

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.740
being controlled by
the London office.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.120
There are no American record
labels like that anymore.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.980
So the London office was kicking
their asses every day

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.230
saying, you've got to break
this band, or we're

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.020
going to lose them.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.070
So Capital were like, OK,
OK, what do we do?

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.930
And it was a massive campaign.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.110
MTV started happening
at the same time.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:48.490
We were seeing our ticket sales
and album sales were

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:52.250
coming up in states that
MTV was showing in.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.150
We went back to Europe.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:59.990
We did a victory lap of Britain
at the end of the

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:05.480
year, like November, House
Records in our home city.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.870
And then I'm looking, and I've
got all this out, and I've got

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.570
the itineraries from back there,
and I see that we're at

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:14.952
the Holiday Inn in Birmingham
on December 1, 1982, and I'm

00:11:14.952 --> 00:11:17.390
thinking, OK, so what
happens then.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.710
After all of this, oh, I go
back to my parents' house,

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.890
because I'm still living
with my parents.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.152
That's how crazy--

00:11:24.152 --> 00:11:26.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.480
JOHN TAYLOR: But it happened
so fucking fast.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.740
And there's nothing like
a father to bring you

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.390
back down to earth.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.730
I think I'd been there two days
before he was, turn that

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.626
bloody music down!

00:11:40.626 --> 00:11:43.150
You're not on bloody tour now!

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.360
And I really enjoyed--

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.760
and that was a discovery
for me.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.080
I wouldn't have remembered
that if I

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.520
hadn't written a book.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.150
And that was like, wow.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.040
ADAM STEWART: That's amazing.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.690
Why don't we, if you would,
want to take us through a

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:58.200
passage of the book?

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:58.880
JOHN TAYLOR: Sure.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.580
Yeah.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.670
I'm a little bit concerned that
some of the readings are

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.280
a bit long, so bear with me.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.100
I'm going to read a little from
the first chapter, which

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.016
is called Hey Jude.

00:12:10.016 --> 00:12:14.490
I'm four years old, confident
and shy, hair blonder than it

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.780
would be in my teen years, in
shorts and sandals, a young

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.260
prince of the neighborhood.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.510
The south Birmingham suburb
of Hollywood.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.700
How perfect.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.000
10 o'clock in the morning on any
given weekday in 1964, and

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.040
I've stepped down off the porch
[? in wait, ?] kicking

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.880
at the grooved concrete
driveway, watching as mom

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.830
pulls the front door closed,
locks it up, and puts the key

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:35.880
in her handbag.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.430
She puts the handbag in the
shopping bag, and off we go,

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.030
left off the drive and up the
hill that is the street on

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.880
which we live, Simon Road.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.640
Our house is number 34, one up
from where the road ends.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.050
We walk together along the
pavement, counting down.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:52.500
32, 30, 28.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.600
On the left side of the street
are all the even-numbered,

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.910
semi-detached houses, single
buildings designed to function

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.500
as two separate homes, houses
twinned with number 36.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.040
Across the street, the odd
numbered houses are detached,

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.600
each building a single dwelling,
all much larger than

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.050
ours, and so are the back
gardens, which are long and

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.930
tree-filled, and bordered at
the bottom by a stream.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:15.880
The driveways are slicker,
too, with space for

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.870
more than one car.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.440
I hold mom's hand, remembering
the Beatles song that is so

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.500
often on the radio as the
incline gets steeper.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.570
We reach the crest of the hill
where Simon Road meets Douglas

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.180
Road and turn right.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.840
We pass a 12 foot high holly
bush, the only evidence I've

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.960
found that suggests where
the estate got its name.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.460
We march on, crossing Hollywood
Lane in front of Gay

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.330
Hill Golf Club, an establishment
that will assume

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.970
mythical proportions in my
imagination as a venue for

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.740
wife-swapping parties, not that
anyone in my family ever

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.950
set foot in the place,
and there was no

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.780
truth in the rumor.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.270
Cars flash by at 20 or even
30 miles an hour.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.910
We make it to Highter's Heath
Lane, another main artery of

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.000
the neighborhood, which must
be taken if you're visiting

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.170
the old Birmingham of nans and
aunts and uncles, recreational

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.820
parks and bowling greens.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.750
It gets traversed a lot by the
Taylor family at weekends.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.930
It must also be used by mother
and son if we are to reach our

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:14.070
destination today, Saint
Jude's Parish Church.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.750
I would go to many beautiful,
awe- inspiring churches when I

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.400
was older--

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.570
St. Patrick's on Fifth Avenue,
St. Peter's in Rome, Notre

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:24.070
Dame de Paris, but St. Jude's on
Glenavon Road was the most

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.260
pragmatic people's church
anywhere in the First World.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.340
Built in the post World War II
years, St. Jude's was intended

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.460
as a temporary structure,
not meant to last

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.770
more than a few years.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:36.620
It's coming up on 20 now, and
yawning with cold air and

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.210
aching joints, single story with
windows every six feet

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.710
along its length, and a roof
of corrugated iron.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.430
Its crude purity enhanced the
idea the St. Jude's faithful

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.790
had about being the
chosen ones.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.320
Why else would we gather
together in this cold, ugly

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.380
place, unless it was an absolute
certainty that we

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.490
would benefit from it?

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.840
A communal sense of readiness
sends us through the small

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.110
lobby, where on raw wooden
tables, literature is offered,

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.960
some for sale, some for free--

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.110
textbooks, Bibles, songbooks,
and other merchandise,

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.010
including rosaries, crucifixes,
and pendants of

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.870
St. Jude's, the patron saint
of hopeless cases.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.370
On into the nave, where there
is a smell of sweat and

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:18.890
yesterday's incense.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.720
It's usually cool in here,
sometimes warm, but never hot.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.420
A tall, red-headed man plays a
rickety looking organ, quietly

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.820
piping sweet music that
is barely there.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.240
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.930
would call it ambient.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.100
Candles burn lazily
with a holy scent.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.110
On the strike of 11:00,
the service begins.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.970
The priest enters smartly,
followed by a pair of young

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.740
men in white robes, the priest's
team, his posse, one

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.930
of whom swings a silver chalice
from which more

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.410
incense issues.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.930
The air in the church needs a
good cleansing before the good

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:49.650
father can breathe it.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.570
He wears elaborate clothing, a
robe of green and gold silk

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.130
with a red cross on his back.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.620
Beneath the cloak, ankle length
turned up trousers

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.230
reveal the black socks and
black robes of any other

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.910
working man.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.390
The music surges in volume,
and we all stand.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:06.180
The red haired man leads us in
a song we know well, The Lord

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.160
is My Shepherd.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.450
I open the hymnal to
read the words.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.660
I like this one, but
like Mom, I'm too

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.360
embarrassed to sing out loud.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.280
I wish I could.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.330
I just don't.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.750
But I like the feeling of
togetherness that comes from

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.750
everyone in the room singing
the same words.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.040
Once the song is over, the
priest walks to the dais.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.010
He glances down at his Bible,
opens his hands wide, and

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.420
says, let us pray.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.650
ADAM STEWART: John, you met
Nick, if the chronology I have

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:36.010
is correct, in 1971, so seven
or so years after

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.420
this picture is taken.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.850
Music is changing at that time,
and as you guys are

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:46.400
growing up, Bowie, Roxy Music,
and that kind of glam stuff

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.530
starts happening.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.340
At '76, there's this turn, it's
the Sex Pistols, so you

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.320
get this kind of real
change in music.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.690
'78, Duran Duran comes about.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:58.150
And you and Nick clearly
have some aspirations.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.130
Some pretty ambitious goals.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:04.020
At what point in the journey
were you like, we've arrived.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.069
This is it.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:08.859
This is what we've always
set out to do?

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:12.339
JOHN TAYLOR: Well,
we were lucky.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:16.750
We connected with a nightclub
in our home city of

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.369
Birmingham, and the guys that
ran the club-- that owned it,

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:21.530
actually-- were two brothers.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:25.579
And it's all about team
building, isn't it, at the end

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:26.540
of the day?

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.420
It just is.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.890
I don't believe in solo acts.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.840
It's all about building
a team.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.210
And Nick and I, we were
the founders.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:40.730
And then we formed Duran, and
we had a couple of guys come

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.040
in, and then they left.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.720
Something that I talk about in
the book, how galvanizing it

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.700
is when people leave, and they
go on to something else, and

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.950
you go, you fuckers!

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.730
We're going to show them.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.940
We were written off quite a
few times before we had a

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.530
record deal.

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.670
And then somebody introduced
us to Roger Taylor, who was

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:06.320
the drummer, and that was when
I started playing bass.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.450
And then it took
us a long time.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:12.010
I mean, the funny thing about
Duran Duran is, like, I

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.815
remember Boy George, he
was a Brummie too.

00:18:14.815 --> 00:18:16.990
He spent a lot of time
in Birmingham.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:22.020
And I remember talking to him at
a wine bar in 1979, and him

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.600
saying to me, what's the
name of your band?

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.830
And we say, Duran Duran.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:25.690
He goes, Duran Duran?

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.347
Are they still going?

00:18:27.347 --> 00:18:32.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.960
We bounced around our
town for a while.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.130
We went through different--

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:37.080
finding different--

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.280
then you'd find the right--

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.690
and then the guitar player--

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:40.920
and then the guitar player
would leave.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.200
But we made the acquaintance
of these two brothers who

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.960
became our patrons, and they
started putting a little bit

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.670
of money into us, and they gave
us a place to rehearse.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.470
And the group identity
kind of formed

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.900
itself in this nightclub.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:02.470
And then Andy came down
from Newcastle.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.945
He answered an ad in one of the
national music papers, and

00:19:05.945 --> 00:19:07.650
he came down.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:11.940
He was cut from a different
cloth than we were.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.190
He was hardcore.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.450
And he knew his music,
you know?

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:19.690
And then within about six weeks
of him coming-- and I

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:20.850
mean, he came down.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:25.030
He moved from Newcastle 300
miles to Birmingham, and we

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.890
didn't even have a singer.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:32.100
That's how confident the three
of us and the managers were,

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.090
that by the time Simon came on
board, we were like, great,

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.930
OK, sign here.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.855
We're off.

00:19:37.855 --> 00:19:40.140
And the day that Simon came
in, he walked up to the

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:40.690
microphone.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:41.670
We were playing.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.175
We'd already been working
on the architecture

00:19:43.175 --> 00:19:44.150
of the sound, right?

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.710
So we knew what the band's sound
was going to be like,

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.400
but we needed a voice.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.930
Simon came in, he got a blue
exercise book that he used to

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.530
make notes, like ideas for
poems and whatnot.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.100
I love "Nashville,"
by the way.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.400
I just want to put
that out there.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.380
I think "Nashville" is the best
new show, and I love the

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:06.120
way they address songwriting
and collaboration.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.270
It's smart.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:08.580
It's really well done.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.270
And Simon had a book with some
words in it, and guys like

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.710
that in the music business
are priceless.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:15.990
There are so few of them.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.680
It's so easy to make a beat, but
somebody comes in with a

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.070
decent bit of poetry on
paper, sign them.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.200
Simon walked over to
the microphone and

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.110
just, well, try this.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.100
Blah blah blah.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.140
And then that was it.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.250
We were off.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:29.980
And we said, right.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.360
We've got a gig in four weeks.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.091
Let's write some songs.

00:20:36.091 --> 00:20:39.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.170
ADAM STEWART: I mean, Duran
Duran certainly cut a path

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.530
that was different than really,
just about anyone else

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.930
at that time, because you
brought together different

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.200
factors and things that were
happening in music.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.970
But I'm curious,
because disco.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:52.980
And you talk a little bit about
Chic in the book and

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.800
everything like that, because
there's an aspect of new wave,

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.240
and an aspect of disco, and
especially in the early Duran

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.540
Duran music.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.670
Can you talk a little bit about
how your sound came

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.250
together as a band?

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:07.520
JOHN TAYLOR: Well, I remember
being in a pub one lunchtime

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.090
in Birmingham.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:11.530
I went to art college
for a year, and I

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.300
was on my lunch break.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:17.950
And I remember the jukebox in
the pub, and "Anarchy In the

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:18.750
UK" came on.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:19.340
Sex Pistols.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.360
That was an anthem for me--

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.750
really massive record.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.160
And then Chic came
on after that.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.460
"Everybody Dance,"
I think it was.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.840
And I remember sitting
there thinking, I

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.610
love both these songs.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:36.000
It was like being Republican and
Democrat at the same time.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.380
JOHN TAYLOR: It's like
it was either or.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.270
You can't be both.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.240
And I thought, but I am both.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.970
I love both of those musics.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:49.110
And I thought, god, if we could
just somehow combine

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.190
those two things.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.460
And the key for me was to become
a bass player, because

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.130
the thing about Chic's music
and disco music that really

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.390
caught my attention
was the bass.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.320
And the music that I've been
listening to-- the bands that

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:06.280
I've been following in my late
teens were bands like The

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.860
Clash that were really
guitar-driven.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.050
The bass players just followed
the changes.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.390
Nobody really listened
to the bass.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.840
It was just part of the sound.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.870
But in disco, the bass almost
felt like it was the lead

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:20.300
instrument.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.980
And so I started playing with
Rog, and fortunately, Roger

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.020
was also a punk.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.090
But he was kind of like, yeah.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.500
Like "Another One Bites
the Dust," you know?

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.750
[HUMMING "ANOTHER ONE
BITES THE DUST"]

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.510
You're doing it together,
and it's so much fun.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.420
And then you bring in the big
guitars over the top of that,

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.910
and then maybe you've
got something.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:42.360
And that's kind of like
what we were.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.910
And then at the same time, these
were the days of the

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.750
first affordable synthesizers.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.235
I think we got one of the first
Wasp synthesizers which

00:22:53.235 --> 00:22:54.060
came into Birmingham.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.430
It was about this big,
it was plastic.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.010
It cost 199 pounds.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.210
And you had to hold it down.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:04.700
[IMITATING SYNTHESIZER SOUNDS]

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.850
And you put a beat to that,
and you've got techno.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.100
ADAM STEWART: Cool.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:13.360
In the book, you talk a lot
about celebrity, and your

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.490
celebrity, and what
you went through.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:17.440
Talk to us a little bit.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.150
What was the best and the
worst part of celebrity?

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:26.440
JOHN TAYLOR: I think
the best part--

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.530
I'm reaping the rewards of it
now, really, because there are

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:33.520
just so many people out
there that care.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.610
When you've been a part of--

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:39.950
I mean, I know how much
Bowie means to me.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:43.890
There's a handful of guys that
helped me become, that helped

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.150
me through that really
difficult time

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.460
from 13 to 15, 16.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:53.800
And I love him like I love
my dad or my wife.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.440
And we had the privilege to
be a part of that for a

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.710
generation of teens.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.520
So there are a lot of
people out there

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.130
that we're very important.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.380
We play an important part
in their lives.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.540
And it's very useful when you
want to get a table in a

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:09.790
restaurant.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.480
No, but that's a great thing.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.040
The worst thing--

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:16.520
I don't know.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:25.340
I mean, I feel like you're
suspended in adolescence,

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:29.080
which is fun, but
it's also bad.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.110
Because I think I got to the age
of 30, and just the sight

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.750
of a bill coming through
my post freaked me out.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.750
I just didn't know what to
do with a telephone bill.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.210
You just don't know.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.350
I guess a lot of athletes have
that, too, because you're just

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.120
treated like babies.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.930
It's just about, no, you just
concentrate on playing,

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.150
writing songs, and performing,
and looking

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:51.780
good for the video.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.510
That's all you've got to do.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.110
We'll take care of
everything else.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:57.840
But there's certain things that
as adults, we need to be

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.100
able to take care of.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.940
And when the boat slows down,
the train slows down, and then

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.070
you're in a position where
you go, you know what?

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.880
Maybe I need to start taking
care of that, and that, and

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.460
doing that.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.710
But it's kind of overwhelming.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.810
So maybe that's the worst.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:15.840
ADAM STEWART: Cool.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.085
I think it's a good point for us
to maybe hear a little bit

00:25:18.085 --> 00:25:19.810
more from the book.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.540
JOHN TAYLOR: OK.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.080
This is a shorter one, honest.

we were in Boystown

00:25:38.346 --> 00:25:40.690
JOHN TAYLOR: Chapter
31, Legal Age.

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:44.500
One thing I discovered on tour
in 1981 was that girls, in all

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.860
languages, like taking
drugs with me.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.370
Even though I had a girlfriend
back home, my horror of lonely

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.920
hotel rooms meant I would go
to any lengths to avoid

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.590
sleeping in them alone.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.920
Coke, I was beginning to
realize, was an effective

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.980
insurance policy against
that eventuality.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.500
I'd been a nerd at school.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.960
I wasn't a jock or an
intellectual, and I'd never

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.500
had a regular girlfriend
as a teenager.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.040
Now I only had to wink in a
girl's direction in a hotel

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.180
lobby, backstage, or at a record
company party, and I

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.590
have company until
the morning.

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:17.030
So what's the problem,
you might ask?

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.050
Well, the trouble is-- and I
didn't figure this out until I

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:20.080
was almost 40--

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.320
that there's something about an
intimate encounter of that

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.430
nature with someone you
barely know that

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.250
jars against the spirit.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.410
You want it, but it doesn't
feel quite right.

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:30.870
And when you start doing it
night after night, week in,

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:33.790
week out, your ideas about
love and sex begin to get

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.270
somewhat distorted.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.650
And jumping into bed like porn
star Johnny is not as easy as

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.540
you might imagine, especially
with someone whose first name

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.250
you're not even sure of.

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:45.840
You feel awkward, or
at least I do.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.200
Maybe it was some residue
of Catholic guilt.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.930
Plain old common decency?

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:52.360
Hadn't mother taught me
something about this?

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.090
The drugs and the alcohol served
to take away all those

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:58.270
doubts, plus any inhibitions
or insecurities I

00:26:58.270 --> 00:26:59.780
or she might have.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.410
I didn't want to be lonely,
and the drugs

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.680
ensured I never was.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.620
I'm a pinup on thousands of
bedroom walls, but the fear of

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.240
loneliness is turning
me into a cokehead.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.950
Of absolute necessity
for any touring

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:13.320
musician is the itinerary.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.740
It usually comes as a gift from
the tour manager on the

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.170
last day of rehearsal.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:19.230
Depending on the length of the
tour about to be undertaken,

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.510
it could cover any length
of time between one

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:22.950
week and two months.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.520
Page one lists the principals--

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.030
the inner circle--

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.670
the crew who are going to get
the show around the world.

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:31.540
All the numbers to call if in
trouble are listed there-- the

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.130
management, the agencies,
the travel

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.390
agents, the local promoters.

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.570
Then follows a page by page
account of the destinations.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.620
October 3rd, Chicago.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.430
Band hotel, Ambassador East.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:44.250
Crew hotel, Crown Hyatt.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.790
Venue, Park West, and
so on and so on.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.110
I'd not noticed right away that
in the left hand corner

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.370
of each page of the US

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:51.930
itinerary, there was a number--

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.080
usually 18, 20, or 21.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.140
It was months before I was
let in on the secret.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.240
The numbers referred to the
legal age for sexual

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.170
intercourse in that
particular state.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.460
The other necessity for the
touring musician is the day

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.750
sheet, usually slipped under the
hotel room door while the

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:10.310
occupant is still asleep.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:13.330
Regardless of the degree of
befuddlement, the day sheet

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.670
information was always
quite clear.

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:21.790
Today is October 3rd, it is
Friday, you are in Chicago.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.830
Today is a show day.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.620
Sound check is at 4:00 PM.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.128
You almost expected it to
say, your name is John.

00:28:29.128 --> 00:28:31.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.060
ADAM STEWART: That's awesome.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.550
So I think at that point in
the book, too, you start

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.130
talking a little bit more, and
it comes up even in that

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:40.580
chapter, this kind of notion
of loneliness.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.760
And it's now kind of being
equated to drugs and alcohol

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.940
becoming a larger part
of your life.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.930
Was that a cause and effect?

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:51.930
Was it the loneliness and then
what you were kind of feeling

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.070
on the road that led
you to that point?

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.220
JOHN TAYLOR: Well, I'm still
figuring it out, really.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.780
I mean, getting to write a book
like this, you really do

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.645
analyze your behavior,
and the whys.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.920
I was the guy in the band
that just didn't

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.160
have the off switch.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.530
I mean, it could be 5:00 in the
morning and everybody else

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.760
was turning in, because
we had a travel day or

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.420
whatever the next--

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.600
I'd just be getting started.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.560
And you become the guy.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.370
We've all got one
in our family.

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:21.310
Every family's got one.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:23.690
Uncle Jake just doesn't
know how to put

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:25.070
the plug in the jug.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.490
Just doesn't know
when to stop.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:31.360
And when you are that guy, you
start getting a lot of shame.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.440
Over the years, you're
the hung over one.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:39.396
You're the butt of the joke.

00:29:39.396 --> 00:29:42.740
And I'm not sure what that
loneliness was about.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.280
I think it was a combination
of things.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.530
I mean, fame is very--

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.640
you've got a lot of
people around

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:55.170
you giving you attention.

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.150
It's very addictive.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:01.610
I mean, it's very hard
to turn off from.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:07.210
And I found it to be quite an
insecure world, actually.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:12.240
We had a couple of good years,
but then paranoia set in, and

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.210
the drugs didn't help that.

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:16.090
Hangover wont'--

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.060
when you're late for the
meeting, what's the first

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:19.940
thing you think?

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.510
What have they been
saying about me?

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.170
ADAM STEWART: There's some
pretty harrowing stories in

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:24.730
the book, you know?

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.230
All nighters, and--

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.920
JOHN TAYLOR: What's that?

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.720
ADAM STEWART: All nighters,
and some wild times.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.300
When did you realize that
you had a problem?

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.980
When did you decide to do
something about it?

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:39.160
JOHN TAYLOR: Well, I
think any of us--

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.370
when do you realize
you're an addict?

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:43.490
When do you realize you're
addicted to shopping or

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:44.220
cigarettes?

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.300
When you try to stop.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.670
And often, we put that off.

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.860
We say, yeah, yeah, I could
stop if I wanted to.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.135
I just choose not to.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:00.930
So then my late 20s, I tried
to stop spending.

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:03.310
I tried to stop shagging.

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.220
I tried to stop getting high.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.470
All of these things.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:07.490
And I've got no program.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:09.560
I've got no idea how to do it.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.800
And it's really hard.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.260
I found that I guess
I was living in LA.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.210
I've moved to LA.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:20.260
I'd had a child.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.925
I'm 30, I think, now.

00:31:22.925 --> 00:31:24.320
In my early 30s.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:30.190
And by that point, I'd gotten
kind of unhappy, and I felt

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:32.200
that I'd blown it.

00:31:34.832 --> 00:31:36.840
The early '80s were great
for the band.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.400
The second half of the '80s,
we were hanging on.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.480
Hanging on like the fucking
zeitgeist was over there, and

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:46.510
it was like, maybe you guys
should just call it a day.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:49.590
We were like, we were just
getting started.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.980
MTV didn't want to play us.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.300
Nobody wanted to play
us on the radio.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.700
And that's when you really
have to dig in.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.040
I mean, that's when people start
saying to you, well, you

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.900
don't really need to work
anymore, do you?

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.910
It's like, what are you
supposed to do?

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:06.440
I never get that argument,
because I love my job.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.800
So I'm not looking to take
an early retirement.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.210
But we hung in there.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:14.990
But yeah, I wanted
to talk about it.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:16.370
I talk about getting sober in
the book, because that was

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.500
profound for me.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.050
And I was really lucky.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.070
I just happened to meet the
right person at the right time

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.710
who directed me to rehab.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.592
And I thought, rehab?

00:32:26.592 --> 00:32:28.640
I'm not one of those
guys, am I?

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.920
But it really worked for me.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.220
And I wanted that to
be in the book.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:41.020
I wanted to find a way to write
about that, because it

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:45.660
enabled me to have a life, on
top of all the fun and games

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.340
of the '80s.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.600
ADAM STEWART: Hard to
look back at that?

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.350
Hard to tell that story?

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.890
JOHN TAYLOR: Which bit?

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:53.770
ADAM STEWART: Just the kind of
darker times, and that aspect

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.450
of it, as you're kind of going
back and looking over your

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.230
life and seeing all of these
different things that have

00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:59.200
happened and occurred.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.550
JOHN TAYLOR: Yeah, I knew that
there was going to be a

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.650
recovery element to the book.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.100
I knew that--

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.810
that if I was going to do a
book, I was going to have to

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:14.880
find a way of describing the
experience that I had with

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.890
rehab, and the makeover that
I got as a result of it.

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:21.020
But then what that meant was,
I was going to have to show

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.060
the reader why I needed
to go to rehab.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.800
So there was going to have to be
a handful of scenes, and I

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.120
was going to have to take the
reader down and get a sense of

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.200
what it was like.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.850
But I feel like I found
a way of doing it.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:40.710
I mean, spiritual journey is
one of the undercurrents in

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.970
the book, because it starts out,
like, the first reading

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.130
that I did, my mother was
very religious, but I

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:46.510
never bought into that.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:51.450
I think at the peak of my real
waste out time was the mid

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:54.640
'80s, and I had an apartment on
the Upper West Side of New

00:33:54.640 --> 00:34:00.560
York and I used to get so high
in that place, and a lot of

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.720
all nighters.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.275
And there's a scene that
I always remembered.

00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:08.989
There was a storm, and I was
really, really messed up,

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:10.659
Quentin Tarantino style.

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:12.110
And what did I do
at 9 o'clock?

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:15.310
I want to call my parish priest,
because I've decided

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:17.639
that I need to write
a [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:19.600
for Saint Jude's.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.100
It wasn't calling hookers.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.409
I'm calling my fucking parish
priest, who I haven't spoken

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:24.615
to in three years.

00:34:24.615 --> 00:34:26.270
And I thought that was
really kind of

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.290
interesting that I did that.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.010
And if I could write that
scene, I thought

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:32.409
that would be different.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:37.150
It might give a key to who
I was, rather than--

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:40.020
I never called in hookers,
actually, I'm happy to say.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.440
That never appealed to me.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:45.870
But I was looking for some kind
of spiritual salvation,

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.560
even after three years--

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.400
three or four years of using.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.480
ADAM STEWART: It's kind of
interesting to hear that

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.150
connectedness to home.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:56.540
We did a Google Hangout before,
and for as much as the

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.620
varied questions, a lot of
people came back to one of the

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.370
themes that really comes out in
the book, which is really

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:04.300
your connectedness to your
parents, and that type of

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.840
inspiration, and how your
parents-- both of them have

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.900
passed away, but what that meant
to you in your life.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.700
So it's really interesting to
hear that at the time, where

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:12.840
everything is kind of going
crazy in your life in New

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.190
York, you're still thinking
about back home.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.320
And I think that was one of
those things, again, that I

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.970
just feel connected with a
lot of different people.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.580
30 years now, plus, I think,
into Duran Duran.

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:26.590
What's it like for you today?

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:27.150
JOHN TAYLOR: It's good.

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.700
It's good.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:31.700
I'm glad I got to write the
book over the last year,

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.650
because we've had a
really good time.

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:37.850
I mean, we did our
last album as a

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:39.880
digital download on iTunes.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:44.730
It felt like we finally got
right with new media.

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:46.910
For a couple of years, we
just couldn't relate.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:49.980
We couldn't find our place
in the industry.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.690
And this last album,
we were lucky.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:53.850
Mark Ronson stepped in
and produced, and

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:55.310
he gave us a sense--

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:57.640
just having in the room,
you feel hipper.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.730
I mean, that was a good thing.

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:04.360
And then we started getting into
social media, networking,

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:13.170
promoting the album, and finding
what that did for the

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:16.520
connectivity of our fans
was just amazing.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.340
And I felt it.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:28.790
I mean, the album came out just
before Christmas of 2010,

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:32.280
at the end of not last year,
the year before.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.500
And we started getting into
social networking.

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.480
And the first show that we did
was in London about three

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.480
months later.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.080
And the feeling in the room
was so charged up.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.240
It was completely different to
anything that we'd done in the

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.710
previous five years.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:49.600
And I put that down to
social networking.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.610
And people were showing up, and
they were going, hey, how

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:52.480
are you doing?

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.540
And they'd connected, because
when the band goes on social

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:57.670
networking, people start signing
on, following us on

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.690
Twitter, getting onto Facebook,
and they start

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:00.220
connecting.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:04.410
And suddenly, it's like
Duran fans reunited.

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:08.010
It's like one of those
friend networks.

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:12.690
And it's generated a lot of
energy around the band.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:15.720
And I don't even worry about
getting in the charts anymore.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.790
It's not about that.

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:19.320
It's just, like, we've got
this really strong family

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.830
that's kind of re-committed
itself to each other, and

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:26.150
actually is kind of
growing again.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:28.320
So it's been an interesting
couple of years.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.550
And we're going to get back and
do another album with Mark

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:33.350
in the spring.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:34.797
And we're really enjoying
our music.

00:37:34.797 --> 00:37:36.140
ADAM STEWART: Terriffic.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.504
Any questions?

00:37:38.504 --> 00:37:40.300
AUDIENCE: Who are your current
musical inspirations?

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:46.385
JOHN TAYLOR: I was playing
Led Zeppelin yesterday.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:52.005
They're never not going
to be relevant.

00:37:52.005 --> 00:37:55.600
I've been listening to a lot of
folk rock lately, actually.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.530
Bert Jansch, John Renbourn.

00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:01.730
Sort of old English
guitar music.

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:03.790
But I like modern music.

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:08.310
I like to hear great
modern music.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:09.270
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:13.600
is a DJ that I really like,
and he's put an album out.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.430
It's like a curated DJ set
that's kind of like my album

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:20.120
of choice at the moment.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.880
You just have to look.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.880
Like last year, I was on the
road in England, and I was

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.255
listening to Louis Armstrong.

00:38:28.255 --> 00:38:29.870
I thought, this is what
it's come to.

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:31.060
I'm listening to music
from the '30s.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.470
That's how crap contemporary
music is.

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:37.890
And I just chanced upon this
record store called Piccadilly

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:39.530
Records in Manchester.

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:45.730
I went in-- it was December, and
they'd curated the year's

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:47.940
best music, and they printed
up a pamphlet.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.470
You know, Amoeba do it, Rough
Trade do it in London.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.590
And they printed up a pamphlet,
and all the staff

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:56.940
from the record store got to
write a little blurb about

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.820
what they thought was
the important best

00:38:58.820 --> 00:38:59.920
music of the year.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.710
And I'm opening up this
pamphlet, and almost every one

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:06.090
of them is saying, wow, the
best music of 2011--

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:07.030
I don't know where to begin.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:09.520
It was such a fantastic
year for music.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.860
And I'm thinking, fantastic
year for music?

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:17.120
And I realized how out
of touch I was.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:21.340
And I bought half
a dozen albums.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.145
Their top six albums
of the year.

00:39:24.145 --> 00:39:24.900
Every one of them--

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:29.550
Kurt Vile, Washed
Out, Metronomy.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:33.122
I mean, half a dozen bands that
I'd not heard of became

00:39:33.122 --> 00:39:35.190
my new favorite bands.

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:37.000
So I just have to
get out there.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.987
If I want to be into
contemporary music, I just

00:39:38.987 --> 00:39:40.448
have to make an effort.

00:39:40.448 --> 00:39:42.370
Thanks.

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.490
AUDIENCE: I sort of have a
follow-up question to that,

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:46.230
for music discovery.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:50.710
For your own music that you
listen to, do you find

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:55.200
yourself using digital services,
like you said, going

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:55.990
to record stores?

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:59.000
And if you are using digital
services, are you using

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.320
Spotify, or YouTube,
or iTunes?

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:02.810
JOHN TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:11.570
I mean, I'm on the hunt all the
time for music that I have

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:13.170
not heard before.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:14.300
It doesn't have to be new.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.000
It can be old.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.260
But something that's going
to inspire me--

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.900
that's going to keep
me interested.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:23.150
I find that as a bass player,
I can only listen to

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:26.240
contemporary music for so long,
because most of the

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.610
great bass work is older.

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:32.460
But I've always got a stack
of stuff that I'm

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.320
working my way through.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:39.470
I do use iTunes if there's
something that I need now.

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:42.830
But if it's something that's
important to me, I'm still

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:44.350
attached to the physical
product.

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:47.370
I've sort of gotten back into
vintage vinyl the way some

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.366
people get into vintage wines.

00:40:49.366 --> 00:40:53.920
I mean, the idea of taking
"Exile on Main St." out maybe

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:58.440
once every two years,
and putting it on--

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.570
that's like uncorking a vintage
bottle of wine.

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.880
I just want to do it, and then
I don't want to hear it for

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.530
another two years.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:10.670
Because music, like any art,
it doesn't have infinite

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:12.890
amounts of energy in it.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:14.030
You have to pace yourself
in your

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:17.540
appreciation of it, I find.

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:21.560
I also found-- we were talking
over lunch how the music, like

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:25.600
those three bands that I just
mentioned, I still am attached

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.900
to imagery.

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:32.740
Like, I still like packaging
that gives me something more,

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.020
something visual that I can
connect with the music that

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:36.530
I'm listening to.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:39.150
And I find that if it's music
that I'm going around telling

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:40.840
everybody, you've got
to get this band!

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.170
You've got to buy this!

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:47.140
Then I own that physical
product.

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:47.830
I've got to have it.

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:49.187
I've got to have something
that I can

00:41:49.187 --> 00:41:50.290
relate to on that level.

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:54.400
I haven't been able to
let go of that yet.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:54.773
Thanks.

00:41:54.773 --> 00:41:56.023
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.730
AUDIENCE: Can you fill us in on
how you guys came up with

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:03.085
the name Duran Duran?

00:42:03.085 --> 00:42:03.350
JOHN TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:11.590
It's from the film "Barbarella"
with Jane Fonda

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:14.600
as the sexy lady astronaut.

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:21.940
It was taken from a French
cartoon strip, and

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:22.900
the film is a really--

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.680
Roger Vadim.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:28.630
It's a really extraordinary
film.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:31.620
It's beautifully shot,
kind of kitsch.

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:36.670
And I think the opening line in
the film is Barbarella, you

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:40.700
must find Duran Duran from
the planet Earth.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.170
That's the opening
line in the film.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:46.160
And Duran Duran is this
criminal, this sort of

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:51.470
trans-universal criminal who has
stolen some machine that

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:53.505
is guaranteed to give
women pleasure.

00:42:53.505 --> 00:42:56.040
But that had nothing to do
with that choice of name.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.440
I mean, it was just a time
when everybody was naming

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.260
their band The something.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.150
The Damned, The Boys,
The Clash.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:07.370
So I liked the idea
that this had

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:10.530
something that seemed modern.

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:13.730
AUDIENCE: Do you have a favorite
Duran Duran album or

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:15.100
single or video?

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:18.730
JOHN TAYLOR: Well, I think "Rio"
is probably the album

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:21.570
that's just where we really
caught the wave.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:25.390
And I think every note
of it works.

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:26.100
Better than works.

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:29.610
Every note of it is great.

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:31.040
But I'm proud of a lot.

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.360
I'm proud of "Ordinary World"
as a song very much.

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:38.110
"Notorious."

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:40.860
"View To A Kill." You know,
that's interesting.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.460
Writing a Bond theme is like
designing a Rolls Royce.

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:47.380
It's really, really difficult,
because you've got so many

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.980
boxes you have to tick for
it to work for the Bond

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.930
franchise, but I think we did
a really good job with that.

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:55.310
And that was a difficult
song to write.

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:58.310
There was a lot of infighting
going on while we were doing

00:43:58.310 --> 00:43:59.380
it, but I'm really happy
with that one.

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.350
AUDIENCE: That was a
cool video, too.

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:01.760
JOHN TAYLOR: You think so?

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.188
See, I hate that video.

00:44:03.188 --> 00:44:05.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.060
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.950
JOHN TAYLOR: It's not
one of my favorites.

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:10.550
I'd rather watch the
titles from the

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:13.300
film unfurl, you know?

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:13.740
Thanks.

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.450
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:16.460
ADAM STEWART: Any
other questions?

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.130
Great.

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:19.600
Terrific.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.280
AUDIENCE: Have you tried playing
your song on "Rock

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:21.860
Band?"

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:22.794
JOHN TAYLOR: No!

00:44:22.794 --> 00:44:23.728
No!

00:44:23.728 --> 00:44:24.662
Never.

00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:26.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:27.330
AUDIENCE: And do you get--

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:29.400
because they change
the level, right.

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.970
Some songs are harder
than others.

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:32.790
Do you appreciate it if
your song is the easy

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:34.370
song or the hard song?

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:34.890
JOHN TAYLOR: No.

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:37.240
You could be talking to me
about brain surgery.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:41.520
I know nothing about
"Rock Band."

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.180
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering if you
can kind of paint a picture

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:48.080
for us of what it was like, the
first public performance

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:52.710
that you did as the Fab Five
lineup with Simon.

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:54.380
What was that night like?

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.360
Was it a disaster,
or was it magic--

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.770
everything came together?

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:02.150
JOHN TAYLOR: Well, again, we've
got to go back to the

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:04.850
club that we were based out of,
which was a club called

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:07.240
the Rum Runner in Birmingham.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.860
And it was a very culty
kind of scene.

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:13.500
It was a very fashion-oriented
scene.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:18.300
It was kind of post punk, and
it was this kind of glamor

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.590
that was coming back.

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:26.750
It was very ambiguous,
sexually.

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:29.440
There was a lot of gays
on the scene.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.720
People were just into
dressing up.

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.970
Everybody did something
with their hair--

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:35.040
dyed, coiffed, whatever.

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.120
And it was like a kind
of oasis, really.

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:39.940
A post-punk oasis.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.470
And the kind of music that was
popular there was this sort of

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:45.530
new electronic vibe,
like Simple Minds,

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:47.300
Japan, bands like that.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.050
And so we became the
house band there.

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:52.670
And we were rehearsing there.

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:55.440
And we all had jobs there.

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.400
We would all work behind the
bar, or work on the door.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.960
And in return for that, the
owners had given us this--

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:07.490
we had a rehearsal space
just off the main bar.

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:10.280
And on a Friday night, which was
a really hot night in the

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:13.560
club, we'd go up and turn on our
gear, and we'd invite some

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:17.190
of our friends up at midnight,
and we'd just play some songs

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:19.820
while everybody was dancing
down on the floor.

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:28.430
So when we had the final debut,
as I call it, which was

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:33.900
like version five of the band,
we were playing to friends.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.810
And everybody kind of knew us.

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:39.360
And there was a sense of, like,
OK, these are our guys.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.610
This is our band.

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:46.520
It's not like a foot
stomping kind of--

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.120
it's not like, a yeah
kind of scene.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.740
It was like, hmm, okay,
yeah, cool.

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:56.100
And yeah.

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.870
I mean, there are one or two
pictures from that particular

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:00.126
show in the book, in fact.

00:47:00.126 --> 00:47:02.340
I'll point them out
to you afterwards.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.840
Thanks.

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.410
ADAM STEWART: Any
other questions?

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:07.780
AUDIENCE: What was going on
the band when Arcadia--

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.550
kind of the branch out there?

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:10.950
Were you guys broken up, or--

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:12.050
JOHN TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:13.710
I mean, I feel, in a way,
we kind of had.

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:16.350
I mean, it's funny.

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:21.290
The pressure was so great in the
early, mid '80s, just to

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:23.120
write big hits.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.500
And we kind of--

00:47:27.832 --> 00:47:30.870
we weren't all agreeing
on the direction

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:33.500
the band should take.

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.520
So when we finished the third
album, Andy and I decided we

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.300
wanted to do a side project.

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:47.290
And so over time, we connected
with Robert Palmer, Tony

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:50.750
Thompson, Bernard Edwards, the
rhythm section from Chic, and

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:53.380
we made that album.

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.460
And then Simon, Nick, and Roger
kind of countered that

00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:59.540
with Arcadia.

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:02.470
I mean, it was difficult.

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:04.930
Nine months, maybe, where we
were very much-- there were

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:08.390
two camps, and that's
in the book.

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:14.360
Because we were kind of fighting
with the managers,

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:17.793
and it wasn't a happy
time, really.

00:48:17.793 --> 00:48:19.015
It was quite difficult.

00:48:19.015 --> 00:48:21.470
But it's in there.

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:23.800
Any more for any more?

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.510
ADAM STEWART: I think that's
a good question to segue,

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:26.800
actually, into the
last reading.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.050
JOHN TAYLOR: OK.

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:34.850
We got to play Coachella last
year, and it was a big one for

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:35.980
me, because I've got kids.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.690
I've got teenage kids that
have been telling me for

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:42.630
years, you guys got to
play Coachella, man.

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:47.380
It was like final validation
with the teenagers.

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.065
But it was magical.

00:48:48.065 --> 00:48:49.320
It was magical.

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:54.010
So I chose to end the
book on that night.

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:56.150
Behind the stage, to the
side of the ramp,

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:57.960
our band has gathered.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.050
We stepped off the pair of golf
carts that had brought us

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:02.930
the half mile from our dressing
room in battery

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:04.160
powered silence.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.530
The air is warm and
electric blue.

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:09.160
We acknowledge each other
without words, using nods and

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.760
smiles, back slaps, and other
gestures of encouragement.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.180
Instincts surge.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.500
Every other concern
falls away.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:20.890
Since 1981, we've released our
songs on vinyl, cassette tape,

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:24.530
CD, 8 track, digital audio tape,
mini disc, ringtones,

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:28.530
MP3, streaming, and download,
for purchase or rental.

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:31.330
I've long since learned to relax
and cease worrying about

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:34.160
how the music finds its
way to your ears.

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.240
Just play.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.610
Just write.

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:40.230
By the time we begin the "All
You Need Is Now" tour, which

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:43.000
tonight's performance at
Coachella is a part of,

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.900
excitement levels have
reached fever pitch.

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.520
We've come a long way to get to
this holy place, Coachella,

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:50.960
and a lot has changed in
the last 30 years.

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:55.800
Cell phones, computers, SUVs,
nose hair trimmers,

00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:00.140
supplements, Propecia, paperless
itineraries, in-room

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:04.150
humidifiers, steam rooms,
saunas, and gyms, pre-show

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:07.850
massage, Twitter, Spotify,
and Google.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:10.930
Touring with 3,000 songs in my
pocket and 30 books on an

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:14.680
iPad, therapy by Skype, great
coffee everywhere.

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.550
Another difference is out there,
where there are just as

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:19.690
many men as women in the
audience tonight.

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:23.260
At day's end, my job is to be
a catalyst for connectivity,

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.490
to help bring people closer
together, men and

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:27.040
women, girls and boys.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.720
That's what the music
has done for me.

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.140
What hasn't changed are the
notes that run up and down the

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:35.040
neck of the bass and the feeling
that hits you when one

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:38.180
note rubs against another in a
way that sets the hair up on

00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.890
the back of your neck, and the
sound of the crowd, and the

00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:43.370
feeling of adrenaline that
charges through my body when I

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:46.310
hear it holding that
four-stringed machine gun on

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:49.950
stage less than six feet
away from you.

00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:52.550
Simon is running through his
vocal warmups which we so

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:54.170
often rib him about.

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:57.190
Nick has a plastic cup in his
left hand, and is taking sips

00:50:57.190 --> 00:51:00.330
from it, now reaching his right
hand upward to flash a

00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:02.140
snapshot on his camera.

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:05.300
We all fiddle with our in-ear
monitors, trying the volume,

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.050
listening for interference.

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:08.820
A photographer from
"Spin Magazine"

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.220
wants to take a picture.

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.050
We assemble reluctantly,
everyone just wanting to get

00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:14.670
on with the show.

00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:17.440
It's an outdoor festival, so
tour manager Craig will not

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:20.500
get to give his usual cue to
take the house lights down.

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.640
Tonight, that is one of
God's jobs, and what a

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.540
job of it he is doing.

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.760
A glittering bauble of sunlight
fights to stay above

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.810
the horizon.

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:30.640
A full moon appears, a
late-coming VIP that takes a

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.640
seat above the lighting gantry
at 11 o'clock high.

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.140
Nature presents for us a better
light show than any

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.590
human could ever have created.

00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:40.050
We walk together up the ramp.

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:42.600
The stage is set, the
electronics are primed, the

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.820
audience ready.

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:46.930
Nick walks on first in
a black net snood

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:48.315
borrowed from Lady Gaga.

00:51:48.315 --> 00:51:50.191
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:50.191 --> 00:51:52.960
JOHN TAYLOR: He walks across the
stage and onto his riser,

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.540
puts down his camera, and
touches the Andromeda

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:58.600
synthesizer from which issues
forth a sample of the exact

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:01.940
sound he used to begin our first
single, "Planet Earth,"

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:05.070
written and recorded
over 30 years ago.

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:06.530
My heart is pounding.

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:09.360
There is no better time than
this, and I'm about to take

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.580
the stage, and the future
belongs to me.

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:14.390
This is what the moment feels
like as I walk out onto the

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:16.300
stage one more time.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.830
Roger's drums kick in, an eight
bar count, and I'm in

00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:22.330
with him, the galloping groove
that started it all for me.

00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:26.380
30,000 California kids, eyes and
teeth smiling, cameras and

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:30.240
cell phones popping, a million
tiny seductions all at once,

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.500
and the music never
sounded better.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.233
Thank you.

00:52:33.233 --> 00:52:34.712
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:34.712 --> 00:52:36.684
ADAM STEWART: John.

00:52:36.684 --> 00:52:40.135
On behalf of Google, thank you
very much for doing this.

00:52:40.135 --> 00:52:43.100
That was really terrific.

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:45.810
So John's going to be signing
books right outside.

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:47.060
Thanks, everybody.
