through these stories is that the degree

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800

really a relief I think because as you

written by a philosopher in South Africa
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.880

I think it's a specious argument and I

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700
I think it's a specious argument and I
 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.690
I think it's a specious argument and I
think it's artificially constructed but

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700

he basically argues that
because life is so full of suffering

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069
because life is so full of suffering
 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.979
because life is so full of suffering
even good lives are very much full of

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989
even good lives are very much full of
 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.089
even good lives are very much full of

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099
suffering that it's wrong to bring

suffering that it's wrong to bring
children into the world because the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720
children into the world because the
 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.690
children into the world because the
suffering outweighs the good even in

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700
suffering outweighs the good even in
 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.030
suffering outweighs the good even in
good lives and it's actually wrong it

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040
good lives and it's actually wrong it

would also be better not to exist for

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560
would also be better not to exist for

exactly the same reason and my sense in

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040
exactly the same reason and my sense in
 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.649
exactly the same reason and my sense in
reading the book is that he came to that

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659
reading the book is that he came to that
 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.089
reading the book is that he came to that
conclusion and then wrote the book to

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099
conclusion and then wrote the book to
 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.309
conclusion and then wrote the book to
justify it which is actually the reverse

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319
justify it which is actually the reverse
 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.080
justify it which is actually the reverse
of the way that you should write a book

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090
of the way that you should write a book
 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.759
of the way that you should write a book
what you should do when you're writing a

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769
what you should do when you're writing a
 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.229
what you should do when you're writing a
book is you should have a question and

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239
book is you should have a question and
 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.720
book is you should have a question and
you should it should be a real question

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730
you should it should be a real question
 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.860
you should it should be a real question
right it should be one you don't know

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870
right it should be one you don't know
 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.990
right it should be one you don't know
the answer to and then you should be

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000
the answer to and then you should be
 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.119
the answer to and then you should be
studying and writing like mad and

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129
studying and writing like mad and
 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.110
studying and writing like mad and
reading everything you can get your

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120
reading everything you can get your
 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.849
reading everything you can get your
hands on to see if you can actually

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859
hands on to see if you can actually
 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.920
hands on to see if you can actually
grapple with the problem and come to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930
grapple with the problem and come to
 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.690
grapple with the problem and come to
some solution and you should walk the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700
some solution and you should walk the
 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.059
some solution and you should walk the
reader as well through your process of

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069
reader as well through your process of
 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.190
reader as well through your process of
thinking so that they can come to the

thinking so that they can come to the
 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.140
thinking so that they can come to the

well not necessary to the same
 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.670
well not necessary to the same
conclusion but at least track what

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680
conclusion but at least track what
 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.740
conclusion but at least track what
you're doing and I don't think that's

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750
you're doing and I don't think that's
 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.970
you're doing and I don't think that's

backwards but then and so I was thinking
about it a lot because that's actually a

about it a lot because that's actually a
 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.580
about it a lot because that's actually a

better if it didn't exist at all and the
 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.680
better if it didn't exist at all and the
problem I've had with that there's a

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690
problem I've had with that there's a
 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.390
problem I've had with that there's a
variety of them but one of the problems

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400
variety of them but one of the problems
 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.099
variety of them but one of the problems
I've had with that is what happens if

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109
I've had with that is what happens if
 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.409
I've had with that is what happens if
you start to think that way because what

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419
you start to think that way because what
 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.300
you start to think that way because what
I've observed is that people who begin

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310
I've observed is that people who begin
 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.189
I've observed is that people who begin
to think that way that isn't where they

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199
to think that way that isn't where they
 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.680
to think that way that isn't where they
stop like that they get angry at

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690
stop like that they get angry at
 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.210
stop like that they get angry at
existence which is what happened to Cain

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220
existence which is what happened to Cain
 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.099
existence which is what happened to Cain
as we saw in the Cain and Abel story and

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109
as we saw in the Cain and Abel story and
 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.259
as we saw in the Cain and Abel story and
then the next step is to start taking

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269
then the next step is to start taking
 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.140
then the next step is to start taking
revenge against existence and that

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150
revenge against existence and that
 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.119
revenge against existence and that
cascades until it's revenge against well

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129
cascades until it's revenge against well
 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.619
cascades until it's revenge against well
I think the best way of thinking about

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629
I think the best way of thinking about
 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.659
I think the best way of thinking about
it is revenge against God for the crime

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669
it is revenge against God for the crime
 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.699
it is revenge against God for the crime
of being which is I think the deepest

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709
of being which is I think the deepest
 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.619
of being which is I think the deepest
sort of hatred that you can entertain

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629
sort of hatred that you can entertain
 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.469
sort of hatred that you can entertain
and and and when you're in the grip of a

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479
and and and when you're in the grip of a
 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.089
and and and when you're in the grip of a
really deep emotion like a really

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099
really deep emotion like a really
 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.339
really deep emotion like a really
profound emotion right at the bottom of

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349
profound emotion right at the bottom of
 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.140
profound emotion right at the bottom of
emotions you're in something that's like

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150
emotions you're in something that's like
 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.360
emotions you're in something that's like
a quasi-religious state and that's more

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370
a quasi-religious state and that's more
 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.310
a quasi-religious state and that's more
or less independent of your beliefs a in

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320
or less independent of your beliefs a in
 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.760
or less independent of your beliefs a in
a transcendent deity

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770
a transcendent deity
 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.650
a transcendent deity
I mean you can be in a profoundly

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660
I mean you can be in a profoundly
 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.659
I mean you can be in a profoundly
emotional state that's as deep as it can

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669
emotional state that's as deep as it can
 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:31.890
emotional state that's as deep as it can
be and it can have religious

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900
be and it can have religious
 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.480
be and it can have religious
significance without that necessarily

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490
significance without that necessarily
 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.520
significance without that necessarily
signifying anything about a transcendent

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530
signifying anything about a transcendent
 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.580
signifying anything about a transcendent
being you know but but then I was

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590
being you know but but then I was
 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.350
being you know but but then I was
thinking you see the problem with that

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360
thinking you see the problem with that
 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.050
thinking you see the problem with that
argument is you can gerrymander it

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060
argument is you can gerrymander it
 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.670
argument is you can gerrymander it
endlessly you know because first of all

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680
endlessly you know because first of all
 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.050
endlessly you know because first of all
how do you measure suffering and how do

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060
how do you measure suffering and how do
 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.610
how do you measure suffering and how do
you measure happiness it's like how do

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620
you measure happiness it's like how do
 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.710
you measure happiness it's like how do
you assign weights to them and god

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720
you assign weights to them and god
 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.300
you assign weights to them and god
there's just no way of doing that you

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310
there's just no way of doing that you
 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.809
there's just no way of doing that you
have to do it arbitrarily and so you can

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:54.819
have to do it arbitrarily and so you can
 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.430
have to do it arbitrarily and so you can
make an argument that the suffering

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440
make an argument that the suffering
 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.839
make an argument that the suffering
outweighs the happiness you just wait

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849
outweighs the happiness you just wait
 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.309
outweighs the happiness you just wait
the suffering more heavily than you wait

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319
the suffering more heavily than you wait
 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.719
the suffering more heavily than you wait
the happiness and that's the end of that

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729
the happiness and that's the end of that
 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.020
the happiness and that's the end of that
you know and so that's that's a problem

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030
you know and so that's that's a problem
 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.740
you know and so that's that's a problem
but I think there's a deeper problem
