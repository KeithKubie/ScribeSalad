Narrator: IN A LAST-DITCH
ATTEMPT TO BUST OUT OF JAIL,

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:07.868
ADAM AND JAMIE UNLEASH

00:00:07.868 --> 00:00:11.534
THE SUPPOSEDLY AWESOME POWER
OF ANTACID --

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:15.234
SOME IN TABLET FORM,
AND SOME AS RAW INGREDIENTS.

00:00:15.234 --> 00:00:19.167
THEY START BY DRENCHING JUST THE
PILL PILE WITH THE SMALL HOSE.

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:22.100
THIS IS PHASE ONE.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.033
PRESSURE IS STILL INCREASING
ON THE PLASTIC.

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:25.167
I CAN SEE IT MOVING.

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:26.501
REALLY?
YEAH.

00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:28.067
RIGHT IN THE CORNER
DOWN THERE.

00:00:28.067 --> 00:00:30.100
Narrator: EVEN BETTER,
ADAM'S GAUGE CLUSTER

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.634
IS FINALLY
FEELING THE PRESSURE.

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:34.367
OH, WE'RE GETTING SOMETHING
ON THE NEEDLE.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:39.901
JUST A TINY BIT.
GOT MAYBE 20% OF 1 PSI.

00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:41.200
WE'VE PROBABLY
TAKEN CARE

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.067
OF MORE THAN HALF
OF THE ANTACID TABLETS THERE --

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:46.968
14,000, 15,000
AT THIS POINT.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.501
AM I CRAZY,

00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:55.634
OR DOES THAT DOOR SEEM LIKE
IT'S PUSHING OUT ON THE BOTTOM?

00:00:55.634 --> 00:00:56.667
IT IS.
IS IT?

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:58.934
LOOK ALONG THE RAIL
ON THE BOTTOM.

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:04.133
THE DOOR IS PRESSING OUT
ON THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM.

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:11.767
WE'RE AT JUST A HAIR'S BREATH
UNDER 1/2 OF A PSI.

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:14.534
YEAH, THE PILE
IS ALMOST ENTIRELY WET.

00:01:14.534 --> 00:01:16.267
FOAM HAS CRAWLED
ALL THE WAY UP IT.

00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:19.133
I DON'T KNOW, DUDE.
YOU WANT TO DO WHAT WE DO BEST?

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.934
YOU WANT TO TAKE IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL?

00:01:20.934 --> 00:01:22.467
YEAH, OVER THE TOP.

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:24.567
CUE THE DELUGE.

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:28.767
LET'S GO TO PHASE TWO --
TURN EVERYTHING UP TO FULL.

00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:32.133
PHASE TWO IS THE TUB
AND THE FIRE HOSE.

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:38.367
IF IT DOES WHAT IT SHOULD,

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:42.534
WE'RE JUST MOMENTS AWAY
FROM THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BELCH.

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:45.234
THERE WE GO.

00:01:45.234 --> 00:01:46.667
WATER IS POURING
INTO OUR TUB.

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:48.400
OKAY.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.634
OH, WE'RE AT 1 PSI!

00:01:49.634 --> 00:01:51.501
IT'S CLIMBING
LIKE A ROCKET.

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:53.067
1.5 PSI.

00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:54.367
LOOK AT THE DOOR!

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:55.367
EYES OPEN!

00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:57.167
2 PSI!

00:01:57.167 --> 00:01:59.100
THE DOOR IS GONNA GO.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.434
2.5 PSI!
OH, MY GOD!

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:08.133
WE'RE COMING UP
TO 4 PSI.

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:11.701
AND THE DOOR IS -- OH!

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:15.934
OH, MY GOD.
IS EVERYONE OKAY?

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:24.634
OH.
IT ACTUALLY WORKED.

00:02:24.634 --> 00:02:26.634
DUDE!
[ LAUGHS ]

00:02:26.634 --> 00:02:28.067
LOOK AT THAT.

00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:30.934
Jamie: YOU COULD HEAR IT,
AND WITHIN SECONDS,

00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:32.901
THE DOOR STARTED TO POTATO CHIP.

00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:35.133
THIS MASSIVE DOOR THAT I BUILT

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:38.767
IS JUST, LIKE, CREAKING
AND GROANING AND CURLING

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:40.734
FROM ALL OF THIS PRESSURE.

00:02:40.734 --> 00:02:43.434
IT WAS AGONIZING TO WATCH IT.
