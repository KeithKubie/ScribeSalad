00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.570
Let me illustrate the use of signifiers. How

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.244
do you start and stop this video? Feel

00:00:06.244 --> 00:00:10.418
free to experiment. See that right pointing triangle,

00:00:10.418 --> 00:00:14.850
down there? That's a pretty universal symbol, to

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.430
mean play. Click on me to play the video. And when you click on it, it

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.180
changes to two vertical bars. Again, pretty universal

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.920
symbol for pause. Click on me to stop

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.850
the video. Now, how would you know that, before you ever experienced

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.280
it? Usually you have to be told. Or sometimes they label it, play and pause.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.766
But once you've learned it, it's the same all over. So that simplifies things.

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:51.310
But hey, there's more. Click any place on the screen, it stops the video.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.250
Click again, it starts it. Pretty neat, huh? But no visible signifier.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.370
How would you ever learn that? You just have to know. Oh, and while you're at

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.360
it Double-click. What happens? Hm. So what

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.290
do you think? These invisible signifiers that

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.990
make it easier to do the thing. Is that good design, or bad design?
