Here x must equal positive 1. Nice problem solving if you figured this out. We

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:11.364
start solving this problem by multiplying x times x plus 2. Since we're adding

00:00:11.364 --> 00:00:16.053
two logs with the same base, we can just multiply these arguments together. So

00:00:16.053 --> 00:00:20.751
we'll have log base 4 of x times x, which is x squared, and x times 2, which is

00:00:20.751 --> 00:00:27.693
plus 2x. The log base 4 of 3 stays on the right-hand side of the equation. Now

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:30.804
that we have a logarithm on one side of the equation here and a logarithm of

00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:35.494
something else here, we can set these two things equal to one another. We

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:39.462
want to factor this quadratic, but first we need to subtract 3 from both sides,

00:00:39.462 --> 00:00:47.635
to set it equal to zero. Now factoring, we get x plus 3 times x minus 1. We set

00:00:47.635 --> 00:00:51.796
each of these factors equal to 0 so x can equal negative 3 or x can equal

00:00:51.796 --> 00:00:56.650
positive 1. Now keep in mind that we want these arguments to be positive so

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.776
that way we can take a log of them. So if x were equal to negative 3, I would

00:01:01.776 --> 00:01:07.679
have a negative number here. I can't take the log base 4 of negative 3. That's

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:13.746
not possible. So this solution is out. This means the only solution is x equals

00:01:13.746 --> 00:01:15.513
positive 1.
