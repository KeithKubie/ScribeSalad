Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burns time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. Just checking in on you. Listen to this shit. I just got back from, uh, where the hell was I? Phoenix, Arizona. Home of the sons home of the coyotes home with a fucking, uh, I dunno. Grapefruit League net. Grapefruit League one instructional league. I don't, what the fuck is homer? The Diamondbacks home with the fucking condos.

Speaker 2:          00:00:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:37       All right. I just got back from there. Okay. I'm coming home. I'm taking a cab because I'm old. I don't do fucking Uber. I don't do Lyft. I don't do any of that bullshit. All right. I'm fucking calling somebody and they just pull up in their car. I just, I'm not, I noticed I don't do it right. I fucking take cabs. So I pull up to my house and this is fucking whatever state truck there for. These fucking guys are in my yard. The gates open and one of the guys got a ladder up to the side of my house, so I just walk in. I'm like, uh, yeah. Hey, what are you guys doing? And he goes up, God, somebody finally somebody's home, and I'm like, what do you mean my wife didn't let you in? He was like, no, there was no answer.

Speaker 1:          00:01:26       And I'm like, then what are you doing here? And he goes, well, you know, I keep coming by. There's nobody here. I got to check the meter. You know? They'd said, you put a new electrical box. You know you guys didn't have a home. I mean, what was I supposed to do? I was like, I don't know. Not coming to my fucking yard. What do you, what was I supposed to do? Every time I go to the bank, the bank's closed. I mean, what was I supposed to do? Come back when they're fucking, they're yet can't. He just kept saying, what was I supposed to do? You trust passing you asshole the F up fucking. He just kept saying what any I've, you know something. I actually kept my cool up. I just calmly said, I don't know, not coming to my yard. I go off my, if I keep one of my neighbor's house and he's not there, that doesn't mean give me a right to go in there. And he goes, well, I've got to go over. I got to get to the pole. I mean, you know, when they changed the box, the only put temporary whatever, fucking things on there. I gotta put the right things on there. I don't have your phone number. I'm like, well, whose fault is that? Some I fault. Nobody asked me. You guys never called me, or I guess she couldn't call me, but you should have gotten from the, from the electrician. He goes, yeah, the electrician did give it to me. Why go? There you go.

Speaker 1:          00:02:36       So the guy, the guy is grabbing a ladder, he takes it down and he's fucking walking out and go, you know what do you, what do you need to do here? He goes, no, no. You know, go get out of here. It's just like, dude, you, I'm going to fucking pout now. You know what I'm saying is right fucking walking. You just open the gate. You just fucking walk in. Unbelievable. I like the guy. The other guy immediately was fucking, you know, he's looking down. He knew he was feeling you lose. The guy was wrong. The guy was basically like, this is like the third time I come over here, nobody ever answers the door. I'm getting sick of this and he just fucking, it'll climbed over the wall. I don't know what the gate's locked. I don't know how they did it mean you had a ladder? I guess he just fucking went right up and over it. I mean, what was I supposed to do? One fuck. You mean what we are supposed to do? That's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard. So then I go, what do you need to do? He told me when he did do I call, how are you want to go down and do it?

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       Get the fight. I mean, he still did way too much. Don't, I don't know. It was the weirdest fucking response ever. Well, you know, I, I what, what was I supposed to do? So, but I was actually happy that I, I mean, I lost my shit on it now thinking about it on the podcast way more than I did in the moment. And um,

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:58       you know, I said to the guy said, I'm not trying to be difficult, but you know, that's what you're doing here is it's not right. And you know, it's not, I shouldn't say I should said that. And you know it's not right. You got inpatient and he just said to hell with it, I'm just going to do this anyways and you're trespassing. You know, you trespassing. I don't care that you worked for the state. That doesn't, you know, I guess, you know, if, if my fucking house was on fire or the the poll or some shit, there was a live wire hanging from it, then yeah, I guess you have the authority to go up and over. I don't think you can do that just because you're fucking tired of knocking on the door. Nobody answers.

Speaker 1:          00:04:36       Anyway, sorry. So I just got back from Phoenix, Arizona. I had the best fucking time when I was out there, ate a bunch of great food, but all basically I kind of ate mainly down near um, um, wherever, wherever the fucking Phoenix Suns play the, uh, traveling Riverside resort arena, whatever the hell they call it. Um, had a couple of really cool, um, meals when I was down there. Went to this really good pizza joint. Um, good for the southwest pizza. You don't mean let's not get crazy right. And, uh, got a good burrito down there. I didn't work out at all. I was driving over to see my dog. I was starving. I got a fucking whopper with cheese and fucking burger king and all freckles is a, that's it. I'm done. I'm, I'm officially, I'm on the wagon for the first time in a year, like really hardcore on the wagon.

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       Like I'm fucking done. There's no drink in, in site other than water for me. Um, I don't know. I was, I was, uh, I don't know what happened to me the last two times I went on the road. I just spent under a fucking a lot of stress, you know, not sleeping with the kid. And then I got to put this new hour together and uh, my fucking shoulder is still messed up, although I finally turned the corner with it. And, um, but you know, so I just, you know, I just haven't been able to work out the way I want to and I swear to God, dude, I am starting to get dad bought and I have to stop this immediately. I am too goddamn vein, you know, you know when you just look bad in a tee shirt, I have a pothead body right now and I do not fucking like it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       Oh, I forgot to tell you still have to deal with that guy. Hey, you know, what the fuck was I supposed to do? I come into my house and there's this strange odor, like, what is that? Is that some hippie candle? What's going on? And I come downstairs and Nia tells me that a fucking pipe or some shit bursts the night before and all this water came out. I go, you gotta be shitting me. You gotta be shitting me and I go, okay. Did you, did you go to the front of the house like I showed you and turned off all the water?

Speaker 3:          00:06:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       No, I turned it off under the sink. I'm like, Oh God, okay. I'm smelling water. And then I look at my bedroom ceiling and there's a brown stain just ever so small and this little fucking crack. And I was just like, oh my God. Dot. Again, please tell me not against. So I run upstairs. I shut off the main fucking thing.

Speaker 3:          00:07:17       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:07:18       this is thing about these feminists, they don't want to do fucking housework anymore, but they, they're not going to do the guy shit either. Like no one had to shut the fucking water off. It's like, so what exactly are you going to do?

Speaker 3:          00:07:30       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:07:30       fucking watch Mary Tyler Moore reruns. So it's, I'm sorry, whatever. I'm flying up, run upstairs at flying out the fucking door. I shut it off. And then I, you know, now I got my stupid can iPhone flashlight, you know, because the fucking guys outside checking the box of cut off the electricity, the water's off. Now this is just basically a glorified fucking log cabin and I'm going through the crawl spaces and all this shit and I'm trying to find out where this water is coming from as it collected. Is the ceiling going to collapse? What is going on? And um, fortunately I think, I think we're all right. Um, and it was also fresh water. So I don't think you guys like, you don't have to deal with mold, which I don't know if that makes sense to me. I mean, it doesn't also it on what the fuck's in the inside the pipe. I have no idea. I'm sure there's going to be a bunch of people tweeting at me make scaring the shit out of me. So that's basically what I came home too. But the plumber came by, change the fucking thing that needed to be changed. Hopefully everything's going to be all right. But I once again,

Speaker 3:          00:08:36       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:08:38       everybody in your house, I'm telling you right now, needs to know how to shut off the fucking water.

Speaker 3:          00:08:46       Everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:08:47       In fact, that's the first thing I'm going to teach my daughter once she starts walking around,

Speaker 3:          00:08:52       you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:08:54       What'd she understands? The concept of

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       water and what it can do to your house. All right. And I'm just going to be like, look, the next time a fucking book, I sweat the next, I'm going to, I'm getting rid of this house. I'm done with it. Fuck this house. I've had it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:11       I've just had it with his fucking house, you know, smell, goddamn faults. What happened? You buy a 100 year old fucking house that has a lot of character. You know, I'm going to sell this fucking house and I am going to buy some brand new home depot doubt. No character whatsoever. I mean, I want it to look like a fucking food court. I don't give a shit. As long as everything's brand new in it. No, don't mind like the people won't put it together. Right? And I'll still have the problems, but um, I was literally when I was in the crawl space, right?

Speaker 1:          00:09:47       It's all these fucking cobwebs and all that. I just, it just, it was it. I officially fell out of love with this house and I was like, you know what? Fuck this house. You know why? You know what? You went house, you fucking when you brought me down. Cool Hand Luke, you finally fucking did it. What should dirt doing? A boss man's hole. That's what this house has been doing me the entire fucking time I've lived here. I Dunno boss. We got to get it outta there. What's your dirt doing? A boss man's yard. I don't know boss.

Speaker 2:          00:10:29       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       Ah Fuck. Anyways, homeownership, you know they always show all of the young couple on TV, fucking smiling and all that shit. They had a fucking show me my fucking whopper with cheese. Fucking body crawling around a goddamn crawl space. Of course. What are going to walk around and crawl space bill.

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10:52       so then I fucking

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       thank God. It's all right. So then I leave, I go down to take care of all the bills and all of this shit. So why the podcasts late is late. And I'm like, alright, I gotta I gotta pick up a salad or something. I got to start on the right foot here. And, uh, you know, typical La Thing, oh, this is the place I want to be. Um, that's a restaurant that, you know, 40 people can eat at and there's four parking spots, two of which, you know, are taken by the cook in the manager and the other two are taken by the fucking waitstaff. So as always, there's no fucking place to park. And I turned the corner. Lo and behold, there's a fucking spot. And, um, I went down and turned around like a gentleman and of course someone else said, fuck that. And they made the three point turn into the goddamn parking spot, took my fucking pocket spot.

Speaker 2:          00:11:45       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:45       And uh, that, and then I, then that was it. That was enough. All my meditation, everything went out the fucking window. And, uh, you know, so I had my first fucking meltdown in awhile and in weeks, my first meltdown in weeks. And then I basically, I went from yelling at the guy who fucking took my, took my parking spot. It was my parking spot, right? He got there first. I saw it first, but he fucking made a better move. And he gave boxed me up like, you know, you've got the rebound. I went from yelling at bout him in the car to myself to yelling even louder about the electrician to yelling even louder about shutting the fucking water off. The second day is of God damn problem. Um, and then I found a parking spot and I got out and I think I was yelling so loudly like somebody walking by was looking at me all fucking weird and I dunno, whatever. I had a little bit of a setback. But uh, anybody out there if you'd like to buy a house with a lot of character, oh, does this out. This house is a character. I'll tell you, it'll have you scratching your head. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:12:57       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       maybe I'll sell this idea and talk to me about this. Maybe I'll sell this fucking house and we'll just do the, do the, uh, moving to one of those soldiers. Fucking high rises. You know, you know those things that people do, the empty nesters do when they just don't want to deal with the fucking house anymore, which I never understood. It's like, why the fuck would you want to be live in your house? All the kids are out of there. You know, you now, you've got all these spaces. It's going to be great now. Right now I know why. Now I know what.

Speaker 2:          00:13:24       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       Oh, do I know why? Cause this shit's going to happen. Yeah. I, I completely fucking get it now. Like I don't give a fuck about a view. I don't give a fuck about, you know, old school shit. I don't give a fuck about anything. All I give a fuck about is if something breaks, it's not on me. How, where can I live like that? I might go back to renting

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       this house is just, it's just a fucking, it's a motherfucker. I'm never again, I'm telling you right now, don't have a buy a fucking old house unless you're handy. You know, or unless you just like making your life fucking difficult. I'm telling you, this is the classic. This is what mean versus you were laughing about all week. I was, how he makes his life easy and I make my life difficult. He buys a fucking house, the last fucking guy, three dead, the whole thing. He gets, he turnkey. I need to be more Versie.

Just live in that right where bill, you just don't fucking parking spots out here. I Dunno. I'm sorry. Anyways, so I'm going to be Billy elliptical head, Billy fucking no booze bag and we've eaten salads and all this fucking shit. And uh, you know, I got to get this under control, disgusted with myself, you know, it's time to walk into the fucking bathroom mirror and just trashed myself, you know, take the shirt off. Let's see what it is. You know, it looked like Tom Brady. I just first way, and you know when he was a college student just eating Cheetos and he was like a third string quarterback or some shit. Well, when I don't look like his face, I look like his stomach.

Speaker 1:          00:15:14       Just no muscle tone whatsoever. I'm exaggerating, but it made, I don't know. It's not a, it's not what I want. It's not what I want to see. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:15:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:25       It's Christ. It's like my belly is to the point. It's going to be like when I stand in the shower, my knees aren't going to get it wet. Um, feed are totally dry, you know? Um, but that, you know something, I'm not that bad, but that's the road I'm heading on. And I was sitting on the plane today watching all these fucking people who just destroy their bodies, just getting on the plane, just getting on a fucking plane. They're like winded from walking down that movable hallway, whatever you call that. It's not the tarmac. When they, what do they call that? The jet way people could you put your coats under the seat in the overhead compartment so we can expedite the boarding process. We still have a lot of peoples standing. I'm on the jet way. We want to have it on time departure. Um, and I'm just sitting there watching all of these fucking,

Speaker 3:          00:16:16       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       just fat Fox walking by. This gotta be something amazing though about living that way.

Speaker 3:          00:16:27       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       well you, Oh, you just always just, you're always eating exactly what you want to eat, you know? Hey Mike, you want a devil dog? Yeah. Do you want to get a breed off? Sure. Absolutely. What do you feel like having a cheeseburger, French fries and a chocolate malt.

Speaker 3:          00:16:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       You know, it's like you basically, you're eating like a fucking eight year old whose parents aren't home your entire life. You don't, you know, when your parents took off, that was it. You went to the enemy, you're eating a fucking elements cake or some donuts or those store bought fucking donuts. Those ones where it was like, it was like four plane for powdered cinnamon. Do they still make those things? We had those things all the time. I used to eat, I got dammit, I ate absolute shit when I was growing up. Then you went outside, you ran around and just burned it off.

Speaker 3:          00:17:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:24       You didn't have a fucking blew out. Your rotator cuff is a fucking seven eight year old you injury free brand new fucking car. You know what? My Body's like, my body's like this house. It's just fucking old as shit.

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       I can't wait. You know how they can like grow an ear and I'd fucking petri dish now I swear to God I, I, you know they got to do that. Like it's going to happen man. When they see they can bro all the organs and they can grow all your fucking body parts up over again. I'm telling you right now it's going to be like, you body's going to be like a a I will, you know it, but they probably still would look old. But yeah, it looks like one of those Resto Mod. Thanks. You know, or it's brand new one Denise. But on top it looks at, you know, like a 1960, whatever. Is any of this fucking make it sense? I mean, what was I supposed to do? I mean, I knocked on your door three times and there was nobody here, so I just figured I'd walk into your fucking yard, put a ladder up next to your house, Jesus Christ. You know what I mean? Can you imagine if somebody did that at Ted Nugent's house? How many fucking bows and arrows would that guy have? And it's stupid construction hat. What do you got the hard hat on for? This is like, like that's going to help. Like when you fall off the ladder, that thing doesn't fall off with you.

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       Maybe that's why he did it. He had his hat so fucking tidy wasn't even thinking. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:18:51       yeah.

Totally cheating. Doesn't need to talk shit. Right? He's the shit that's Reggie fucking Miller hits a three steals the inbound pass runs behind the three wasn't good enough to get them for two fucking hits, another three point turns around and looks at fucking spike Lee. Does the church in the garden. I mean that's, yeah, it's fucking, do you ever have to, do any of you ever got an outdoor accomplish anything else after that?

It just hang on our every word. Just hoping maybe this complete stranger on TV. She's the one that's gonna make me happy. I mean that's, that's the saddest part of watching one of those Oprah shows. I even know she does it anymore. I'm just gonna pretend the show still on the fucking, there was all those women that sat in the crowd, the fucking look of hope on their face.

Speaker 3:          00:28:32       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:28:34       I always wanted to see, you know, what they should have had next door was the sea of men that all those fucking poor women were married to.

It just fucking sit there with that fucking

Speaker 3:          00:28:56       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:57       Like you ever watched one of those shows with is like 10 whores and they're all fucking fight over some nerdy guy and that look of hope they have, if they're going to get the fucking, you know, get handed a slipper, which means they're going to be there for another week, whatever the fuck you need, whenever it is they do, they all had that look on their face.

Speaker 1:          00:29:15       Do you know what? As much as I'm making fun of Oprah, I also like Brent, but no matter how fresh it is, no matter how much I like it, if someone was standing in a big yard yelling that it would make me uncomfortable and it would take away from the experience.

Speaker 3:          00:29:30       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:29:32       it's gotta be weird to be part of her fucking staff. Just every once in a while I'll just hear yelling random things. Costume.

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       All right. I don't know what to talk about next. Sorry. Bitched about my house so much. Um, enjoy this nuts little musical clip here. Oh Hey. By the way, you know what? I heard that, uh, that sneaker shit that I was saying actually ended up on some big sneaker websites, so I must be getting fucking trashed on that one. You know, I had no idea that, you know, I knew people were into sneakers. I didn't realize I went and told him that much. You know, I actually bought a new pair of sneakers this week when I was out in Phoenix. I got the classic fucking shell toes. That's what I got. You know, cause a lot of peoples were suggesting that I wore those fucking, you know, you know those giant lecture Chunky fucking sneakers that people with feet problem use. You know, I don't wear those.

Speaker 1:          00:39:16       Although I do have the Steve Jobs, new balance. You know, if you look at the Daytona 500 picture, I believe I'm wearing them there. I did have a nice pair of sneakers but I was not going to wear them to the Daytona 500. So maybe I have a little sneaker head and make it right. Maybe, I don't know. I wear the shittiest pair of sneakers. I had to go down and that fucking track with all the Goddamn oil and shit all over the place. Um, once again, I want to thank everybody that came out to stand up live. Everybody at Stan applied. It had such a great time and uh, I dunno, Paul Versey crushed it and all week. And uh, I just had a, I had a great time, so thank you very much. San Jose Improv in two weeks and uh, that's it. Please listen to the music if you'd like. And uh, we're going to have a greatest hit from a podcast recorded in a different time in another year and something else. All right. Have a great weekend. You constant. I'll, I'll talk to you on Monday.

Speaker 4:          00:40:14       Is the Monday morning podcast 20 past nine on Monday morning. A cloudy day out here in La as it is the rainy season and a actually had some guests over here, so this is going to be quiet, kind of a quiet podcast. Um, cause I also have to do to the, uh, I have some friends in town from out of town, so we have to do all the La Shit. Uh, and I gotta be honest with you, I'm trying to think what the La should is because I'm still new out here, you know, and I lived in New York. I knew what that meant. You know, that meant they wanted to go to the top of the empire state building. They wanted to go to the Statue of Liberty, uh, Times Square. Basically. They wanted to go every place that a new Yorker never goes. And uh, so what my mission always was whenever I had, um, you know, friends coming down to visit New York City was I immediately tried to convince them that all the things that they wanted to see, they didn't really want to see.

Speaker 4:          00:41:20       And um, I like to think I was doing them a favor. But uh, you know, part of it was selfish cause you know, I'm not fucking getting on a boat to climb up into a statue that's looking out into the ocean. You know what I mean? It's like, you know, I dunno. That's what we wanted to talk about. Underrated. Overrated. Okay. Overrated climbing up into the statue of Liberty. If he can even still do it with the whole nine, 11 America or whatever that we live in now. I don't even know if you're allowed to fucking do it anymore. I'm sure they'll let you if they like, you know, if you let them fingerprint you and scan your fucking retinas. But um, anyways, um, I don't, I always feel like when you go to a city, like personally, I, you know, I want to do a few touristy things, but, uh, I want to hang out with the locals because they always know the good bars and the restaurants and that type of shit.

Speaker 4:          00:42:13       And so that's what I used to try to, you know, convince people like, but it's hard sometimes. Sometimes you just got to give in. Like when my parents came down and they wanted to eat at Mickey Mantle's on 57th street, 59th Street, and uh, you know, you just can't stop people from doing shit like that. You know. Isn't this a great burger? No, no it isn't. It's a great, is a touristy burger and it's fucking $18 more than it needs to be because when you look out the window, you can see central park. What is wrong with you Mickey Mantle? Yeah, that's great. Let's then, let's go get a hotdog at Wade Boggs. The fuck does Mickey Mantle know about making a burger? Okay. If you want to go Busan and Mouse, oh, that's a low blow fucking dead legend. What the fuck is wrong with me? I apologize.

Speaker 4:          00:43:03       The Yankee fans over that one. I shouldn't end sports fans in general. You know, Mickey Mantle never did steroids. Diddy, granted they didn't exist back then. And uh, I got to tell you some, it's too bad he didn't and it's too bad they didn't exist back then because we would've got to watch that guy, uh, you know, have the body of a 22 year old until he was 42. And uh, I got to tell you something man. Um, after, you know, just watching some of these guys get busted and you know, getting busted for being on juice, uh, you know, they always have that question, you know, should people who do steroids be allowed into the hall of fame? And uh, I think after the rock thing, I'm finally thinking, no, they shouldn't. And just for the simple fact that, like I just said, it's like, it doesn't help you get better.

Speaker 4:          00:43:58       It just keeps your body in mint condition until you like 40, 42 in, all of these guys would get busted the second they get off them there, they're numbers go right through the floor. And I don't think it has anything to do with this skill. It's just like a, you do roids it's like you become one of the expert. I'm not really big on those action movies and shit, but you know those movies where you know, somebody gets super human healing abilities and somebody slices into his arm and it made immediately heals up. It's like you're literally doing the real life version of that. And uh, I don't think it's fair to guys like Ken Griffey Jr there really isn't like, uh, that guy quietly hits 600 fucking home runs and I, you know, kind of stop noticing 10 years ago when all these fucking gorillas will coming up to the plate.

Speaker 4:          00:44:50       I don't know, I've said this before, maybe they should have a special wing, you know, the roid rage wing of the hall of fame. I have no idea, but I got to admit, I think we're all hypocritical, forgiven those guys shit because no one gave a fuck about baseball. And then all of a sudden when McGuire and Sosa came around, I was one of the best years of baseball ever. And uh, everybody made a ton of fucking money and everybody had a great time and now we're all acting like our feelings got hurt because we got to watch people hit 600 foot home runs, you know, then make any sense. I'm half a fucking sleep out here. Um, here's something that I, uh, I actually read a quote from one of these magazines, I guess evidently a Clint Eastwood was hyping that movie. Gran Gran Torino. I don't know if you guys have seen that movie. I'm sure you've seen the ads for it. Where he basically is, I get up late Lon, you fucking person of another race and I'm a white man and I represented my car represents back when America was good in the early seventies. Um, I guess when he was, uh, doing the interview for that movie, uh, he called I guess the current generation, the pussy generation. And at first it made me laugh and I'm thinking like, yeah, Clint Eastwood obviously has earned the right to call people pussies. And I'm thinking, wait a minute, Cleese was, is an actor.

Speaker 4:          00:46:23       Okay. Who plays tough guys who never loses a fight really any, even if he does lose a fight in a movie, it's a fake fight. So at the risk of making my second sack religious comment first trash in the Great Mickey Mantle, uh, now I'm going to go out to Clint Eastwood. Unlike where his Clint Eastwood, I want, this is my question for you guys this week. Where's cleanness would got off like where's he earned the right that he's this tough guy cause like he plays a tough guy. I've known understand that with like actors. Like I remember like after nine, 11, like, um, for some reason they wheeled out Tom Hanks and like that was supposed to make me feel relaxed as an American. And I remember during that time I was doing a joke on stage going and talking about Tom Hanks saying he's done so many army movies. He thinks he's a veteran.

Speaker 4:          00:47:18       You know what I mean? It's not like you did army movies, but he played an astronaut. He was in saving private Ryan. You know what I mean? And like all of a sudden, like he becomes like a, all these guys, like I said, you know, here's, here's one for you. I've got fucking, you know, friends out here. Some were doing the touristy shit out here in La and I take them down to Mann's Chinese theater or grooming or whatever the fuck they call it now. And they got those, uh, they got the hand prints in the feet, prints in the footprints there in the, uh, the cement. And I found John Wayne, I swear to God, John Wayne had the smallest fucking feet I've ever seen it. I couldn't believe it. This is the Duke John Wayne. This is the guy. Everyone was one. Just thought if even breathed on you, he fucking knock you in the next week.

Speaker 4:          00:48:07       This guy had like, I think he went to fucking lady gap to buy his cowboy boots. She's like so fucking the smallest fucking things. He could've fit both his boots and his cowboy hat. That's how small his fucking feeder. If you ever go to La and you go to Mann's Chinese Stereo, it's on the right hand side. He had tiny little ass feet, you know, actors are fucking annoying, you know what I mean? So then they put on fucking leather jackets and they play these bad asses and it's just like, dude, you're fucking, you're an actor. Have you had any real fights, Clint? Huh? Somebody of a fucking rear engine and the drive through at Burger King and you got out and you settled the score maybe. Yes. I don't know what, but you know, I don't know. I'm fucking just fucking annoyed me. And, and moving on from that, somebody actually sent me an email that kind of ties into this, right? I'm not saying clinics and a tough guy. The guy's fucking ridiculous. He's 80 years old, he's still lifting weights, you know, the way his eyes are squinted. He definitely seems like a bad ass, but you know, I want to see his fight card. I want to see his arrest record. You know, maybe he was a juvenile delinquent before he came up. I Dunno, I haven't Wikipedia them yet.

Speaker 4:          00:49:30       I have no idea. But this is just, you know, there's just an, I don't even know why I'm defending this generation of people because I'm 40 years old. So technically the only generation that pop culture gives a fuck about is the young kids, you know, which is basically, I don't know what, whatever it starts to is basically once you're over the age of 24, nobody gives a fuck about you anymore as far as like a what music you listen to. Um, anyways, so this, this woman wrote me this, uh, she wrote me this email and it said, uh, when it let me get down to the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all this type of stuff. Same really nice stuff to me, which um, I'm going to blow through here even though I totally appreciate it. And she was commenting on the guy last week, you know, the guy last week, I was reading the story where, uh, he was hanging out with this girl, most beautiful girl he's ever seen, but she's dumb as a brick and there's a fucking pothead and he can't figure out how to close the deal with her.

Speaker 4:          00:50:25       Um, so this is what she said. She said, Oh, and about the guy who asked about what he should do with the, with the pretty pothead girl asked him if he tried to get physical with her. Um, wouldn't he know whether or not she was interested in a physical relationship if he had made a move on her, which is a great point because maybe he didn't. And she said he's probably one of those hesitant guys that want the check to make the first move. So typical of today. So I guess that's kind of backend. Clint Eastwood saying that this is like the pussy generation. Um, I don't want to be a dick here, but I think a lot of that has to do with, uh, the oversaturation of a date rape movies. And, uh, these 100% chick tone shows like fucking Oprah and I'll, I mean, they got, you're so fucking, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:51:25       I don't know what it is they got. Everybody's so convinced that women aren't the same lying sacks of shit that guys are with just different genitalia that I think a lot of guys are approaching, um, stupid pothead checks. Like they're these princesses that need to be rescued. In other words, what I'm saying is he's you just fucking bender over. He should just stick her bag of weed on the floor in front of our ankles and when she bends down to get it, he should handle this business. All right. That was ignorant. There you go. That's the first a straight up fucking ignorant statement of the week. Um, let's get on with it here. This is the out of the Monday morning podcast. If you're wondering what this babbling is, um, I do one of these every single week. Like fucking cal Ripkin. I'm the cal Ripken a fucking podcast.

Speaker 4:          00:52:15       I can't remember the last time I missed one. Even when I fucking miss one, I call up and I apologize, you know, does that count if cal Ripkin Mr Baseball game in the middle of his streak and he just kind of called in the Orioles and said yes. Sorry about that. Yeah. But he called up, he called up before the sixth inning, so that counts as him showing up. Anyways, I do one of these every week. People send me a, they send me questions, they send me their list of underrated overrated. Um, sometimes they ask me for advice. Sometimes somebody sends me a cunty email and uh, they earned the right of a douche bag of the week. If it's bad, if it's bad criticism, if I deserve it, I'll take one on the chin. Um, and also I hiked the stuff that I have going on in my career.

Speaker 4:          00:52:58       Okay. Bill, what do you have going on in your career at this week? Well, I will tell you on, uh, next Monday, Monday the uh, the fuck is today at damn this phone once nine plus seven, the 16th, March 16th, I am going to be doing um, a couple of shows. I believe they added a second show at the punchline in San Francisco. The first one sold really well. And last I heard we were going to add a second show. Um, you can go to punchline comedy club.com. I have all the information. I probably don't even have that up on my website. Do I? What a moron. I'm going to do that at the end of this podcast. By the time you hear this, it's going to be up there. Hopefully. Um, I'm going to be at the punchline San Francisco next Monday night with Joe Barton. Nick, um, and the shows are at seven o'clock and I believe they just added a nine or nine 30.

Speaker 4:          00:53:50       And that's what I like to do. I'd like to hype Shit where I have three quarters of the information and later on this month, the final weekend of March, whatever the hell those dates are, I'm going to be at the house of comedy and East St Louis White people. Don't be scared. It's going to be a nice mixed crowd, you know, and you know, just like our president nice and mixed, you know, they'd go, I don't let me bring in America together. Um, and then I got up after that, I got, uh, the Trump marina. Why don't I get on my fucking website here and figure out most of you listening to this, by the way, on my website, cause I gotta I gotta admit I'm starting to find my space, my space. I'm starting to feel like the survivor of a nuclear holocaust, you know, kind of like will Smith's character and I am legend every day.

Speaker 4:          00:54:39       Every Monday I will be doing a podcast at the pier down at the bottom of Manhattan, you know, and I want you to saber tooth tiger. I never understood those fucking lions in that movie. Where the fuck did they come from? You know the only lines in Manhattan or in the zoo. So if everybody, the zookeepers all died of whatever fucking disease it was, was that some animal lover who came up with the end of the world? Rabies, I have to let these lions go and get mauled to death just like you fucking deserved. Um, okay. Here we go. Sorry. I had to do that until I got to my website. Um, April 4th, 2009, I will be at the Trump marina with uninformed Joe to Rosa Comedy Central Presents Joe to Rosa, every local bar in Manhattan's Jody rose. Sorry, Joel, if you listen to this, I, you know, good things come in three and you only have two good things in your life.

Speaker 4:          00:55:33       All right? And I'm one of them. Don't ever forget that. You fucking half Egyptian S. All right, getting a little louder, a little more angrier. Um, what else do I got? I got the funny bone and Columbus and my Caroline's date got moved from the middle of May to the last week of April slash first weekend. I guess it's the first weekend in May. All right. I'm sure I'm going to emails on that. Oh my God, I was coming in from Chattanooga just through your show. Send me a free DVD. I will, as long as you open your mouth and let the mailman jam it down he fucking throat. I really get made here. Um, oh, we're going to be getting less than the girlfriend over there. She puts a fucking makeup on. Okay. Audience of one. Um, anyways, uh, oh, here we go. You know, it's uh, something that really annoys the shit out of me.

Speaker 4:          00:56:32       Uh, parents, I don't like former Fred boy date rapists to then have kids and then sit there and, and you know, now because they have a kid, I have to be respectful around them. I think I talked about this last week, but I'm going to talk about it again because it's happened again. I'm sick of you form a fucking loud douche bags, you know who just ruined people's flights. You've ruined baseball games basically. You like me? Okay, you're an asshole. And now that you have a kid, everyone else has to be on their best behavior because you ended your life. And the fun in your life. Everyone else has to be on your schedule. All right? Fuck you and your fucking kid, all right? If you don't want them to be around a fucking animal like myself, don't take them out in public, okay? That's what they have board games for.

Speaker 4:          00:57:18       So why don't you sit there with your board game and you'd dip and re your turtleneck sweater that you don't want to wear as the rage for the person that you knocked up, builds up inside of you. Why don't you keep that all right? Walk out in your backyard and scream into a bush. Okay? Believe you fucking kids because I'm still single. I don't have any kids and I'm having a good time and I'm not having you be a fucking wet blanket because you have this little creature that only half looks like you. All right? Okay. Comment of swinging. I'm all right. I'm playing to the crowd right now. I'm getting laughs. I'm just fucking deliberately being an asshole. I'm really not in that bad of a mood, Huh? I'm not singling. You know what I mean? I'm not married either. All right. So watch your p's and q's over there, sweetheart.

Speaker 4:          00:58:10       Um, ever tell you I got my girlfriend, they gave us little fucking, I want to put my makeup on. I'm a little eight year old princess women love that Shit and you know, and you'd think it would keep them from heckling you during a podcast, but it doesn't. The fucking happiness only lasts for a few days. All right, question number one. Okay. So if you new to my podcast, I do a, and this one is going to be a little short this week. I know, I would say that. Then I ended up doing 50 minutes, but uh, I'm already up to 18 minutes. I'm gonna try to keep this, uh, kind of try to keep this about 30 minutes. Oh, by the way, I went down to Irvine last night and I watched, uh, my old friend from the Chappelle show, Charlie Murphy to a, a nice hours worth of killer material that I haven't seen before.

Speaker 4:          00:58:58       Um, if you get a chance, definitely check out Sharley. I think he really has a, uh, just a totally original, original fucking style. That's great. He just goes up there and he tells these fucked up stories. Either that happened, that he invented hybrid stories that are partially true. I don't even know what the fuck he was. Great. I sat there in the crowd like a Goddamn Fan. Had a great time. Um, and that is it. So look at me hyping other, took a little bit of a fucking great guy. I am granted, I already hyped my shows and buried his hype fucking 20 minutes into a podcast and I'm patting myself on the back. Um, alright. I do questions. I answer questions every week here on the podcast. So here are some questions. Hey Bill, I was wondering if you ever had a slow, a slow spot in comedy.

Speaker 4:          00:59:50       Like if you ever had a period of time when you didn't come up with any material, any material for awhile. Oh yeah. That happens all the time then it happens like every six weeks, you know, or whatever. Or we'll have for a six week period. But, um, I've learned how to get, I've learned what works for me, how to get me out of those. And I think I've answered this before, but I know I have a Zillion podcasts so I will answer it again in the name of comedy. Um, what I do to get myself out of those, I take all rules of, of being a hack. I just throw those out the window and um, I'm really setting myself up to get trashed. Like really, Bill, I never noticed that you ever, uh, didn't take the rules of hack off with your awful specials?

Speaker 4:          01:00:37       Um, no, I just basically I do two things. What I'm going to write his block a, I will talk about current events like that dumb broad, but the eight fucking kids and just basically shit that like every comic is jumping on. You know, like you ever see when an animal dies and the discovery channel's a bunch of vultures sitting around it. That's kind of like hack materials. Like, and I'll fucking fly right down with my ugly buzzard head and I'll take a big chunk out of it. I basically just basically if you're in writer's block, just do hacky shit about topical new stuff. And also I try to ask my self what's bugging me right now? Anything from, um, my girlfriend, it's going to bad look there. My girlfriend too. Uh, like, um, the fact that I can't come up with any new material, anything that's bothering me.

Speaker 4:          01:01:34       And um, I just, you just kind of use that as an exercise just to go on stage and just to be saying something new, even though you know it's hacky shit that you never got to keep it, it still feels good to not be doing all the jokes that you're sick of. And usually they'll end up spinning into something else hopefully. And you kind of pull yourself out of the mud and uh, and if all else fails, just pick on some fat guy in the crowd. All right. No, don't do that. Don't do that. Okay. It didn't we learn anything from Eddie Murphy in the clumps, whatever the fuck that more than, what was that movie called? The night he professor, you know, I fucked up. I thought it hit all the questions right in a row. Now I gotta scroll down. Hey, how did you guys enjoy the music last week?

Speaker 4:          01:02:21       Did you like the old school music? I'm going to play some more and we play you a Ted Heath elks parade next week. This is slowly just going to become like fucking pirate radio. I bought two more records this week. I actually bought a clash record cause I felt really bad about trashing them, not trashing, I'm just saying I didn't understand that music. So I deliberately went out and I bought a bunch of music that I never fucked with when I was a kid cause I uh, I got into ACDC, which led me into Motley Crue, which led me then down to a really bad road of Glam hair metal that I want to say ended with Brittany Fox. But somewhere in there though, I did, I did. I found Stevie Ray Vaughan when he did the video for, couldn't stand the weather. So I always had one foot in decent music.

Speaker 4:          01:03:11       But uh, basically I totally shut out the Ramones or the clash unless you know, other than their radio shit, Elvis Costello, this is all shit I bought this week. I finally downloaded, uh, David Bowie, that, uh, Ziggy stardust album. And I was like, you know, this is like one of these great concept albums that people listened to in the 70s. And I was like, fuck this, I'm doing it the way they did it in the 70s minus the drugs. So I got my headphones that I have, I do have headphones, I have the big fucking, you know what actually for drums, they kind of protect the ears from the drums and he also can listen to your iPod, which I don't have my dismay. And I plugged it in my laptop and I listened to the album and I fucked up was because rather than listening to it in the track order, I guess on my iTunes, I had it in, you know, last downloaded.

Speaker 4:          01:04:05       So it kind of jumped all around the album. I kind of realized when the Ziggy stardust fucking kill themselves or whatever, by the third song, I'm like, wow, how's David Bowlby going to pull himself out of this fucking thing? And then I realized, you know, once again I fucked up with technology but the fucking killer album and uh, I dunno if anybody has any suggestions of, of music from that era, you know, all the shit that I thought sucked, like talking heads. I kind of like the couple of their songs, but like some David Burns Solo shit I found is amazing. And to think that I was in a, in a warehouse just trashing him during that period of my life thinking that he sucked as I was listening to Cinderella and poison and all this, uh, Tesla, I'm not saying they were bad, but that was definitely the smooth jazz of heavy metal.

Speaker 4:          01:05:00       It was a, I don't know, it's just fucking embarrassing. Really embarrassing. I think eighties music really gets a bad rap when you start listening to, uh, I dunno. I Dunno what the fuck up. I just literally asked you for advice then and then I bought a couple albums. All right. Actually, literally still by him too, by the way. Bought a couple of cds and didn't even listen to them yet. And now I'm already trying to tell you guys what's good music from the 80s CDC, the fucking most of the Inner Mussolini. It's fucking me. I Dunno. I'm not. All right. Um, let's get to underrated overrated here or what? You guys want to hear a story about revenge. Huh? I like how I asked you guys questions. You know, it's like you actually have a say and as you sit there and nod your head and your cubicle, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:05:48       You know, a pump your fist on your fucking treadmill, you know, or just say yes out loud, loud, loud in your middle seat on that Delta Airlines flight you on Delta Airlines right now. Is there somebody with bad breath eating pistachios next to you ever tell you that fucking story? Unreal. And he's eating the red ones too. That made his lips all fucking pink by the end of it. Horrific. Horrific flight. All right, let's get to the revenge. When the fuck is it? COSI generation. I'm really disorganized this week. Okay. Because I have guests. I have, I'm entertaining this week. All right. And wearing a Tuxedo for three days. Underrated. Overrated, underrated. Overrated with fuck is the revenge story.

Speaker 4:          01:06:37       God dammit. Oh, this isn't terracing. I don't want to just read it. I'm just going to start. I'm just going to jump around. I'm just going to jump around. Who's at House of pain? Um, no. Well fuck. Oh fuck you. I don't know who it was. I tapped out during that Perry to write movie review bill. I just got back from the midnight showing of the watchman. I really don't know how to review it. I'm told it sticks pretty close to the graphic novel and had cool special effects, great story and good acting. But I kind of felt eh after it, after leaving the dark night, I remember I was so amazed. I didn't have a single thought run through my head for at least five minutes after ironman and hulk. I left feeling satisfaction. But with this movie, something just kind of left me feeling depressed after watching and I think it was the overall message of the movie was serious told in a totally ridiculous way.

Speaker 4:          01:07:27       Anyway. Anyway, I would recommend it. But go with caution. If you don't like comic books and have trouble following fragmented, fragmented storylines like Tarantino movies, I wouldn't go. You know, it's said God damn good review. Got Right to the fucking meat and potatoes of it. Oh, and by the way, he says it was directed by the guy who did the 300 story, 300 movies. So there's a lot of man ass in it. Yeah, I find that funny. That guys really liked that. Uh, that movie 300. I mean, I thought it was pretty ridiculous, but um, the amount of guys that get pumped after they see that, I mean, that literally was playgirl the movie. I thought, um, I just thought, don't think ms stupid. They, you can turn this spot. Ah. All right, good luck with the, um, you know what that's like. That's like Beyonce, my girlfriend downloaded that fucking album. The name of the album is I am dot, dot, dot, dot. Sasha fierce. All right, Beyonce. Well, good luck with that character. He kind of still sounded like Beyonce. If you ask me. Beautiful, gorgeous woman, woman really can dance. But her voice, oof. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 5:          01:08:47       Yeah. Yay.

Speaker 4:          01:08:51       Horrible punishing you. Just fucking Polish into her. Best thing was when she whipped her head around and fell down on the stage. That was probably one of the greatest things I think I've ever seen. And a lot of it's just bitterness. She's just absolutely gorgeous. You know, she's totally out of your league. And is there anything funnier than seeing a beautiful girl just fucking fall right on her ass? You know, this is ridiculous and I'm sure she's a nice fucking person, but you know, I should really, reality is, I'm kinda thinking like, this is Jay z, his fucking wife. And uh, then he stabbed somebody one time for something, although he did it in a hacky way. He walked up and he used the Godfather, the line. He said, you broke my heart and then stabbed him. That's all alleged. Why don't I shut the fuck up?

Speaker 4:          01:09:35       Okay, I will. All right, here's a revenge story. Bill. I'm not really into revenge, but if someone fucks with me to the point where I think about pushing them off a cliff, then yeah, I kind of feel like I have to do something. So here's my story. Oh, this is a good one. Settle in for this one. If you're at home, get underneath your ass can and roast some fucking marshmallows because this is like a, this is the closest thing to what go story. Um, this is just has that evil fucking, uh, last house on the left Vibe, um, which I loved that they're making. Again, cause that reference will finally make sense to people. Um, if you don't know what that is, there was John Rose films in the 70s, w which were basically rate movies. Last House on the left gator Bait. Fucking, uh, I spit on your grave and evidently they're going to make a comeback, which I think is fucking hilarious, you know, you know, we haven't had a good rate movie in awhile. All right. Um, let's remake last house on the left.

Speaker 4:          01:10:37       I think that that needs to be updated. All right. Anyways, Bill, I had a girlfriend for about three years. This is the revenge story. Bill. I had a girlfriend for about three years who ended up cheating on me when I found, and when I found out about it, I called her out on it and she got defenses and turned on me, blah, blah, blah. Wow, dude, that's, that's some pretty, uh, she's got skills. If she was able to do that, uh, you cheated on me. You fucking bitch. Yeah. Well you never do the dishes. Okay. I'm sorry. I guess you made a good point. How the fuck did she turn on you? Unless you, all right bill, just shut up and read the story. Okay. I will. So anyway, she turned on me. Um, then he goes, I made the poor decision and took her back about a year later, about a year later, she cheated on me again and I told her to go fuck herself prior to the second cheating, I bought a trip to Disney world for us.

Speaker 4:          01:11:36       And about eight months after we broke up, it was time for the, for the Disney world trip. So I asked her if she wanted to go see, she said yes and off we went. Now my revenge kicks in. See, this is just like one of those movies starts off all nice and sunny. We'll go into the camp and going to Disneyland and here comes fucking Jason on a crystal lake. Um, so now my revenge kicks in. All of the degrading things I've ever wanted to do. This chick I did to this one. Okay. And I have guests, so I get a mumble. This shit I busted on her face. I pounded her into the ass until she puked Jesus Christ. Women are just literally ripping their headsets off right now. Anyways, he goes, it was fantastic. On the fourth night we had an argument, she told me that she wanted to go on this trip to try and win me back cause she felt bad for all the things she had done to me. Basically she was apologizing for cheating when I told her that there was no chance of us getting back together. And the only reason why I fucked her was to make her feel like a prostitute.

Speaker 4:          01:12:51       She bought a plane ticket home and I felt wonderful. I guess what I'm trying to say is some people deserve what they get. Oh God, what a great, great story. Um, there's so many levels to that. Okay. First of all, just the fucking, the fact that she cheated on you and you took her back, he just liked dineros character and casino, you know what I mean? You didn't know how to handle it. And then she cheats on you second time and then you just become jaded and you just go into like a, it was like, you know those movies where the guy, you know, the, the week person's just getting the shit kicked out of 'em and then finally they just can't fucking take it anymore. And then all of a sudden they turned into like fucking like Clint Eastwood character. You actually did that with this girl.

Speaker 4:          01:13:39       And then the whole other level that I love, okay. Is that now that you've finally pound in this skank in bed the way she always wanted to, probably the reason she cheated on you. You know, cause you probably will do in the, I love you kind of sex now. You actually fucking do what you was supposed to be doing with this girl. Now she wants to get back with you. Fuck that. She didn't go to Disneyland because she wanted to get back with you. She went to Disneyland because she's a fucking cunt who saw a free tip to fucking Florida and she thought she was going to play you again and get more shit out of you. Then all of a sudden you come in there and you throw down like Johnny fucking Wad and now all of a sudden that then, then she wanted to get back with you and then you told him to go fuck herself.

Speaker 4:          01:14:27       Which was perfect because I thought you were going to crumble in that moment and you didn't, you know, and then she fucking left and then that's great. And then you laughed your ass off and jumped on the tea cups listening to, it's a small world after all, you know, that's fucking great. Four stars. If you fucking film that, I would, not only would I go see it, I would buy it on DVD. Great fucking story of revenge. Um, all right. And we go, oh, we had a lot of passion in it, Huh? Oh, we're, are we up to 34 minutes? All right, let's hustle through this. All right. Overrated. Overrated. Underrated list for the week. Overrated. High priced Mexican foods. You can get the same shit for half the price across the street. You know, some shit is written so perfectly, I don't even need to add to it.

Speaker 4:          01:15:15       Exactly. 100% correct. I still had to add to it. Alright. Underrated. Fake boobs. Fucking awesome. Um, I like how that's written so short and it's just up to me to draw my own collusion, my own conclusions. Fake boobs. Fucking awesome. Um, have you ever touched him? The fucking horrific. Um, personally I guess I hate fake boobs are the worst. Uh, don't ever do that. I don't ever do that. Then all of a sudden in a matter how good they are, it's like you're having sex with a fucking cyborg. I, one of those awful Bruce Willis movies. Remember those are judge dread. You know those movies where you know, they always, they always ended up hooking up with some half person, half robot. That's what I feel about that stuff. And I really don't understand why people get face lifts and stuff, you know, first of all it doesn't look good and everybody noticed even if even if you didn't notice for some reason when you get your face lift, it also becomes really shiny.

Speaker 4:          01:16:16       Can anybody explain what that is? Is that the Botox? What is it about getting faceless that makes you face so fucking shiny and it literally looks like laminated? Um, now you know what it looks like. It looks like the apples and the grocery store that they spray to make them really, really shiny. Speaking to which you ever get an organic apple. I mean it's like so natural. There's like a fucking warm in it. I like the, I think I like the old shiny ones. Um, all right, Phil Love U podcast. Just wanted to say, I think using, I like this one too. A bill. I just want to say, I think using big words is overrated. If you can express something by saying a simple, normal word, why use a big word? I just broke up with my girlfriend today and earlier she had called me anthro, anthro phobic because I don't even know what the fuck that means because I don't like, cause I don't like her friends.

Speaker 4:          01:17:12       She called me anthro cause I don't like her friends. Um, I just don't like most of her friends. It doesn't mean I hate people in general or even hate or friends. I honestly didn't know what it meant. So I looked it up. It means a fear of people, which isn't even what she said. You're right. She didn't even use it correctly or actually what she or she has a delusional view of her friends that her friends represent everybody or that her friends are so great that if you don't like them, then you just hate all people because her friends represent humanity. Jesus. Good movement. Dumping that fucking stuck up Twat. Um, anyways, I definitely do not like a lot of people, but I don't hate people unlike that call last week. Who messed with that guy's mom? Mom's car. Yeah. That guy was fucking nuts. Anyways, it seems like a, you're kind of the same way.

Speaker 4:          01:18:05       I just don't see the point of using big words other than trying to sound smart. It's like if something can be said more easily and in a way that's easily more easily understood by using smaller wood, words can't even fucking read. Especially if you have an idiot like me reading it. Keep the word small. Would you say something like that serial killer was, I can't even, I don't know what this word is. Dak Know Adac no maniac. Or that Lee was obsessed with killing. I don't think you'd say either. I think you just say that guy's a serial killer. I mean, I think we know what serial killers do. I know what you mean. Do I know what you mean by this is what I think. I think, I think big words, uh, they're, they're much better in print. You know what I mean? Cause you don't want to read, you know, a great novel and just have someone like, dude, shit was fucked up.

Speaker 4:          01:18:57       You know, I was like, damn, I mean I wouldn't want to read like I, I don't, I don't mind. I don't mind big words, but I mean they have to be coming out of the right person's mouth. In fact, I kind of liked them on some level when, um, you know, but person use a big word and it makes me want to read and they're actually using it in an obnoxious way and they've earned the right to use it that way because they actually do read and don't watch TV. But yeah, if it's just some chick you were dating who has cunty friends and they watch the Osi every Thursday night and then she pulls out a word like that. Um, that sounds like that, that was a breakup word. She was like, I'm going to use a big word here so I can feel like I'm above this guy who's dumping me because my low self esteem is, is, is gonna fucking flow right over the side. And I'm going to break down and I'm going to start crying and I'm going to have a snot bubble and I'm going to feel horrible. And I know in six months I'm going to realize this person isn't worth crying about. So I'm going to use a fucking big word here to try to save myself.

Speaker 4:          01:20:04       I really forgot what I was saying halfway through that. That's weird. I actually agree with that guy. And then in that scenario, I just sorta trashed him like saying he wasn't working, he was wasn't worth crying over. You know what? I don't know shit about either one of you, but, uh, you wrote me the letter, so I'm going to fucking side with you. I'm trying to be more balanced because I trashed chicks twice in this. Uh, all right. Hey Bill, I've been a big fan of yours since I saw your European friends, Sam, as in his hand. I was wondering, when are you gonna come to the punchline in Atlanta? Well, why don't you go on my fucking website and scroll down and look for punchline in Atlanta? That's usually a good way to find out. When I'm at the punchline in Atlanta, I'm there in June.

Speaker 4:          01:20:46       Why do I put my dates up? You know, you know why? Because 90% of you actually read the calendar and this fucking guy is not going to listen to this podcast. And he's going to email me again this week and you know what? I'm actually going to send them an email because I'm a whore. It'll tell me exact dates and put a link on it. So I'm just going to shut up. Um, anyways. Um, all your shit is lit up, man. So, um, anyway, overrated, underrated, overrated. Having kids. Marriage is bad enough, but for the life of me, I can't understand why the fuck anyone would ever want to have kids. Your life effectively ends when you have kids. Everything you do has to be for them. How fucking pathetic is your life that you have, um, that you decide, you know, what would be fun? Never having any fun anymore. I can't wait to clean shit out of some douchebag. Infants, Asshole, Jesus Christ. Only get four hours of sleep at night. If I'm lucky and never have any fucking fun with my friends ever again. I mean Jesus fucking Christ. Are you kidding me? Um, underrated. This is the same guy maker's mark whiskey.

Speaker 4:          01:21:57       Let me guess what you talk about after you've had a couple of belts from that. Anyways, he says, this shit is all I drink and it's fucking spectacular. Under 40 bucks a handle, 80 proof and smoother than James fucking bond. Uh, this guy's great. This guy is like the guy's guy and he's the guy. You know what I love about this dude? This is the kind of guy when you're in a bar and you know you're fucking up your life, which is why you go to the bar and you start drinking, and this is the guy who's going to tell you when you should face that everything you're doing is exactly right. He's the guy who comes up. What's the matter man? I don't know man. I blew with this chick and he's the guy that you blue with this chick. What the fuck is, well, you don't want to be with some fucking Broadway you out of your funk.

Speaker 4:          01:22:42       And he just builds you up and then you get him. Or did you get a Dui? And then they take your shoe laces and then you curl up on that burlap sack they use for a blanket and you wait for your dad to come down and pick you up. You know? But in that moment, before all that shit happens, it's, this guy's the shit. Um, do you know what it is? I think as you get older yet, like me, I, I'm starting to really feel like I want to have a kid now because it gets pathetic after awhile, you know? I Dunno. I Dunno if it's, it's the, the magnetic pull of the herd, you know what I mean? Everything has like a gravity to it and I think they, as much as you tried to fucking escape the orbit of the fucking heard, you get pulled back into it.

Speaker 4:          01:23:25       And, uh, I dunno. Sometimes I feel like I'm having too much fun. Like, as a 40 year old guy and I'm sitting there, you know, learning how to play good times, bad times, and I got the NHL package and when I'm not watching TV, I'm learning how to play ACDC songs. So when I'm not doing that, I'm fucking telling jokes on stage. It just gets to the point you like going like you start feeling guilty, you know, I ain't guilty, but you just started looking like, you know what, I need to fucking teach someone else how to do their life like this. You know, I got to admit I am a miserable motherfucker, but I am having, I'm having a great time and you can have it too if you learn how to talk about your Dick on stage. All right, last thing, Bill, you started talking about the police last week and it got me thinking about them.

Speaker 4:          01:24:17       Uh, the band, the police, all this. When I was talking about all the, uh, all the music that I missed out on the police will, one of the few that I listened to. Um, anyways, you started talking about them. And so it pulled me out, made me pull out some of my old records and I started listening to them. Um, and his underrated for the week. As he said, sting is a very underrated bass player. Most of the baselines he plays are amazing. I know most people think of him for his solo work and all the crappy new age stuff he does, but when he was with the police, um, he could rock a base like no other. Uh, yeah, I've gotta admit. Yeah, he's fucking, um, I would definitely, I don't know if he is underrated now with musicians. He isn't, but I think with people he's underrated because a lot of people feel that, yeah, a lot of his solo stuff is cheesy.

Speaker 4:          01:25:05       And meanwhile he's playing with some of the bet like Vinny, Kali Uda in all these fucking guys. And then I make God at songs like really laying that that field is a gold song, whichever it was like people think is like, elevator music has him on base. And I think Vinny call Udas actually playing on drums. Um, all right. I'm a music nerd. All right. And, uh, and that's it. It's kind of clock out here and I have to go, uh, I got to go do some touristy shit. So, uh, you guys, I really want to thank you for continuing to write in the questions, the underrated overrated. You guys. You know, it's funny, you guys are getting so good at this shit that, uh, the podcast, I think it becoming better. I'm actually reading out loud and much better way you guys actually using punctuation and I, you telling me some great stories.

Speaker 4:          01:25:51       I'm loving the stories about revenge. Um, and if you just want to comment on revenge in general, cause, um, I, you know, I dunno. Revenge really. Uh, that's a line that I, I, I've never, I just don't care. I just don't cross that. I just, I feel like that is the deepest, darkest part of your soul that you can go into. You know, you're fucking, uh, you know what you like. You like Jimmy Smits on Dexter. Do you guys watch desks, Dexter this season? I'm gonna recommend a couple of shows Dexter I liked, but, uh, you gotta watch brotherhood, showtime on demand. You have to watch that fucking show. And uh, it's just an unbelievable show and is actually, there's a, there's a couple of guys first season and Co Comedian Tony v that I, that I learned so much from. And another guy, I actually started out with, uh, Kevin Chapman who plays Freddy Cork, who's one of my favorite characters on that, on television right now.

Speaker 4:          01:26:54       Um, I don't know if you just did to Gangsta fucking shows. It's the shit. It's a great fucking show brotherhood. Um, I'm sure you can rent the first DVD some even if you, even if you buy it, no, don't buy it because maybe you don't like it, then you're stuck with it. Then I get to listen to you to be a contact, but fucking, uh, go rented somewhere. I'm telling you it's a great show and I'm also into breaking bad. Those are my three shows. Other than that, I just watch sports and, uh, and that is it. All right. This really tapered off in the end. I hope you guys enjoyed it. You guys have a great week and, uh, keep everything calm and, and I'll keep doing the podcast. I'll talk to you next week. Please come out and see me, uh, this Monday night, this coming up Monday the 16th at the punchline in San Francisco, or I'll come and see me in Saint Louis at the house of comedy in East Saint Louis. All right. I got a brand new hour and a, I got a new chunk of Shit I'm working on. All right. That's it. Take it easy.
