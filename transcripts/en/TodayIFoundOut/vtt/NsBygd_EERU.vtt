00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.340
Why Does the Moon Look Bigger on the Horizon?

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.100
The question of why the Moon looks bigger
on the horizon than when it’s high in the

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.130
sky has been debated for several thousand
years.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.230
One popular myth, dating all the way back
to Aristotle in the fourth century BC and

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.780
which still endures somewhat today, is that
it is simply a case of magnification caused

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.470
by the Earth’s atmosphere.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.280
While a “magnification” effect is taking
place, it actually is going the other way

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.320
and is more of a compression.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.470
Atmospheric refraction causes the Moon to
appear slightly smaller in the vertical axis

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.070
when it is near the horizon vs. when it is
high in the sky.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.069
This refraction, combined with the fact that
the Moon is about 4,000 miles farther away

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:41.449
when it is on the horizon, causes it to appear
1.5% smaller, if you were to measure very

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.749
precisely its apparent size on the horizon
vs. higher in the sky.

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.620
So if it’s not magnification from the Earth’s
atmosphere, what is going on here?

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.510
In short, the Moon appearing bigger near the
horizon is nothing more than an optical illusion.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.909
It’s really as simple as that.

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.249
You can verify this fact by taking a pair
of calipers, or even just a ruler, and measure

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:05.630
the diameter of the Moon on the horizon; later
that night, when it is higher in the sky,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.630
measure it again.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.170
(Be sure and hold the measuring device at
the same distance away from your eyes each

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.280
time to get accurate results.)

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.789
If you do it precisely enough, you’ll find
that it actually will measure about the same

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.890
size both times, despite appearing nearly
twice as big to your brain when it is on the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.100
horizon.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.250
Exactly what is going on in our brains to
cause this optical illusion is still somewhat

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.479
up for debate, but it seems to center around
size consistency, where our brains are trying

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.560
to grapple with the size of an object vs.
how far away it thinks it is.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.469
For instance, when you see people very far
away from you and their heads look incredibly

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.729
tiny, your brain doesn’t think for an instant
that the people and their heads are actually

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:43.729
tiny.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.219
Your brain adjusts your perception based on
what else is in your vision to gather that

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.149
third dimension of depth.

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.479
Something of this same effect is thought to
be happening with the Moon, only this time

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.000
your brain is getting tricked into thinking
that the Moon is farther away when it is on

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.749
the horizon, making it appear bigger to you.

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:04.140
This is known as a Ponzo Illusion, named after
Italian psychologist Mario Ponzo.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.190
Mario Ponzo first demonstrated the “Ponzo
Illusion” in 1913.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.170
In this experiment, Ponzo drew two converging
vertical lines on a piece of paper.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.180
He then drew two horizontal lines crossing
these lines, one at the top, and one at the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.180
bottom.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.410
These two horizontal lines are the same length,
but it appears that the one at the top is

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.180
much longer because it looks farther away.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.630
(See image in the show notes)
This is due to our brains interpreting the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.130
two converging lines as parallel lines that
only appear to be converging because they

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.560
are getting farther away.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.570
Thus, if both horizontal lines are making
the same length “imprint” on our eyes,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.610
but one is farther away, then the one that
is farther away must be much larger, so our

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.380
brains perceive it as larger than it actually
is.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.620
So, in the end, it’s a matter of our brain’s
getting tricked in terms of the distance from

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.230
the Moon to us when it’s on the horizon
vs. high in the sky.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.680
When it’s on the horizon, the brain has
reference points to compare and judge the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.440
distance, and similarly adjust the apparent
size based on that perceived distance.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.330
When it is high in the sky, there is nothing
useful to compare it to, so the apparent size

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.310
changes based on how far away our brain thinks
it is at that point, namely, thinking that

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:21.570
it is closer to us high in the sky and farther
away on 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.980
the horizon.
