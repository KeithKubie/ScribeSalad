00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.340
It could seem like a strange topic to be discussing.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.000
It doesn't come up much in polite company.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.940
Yet, we know that as many as 35% of U.S. and U.K. males under 50

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.600
will be struggling with it to a degree they themselves find somewhat dispiriting in their reflexive moments.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.280
In it's most extreme form: using up hour after hour,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.940
it starts to sap relationships, motivation, and sheer well-being.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.560
The first move is to insist that the problem is neither ridiculous nor unfathomable.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.760
It starts with a simple design flaw in our brains,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.900
brains that evolved to respond powerful to stimuli like, sexual attraction or sugar,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.740
in conditions where these were very scarce indeed.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.380
These brains just never acquired a capacity for self-control

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.600
commensurate with the temptations offered by the modern, technologically enhanced world.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.940
Levels of discipline that, were at one point, entirely adequate to deal with sexual opportunities

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.960
in the small villages of the east African grasslands,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.660
just can't cope with galleries filled with images of millions of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.880
highly fertile, well proportioned, digitized, naked people.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.200
Why ever do anything other than look?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.580
The problem of porn is identical with that of food:

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.500
brains that were geared to take quick advantage of the occasional presence of a few berries

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.180
are now defenseless before the vats of artificial sweeteners

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.320
turned out by our remorseless technologies.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.420
People don't spend hours looking at pornography on the screen because they are bad,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.700
but because the porn is so very good,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.560
that is, devilishly well adapted to breaking down all arguments against it.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.140
Crucially, in all cases of addiction, it's never that we're simply greedy, or lusty, or depraved;

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.140
the real reason is always more poignant and more worthy of sympathy:

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.440
we get addicted because we're sad.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.100
The business of living is so desperately hard:

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.780
relationships are so challenging, work often so unfulfilling or boring,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.840
family dynamics so tricky, and the capacity for honest, kindly conversation so restricted,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.500
we may, through no particular fault of our own, fall into despondency

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.300
of a kind that leaves us extremely vulnerable to the sudden intense highs

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.720
offered by short films about lesbians trying anal,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.740
or plate after plate of iced buns.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.320
What we call addiction, invariably, has the same structure:

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:30.180
a difficult life, plus a very intense diversionary pleasure, plus a technologically induced way of increasing that pleasure

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.640
to a pitch which breaks our minds natural muscles of self-control.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.000
The cause of porn addiction isn't, therefore, porn.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.140
It's careers that are fraught, and relationships where we can't get our point across,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.440
and essays that are devilishly tricky to author.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.060
The real cure to addiction is, hence, simple in structure:

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.560
to find something nicer to pursue than the thing we're addicted to.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.900
But of course, that's going to be very hard, for comparable highs are not widely to hand.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.680
Yet, a chief and immediate enemy is shame,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.380
which reinforces the feeling of low self worth and helps inspire the addiction in the first place.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.220
It's therefore helpful to insist on a few points:

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.000
that addiction is normal,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.260
that it's not our fault, it's that of a brain that wasn't made to cope with the temptations before us,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.580
that there's no need for self disgust; the addicted are almost in the majority, though we'd never know it,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.500
that we should draw courage from the confessions of others,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.220
that we should acknowledge the sadness in our lives, that we should interpret it with the necessary dignity,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.940
that we should hold the pain and incompleteness in mind without fleeing it,

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.860
that we should use it to power something more relevant to our talents, reroute your manic energy,

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.120
try to heal someone else's pain, swap this addiction for another, slightly less fruitless one,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.520
become compulsive elsewhere.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.080
And then, a banal, but critical point:

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.880
we should try never to be left alone with a computer when we are in a vulnerable state.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.420
Let the rational parts of our structure life so that we'll be less at risk in moments of sadness.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.280
It's simply the ultimate cruelties that the machine we do all our work on

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.880
also happens to host the  magic door to a play land more phantasmagorical

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.020
than anything the Marquis de Sade could have dreamt up.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:23.420
Secular, modern people often automatically assume that sexuality can't exert a momentous power over our minds.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.720
They're being too sanguine, and therefore unwittingly, rather mean.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:35.060
Online porn has an unparalleled power to get in the way of almost every other rather important and precious thing around,

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.520
starting with the rest of our lives.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.900
We should forgive ourselves for being so drawn to these intense, often rather harmful highs

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.120
in a world that's mostly grey and arduous.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.880
Then, with all the will we can muster, we should try to switch off.
