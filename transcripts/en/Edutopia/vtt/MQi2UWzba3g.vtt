00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:07.256
&gt;&gt;Michael: Is there more than one
way to figure out how big an acre is?

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.125
&gt;&gt;Students: Yes.

00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:09.816
&gt;&gt;Michael: Could it be two feet wide?

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:10.306
&gt;&gt;Student: Uh-huh.

00:00:10.336 --> 00:00:11.976
&gt;&gt;Michael: Right, it's going
to be really long, right.

00:00:13.156 --> 00:00:17.246
&gt;&gt;Brent: What works for student learning
is engaging kids with their environment.

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:19.606
It could be about the local culture.

00:00:19.606 --> 00:00:21.186
It could be about the local history.

00:00:21.456 --> 00:00:23.216
It could be so many different things.

00:00:23.216 --> 00:00:26.816
But finding that inspiration
in your community is key.

00:00:26.816 --> 00:00:30.926
When kids are engaged with
a curriculum, they learn it.

00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:32.696
&gt;&gt;Michael: Any questions?

00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:32.999
&gt;&gt;Students: No.

00:00:33.296 --> 00:00:33.586
&gt;&gt;Michael: All right,
make it so, do it up.

00:00:37.596 --> 00:00:42.236
&gt;&gt;Brent: What place based education
does is connecting learning

00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:44.296
to your own environment.

00:00:45.876 --> 00:00:48.656
Your own environment can
look many different ways.

00:00:48.656 --> 00:00:50.086
It can be an urban environment.

00:00:50.086 --> 00:00:51.786
It could be suburban, it could be rural.

00:00:51.786 --> 00:00:53.866
&gt;&gt;Laura: It can be the
buildings of the place.

00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:55.726
It can be the landscape of this place.

00:00:55.726 --> 00:00:57.956
It can be the stories of the place.

00:00:59.546 --> 00:01:01.866
&gt;&gt;Sarah: This year is Hood River
County school district's one hundred

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:02.956
and fiftieth anniversary.

00:01:03.106 --> 00:01:07.666
And we decided that since our building
is one of the most historic buildings

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.376
in the district, and we have some space,

00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:13.616
we decided to take the old ticket
office and turn it into a museum.

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:23.676
&gt;&gt;Emma: It is really cool to
learn about Hood River and Oregon.

00:01:23.676 --> 00:01:26.736
We started by making a
timeline and it's going to wrap

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:29.616
around the perimeter of the museum.

00:01:29.616 --> 00:01:32.836
And then there's also going to be some
major events that happen in the world.

00:01:32.836 --> 00:01:33.946
&gt;&gt;Sarah: We're going to have a
lot of World War Two things here.

00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:39.556
&gt;&gt;I'm going to say somewhere
in that corner over there.

00:01:39.556 --> 00:01:40.426
&gt;&gt;Emma: We took a field trip.

00:01:40.426 --> 00:01:45.056
We walked downtown and Miss Segal gave
us pieces of paper that had pictures

00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:48.486
on them of what the downtown
looked like back then.

00:01:48.586 --> 00:01:52.996
And we had to find where the locations
were and then look at how it looked now.

00:01:53.436 --> 00:01:56.586
It was a lot more interesting to learn
about and you really want to know,

00:01:56.696 --> 00:01:58.256
because you can relate to it.

00:01:58.656 --> 00:02:00.196
&gt;&gt;Sarah: What do I hope
the kids get out of it?

00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:02.996
That they get to better
know their community,

00:02:02.996 --> 00:02:06.166
and they have a pride in their space.

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:10.466
&gt;&gt;Laura: Here in Hood River, we
live in this very unique landscape.

00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:11.706
The Columbia River Gorge.

00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:14.976
So that was a really obvious place to
start when we're talking about geology.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:18.536
&gt;&gt;Student: How many layers are there?

00:02:18.536 --> 00:02:18.926
&gt;&gt;Student: Three.

00:02:19.116 --> 00:02:21.966
&gt;&gt;Laura: There's been seven catastrophic
events that have created this landscape.

00:02:22.636 --> 00:02:26.836
And so you can talk about volcanoes,
you can talk about lava flows.

00:02:26.836 --> 00:02:28.306
You can talk about earthquakes.

00:02:28.306 --> 00:02:31.936
You can see the different layers of
rocks and the geologic history of time.

00:02:35.046 --> 00:02:36.096
&gt;&gt;Lauren: When we're
done with this model,

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:37.576
it will display what
the gorge looks like

00:02:37.576 --> 00:02:40.976
and how landslides have
been carving the gorge.

00:02:41.486 --> 00:02:45.036
So the first layer, which is the
clay, is the Ohanapecosh layer.

00:02:45.576 --> 00:02:49.676
The second layer is the Eagle Creek
formation, which is mainly soil.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:56.656
And the third layer, a salt
layer, is made up of larger rocks.

00:02:59.816 --> 00:03:03.566
If you walk on some of the trails,
like Wahclella Falls, which we visited,

00:03:04.206 --> 00:03:08.676
you can actually see where
the landslides could occur.

00:03:08.676 --> 00:03:13.496
When landslides happen, it's
because of water weathering down.

00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:18.176
Those three layers get really
moist and eventually erode.

00:03:19.956 --> 00:03:23.196
So now we'll model an example
of a landslide when it rains.

00:03:23.196 --> 00:03:29.386
As you can see, the soil gets brought
down and sometimes the small rocks do

00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:31.966
as well, which leaves
the Ohanapecosh bare.

00:03:34.206 --> 00:03:34.786
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay.

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:36.786
&gt;&gt;Lauren: Sweet, it worked.

00:03:37.046 --> 00:03:38.536
&gt;&gt;Laura: My hope for my students
when they leave my class is

00:03:38.636 --> 00:03:41.856
that they can be stewards of
the world that they live in.

00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:45.826
Place based education is
also skills that you can use

00:03:45.896 --> 00:03:48.936
to understand the community
that you're living in.

00:03:50.356 --> 00:03:52.536
&gt;&gt;Michael: Being able to
understand how you fit

00:03:52.536 --> 00:03:57.056
into a system is a really important part
of middle school and we try really hard

00:03:57.056 --> 00:04:00.106
to be able to get kids to
understand, what's their role

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:00.976
and what's going on around them.

00:04:01.046 --> 00:04:03.326
&gt;&gt;Michael: Into that area,
because that's what one acre is.

00:04:03.496 --> 00:04:04.876
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, that makes sense.

00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:06.936
&gt;&gt;Michael: We are in the
process of studying fire ecology.

00:04:06.936 --> 00:04:09.066
There's a lot of fires
that happen in our area,

00:04:09.066 --> 00:04:11.026
and we know that the reporting unit

00:04:11.026 --> 00:04:13.886
that they give us how big a
fire is, is often in acres.

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:18.556
We've also been studying algebra and
so we're using a one step equation here

00:04:18.556 --> 00:04:21.586
to be able to physically pace it
out and put it onto the ground,

00:04:21.586 --> 00:04:24.976
so they can start having a gut
understanding of what an acre really is.

00:04:26.046 --> 00:04:29.136
&gt;&gt;Okay, so get your calculators
out, figure out your pace.

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:31.936
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, do a hundred
divided by forty-five paces.

00:04:32.046 --> 00:04:35.666
&gt;&gt;Michael: The whole idea was, let's
do things that put math in context

00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:38.626
and let's create problems
that the kids want to solve

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:41.976
and then give them the tools
math wise to be able to do that.

00:04:43.056 --> 00:04:44.196
&gt;&gt;Student: And then walk
that way two hundred steps.

00:04:44.196 --> 00:04:45.176
&gt;&gt;Student: How many steps?

00:04:45.226 --> 00:04:46.626
&gt;&gt;Student: Two hundred, because
we did four hundred feet.

00:04:46.796 --> 00:04:47.696
&gt;&gt;Student: One, two...

00:04:49.046 --> 00:04:52.336
&gt;&gt;Brent: I think what works for
student learning is engaging kids

00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:58.426
with their environment and how you
define that environment is really

00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:01.366
up to the kids, the community
and the teacher.

00:05:01.976 --> 00:05:06.456
All of us need to feel like
we're connected to something.

00:05:07.826 --> 00:05:12.926
Place based learning provides
kids with that home base,

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:14.736
and now they can start exploring.

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:18.836
&gt;&gt;Student: Thirty, thirty-one,
thirty-two...
