 RAISE RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU 
ARE BILINGUAL.  SO, OY 

00:04:38.074 --> 00:04:40.074
VAMOS.  [SPEAKING

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:50.606
 SPANISH].  I AM GOING TO TALK 
ABOUT HOW IS IT THAT I CREATED 

00:04:50.607 --> 00:04:52.607
SOME BOOK

00:04:55.257 --> 00:04:57.570
 "OLINGUITO FROM A TO Z" 
UNVEILING THE CLOUD FOR IT.  BUT

00:04:57.944 --> 00:05:00.232
 YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'RE GOING TO 
START FROM THE START.  DO YOU 

00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:04.012
KNOW WHAT IS THE VERY FIRST 
THING THAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO 

00:05:04.842 --> 00:05:11.505
WRITE A BOOK?  IT'S NOT PEN AND 
PAPER.  NO THINGS THAT YOU CAN 

00:05:11.793 --> 00:05:15.264
TOUCH.  IT IS SOMETHING THAT 
COMES FROM HERE.  WHAT IS IT?  I

00:05:15.378 --> 00:05:24.941
 WANT A HAND.  JUST A HAND.  
WHAT IS IT?  WHAT IS IT?  YES?  

00:05:24.942 --> 00:05:31.440
AN IDEA.  THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE
 NEED.  BEHIND EVERY SINGLE BOOK

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:37.070
 IN THIS AMAZING LIBRARY.  
[SPEAKING

00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:45.638
 SPANISH].  AND THIS IS MY IDEA

00:05:49.285 --> 00:05:55.889
 BEHIND THIS BOOK.  I WANTED TO 
CREATE A BOOK WITH A SPANISH 

00:05:56.023 --> 00:05:58.023
ALPHABET.  [SPEAKING

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:13.406
SPANISH].  I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO 
GO ABOUT IT.  SO ONE DAY, I

00:06:17.088 --> 00:06:22.401
 OPENED THE NEWSPAPER, THE 
WASHINGTON POST BY THE WAY.  

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:28.897
[SPEAKING SPANISH].  I FOUND AN 
ARTICLE.  AND THIS ARTICLE 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.457
TALKED ABOUT THIS AMAZING ANIMAL
 CALLED 

00:06:38.622 --> 00:06:41.754
OLINGUITO.  CAN YOU REPEAT THAT 
WITH ME?  

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:48.637
OLINGUITO.
FABULOUS.  OLINGUITO.  SO I READ

00:06:48.828 --> 00:06:51.383
 ABOUT THIS ANIMAL.  AND I SAID

00:06:54.593 --> 00:07:00.095
 OH, OLINGUITO, I HAVE MY OWN.  
BUT THEN I NEEDED TO FIND ALL OF

00:07:00.396 --> 00:07:07.636
 THE OTHER LETTERS ARE FROM THE 
SPANISH ALPHABET.  I NEEDED TO 

00:07:07.916 --> 00:07:16.958
FIND ALL THE ANIMALS OR AMAZING 
ANIMALS AND PLANTS THAT

00:07:18.464 --> 00:07:22.672
 CO-EXIST WITH OLINGUITO IN THE 
CLOUD FOREST OF ECUADOR.  THAT 

00:07:22.673 --> 00:07:25.833
TOOK ME A LONG TIME.  AND BEFORE
 I TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT, AND I 

00:07:25.834 --> 00:07:31.982
READ YOU THE BOOK, I WANT TO 
TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE 

00:07:31.983 --> 00:07:35.428
OLINGUITO AND ABOUT THE CLOUD 
FOR IT.  

00:07:35.429 --> 00:07:41.513
THE OLINGUITO IS A SMALL SOFT 
ANIMAL AND THEY SAY IT HAS THE 

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:47.572
FACE OF A TEDDY BEAR AND THE 
TAIL OF A CAT.  IT IS VERY, VERY

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:55.230
 SMALL.  ACTUALLY THIS IS THE 
EXACT SIZE.  VERY SMALL.  AND IT

00:07:55.528 --> 00:08:02.152
 LIVES IN THE CLOUD FOREST OF 
ECUADOR.  IT'S AN NOCTURNAL 

00:08:02.643 --> 00:08:07.258
ANIMAL.  DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHAT 
NOCTURNAL MEANS?  HANDS.  LET'S 

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:13.648
SEE.  LET'S SEE.  OVER THERE.  
NOCTURNAL NOCTURNAL, WHAT DOES 

00:08:13.649 --> 00:08:15.649
THAT 

00:08:34.332 --> 00:08:42.567
MEAN? 
ANIMAL NOCTURNAL.  YES,MEAN? 

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.310
ANIMAL NOCTURNAL.  YES, 
NOCTURNAL MEANS -- [SPEAKING

00:08:34.579 --> 00:08:39.841
 SPANISH].  A NOCTURNAL ANIMAL, 

00:08:47.282 --> 00:08:49.282
DOES IT COME AROUND DAY TO DAY. 

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:56.923
 NOCTURNAL, IT COMES AROUND AT 
NIGHT.  IT LIVES IN THE CANOPY 

00:08:57.509 --> 00:09:01.389
OF THE CLOUD FOREST.  THAT MEANS
 IT DOESN'T COME DOWN FROM THE 

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.591
TREE TOPS.  AND WHY IS IT THAT 
IT TOOK SO LONG TO FIND THIS 

00:09:07.622 --> 00:09:10.883
LITTLE ANIMAL?  WELL, IT TOOK 
VERY VERY LONG BECAUSE I HAVE TO

00:09:11.042 --> 00:09:14.833
 TELL YOU NOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
 THE CLOUD FOREST.  WHY DO YOU 

00:09:15.157 --> 00:09:23.591
SUPPOSE THE CLOUD FOREST IS 
CALLED THE CLOUD FOREST?  WHAT 

00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:26.415
IS THE USE?  [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:56.211
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.  THE CLOUD

00:09:40.569 --> 00:09:43.001
 FOREST IS FILLED WITH CLOUDS. 

00:09:50.725 --> 00:09:54.759
FOREST.  THEREFORE, THINK.  PUT 
ON YOUR THINKING CAPS.  THINKING

00:09:55.210 --> 00:10:02.863
 CAPS ON.  DO YOU THINK THAT IS 
VERY EASY TO SEE AN ANIMAL THIS 

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:08.324
SIZE WHEN IT'S ALL VERY, VERY, 
VERY DARK, THERE IS NO

00:10:11.417 --> 00:10:17.000
 LIGHT AT NIGHT.  WE ARE NOT IN 
THE CITY WE ARE IN A FOREST.  

00:10:17.263 --> 00:10:23.985
[SPEAKING SPANISH].  THERE IS A 
FOREST WHERE THERE IS NO LIGHT 

00:10:24.221 --> 00:10:29.946
WHATSOEVER.  DO YOU THINK IT IS 
VERY EASY TO SEE AN ANIMAL THAT 

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:37.532
COMES ONLY AT NIGHT IN A VERY 
DARK FOREST?  AND IF THAT FOREST

00:10:37.734 --> 00:10:41.498
 IS ALSO COVERED WITH FOG AND 
MIST.  [SPEAKING

00:10:46.761 --> 00:10:48.761
 SPANISH]. 

00:11:09.114 --> 00:11:12.989
  NO. 
NO.  NO.  OKAY.  NO.  YOU HAVE 

00:11:07.705 --> 00:11:17.030
THE RIGHT ANSWER.  NO.  SO THAT 
IS WHY IT TOOK SO

00:11:17.775 --> 00:11:19.775
 LONG.  
[SPEAKING

00:11:23.054 --> 00:11:29.338
 SPANISH].  I AM GOING TO TELL 
YOU HOW IS IT THAT THAT 

00:11:29.464 --> 00:11:32.855
HAPPENED.  A GROUP OF 
SCIENTISTS, NOT FROM HERE.  

00:11:32.856 --> 00:11:34.856
ACTUALLY A

00:11:36.861 --> 00:11:44.249
 GROUP OF SCIENTISTS THAT WORKED
 IN THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:53.903
  THEY WORKED FOR 10 YEARS 
FINDING AND DETERMINING THE 

00:11:53.904 --> 00:11:59.235
DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS OF A 
CERTAIN ANIMAL LIKE THE 

00:11:59.643 --> 00:12:04.203
OLINGUITO CALLED THE OLINGO, 
THAT COMES FROM THE SAME FAMILY.

00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:07.192
FAMILY OF THE 

00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:14.805
RACCOON AND ONE DAY THE 
SCIENTISTS FOUND OUT,

00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:45.978
OUT,ZOOLOGY, THERE WERE SOME 
LABELED OLINGUITO THAT WERE 

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.260
OUT,ZOOLOGY, THERE WERE SOME 
LABELED OLINGUITO THAT WERE 

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:34.502
DIFFERENT.  AND SOME BONES, YOU 
KNOW, THE FUR THAT WAS A LITTLE 

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:41.284
DIFFERENT TOO.  AND THESE 
ZOOLOGISTS BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT

00:12:41.416 --> 00:12:47.581
 THIS WAS MISLABELED.  AND THIS 
TESTAMENT THAT HE HAD BEEN 

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:52.100
STUDYING IN THE MUSEUM OF 
NATURAL HISTORY HAD BEEN 

00:12:52.597 --> 00:12:57.573
MISLABELED.  AND HE CONDUCTED 
SOME VERY SPECIAL TESTING.  DNA 

00:12:57.796 --> 00:13:03.620
TESTING.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE 
FOUND?  DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?  

00:13:03.743 --> 00:13:08.923
THAT THIS WAS NOT AN OLINGUITO. 
IT WAS A DIFFERENT ANIMAL.  SO 

00:13:09.826 --> 00:13:14.558
THESE SCIENTISTS GATHERED A 
GROUP OF OTHER SCIENTISTS, AND 

00:13:16.599 --> 00:13:22.767
THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN SOUTH
 TO THE COUNTRY OF ECUADOR.  

00:13:23.593 --> 00:13:26.098
[SPEAKING SPANISH]. 

00:14:18.056 --> 00:14:42.246
 THEY WANTED TO KNOW IF THE 
ANIMAL WAS ALIVE AND WELL IN THE

00:13:57.866 --> 00:14:02.757
 FOREST.  OKAY.  
NOW I'M GOING TO STOP.  AND I AM

00:14:03.123 --> 00:14:06.759
 GOING TO READ YOU -- WELL 
ACTUALLY I'M GOING TO TELL YOU 

00:14:07.501 --> 00:14:15.114
THIS STORY OF THE OLINGUITO IN 
SPANISH.  AND THEN WE WILL SEE 

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:18.398
THE STORY DEVELOP, SHOWN ON THE 

00:14:23.322 --> 00:14:26.571
SCREEN IN ENGLISH.  [SPEAKING

00:17:37.698 --> 00:17:41.239
SPANISH].  AND NOW LET'S GO INTO
 THE FOREST.  I WENT TO THE 

00:17:41.485 --> 00:17:43.485
FOREST.  I WENT TO THE

00:17:44.884 --> 00:17:46.884
 FOREST IN

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.024
 ECUADOR.  WHERE OLINGUITO 
LIVES.

00:17:53.025 --> 00:17:56.545
AND I WENT THERE BECAUSE I 
WANTED TO SEE WITH MY OWN EYES, 

00:17:56.726 --> 00:17:58.726
NOT ONLY THE OLINGUITO, BUT I 
WANTED TO

00:18:01.905 --> 00:18:06.540
 SEE THE AMAZING PLANTS AND 
AMAZING ANIMALS THAT CO-EXIST 

00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:08.541
WITH THE OLINGUITO.  I DIDN'T 
TELL YOU SOMETHING VERY 

00:18:08.827 --> 00:18:12.226
IMPORTANT.  AND THAT IS, THAT IN
 A CLOUD FOREST, NOT ONLY THE 

00:18:15.737 --> 00:18:17.737
CLOUD FOREST IS KNOWN FOR

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:27.427
 THE CLOUDS THAT COVER EVERY 
SINGLE PART OF THE FOREST.  WE 

00:18:27.428 --> 00:18:32.949
HAVE A LOT OF PLANTS.  AND THESE
 PLANTS, MANY OF THESE PLANTS 

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:38.222
ARE AIR PLANTS.  YOU HAVE THE 
CLOUDS AND THE FOG COVERING ALL 

00:18:38.223 --> 00:18:44.559
OVER THE FOREST.  AND YOU ALSO 
HAVE MANY PLANTS THAT ARE AIR 

00:18:44.697 --> 00:18:48.130
PLANTS.
LIKE THE CAMILIAS LIKE YOU SAW 

00:18:48.296 --> 00:18:52.009
THERE.  REMEMBER WHEN I STARTED?
[SPEAKING SPANISH]. 

00:18:55.878 --> 00:19:00.223
 WHAT YOU SEE UP THERE ON THE 
SCREEN RIGHT NOW, THOSE ARE AIR 

00:19:00.388 --> 00:19:03.174
PLANTS.  THIS PLANT, THIS IS ONE
 OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE 

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:08.357
CLOUD FOREST.  THE CLOUD FOREST 
IS KNOWN TO HAVE A LOT OF MIST. 

00:19:08.499 --> 00:19:16.707
 A LOT OF HUMIDITY THAT ACTUALLY
 ARE NUTRIENTS.  THEY NOURISH 

00:19:16.708 --> 00:19:18.708
ALL OF THE AIR

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.475
 PLANTS.  AND ALSO THE LIGHTS, 
THEY ARE AIR PLANTS.  

00:19:27.476 --> 00:19:32.690
AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THE WATER. 
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SEE UP 

00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:42.135
THERE?  WHO IS EATING THE 
BANANA?  WHO IS EATING THE 

00:19:42.449 --> 00:19:44.449
BANANA? 

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:52.442
SPEAKER:  I CAN'T HEAR YOU.  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  OLINGUITO.  

00:19:52.624 --> 00:19:55.820
SPEAKER:  YEAH, OLINGUITO.  YOU 
KNOW I WAITED 4 HOURS THAT NIGHT

00:19:56.853 --> 00:19:59.043
 WAITING FOR OLINGUITO TO 
ARRIVE.

00:19:59.044 --> 00:20:03.711
AND I WAS STAYING IN THIS LODGE 
IN THE CLOUD FOREST.  AND THE 

00:20:03.849 --> 00:20:06.563
MANAGER HAD PROMISED ME THAT I 
WOULD SEE AN OLINGUITO.  AND I 

00:20:07.663 --> 00:20:09.663
WAS STAYING THERE JUST THREE 
NIGHTS.  I HAD JUST THREE NIGHTS

00:20:10.079 --> 00:20:14.222
 TO SEE IF.  IF I DON'T SEE IT, 
I'M GOING TO BE VERY, VERY, VERY

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:17.773
 SAD.  SO I WAS STANDING THERE 
WITH MY CAMERA AND I HAD SOME 

00:20:18.243 --> 00:20:21.868
FRIENDS IN THE BEGINNING.  BUT 
BY HOUR NUMBER FOUR, I WAS THERE

00:20:21.993 --> 00:20:27.250
 ALL BY MYSELF.  EVERYBODY HAD 
GONE TO BED.  I WAS STILL THERE 

00:20:28.094 --> 00:20:33.980
WITH MY CAMERA.  I WANTED TO 
SNAP A PICTURE OF THE OLINGUITO.

00:20:34.161 --> 00:20:39.519
I WAS SO NERVOUS THAT MY HANDS 
WERE SHAKING.  I COULDN'T TAKE A

00:20:39.644 --> 00:20:45.230
 GOOD PICTURE.  THAT'S WHY IT'S 
KIND OF FUZZY.  BUT I'LL TELL 

00:20:45.355 --> 00:20:49.742
YOU WHAT IT IS THAT THE 
OLINGUITO IS EATING THE BANANAS.

00:20:50.062 --> 00:20:57.623
THE BANANAS DON'T GROW AT THE 
ALTITUDE THAT THE OLINGUITOS 

00:20:57.833 --> 00:21:02.971
LIVE IN THE FOREST.  BANANAS 
GROW AT A LOWER ALTITUDE, IN THE

00:21:03.396 --> 00:21:09.930
 JUNGLE OR THE RAIN FOREST.  SO 
THE MANAGER TIES BATCHES OF 

00:21:10.148 --> 00:21:13.028
BANANAS FROM THE TREE.  REMEMBER
 I TOLD YOU THE OLINGUITO DOES 

00:21:13.868 --> 00:21:17.312
NOT COME DOWN FROM THE CANOPY OF
 THE TREES?  REMEMBER I TOLD YOU

00:21:17.668 --> 00:21:19.668
 -- [SPEAKING

00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:27.237
 SPANISH].  SO THE MANAGER TIES 
BUNCHES OF BANANAS.

00:21:27.238 --> 00:21:33.168
AND THIS IS SUCH A SPECIAL TREAT
 FOR THE OLINGUITO THAT SURE 

00:21:33.339 --> 00:21:37.475
ENOUGH, WHEN HE SMELLS THE 
BANANA, IT APPROACHES.  AND 

00:21:38.646 --> 00:21:43.668
THERE IT IS.  THAT IS HOW I GOT 
TO TAKE A PICTURE.  SO NOW WE'RE

00:21:44.252 --> 00:21:46.252
 GOING TO READ THE BOOK IN

00:21:49.867 --> 00:21:55.283
 ENGLISH.  COME, ZOOLOGY IN 
WASHINGTON, D.C. AS HE SERVES

FOR THE OLINGUITO

00:22:01.457 --> 00:22:07.291
  ELUSIVE IN THE CLOUD FOREST.  
DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHAT THE WORD 

00:22:09.294 --> 00:22:12.147
ELUSIVE MEANS?  IT'S HARD TO 
FIND. 

00:22:12.148 --> 00:22:16.370
REMEMBER OLINGUITO WAS HARD TO 
FIND?  WHY WAS IT HARD TO FIND? 

00:22:16.492 --> 00:22:21.978
WHY?  YES, THE GIRL IN RED.  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  IT ONLY COMES

00:22:29.183 --> 00:22:32.562
AND WHAT ABOUT THE CLOUD FOREST.
WHAT ABOUT THAT IT'S HARD TO SEE

00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:34.879

00:23:00.154 --> 00:23:09.676
 FOREST EMBROIDED, HOME TO CRAB

00:23:10.532 --> 00:23:15.129
COTTONTAILS AND A DOZING 
OLINGUITO DREAMING THE DAY AWAY,

00:23:15.556 --> 00:23:19.538
 AND I CAN HEAR SOME OF YOU ARE 
VERY EXCITED.  BECAUSE YOU HAVE 

00:23:19.962 --> 00:23:26.242
ALREADY SPOTTED THE OLINGUITO.  
YES.  THE OLINGUITO IS UP ON 

00:23:26.603 --> 00:23:28.603
THAT TREE. BUT

00:23:30.249 --> 00:23:32.249
 HE IS SLEEPING.  
[SPEAKING

00:23:34.633 --> 00:23:36.633

 SO I AM GOING TO TELL YOU 
SOMETHING ELSE.  THIS IS 

00:23:44.378 --> 00:23:47.926
SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T KNOW 
YET.  OR MAYBE YOU DO.  BUT IN 

00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:55.151
EVERY SINGLE STAGE OF THE BOOK, 
THERE IS A ZOOLOGIST.  REMEMBER 

00:23:55.152 --> 00:23:57.610
THE SCIENTIST THAT WENT TO 
SEARCH 

00:24:02.266 --> 00:24:08.417
FOR THE OLINGUITO?  REMEMBER?  
SO I HEAR THE ZOOLOGISTS ON 

00:24:08.795 --> 00:24:10.928
EVERY SINGLE PAGE OF THE BOOK.  
OKAY, THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.244
 PLAY THE GAME.  OKAY.  LISTEN

00:24:24.362 --> 00:24:26.362
ZOOLOGIST, THE 

00:24:30.059 --> 00:24:33.839
SILLIOUETTE OF A MAN, YOU RAISE 
YOUR HAND.  YOU RAISE YOUR HAND 

00:24:34.394 --> 00:24:37.596
WITHOUT SAYING A WORD.  CAN 
ANYBODY SEE THE OLINGUITO ON 

00:24:37.765 --> 00:24:41.258
THIS PAGE?  RAISE YOUR HAND.  
WHERE IS IT?  

00:24:41.259 --> 00:24:42.420

00:24:42.421 --> 00:24:48.942
SPEAKER:  CORRECT.  HE IS HIDING
 ON THE TOP RIGHT.  HANDS DOWN. 

00:24:55.125 --> 00:25:01.283
LET'S TURN THE PAGE.  THIS 
ENCHANTED FOREST IN ECUADOR IS A

00:25:02.069 --> 00:25:07.674
 FESTIVAL OF FLOWERS AND FRESH 
WATER SPRINGS.  RAISE YOUR HAND 

00:25:07.806 --> 00:25:13.679
IF YOU SEE THOSE ZOOLOGISTS.  
IT'S HARD TO SEE.  BECAUSE IN 

00:25:14.831 --> 00:25:22.292
THIS PICTURE IT IS CAMOUFLAGED. 
THE SILOUETTE OF THE MAN, THE 

00:25:24.027 --> 00:25:26.027
ZOOLOGIST IS CAMOUFLAGED. 

00:25:30.363 --> 00:25:32.363
 LET'S SEE WHERE IS 

00:25:34.594 --> 00:25:39.147

WHO CAN HELP HER?  JUST STAND

00:25:45.644 --> 00:25:49.321
THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE HE IS.  IT 
IS BACK THERE IN THE BACKGROUND.

00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:53.904
ACTUALLY ABOVE THE LETTER E.  
THAT IS WHERE HE IS.  AND YOU 

00:25:54.715 --> 00:25:58.873
KNOW WHAT, IF YOU DON'T SEE IT 
WELL LATER, I'M SURE THAT YOU 

00:25:59.727 --> 00:26:06.137
WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE A BOOK AND 
OPEN IT AND FIND FOR YOURSELF.  

00:26:06.318 --> 00:26:10.242
HANDS.  ONLY HANDS.  NO WORDS.  
OKAY SO HAVE I READ THIS PAGE?  

00:26:10.429 --> 00:26:15.696

CAN SEE THE ZOOLOGIST, AND I 

00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:56.462

00:26:56.463 --> 00:26:59.864
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  IT'S OVER

00:26:59.865 --> 00:27:02.533
SPEAKER:  THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE 
IT IS.  IT IS OVER THAT BIG HUGE

00:27:02.754 --> 00:27:07.115
 LEAF AND BEHIND IN THE 
BACKGROUND.  SO TO THE RIGHT OF 

00:27:08.745 --> 00:27:14.241
THE RED AND BLACK PART OF THE 
ROCK.  SO I HAVE TO TELL YOU 

00:27:14.465 --> 00:27:21.906
SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL ABOUT THE
 END.  DO YOU SEE THE END?  AND 

00:27:22.637 --> 00:27:28.859
IN SPANISH IT'S ORMIGA.  BEGINS 
WITH A LETTER

00:27:35.202 --> 00:27:37.202
 -- WHAT LETTER? 

00:27:47.519 --> 00:27:49.519
[SPEAKING 

00:28:08.741 --> 00:28:16.509
SPANISH].  SO SPANISH].  SO 
ORMIGA IN SPANISH BEGINS WITH 

00:28:04.839 --> 00:28:12.161
THE LETTER H.  IT'S A LETTER IN 
THE SPANISH ALPHABET THAT IS A 

00:28:12.162 --> 00:28:15.886
SILENT LETTER.  SOME OF YOU SAID
 O.  SOME OF YOU SAID H RIGHT

00:28:18.993 --> 00:28:26.976
 AWAY.  THIS IS NOT ANY KIND OF 
ORMIGA.  BUT NOT ANY KIND OF 

00:28:28.193 --> 00:28:34.118
ORMIGA.  NOT ANY KIND OF ARMY 
ANT.  THIS ARMY ANT, THEY 

00:28:34.376 --> 00:28:36.376
ACTUALLY COME OUT IN SWAMPS OF

00:28:40.312 --> 00:28:45.648
 200,000 INDIVIDUALS.  THEY 
BLANK THE FOREST, ALL BLACK, 

00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:51.694
THEY GO UP THE TREES AND GO UP 
THE BRANCHES.  AND THEY EVEN GO 

00:28:51.823 --> 00:28:56.932
INSIDE THE HOMES OF THE LOCALS. 
COULD YOU BELIEVE

00:28:59.946 --> 00:29:05.804
 IT?  MY GUIDE TOLD ME THAT AS 
SOON AS YOU CAN HEAR THE ARMY 

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.060

00:29:10.746 --> 00:29:15.369
 EVER HEARD AN ANT WALK?  
IMAGINE HOW MANY ANTS ARE 

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.370
WALKING IF 

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:26.232
THEY  CAN HEAR THEM WALKING.  AS
 SOON AS THE LOCALS HEAR THE 

00:29:26.233 --> 00:29:29.026
ANTS WALKING THEY LEAVE THEIR 
HOUSES.

00:29:29.027 --> 00:29:32.609
BECAUSE THEY COME INTO THE DOORS
 AND WINDOWS AND WHATEVER THEY 

00:29:33.041 --> 00:29:36.818
WANT.  AND THE LOCALS KNOW NOT 
TO MESS WITH THEIR ANTS.  THEY 

00:29:37.085 --> 00:29:41.296
LEAVE THEIR HOUSES AND COME BACK
 WHEN IT'S SAFE TO BE IN THEIR 

00:29:41.297 --> 00:29:46.451
HOME WITHOUT ANTS.  THIS IS THE 
ARMY ANTS.  IT'S NOT ANY KIND OF

00:29:46.943 --> 00:29:51.287
 ARMY ANTS.  QUESTIONS AT THE 

00:29:57.253 --> 00:29:59.253
END.  SO WE WERE

00:30:02.568 --> 00:30:06.963
 HERE.  LEAVES WITH INCREDIBLE 
INSECTS AND A RESTING 

00:30:12.213 --> 00:30:14.213

TO SEE AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
 SEE THE 

00:30:37.865 --> 00:30:43.475
ZOOLOGIST HERE.  IF YOU SEE THE 
ZOOLOGIST DESCRIBE WHICH PART OF

00:30:43.871 --> 00:30:48.454
 THE ILLUSTRATION YOU CAN SEE 
THE SCIENTIST, THE ZOOLOGIST.  

00:30:48.455 --> 00:30:52.869
LET'S SEE.  YOU IN THE CENTER?

THE CLOUD FOREST.  SOMEBODY WAS 
UPSET BECAUSE I WENT BY AND I 

00:31:53.522 --> 00:31:58.232
DIDN'T SHOW THE ZOOLOGIST IN THE
 OTHER ONE.  SO CAN YOU SEE THE 

00:31:58.352 --> 00:32:00.352
ZOOLOGIST 

00:32:01.985 --> 00:32:04.251

THE NEXT ONE.  CAN YOU SPOT THE 
ZOOLOGIST HERE?  THIS IS VERY 

00:32:31.617 --> 00:32:36.594
HARD TO SEE.  IT'S ALMOST THE 
COLOR OF THE GROUND WHERE HE IS,

00:32:37.015 --> 00:32:39.015
 WHERE HE IS

00:32:42.533 --> 00:32:44.981
