00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.050
Well, for one thing, the creation of the object and adding

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.500
a loc property seems like something we could do up in the Car constructor.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.540
Where we used to have object creation, we can simply call the Car function now

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.440
and it'll produce an object that can act as the starting point for

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.060
the rest of the subclass.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.320
Technically, we have a working superclass at this point, but

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.610
there's still more repeated code that we should be able to move into it.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.250
Let's take the code for the addition of a move method out of

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.630
those subclass constructors and move it up here into the superclass constructor.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.810
At this point, we have two complete subclass functions and

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.640
one superclass constructor function that creates a bit of a starting point for

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.970
each of those subclasses to build on top of.
