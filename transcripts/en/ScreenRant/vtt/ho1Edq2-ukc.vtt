00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.320
One thing Marvel has done constantly over
the years is make us laugh.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.799
It’s no coincidence that the MCU’s poster
child is king of one-liners Tony Stark, and

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.540
they’ve kept the comedy coming with characters
like Peter Quill and Scott Lang, but the record

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.910
shattering Deadpool proved that Fox is no
slouch in the joke department either.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.070
Here are the Most Hilarious Marvel Movie Moments
So Far

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.239
Deadpool opening credits

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.140
The opening minutes of Deadpool quickly establish
that this is going to be a superhero movie

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.140
like no other.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.090
It’s a perfect encapsulation of the film
itself by being self reflexive, visually impressive,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.090
and hilarious.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.510
It acknowledges the archetypes the film will
include in the least archetypical way with

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.540
credits like “God’s Perfect Idiot” standing
in for Ryan Reynolds and “An Overpaid Tool”

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.540
for director Tim Miller.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.460
A moment frozen in time, the picture speaking
a thousand words as Deadpool tea bags one

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.250
goon and gives another a wedgie while the
SUV they’re all in rolls down the highway.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.760
The only question remaining is: who carries
a Green Lantern trading card in their wallet?

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.860
Ant Man “Baskin Robbins always finds out.”

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.710
Comedian Gregg Turkington was best known for
his stage alter ego Neil Hamburger before

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.360
appearing in Ant-Man, now Marvel fanboys everywhere
recognize him as Baskin Robbins’ chill but

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.360
firm manager.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.720
He only appeared in one scene, but Scott Lang’s
firing is one of the best in Ant Man, as Turkington

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.030
expresses equal parts approval and indifference
while laying off Lang for the “cool” crimes

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.490
he lied about to get hired.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.530
Friend and fellow ex con Luis should have
warned him

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.310
Spider-Man trilogy -Bruce Campbell

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.189
In all three of Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man films
there was one person you could always count

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.620
on to show up for a laugh.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.700
Okay, two if you count JK Simmons’ dead-on
J. Jonah Jameson, but we’re talking about

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.970
Bruce Campbell’s trio of cameos in different
roles.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.780
Having worked with Sam Raimi on all three
Evil Dead movies, Campbell was a close friend

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.409
of Raimi’s and first showed up in the Spider-Man
universe as the ring announcer when Peter

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.229
Parker tries wrestling for cash.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.100
Whether as a wrestling announcer, theatre
usher, or snooty French waiter, Campbell and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.810
Raimi seemed to enjoy always finding new ways
for him to insult Parker.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.189
Guardians of the Galaxy -fake leg for the
escape

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.140
Marvel made a wise choice when they recruited
indie writer/ director James Gunn to adapt

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.290
their obscure Sci Fi adventure property that
was Guardians of the Galaxy.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.980
Gunn’s script is filled with memorable gags
and great jokes, but there’s one that’s

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.250
so well placed you can’t help but laugh
every time.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.950
While the escape from the Kyln showed off
the abilities of every almost Guardian, there’s

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.849
one character who misses out on most of the
action while carrying out a fool’s errand.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.650
While Quill didn’t think it was very funny
that he paid 30,000 units for a fake leg that

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.370
Rocket didn’t actually need, watching someone
screw with the hero like that in the middle

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.160
of a big action scene was easily one of the
funniest moments in a movie filled with them.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.560
Avengers -Captain America

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.650
Whedon really was in his comedic element when
finding ways to make the Avengers interact

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.690
for the first time, he even managed to make
Captain American funny.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.490
With Stark throwing around pop culture references
covering everything from Point Break to Rock

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.120
of Ages, the man out of time can barely contain
his excitement when Fury makes a pre World

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:11.010
War II reference.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.980
Fury was of course referring to the flying
monkeys in Wizard of Oz.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.310
While we see him catching up on pop culture
in The Winter Soldier, he still has a ways

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.910
to go when it comes to technology.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.349
X Men: Days of Future Past Quicksilver’s
run

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.760
If there’s one X Men member who has the
time and good sense to stop and smell the

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.290
roses, it’s Quicksilver.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.160
Like the Deadpool opening credits, Quicksilver’s
run in Days of Future Past isn’t just great

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.850
on a technical level, but also shows off the
new character’s devil may care attitude.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.330
As the bullets fly towards his allies, Quicksilver
takes a moment to taste some soup, borrow

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.260
a guard’s hat and partake in several other
funny bits of business before deciding it’s

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.580
time to see where those bullets are at.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.739
And in case you didn’t already realize Quicksilver
had a great sense of humour, they threw a

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.519
wedgie in for good measure.

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.110
Thor - I need a horse

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.990
Just as Captain America needed to get with
the times once he was thawed, there was also

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.280
an adjustment period for Thor when he came
to earth.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.940
Unfamiliar with Earth and its customs, the
film made sure to highlight the humour in

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.909
the situation, particularly when Thor is in
search of horse and heads to the nearest pet

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:14.170
store.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.250
In a way Thor ends up getting his wish when
Jane gives him a ride in a Pinzgauer 716 truck,

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.740
which is actually named after an Austrian
breed of horse, although that was probably

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.740
just a coincidence.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.210
Iron Man 3 -The Mandarin reveal

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.009
Say what you will about Shane Black and Iron
Man 3 quote unquote ‘ruining’ what many

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.460
fans consider to be Stark’s number one nemesis,
Ben Kingsley acted the hell out of that part.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.139
He was sufficiently menacing as the Mandarin
in the propaganda videos, but it’s the Trevor

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.520
Slattery reveal where the comic gold lies.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.259
As a washed up English thespian whose King
Lear was once the King of Croydon, Kingsley

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.219
creates numerous droll asides in his few minutes
of screen time.

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:50.389
He clearly had a lot of fun with the role,
which is why he came back for more laughs

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.509
in the Marvel short All Hail The King.

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:53.610
Howard the Duck

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.889
The first feature length film based from a
Marvel property was actually the 1986 George

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.520
Lucas produced Sci Fi comedy Howard the Duck.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.389
At the time the comedy didn’t really land,
nobody found the horny duck funny or charming

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:05.810
and the movie was a huge flop.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.379
30 years later, the humour still doesn’t
really work the way it’s supposed to, but

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:11.979
the entire film itself is kind of one big
joke.

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.830
Just the fact that something this bad was
made on a scale this big is hilarious and

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.080
was a risk only someone like Lucas could have
taken.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.080
From duck boobs (@4:24) to loose duck rubbers
(Howard’s unwrapped condom in his wallet

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.680
@19:25), it’s still unclear who exactly
this movie was intended for.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.969
Avengers Shawarma

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:28.300
Fans who weren’t satisfied with just at
the Thanos tease at the end of Avengers and

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.300
stayed until the very end for the second cut
scene were rewarded with one of the best pieces

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.370
of comedy to come out of the MCU.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.770
The gang sitting around eating shawarma too
tired to speak is a familiar scene to anyone

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.080
who’s ever grabbed a bite with friends after
a night of drinking.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.330
In this case the heroes weren’t hungover
from consuming dangerous amounts of alcohol,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.020
just exhausted from saving New York City from
an alien invasion.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.939
The scene was an afterthought, shot after
the cast and crew reunited for the premiere.

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:55.569
Chris Evans had to wear a prosthetic on his
face to cover the beard he was sporting for

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:56.569
his Snowpiercer role.

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:00.619
It was a brilliant move by Joss Whedon, as
the 30 seconds of silence provided one of

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:03.879
MCU’s most memorable and now iconic scenes.

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:07.319
With so many to choose from, these were just
a few of the Marvel scenes that we got a kick

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:08.319
out of.

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:09.379
What scenes made you laugh out loud?
