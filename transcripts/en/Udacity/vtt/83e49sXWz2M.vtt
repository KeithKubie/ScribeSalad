00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.780
Like string on a spool, DNA can

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.210
be wrapped onto these important proteins called histones,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.010
taking on a shape that's known as beads on a string. Here's an example of a

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.130
real electron microscopy picture taken of this DNA

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.910
beads on a string structure. Just like you

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.740
can see in the cartoon up here wrapped

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.990
around these Histome proteins is the DNA and

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.160
down here in the actual real life picture you

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.400
can see the little circular Histome proteins and their

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.210
connected by a string in between them because the

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.780
DNA is wrapped around them. And then on to the

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.400
next system, and on to the next one, and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.600
on to the next one. This wrapping and folding,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.250
leads to an intermediate form of organized DNA called

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.080
the 30 nanometer fiber and its name as you can

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.650
imagine, based on its size. The width of this

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.710
is actually about 30 nanometers. . Now that's still

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.130
small obviously Now the folding doesn't stop here. The

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.590
30nm fiber will actually start folding on itself here

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.180
in a minute, and that's what organizes into the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.860
really big structure that we're used to seeing, called

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.660
a chromosome. So another way of looking at this

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.370
is our double-stranded DNA here, in our most zoomed-in picture.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.580
Is actually wrapped around these histone

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.170
proteins in the 30 nanometer fiber structure.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.270
We actually call the combination of DNA wrapped around histones, we call that

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.730
chromatin. And then chromatin is organized

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.890
into structures called chromosomes. Chromosomes are actually

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.820
organized chromatin, and you have multiple

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.840
chromosomes in the cells in your body.
