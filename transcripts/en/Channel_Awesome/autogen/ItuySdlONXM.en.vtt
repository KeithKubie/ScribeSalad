00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.960
NC: Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.860
You know, growing up, I remember seeing a trailer for a Rob Reiner film called North.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.540
Even though I never saw it, it looked harmless enough.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.780
Sort of a quirky comedy about a boy who divorces his neglecting parents and searches the world for better ones.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.960
It just looked like any other average family comedy.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.720
But what really drew my attention to it was the Siskel and Ebert review.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960
Siskel: It's junk. First class junk.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.640
Ebert: It's a movie that makes me cringe, even when I'm sitting here thinking about it.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.240
Siskel: It...it's embarrassing. You feel unclean as you're sitting there.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.040
Ebert: I hated this movie as much as any movie we've ever reviewed in the 19 years we've been doing this show.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.100
NC: Damn! That is harsh!

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.180
I mean, these are the guys that reviewed Batman and Robin, Kazaam, the Super Mario Bros. movie, and the Tom and Jerry movie,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.080
and THIS is the movie that made them feel unclean?!

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.580
What the hell could be in it that could be so bad?!

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.540
C'mon, kids, let's find out!

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.280
Kids: YAAAAAY!

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.000
NC: OK, so it starts out with North, played by Elijah Wood, as he listens to his parents argue,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.480
who are, oddly enough, played by Jason Alexander and Julia Louis Dreyfus.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.720
North's Dad: And I was inspecting pants before you even started wearing them!

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.900
North's Mom: Stop over at Atlanta! Like that would kill him!

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.780
Mom: Stop over at Atlanta! Like that would kill him!
Dad: I said I forgot more about belt loops than you'll ever know!

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.460
Dad: I said I forgot more about belt loops than you'll ever know!

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.260
NC: (as George Costanza) "You're killing Independent George, Elaine!"

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.440
North starts to, for some reason, have a panic attack.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.360
(North's parents arguing)

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.240
(North's parents arguing)
North: (labored breathing) Mom...Mom...Dad?

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.480
Dad: Do you know who I am?

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.040
North: Ahhh!

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.740
NC: Dude...kid...your parents are arguing. All parents do that.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.040
It's not like you're possessed by the One Ring of Power!

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.700
NC: As he loses consciousness more and more, we hear the narrator (played by Bruce Willis) explain why.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.880
Narrator: (narrating quickly) Yes, North was having a difficult time with his folks,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.600
and it was putting a damper on what was, in all other respects, a very successful life.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.340
NC: Yeahhh... Nice read there, Bruce.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.040
It's like he knew this movie was a stinker, so he tried to get it over with as quickly as possible.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.040
NC: (narrating quickly) "North was in a jam. He really didn't relate to his parents. (Next page)

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.720
He decided he needed a change, so he roamed the Earth until he found the parents he was looking for.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.420
Where's my check? There it is... Gotta go!" (door closing)

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.780
(car driving off)

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.720
Dad: Hoho! Well, that shut him up!

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.900
North: (screaming)

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.160
Dad: What's the matter with him?

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.600
Here, loosen his pants!

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.040
NC: Wait...WHAT?

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.320
Dad: Here, loosen his pants!

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.780
NC: Wait...WHAT?!

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.280
Dad: Here, loosen his pants!

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.820
NC: Okay...all right...

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.580
You can't let a line like that go by and not have somebody make fun of it, so...

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.220
Here are my jokes!

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.720
Dad: Loosen his pants!

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.580
NC: "...or take his shirt off. Either way, I'm getting a show."

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.120
Dad: Loosen his pants!

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.820
NC: "I hate it when I have to direct the strippers."

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.220
Dad: Loosen his pants!

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.280
NC: (as Dr. McCoy) "Dammit, man! I'm a doctor, not a pedophile!"

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.660
Dad: Loosen his pants!

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.220
NC: "Isn't that the slogan for NAMBLA?"

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.520
Dad: Loosen his pants!

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.660
NC: "....but just skip over the 'turning your head and coughing'!"

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.060
Dad: Loosen his pants!

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.880
NC: "I always forget if we circumcised him!"

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.420
Dad: Loosen his pants!

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.140
NC: "Now we're gonna see why his last name is Wood..."

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.540
Dad: Loosen his pants!

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.400
NC: "Elaine wants to see if he's truly 'sponge-worthy'!"

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.760
Dad: Loosen his pants!

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.580
NC: "You know, when you said you were having 'the other white meat', this isn't what I had in mind!"

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.440
Dad: Loosen his pants!

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.620
NC: "If anyone asks, Art Vandelay did it."

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.900
Play me off, Paul!

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.820
So it turns out North is a sort of child prodigy, loved by all except his own parents.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.840
So he relaxes in his secret place (which is ironically in the middle of a display room, which everyone can see, so...not really secret)

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.260
when he comes across...

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.440
Bruce Willis as a bunny.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.220
I really wish I was making that up.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.300
North: Who are you?

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.460
Narrator: The Easter Bunny.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.940
NC: (as North) "And I'm a Hobbit. Blow me."

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.580
Narrator: It's a holiday. How 'bout yours?

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.940
North: Not lately.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.180
I had a real bad game today.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.200
NC and Kids: HOW BAD WAS IT?

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.620
North: I walked nine Panthers and...hit my coach's wife with a wild pitch.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.620
(wind blowing)

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.460
It's my folks.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.400
Narrator: They don't know what a good thing they got in you, right?

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.800
North: Exactly! And they're the only ones!

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.620
You should hear what all the other parents say about me!

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.220
Dad 1: North's room is ALWAYS clean.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.120
Mom 1: North always looks both ways.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.020
Mom 2: North never spoils his appetite.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.400
Dad 2: North flosses.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.180
NC: "North was crucified for our sins! When are YOU going to make that kind of commitment?"

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.040
Narrator: You realize, of course, that you're not alone.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.700
North: What do you mean?

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.300
Narrator: Look, kid. Just because I'm in a bunny suit doesn't mean I haven't stumbled across--

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.900
Narrator: Look, kid. Just because I'm in a bunny suit doesn't mean I haven't stumbled across--
NC: Yeah...yeah, it does.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.700
NC: Yeah...yeah, it does.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.160
Whatever you're about to say...being in a bunny suit pretty much destroys all credibility.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.380
Narrator: If you want my advice...and I know you didn't ask for it...

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.900
Go home...make up...and goodbye.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.800
(narrating) And that was it.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.440
Nothing special.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.060
I just left him there in that secret spot of his.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.820
Just him...and his thoughts.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.880
NC: And some hallucinogenic brownies that seem to be taking effect.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.140
North: Free agency...

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.260
Winchell: What a scoop!

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.760
NC: Aaah!

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.580
Winchell: A kid becoming a free agent! It's brilliant, North!

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.140
NC: Thanks, prepubescent Larry King.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.640
So he tells his friend Winchell, who works at the school paper, about his plan to possibly divorce his parents.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.720
But he decides to give them one last chance by giving them a call to talk to them.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.220
So he places a call to the pants factory where his father works, where...

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.440
Wait...

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:22.980
What the hell?

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.400
Why is there a...

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.800
Huh?!

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.740
W...what?!

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.680
What the hell is going on in the background?

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.940
Who owns this pants factory? Willy Wonka?

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.980
Narrator: That's bad.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.480
NC: After his dad blows him off, North finally decides to cut the leash and officially divorce his folks,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.560
hiring a lawyer, played by Jon Lovitz.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.620
Dad 3: Come on, Andy! His folks are gonna fight it!

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.280
Mom 3: Of course they are! They're not gonna take this lying down!

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.060
(thud)

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.900
NC: Get it? They said "lying down" and now they're lying down.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.300
I just wanted to explain that, because...you know, it's so subtle.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.840
So they go to court where the judge, played by Alan Arkin,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.800
is about as plausible as that idiot who judged the Anna Nicole Smith trial.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.580
Judge: Even though both sides will be saying things and I will be hearing them, it is still not a hearing.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.280
No doubt you'll all be hearing the same things I am hearing.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.600
That's your privilege.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.860
However...once both sides have been heard,

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.080
then it'll be my job to pass judgment.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.900
Obviously, you can all pass judgment too, but it won't count.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.500
NC: You know, it was a very bold move on Reiner's part to deprive this movie of charm.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.640
It could have had a couple of clever moments, but this director said, "Nope! That's what they'd be expecting us to do."

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.660
Judge: Have I made myself clear to the defense?

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.780
Defense Attorney: Your honor...

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.460
The defense rests.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.960
NC: Wow.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.660
I mean... Wow!

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.860
That is the worst joke I have ever heard in my entire life!

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.880
They did it! They did it! They made the WORST JOKE OF ALL TIME!

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.840
Give them a round of applause, everybody! Incredible!

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.440
(cheering and applause)

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.180
(mocking laughter)

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.360
(fireworks)

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.160
(sniff)

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.840
Awful...Awful...

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.640
NC: So... (sigh)...North has the summer to find his new parents, or they'll apparently put him in an orphanage.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.740
Judge: And if any of you has ever seen The Little Rascals...ho ho ho!

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.680
You know that's no day at the beach!

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.640
NC: (as the judge) "I like to judge things by 1920's comedies.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.140
You know, instead of those useless 'facts' or 'statistics'."

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.440
So North first heads to Texas, where he tries spending time with his first set of parents, played by Dan Aykroyd and Reba McEntire.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.720
Pa Tex: Well, I reckon we'll wake up early and eat...

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.740
And then we'll dig for oil and eat...

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.480
Then we'll rope some dogies, bust a few broncs, and then maybe we'll grab a bit to eat.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.080
NC: WOW.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.340
I mean, there's stereotypes and then there's...THIS.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.620
I mean, this isn't even how people in Texas dress.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.700
This isn't even how COWBOYS dress.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.420
This is like how ICE SKATERS dressing up as cowboys dress!

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.180
North: Sorry...

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:14.140
NC: So North notices that his new folks really want to fatten him up...but why?

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.720
Ma Tex: Then you'll be like Buck!

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:16.860
North: Who?

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:17.880
Pa Tex: Our first son.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.380
Biggest boy this big state's ever seen.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.700
Why, he could eat more in one day than anyone else could eat in a whole month!

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.040
Ma Tex: That's why Buck hated February...

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.420
North: Where is Buck?

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.760
Pa Tex: He died in a stampede...

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.220
North: Oh...I'm so sorry...

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.440
Pa Tex: Needless to say, it was a mighty big loss.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.600
NC: Did I miss something here?

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.660
I mean...what was the point of that conversation? Was something funny said?

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.420
They have a son, the son dies, so...

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.240
So what?

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.640
They have a son, the son is fat, he dies in a stampede...so where's the humor?

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.560
In fact, I'm gonna play a little game with you.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.300
It's a wonderful game to play with a lot of really bad movies, and it's simply called...

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.340
BIG LOSS!

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.760
Because he's FAT!

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.880
And DEAD!

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.420
And...fat...dead people are apparently hilarious!

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.800
35 seconds of build-up for a "fat dead person" joke.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.020
(chuckle) I hope you enjoyed playing!

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.300

Yeah...apparently there's a song in this movie, even though there's not one anywhere else.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.900
Is it a funny song?

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:03.800
No.

NC: No, but a legitimate joke would be nice!

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:48.380
So North sits and thinks about what the flying fuck he just saw, when we're approached by an old, familiar face.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.040
That's right...it's Bruce Willis again.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.340
He's a cowboy now.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.860
Narrator: You know, down here in these parts, we got a saying...

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.920
Sometimes, when you're...panning for gold,

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.680
you gotta try more than one stream.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.500
NC: I'm familiar with another saying:

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.600
"Stop following me, or I'll call the police!"

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.740
So his next stop is Hawaii, where he comes across Governor Ho and Mrs. Ho, who also want to adopt him.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.540
Mrs. Ho: In Hawaii, "aloha" means "hello" AND "goodbye".

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.520
North: Doesn't that get confusing?

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.500
Mr. Ho: Only when you're firing someone.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.540
North: Oh... Uh..."Aloha!"

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.900
NC: "What do you mean, I'm fired?"

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.620
So, are there as many ethnic stereotypes in Hawaii as there are in Texas?

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.680
Do volcano gods eat virgins?

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.920
Mr. Ho: Well, here on the islands, we have only 12 letters in our alphabet.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.800
North: I didn't know that.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.540
Mr. Ho: Well, sure! Just think about it...

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.680
Waikiki, Honolulu...

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.860
North: That's very interesting, but...how does that help me get into college?

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.740
Mr. Ho: Well, since we don't use the letters B, C, D and F...

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.500
You're pretty much guaranteed to get straight A's.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.040
NC: Good gravy...the jokes on Happy Meals are funnier than this...

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.540
But North is also wondering why the governor and his wife want to adopt him in the first place.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.200
Mr. Ho: Hawaii is a lush and fertile land.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.940
In fact, there's only one barren area on all of our islands...

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.440
Unfortunately, it's...Mrs. Ho.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.840
NC: That's the worst thing ever uttered by humans. This movie is pure evil.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.880
I mean...what is up with these jokes? They are horrible!

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.700
You know what? I don't even think Rob Reiner was paying attention.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.040
I just think he wanted to go on vacation and somehow get paid for it!

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.580
So he made a cheap-ass movie, shouting "Cut!" every couple of minutes while he sat around swinging on a hammock.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.960
That, at least, would be a more believable excuse.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.100
Mr. Ho: Please give a big, warm Hawaiian welcome to our new pride and joy...

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.720
Our son...NORTH!

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.880
(cheers and applause)

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:45.960
NC: (whispering) What?!

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.360
North: What is that?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.160
Mr. Ho: Son, that'll be in every airport, along every highway...

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:51.780
North: My crack?!

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.440
What gives you the right to show my crack on every highway?

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.000
NC: I agree. That needs an answer.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.320
Mr. Ho: I'm the governor of a state that's running a little low on self-esteem.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.560
Mrs. Ho: He's right. People from the mainland just don't care about Hawaii.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.120
North: Excuse me, but what does this have to do with my crack?!

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.280
NC: Again, a legit point.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.560
Mr. Ho: If you lived here in Hawaii, people would be more inclined to settle here!

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.420
North: I don't know...

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.460
I need some time to think, okay?

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.960
NC: Yes, like, "What the hell does any of this have to do with his motherfucking CRACK?!"

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.580
HOW WOULD THAT PROMOTE TOURISM?

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.200
It's disgusting!

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.920
Whenever people visit Hawaii, they want them to think of pale boy butt?!

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.300
What is this movie's fascination with Elijah Wood's nether regions?

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.200
Oh, by the way, Bruce Willis pops up again.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.800
Yeah, I guess he's supposed to be like the mysterious mentor that follows him around, but...I don't know.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.240
I think he's more like the annoying mushroom that says "Our princess is in another castle".

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.380
You just want to smack him every time he appears.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:50.160
North: I don't think I should have to settle for parents who show my most private crevice on a billboard to make them feel better about themselves!

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.940
NC: That's nothing. You should see what Governor Palin is doing with her kids.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.720
NC: And speaking of Alaska, that's where North is off to next,

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.740
where the plane lands on the ground, and...

00:13:59.320 --> 00:13:59.980
Wait, what?

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.720
(radio chatter)

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.100
(thump)

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.240
WHERE'S THE JOKE? I DON'T GET IT!

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.600
The plane touches the window? Why is that funny?

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:14.800
ANSWER ME!

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.120
So he gets to the Eskimo village, where...oh, God...this isn't inaccurate at all, is it?

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.760
It's like if The Pola Express meets The Flintstones.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.140
I'll give the film credit, though...

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.200
At least they did get Native American Graham Greene to play an Eskimo here.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.280
I mean, it's not like they got Kathy Bates, spray-painted her face and slapped on a black wig like a minstrel show--

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.340
NO! NO!

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.180
You go back to your room, movie, until you learn something about being racially sensitive!

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.360

THIS ISN'T FUNNY! THIS IS JUST RANDOM! ARE YOU EVEN TRYING?!

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.100
And just when you think this movie couldn't possibly get more insulting,

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.700
just watch what they do with their grandfather, played by Good Burger survivor Abe Vigoda.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.620
North: What do you mean, it's 'time to flow'?

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.480
Eskimo Mom: Well, when an Eskimo gets too old or weak to contribute to society...

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.100
Good fuckity God!

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.460
Eskimo Mom: Oh, don't worry about him, North.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.640
He's had a great life, and he's happy to set sail before he starts embarrassing himself.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.780
Let's go! Don't act like you don't know what's going on! Come on! Let's go!

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:53.380
NC: First of all: when this was done, it was done in times of famine, not just because they were old.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:58.000
Second: This was incredibly RARE and only done as a last resort.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.020
Third: this happened EONS ago! Nobody does it anymore!

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:08.100
I mean, did you do ANY research? Do you know ANYTHING about how the world works?

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.620
READ A FUCKING BOOK!

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:17.240
Meanwhile, back at home, the real parents of North are put on display in a museum, because I guess they're still comatose.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.100
And apparently Rob Reiner thinks this is still funny.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.580
Museum Curator: I'll now take questions.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.020
NC: "Yes...how long are you going to milk this joke?"

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.340
Oh, and remember that newspaper kid who printed the story originally?

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.840
Yeah...the film suddenly decided he's a villain.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:36.420
You see, all the kids in the world are now threatening to leave their folks and hire Jon Lovitz as their lawyer,

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:43.460
which somehow propels him and his new partner, the child newspaper editor, into being the most powerful and richest people in the world.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.600
Okay...

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:50.660
Winchell: As we speak, grown-ups across this great land of ours are feeling humiliated.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.280
They blame North for all their frustrations.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:59.480
Do you realize how many of those angry parents would like nothing better than to do away with our little friend?

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.960
My God! It's a young Dick Cheney!

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.260
Lawyer: But for North to be martyred...

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.120
Doesn't he have to be KILLED by one of those angry parents?

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.680
Winchell: Well...

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.480
Maybe we'll get lucky.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.620
NC: It IS Dick Cheney! AAAAAHHHHHHH!

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.540
So North then travels to--oh, great. We're making fun of the Amish, now. Wonderful. Classy.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.120
Amish Dad: I am thy new father.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.800
And this good woman, who art my wife...art thy new mother.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.940
And these are thy new brothers, who art named Ezekiel...

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.600
North: I have always dreamt of a life without the ever-present nuisance of electricity.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.760
Uh...just let me grab something from the plane...

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:35.440
Floor it!

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.820
(plane quickly taking off)

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.240
Well...at least their cruelty to the Amish was short.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.480
So he goes to Africa where everyone, of course, is in a grass hut...

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.000
drops by China, where everyone hails him as some sort of emperor...

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:58.000
Why don't you just have him drop by France, where everyone wears berets, smokes, drinks wine, and every TV channel has 24 hours of Jerry Lewis--

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.100
It's the next scene, isn't it?

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.200
(laughter)

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.860
YOU ARE SCUM!!!

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.520
Finally, North seems to come across a nice family with a father played by John Ritter.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.140
They have a white picket fence, eat dinner together, and even gave birth to Scarlett Johansson.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.040
That was nice of them.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.880
Yup...they treat North like he's one of their own.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.000
The only downside is this would be his new brother.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.600
Henry (from The Good Son): That was a darling story, Mark.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.080
(screaming)

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.800
NC: So while his new family seems downright perfect,

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.840
North, FOR SOME REASON, still isn't satisfied.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.340
Dad 4: North, we just don't understand why you're leaving.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.360
North: Neither do I.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.900
NC: (as North) "The script forgot to give me a reason, so..."

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.380
"Bye!"

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.020
North: Just gotta be alone...

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.460
Mom 4: We're going to miss you, too...

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.380
(bark)

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.140
Daughter: And so will Oliver.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.260
NC: Thank you. And I look forward to seeing your ass in Lost in Translation.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.620
(whispering) It's gonna look great!

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:56.500
So he walks back to New York, uncertain of what he's gonna do, when he suddenly bumps into...

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.280
Narrator: He sits down next to a beautiful young lady...

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.420
NC: Shhh!

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.220
(whispering) If you walk by quietly, maybe he won't notice you.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.540
(door opening)

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.420
Son of a bitch.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.540
Narrator: Joey Fingers. Nice to see you. And you are?

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.280
North: North.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.040
Narrator: Always been one of my favorite directions.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.300
NC: Huh...this film is so bad, you'd think they would have used that joke earlier.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.380
But nope...they were SAVING it!

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:22.880
So North wonders what he's gonna do when the mythical powers of Willis' wisdom finally puts everything into perspective.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.060
You've realized something it takes most people a whole lifetime to figure out...

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.300
and some people never figure it out at all...

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.900
that "a bird in the hand is always greener than the grass under the other guy's bushes".

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.280
NC: I hate you.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:42.680
So Willis drops him off at the airport so North can meet up with his folks, who I guess finally snapped out of their coma.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.800
Narrator: And remember, Kid, if you can't stand the heat, stay out of Miami.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.900
North: What does that metaphor mean?

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:48.620
Narrator: What metaphor?

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.040
You ever been down there in August?

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.300
Your balls stick to your leg like Krazy Glue!

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.780
NC: You know...FOR KIDS!

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.300
Airport Clerk: Where do you think you're going?

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.400
North: I'm going home.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.780
Clerk: Not on this plane, you're not.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.160
North: Why not?

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.560
Clerk: It says here you're dead.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:01.580
North: But I'm not!

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:02.660
Clerk: How can I be sure?

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.020
North: I'm standing here talking to you.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.500
Clerk: I know, and that scares me.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.580
And since I don't scare--

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.700
NC: And one uninspired comedy routine later...

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:09.760
Boy 1: What's he doing here?

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.460
Boy 2: He's trying to get back to his old parents!

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.760
Boy 3: It'll ruin everything! Let's get him!

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.980
NC: So the kids chase him down when suddenly--

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.160
Okay, wait a minute...that was TWO MINUTES without a Willis cameo.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.540
That's not even enough time to change costumes!

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.600
North: What are you? Some kind of guardian angel?

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.280
Narrator: Well, I guess you can say that.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.780
Because in a manner of speaking, we at Federal Express feel that we are guardians...

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.560
Guardians of your most important packages and priority communiques.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.800
Voice: "Our creepy Bruce Willis stalkers are here to serve you."

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.760
NC: So Willis finally gets him home, as it turns out his parents aren't there.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.840
They're at his secret spot--which apparently wasn't so secret if they knew about it--waiting for him to show.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.060
And who else should be there but the judge, of course, wearing the robe and everything.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.860
North's Dad: All right...you wait here. I'll go look for him.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:52.420
North's Mom: Good idea!

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.300
Judge: Bad idea!

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:57.140
Let me remind you, the ruling stipulates that North is supposed to be in the arms of both parents.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.920
That's two parents and four arms.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.400
NC: You know, no offense, Judge, but I'd put more stock in the Dancing Itos.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.700
They at least had a little bit more class than you do.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:11.000
So North rushes to his secret spot as the spawn of Cheney apparently has a henchmen there WAITING TO KILL HIM.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:15.380
Just how powerful is this kid? Does he also have an army of demons at his beck and call?

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.460
♪ (orchestral music) ♪

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.580
Lurtz: Find the halfling!

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.980
Find the halfling!

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:29.440
NC: So North rushes toward his parents, the henchman gets out his gun, pulls the trigger and...

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.600
It was all a dream.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.880
(growling with rising anger)

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.640
WHAAAAAAAT?!

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:46.920
You actually went to the lowest common denominator and made it all a dream?!

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.900
You ASS of SHIT!

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.020
Narrator: You still here?

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.580
North: I must have fallen asleep...

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.160
Narrator: Come on...I'll give you a ride home.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.640
NC: Yeah...along with all the other great lessons of this movie, take rides from strangers.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.660
Especially if they dress up like the Easter Bunny. That's a good idea.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.060
North: Thanks a lot, Mister.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.280
Narrator: Don't mention it, kid.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:05.580
And remember...

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.340
Be it ever so humble...

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.280
There's no place like home.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:16.540
NC: Yup...an hour-and-a-half of unfunny jokes, ethnic sterotypes and hate-filled stupidity just for something you'd see on a welcome mat.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.420
I hope you enjoyed this journey of racist insensitivity.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.760
Allow us to replace the credits with the words "We're Sorry" 100 times!

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.900
NC: This movie is...amazing.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.660
It actually goes beyond belief.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:34.520
In today's PC world, for a film like this to get made, let alone for kids...it's scary as shit!

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.320
How could anyone greenlight this? How could anyone sign on for it?

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:42.980
How could they get all these big-name stars for such an ugly piece of cinematic prostitution?

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:47.180
Maybe Rob Reiner thought he had too many good films and needed a bad film to even it out.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.220
Personally, I see now why Siskel and Ebert HATED this film so much.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.920
And I REALLY agree with Roger Ebert when he ended his review by saying...

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.280
Ebert: I hated this movie!

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.100
Hated, hated, hated, hated, HATED this movie!

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:04.180
Hated it! Hated every simpering, stupid, vacant, audience-insulting moment of it!

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.780
YOU'RE TOO FUCKING NICE!

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.680
I'm the Nostalgia Critic! I remember it so you won't have to!

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:16.640
Ebert: Hated it!
