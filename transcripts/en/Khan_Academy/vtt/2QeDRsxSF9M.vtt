00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.614
I'm thinking about
buying a restaurant,

00:00:02.614 --> 00:00:04.030
so I go and ask
the current owner,

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.920
what is the distribution
of the number of customers

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.954
you get each day?

00:00:07.954 --> 00:00:09.870
And he says, oh, I've
already figure that out.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.372
And he gives me
this distribution

00:00:11.372 --> 00:00:13.830
over here, which essentially
says 10% of his customers come

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.080
in on Monday, 10% on
Tuesday, 15% on Wednesday,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.250
so forth, and so on.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.570
They're closed on Sunday.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.760
So this is 100% of the
customers for a week.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.466
If you add that
up, you get 100%.

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.090
I obviously am a
little bit suspicious,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.010
so I decide to see how good
this distribution that he's

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.200
describing actually
fits observed data.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.406
So I actually observe the number
of customers, when they come in

00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:36.780
during the week,
and this is what

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.750
I get from my observed data.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.820
So to figure out whether
I want to accept or reject

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.480
his hypothesis right
here, I'm going

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.140
to do a little bit
of a hypothesis test.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:57.950
So I'll make the null hypothesis
that the owner's distribution--

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.220
so that's this thing
right here-- is correct.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.670
And then the
alternative hypothesis

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.500
is going to be that
it is not correct,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.600
that it is not a
correct distribution,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.310
that I should not feel
reasonably OK relying on this.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.410
It's not the correct--
I should reject

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.070
the owner's distribution.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.340
And I want to do this with
a significance level of 5%.

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:28.500
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.420
I'm going to calculate a
statistic based on this data

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.060
right here.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.520
And it's going to be
chi-square statistic.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.030
Or another way to view
it is it that statistic

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.560
that I'm going to
calculate has approximately

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.720
a chi-square distribution.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.009
And given that it does have
a chi-square distribution

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.800
with a certain number
of degrees of freedom

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.930
and we're going to calculate
that, what I want to see

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.700
is the probability of
getting this result,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.320
or getting a result like
this or a result more extreme

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.159
less than 5%.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.700
If the probability of getting
a result like this or something

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.180
less likely than
this is less than 5%,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.780
then I'm going to reject
the null hypothesis, which

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.919
is essentially just rejecting
the owner's distribution.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.540
If I don't get
that, if I say, hey,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.990
the probability of getting
a chi-square statistic that

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.070
is this extreme or more
is greater than my alpha,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.570
than my significance level,
then I'm not going to reject it.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.236
I'm going to say,
well, I have no reason

00:02:26.236 --> 00:02:28.200
to really assume
that he's lying.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.670
So let's do that.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.790
So to calculate the chi-square
statistic, what I'm going to do

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.361
is-- so here we're assuming
the owner's distribution is

00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:36.860
correct.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.330
So assuming the
owner's distribution

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.790
was correct, what would have
been the expected observed?

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.680
So we have expected
percentage here,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.639
but what would have been
the expected observed?

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.971
So let me write this right here.

00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:53.700
Expected.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.950
I'll add another row, Expected.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.970
So we would have expected
10% of the total customers

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.490
in that week to
come in on Monday,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.160
10% of the total
customers of that week

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.900
to come in on Tuesday, 15%
to come in on Wednesday.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.070
Now to figure out what
the actual number is,

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.540
we need to figure out the
total number of customers.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.100
So let's add up these
numbers right here.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.790
So we have-- I'll get
the calculator out.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:26.600
So we have 30 plus 14 plus
34 plus 45 plus 57 plus 20.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.470
So there's a total
of 200 customers who

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.830
came into the
restaurant that week.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.410
So let me write this down.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.850
So this is equal to-- so I
wrote the total over here.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.960
Ignore this right here.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.270
I had 200 customers
come in for the week.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.530
So what was the expected
number on Monday?

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.700
Well, on Monday, we would
have expected 10% of the 200

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.330
to come in.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.020
So this would have been 20
customers, 10% times 200.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.670
On Tuesday, another 10%.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.860
So we would have
expected 20 customers.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.210
Wednesday, 15% of 200,
that's 30 customers.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.310
On Thursday, we would have
expected 20% of 200 customers,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.430
so that would have
been 40 customers.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.080
Then on Friday, 30%, that
would have been 60 customers.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.900
And then on Friday 15% again.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.110
15% of 200 would have
been 30 customers.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.110
So if this distribution
is correct,

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.690
this is the actual number
that I would have expected.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.700
Now to calculate
chi-square statistic,

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.510
we essentially just take--
let me just show it to you,

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.700
and instead of
writing chi, I'm going

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.010
to write capital X squared.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.000
Sometimes someone will write the
actual Greek letter chi here.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.692
But I'll write the
x squared here.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:36.900
And let me write it this way.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:45.462
This is our
chi-square statistic,

00:04:45.462 --> 00:04:47.920
but I'm going to write it with
a capital X instead of a chi

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.042
because this is going
to have approximately

00:04:50.042 --> 00:04:52.190
a chi-squared distribution.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.640
I can't assume
that it's exactly,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.490
so this is where we're dealing
with approximations right here.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.380
But it's fairly
straightforward to calculate.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.230
For each of the days,
we take the difference

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.420
between the observed
and expected.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.340
So it's going to
be 30 minus 20--

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.010
I'll do the first one
color coded-- squared

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.340
divided by the expected.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.200
So we're essentially
taking the square

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.650
of almost you could kind of
do the error between what

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.727
we observed and expected or
the difference between what

00:05:21.727 --> 00:05:24.060
we observed and expect, and
we're kind of normalizing it

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.900
by the expected right over here.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.210
But we want to take the
sum of all of these.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.950
So I'll just do all
of those in yellow.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:44.570
So plus 14 minus 20 squared
over 20 plus 34 minus 30 squared

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:54.300
over 30 plus-- I'll continue
over here-- 45 minus 40 squared

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:04.550
over 40 plus 57 minus
60 squared over 60,

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:12.710
and then finally, plus 20
minus 30 squared over 30.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.930
I just took the observed
minus the expected

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.290
squared over the expected.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.890
I took the sum of
it, and this is

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.370
what gives us our
chi-square statistic.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.080
Now let's just calculate what
this number is going to be.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.671
So this is going to be equal
to-- I'll do it over here

00:06:26.671 --> 00:06:27.920
so you don't run out of space.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.860
So we'll do this a new color.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.820
We'll do it in orange.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.140
This is going to be
equal to 30 minus 20

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:40.752
is 10 squared, which is 100
divided by 20, which is 5.

00:06:40.752 --> 00:06:43.210
I might not be able to do all
of them in my head like this.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.090
Plus, actually, let me
just write it this way

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.830
just so you can
see what I'm doing.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.250
This right here is 100
over 20 plus 14 minus 20

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.170
is negative 6 squared
is positive 36.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.570
So plus 36 over 20.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.040
Plus 34 minus 30 is
4, squared is 16.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.140
So plus 16 over 30.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.230
Plus 45 minus 40
is 5 squared is 25.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.550
So plus 25 over 40.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.050
Plus the difference
here is 3 squared is 9,

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.370
so it's 9 over 60.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:27.442
Plus we have a difference of
10 squared is plus 100 over 30.

00:07:27.442 --> 00:07:29.900
And this is equal to-- and I'll
just get the calculator out

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:36.500
for this-- this is
equal to, we have

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.560
100 divided by 20
plus 36 divided by 20

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:49.300
plus 16 divided by 30
plus 25 divided by 40

00:07:49.300 --> 00:08:02.260
plus 9 divided by 60 plus 100
divided by 30 gives us 11.44.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.390
So let me write that down.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:10.290
So this right here
is going to be 11.44.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.260
This is my chi-square
statistic, or we

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.890
could call it a big
capital X squared.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.970
Sometimes you'll have it
written as a chi-square,

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.990
but this statistic is
going to have approximately

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.780
a chi-square distribution.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.430
Anyway, with that
said, let's figure out,

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.000
if we assume that it has roughly
a chi-square distribution, what

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.720
is the probability of getting a
result this extreme or at least

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.520
this extreme, I guess is another
way of thinking about it.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.750
Or another way of saying, is
this a more extreme result

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.450
than the critical
chi-square value

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.491
that there's a 5% chance of
getting a result that extreme?

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:46.490
So let's do it that way.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.610
Let's figure out the
critical chi-square value.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.420
And if this is more
extreme than that,

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.280
then we will reject
our null hypothesis.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.900
So let's figure out our
critical chi-square values.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.207
So we have an alpha of 5%.

00:08:58.207 --> 00:09:00.290
And actually the other
thing we have to figure out

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.080
is the degrees of freedom.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.470
The degrees of freedom, we're
taking one, two, three, four,

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.380
five, six sums, so
you might be tempted

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.240
to say the degrees
of freedom are six.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.960
But one thing to
realize is that if you

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.310
had all of this
information over here,

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:19.650
you could actually figure out
this last piece of information,

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.720
so you actually have
five degrees of freedom.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.390
When you have just kind of
n data points like this,

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.950
and you're measuring kind of
the observed versus expected,

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.090
your degrees of freedom
are going to be n minus 1,

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.336
because you could figure
out that nth data point just

00:09:31.336 --> 00:09:32.960
based on everything
else that you have,

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.970
all of the other information.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.255
So our degrees of freedom
here are going to be 5.

00:09:37.255 --> 00:09:39.540
It's n minus 1.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.010
So our significance level is 5%.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:48.230
And our degrees of freedom is
also going to be equal to 5.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.080
So let's look at our
chi-square distribution.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.690
We have a degree
of freedom of 5.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.320
We have a significance
level of 5%.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.914
And so the critical
chi-square value is 11.07.

00:10:03.914 --> 00:10:05.080
So let's go with this chart.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.340
So we have a
chi-squared distribution

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.980
with a degree of freedom of 5.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.050
So that's this distribution
over here in magenta.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:16.500
And we care about a
critical value of 11.07.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.417
So this is right here.

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:19.208
Oh, you actually even
can't see it on this.

00:10:19.208 --> 00:10:21.410
So if I were to keep drawing
this magenta thing all

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:26.780
the way over here, if the
magenta line just kept going,

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.630
over here, you'd have 8.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.010
Over here you'd have 10.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.000
Over here, you'd have 12.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.110
11.07 is maybe some
place right over there.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.390
So what it's saying
is the probability

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:50.219
of getting a result at least
as extreme as 11.07 is 5%.

00:10:50.219 --> 00:10:51.510
So we could write it even here.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:58.370
Our critical chi-square value is
equal to-- we just saw-- 11.07.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.000
Let me look at the chart again.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.170
11.07.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.260
The result we got
for our statistic

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.450
is even less likely than that.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.140
The probability is less
than our significance level.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.120
So then we are going to reject.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.180
So the probability
of getting that is--

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:26.740
let me put it this
way-- 11.44 is

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:31.180
more extreme than our
critical chi-square level.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.720
So it's very unlikely that
this distribution is true.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:41.880
So we will reject
what he's telling us.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.660
We will reject
this distribution.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:48.000
It's not a good fit based
on this significance level.
