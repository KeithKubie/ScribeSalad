00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.989
A new study says if you wanna lose weight,
low-carb is the way to go!

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:08.050
You heard it here: you can eat all the fat
you want now!

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:16.070
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and over the
past couple of decades, the low-carb diet

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.770
has been front and center in almost every
single diet plan out there.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.930
The problem is, there haven’t been any long-term
studies, showing that it’s more effective

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.990
for weight loss than a low-fat diet.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.990
UNTIL NOW.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.900
A new study published this week in the Annals
of Internal Medicine, followed 150 obese men

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.370
and women for an entire year - who were randomly
assigned to either a low-carb or a low-fat

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.370
diet.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.989
About half of the participants were white,
the other half were black - and none of them

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.100
had any history of heart problems or diabetes
when the study began.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.830
People in the low-carb group were asked to
eat fewer than 40 grams of carbohydrates a

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.780
day, while those in the low-fat group were
asked to keep their daily calorie intake at

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.870
less than 30% calories from fat and 55% calories
from carbs.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.829
Neither group was explicitly asked to restrict
their total number of calories, but they did

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.580
attend a series of nutritional and support
sessions over the course of the study.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.140
And after the year was over, the results pretty
much spoke for themselves.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.640
The participants were who on low-carb diets,
lost an average total of 12 pounds, versus

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.440
only about 4 pounds for people on low-fat
diets.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.119
That’s a pretty significant difference - but
what’s even better, is that their heart

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.640
health actually improved on a low-carb diet.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.090
They had less inflammation, as well as better
cholesterol and improved triglyceride levels

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.530
- two key hallmarks of good cardiovascular
health.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.920
Also interesting, is the fact that people
on low-carb diets, lost weight - but also

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.450
increased their lean muscle mass.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.280
On the flip side, people in the low-fat group,
actually lost more muscle, compared to fat.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.380
Of course, this study only examined the effects
of those diets for a year, so it’s unclear

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.090
how they’d fare over 3, 5, or even 10 years
- but for the short term at least, it seems

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.660
low-carb is absolutely the way to go.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.049
Even if you don’t need to lose weight, the
benefits it has for your heart - are pretty

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.049
undeniable.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.140
And while we’re on the topic of things that
are good for you, let me remind everyone that

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.680
I host another show here on Discovery, called
Anyhoo.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.039
And a couple weeks ago, we did an episode
on salt - and all of the myths surrounding

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:18.620
it.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.780
So if you wanna know more about that, feel
free to check us out at youtube.com/revision3.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.260
In the meantime, let us know in the comments
below if you’ve gone on a diet - and which

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.310
one was most successful for you.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.439
That’s all for me, but as always - thank
you guys for watching.
