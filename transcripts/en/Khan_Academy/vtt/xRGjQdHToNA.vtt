00:00:00.435 --> 00:00:01.923
- [Paige] Hello Grammarians, Hello David.

00:00:01.923 --> 00:00:02.883
- [David] Hello Paige.

00:00:02.883 --> 00:00:04.035
- [Paige] So today, we're gonna talk about

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:06.723
apostrophes and plurals.

00:00:06.723 --> 00:00:08.312
We talked about this a little bit in our

00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:10.729
Introduction to the Apostrophe video.

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:15.400
This is a very, very rare case,
where we use an apostrophe

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.429
to show that something is plural,

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.051
and it almost never happens,

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:20.538
but we will explain when it does.

00:00:20.538 --> 00:00:22.896
- [David] Paige, when is the one time

00:00:22.896 --> 00:00:25.488
in this immense and
wonderful galaxy of English

00:00:25.488 --> 00:00:28.097
when the stars align
for it to be permissible

00:00:28.097 --> 00:00:31.521
to pluralize something with an apostrophe?

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:34.688
- [Paige] That one time is
when you are pluralizing

00:00:34.688 --> 00:00:36.355
a lower case letter.

00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:39.824
If you're saying something
like, "You need to remember

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:43.106
" to always dot your i's,"
where you're talking about

00:00:43.106 --> 00:00:47.168
the letter I, and there
are several of them,

00:00:47.168 --> 00:00:49.744
you're gonna put an
apostrophe before the S.

00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:53.584
- [David] OK, so that's to
prevent it from looking like is,

00:00:53.584 --> 00:00:56.224
right, 'cause if we didn't
have that apostrophe in there,

00:00:56.224 --> 00:00:59.329
it would just be the word is.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.441
There's no way to tell I's
from the word is in that case.

00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:05.234
- [Paige] Right, and
you need to remember to

00:01:05.234 --> 00:01:08.065
always dot your is,
doesn't make any sense.

00:01:08.065 --> 00:01:09.398
- [David] Right.

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:12.981
- [Paige] This apostrophe can look like

00:01:12.981 --> 00:01:16.149
it's making the letter I possessive,

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.725
but it's really just there
to make it clear that

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:20.225
this is a plural I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.206
and not is.

00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:26.299
- [David] So this is the only case.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.574
If it were upper case letters,

00:01:29.574 --> 00:01:32.642
you wouldn't do this, right.

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:36.003
If you were saying David's capital As

00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:37.336
look like trees.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.482
It's less likely that
you're gonna gonna confuse

00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:45.282
capital A, lower case S in
the middle of a sentence

00:01:45.282 --> 00:01:47.314
for the word as.

00:01:47.314 --> 00:01:48.930
- [Paige] Right, 'cause you
wouldn't just capitalize

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.801
the word as in the middle of a sentence.

00:01:50.801 --> 00:01:52.151
- [David] Right.

00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:56.072
So this is for only lower case letters,

00:01:56.072 --> 00:01:58.696
the little ones, the inside voice.

00:01:58.696 --> 00:02:00.215
(laughing)

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:03.016
Paige, that's it, right?
- [Paige] Yeah.

00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:04.329
- [David] That's the only exception,

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.760
that's the only time you use apostrophes

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.498
to form the plural, no other time.

00:02:09.498 --> 00:02:11.738
So if you're talking
about, doesn't matter,

00:02:11.738 --> 00:02:14.888
if you're talking about CDs,

00:02:14.888 --> 00:02:15.721
or DVDs,

00:02:16.676 --> 00:02:17.509
or MP3s,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.687
or whatever you kids are
listening to these days,

00:02:21.687 --> 00:02:24.340
it doesn't matter, there's no need for an

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.676
apostrophe in any of these places.

00:02:26.676 --> 00:02:27.893
- [Paige] Right, 'cause
that's pretty clear.

00:02:27.893 --> 00:02:30.484
- [David] You just use a lower case S,

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:31.588
but if you're trying to talk about

00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:36.533
multiple lower case letters,
then you use an apostrophe.

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:39.032
- [Paige] Yeah, so if
you're trying to figure out

00:02:39.032 --> 00:02:41.719
how to make something
plural, and you're like,

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.142
"Do I use an apostrophe?"

00:02:43.142 --> 00:02:46.142
No, unless it's a lower case letter.

00:02:47.126 --> 00:02:48.439
You can learn anything.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.272
- [David] David out.

00:02:49.272 --> 00:02:50.198
- [Paige] Paige out.
