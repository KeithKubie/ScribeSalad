PRESENTER: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.840
Thank you for coming to
Authors@Google Presents Brad

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.820
Stone, the author of "Amazon
and the Everything Store:

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.566
Jeff Bezos and the
Age of Amazon."

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:17.040
It's great to see all you
here this Friday afternoon.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.690
I want to start by
introducing Brad.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.170
Brad has been
covering technology

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.350
in Silicon Valley
for over 14 years,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.150
for publications such
as "Newsweek," "New York

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.200
Times," and "Bloomberg
Businessweek."

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.840
Since you hit it off
the ground, Brad,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.530
I was just wondering how did
you come up with this idea?

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.990
How did the project get started?

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.960
What was really the
spark of creativity

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.500
that led you to write this book?

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.530
BRAD STONE: Sure.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.310
Well, I'll start with a
little bit of my history

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.330
covering technology.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.280
So I moved out here to the Bay
Area in the late '90s, 1998,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.484
to cover-- I would say I
was working for "Newsweek,"

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.900
but I'll say I was working for
the magazine formerly known

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.140
as "Newsweek," since
it really doesn't exist

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.770
in that incarnation anymore.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.180
And I moved out here to cover
what was really, to New York

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.920
media, like a foreign country.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.650
I was the correspondent
to Silicon Valley.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.890
And I was covering their
very early days of Google,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.770
and Apple's
resurgence, and Yahoo,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.060
and all the start-up energy
during the dot-com boom.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.200
And occasionally I
would go up to Seattle

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.830
to-- actually the big
story then was Microsoft.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.950
But I remember my
first trip to Amazon.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.280
It was-- I think it
was actually in 2001.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.000
I had covered the company before
then, but I visited in 2001.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.560
And they were in this old
hospital up on a hilltop south

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.910
of downtown Seattle.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.040
And the Nisqually earthquake
had just happened.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.370
And you couldn't actually
walk into the front door.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.070
You had to go snake around
through a small door

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.890
in the back.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.610
And there was a big sign
warning of falling bricks.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.790
And there were people
with hard hats all around.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.980
And it was a perfect metaphor
for the company at the time.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.300
Because they had ascended to
great heights in the '90s.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.960
And Jeff Bezos was
"Time" Man of the Year.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.080
And the stock price
was through the roof.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.830
And they were expanding
in all directions.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.249
And then it all pretty
much came crumbling down

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:07.290
in the span of two years.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.680
It was a single-digit stock.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.609
Bezos was kind of a pinata.

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:12.900
And I was there to talk to him.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.760
And at the time he
was very voluble.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.600
He actually spent
the first two years

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.200
trying to create
the Amazon brand,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.970
and then spent about two
years trying to rescue it,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.420
talking to everybody about
why it was a real company.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.510
And that was sort of my first
experience in a room with Jeff.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.210
And over the next 12 years, I
followed the company closely

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.210
for "Newsweek," then
"The New York Times,"

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.400
and now "Bloomberg
Business Week."

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.140
And the inspiration
for the book--

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.810
to get back around
to your question--

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.190
was actually in some ways
inspired by you guys here.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.080
Because I have a close friend
and colleague, Steven Levy,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.330
who I worked with
at "Newsweek," who

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.180
wrote a great book about
Google called "In the Plex."

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.990
And I read that book.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.069
And Steven's kind
of a mentor to me.

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.110
And around the same time
that that book came out,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.350
there was "Steve Jobs," by
Walter Isaacson, and of course

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.280
there had been some
Facebook books.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.160
And I thought, here are all the
companies changing our world.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.790
And these are all great
books with insider access.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.720
And the great Amazon book
has never been written.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.600
And that is no coincidence.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.620
I mean, I would argue that
Google endeavours to be better

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.080
understood by the outside world.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.410
And that's why you guys have
given several journalists

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.730
access-- at least some measure
of access-- to the company

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.370
to tell its story.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.240
Whereas-- I don't
want to say Amazon

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.810
wants to be
misunderstood-- but I

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.260
think they're comfortable
with the lack of attention.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.430
And we could talk
about why that is.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.260
So I knew enough at the time,
when I decided to do this,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.010
that I wasn't going
to ask for permission.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.580
I was going to beg for
forgiveness afterwards.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.040
And because In the Plex, and
because Steve Jobs had gotten

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.310
so much attention, and also
because the world in New York

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.470
publishers-- everyone
was going to bed

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.230
and waking up
thinking about Amazon.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.830
It's top of mind right
now, because Amazon's

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.660
their biggest distributor and
also their biggest challenger,

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.480
because Amazon's self-publishing
now-- publishing authors.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.209
I got some interest in the book.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.410
And then I went to talk to Jeff,
and tell them I was doing it.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.740
And as a result, I got a pretty
good measure of cooperation.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.240
He allowed me to talk to
family members, and friends,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.100
and Amazon senior executives,
while remaining pretty arm's

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.820
length, himself.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.010
Because,
extraordinarily, he said

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.532
it was too early to tell
the Amazon story, which,

00:04:39.532 --> 00:04:41.990
when you think about how much
they've accomplished over two

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.920
decades, is I think insightful
as to his ambitions.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.550
But I drew on my
many conversations

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.550
with him over the years.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.000
And the result is the book.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.985
PRESENTER: I wanted to
start with this idea

00:04:54.985 --> 00:04:56.860
that I've been thinking
a lot about recently,

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.985
after having read the book.

00:04:57.985 --> 00:05:01.060
And it's the title, "It's
the Everything Store."

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.240
And I think here at Google,
we're a search company

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.740
first-- not only
a search company,

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.640
but that's our bread and butter.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.130
And do you believe
that there would ever

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.050
be a point where,
if there truly were

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.880
a single store, virtual or
otherwise, that sold everything

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.740
on Earth, would it become
too much for consumers?

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.350
Would there kind of be a trend
in the opposite direction?

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.670
Would it just--

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.670
BRAD STONE: Well, right.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.460
I think, in some ways,
we're seeing that.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.450
Amazon is hugely
dominant in e-commerce.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.800
And yet there's no lack
of e-commerce innovation.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.540
There's lots of startups
that have finally figured out

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.010
that there's plenty of
invention that you can do,

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.240
if you're outside of
Amazon's backyard.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.770
But it's interesting.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.460
Why has it become
the everything store?

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.070
Why is it not just a
retailer, but why do they

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.670
sell digital products,
and hardware,

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.390
and now enterprise services
with the Cloud business?

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.690
And that's Jeff.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.290
He's just so relentless in
driving into new markets

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.320
and finding new
opportunities for Amazon,

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.170
in part, because they had to.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.580
They were early.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.300
He left Wall Street to start
Amazon in 1994 with this idea

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.930
that you could start an
"everything" store with books,

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.440
because they were very
portable and shippable.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.450
And there were two
major distributors,

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.040
so you could find them easily.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.080
And it worked, but it
wasn't a great business.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.690
And when he started expanding
it wasn't a great business.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:32.910
And even though they
raised a lot of money,

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.670
they were really never all that
profitable in the early years.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.250
So he's always been
on a sort of march.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.250
I mean, you guys,
search, right away--

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.820
well, OK, not right away, but
by conjoining the advertising

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.880
business was a great
high-margin, profitable

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.600
business.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.810
And Amazon sort all along
has been on a mission

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.490
to kind of invent their way
out of their original business

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.460
model.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.918
PRESENTER: Going along with
that, with what you were saying

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:02.070
with some of the challenges, and
just the running the business--

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.930
you talk a lot throughout
the book about chaos

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.080
and Amazon's
relationship to chaos.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.230
And just how, especially
early in the day,

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.900
they were just really
growing so fast that it

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.410
was difficult for them to
keep everything in order.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.080
And, I believe it was in either
'99 or 2000, Jeff turned things

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.315
around, and said, we're going
to stop growing big fast.

00:07:23.315 --> 00:07:24.940
And we're going to
get things in order.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:30.330
And he said the company
would be profitable by 2001.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.080
What's been your perspective,
having watched the company

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.850
from the beginning, and seeing
all of these different goals,

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.730
and this relationship that
Amazon has with profitability,

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.399
that the stock market
loves monitoring?

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:45.440
BRAD STONE: Right, right.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.648
And in fact, yesterday they
announced their earnings.

00:07:47.648 --> 00:07:51.360
And they lost money, and the
stock is-- I think it's up 10%

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:51.890
today.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.500
So it's sort of the
perennial Amazon paradox.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.870
But there are different
contradictions throughout time.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.730
So at the beginning,
a lot of companies

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.930
were allowed free capital
and plenty of runway

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.776
to go build their businesses
in this great land grab.

00:08:05.776 --> 00:08:07.400
And then, the point
you're referencing,

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.150
he had to change gears, to
his-- probably-- horror in 2001,

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.570
when the stock market crashed.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.450
And they demanded profitability.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.030
And they laid people off.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.590
And they stopped adding
new product assortment

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:21.380
for a few years.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.756
And they had to close the
whole fulfillment center,

00:08:22.756 --> 00:08:23.930
and it was a disaster.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:28.350
And I tell that story,
and it's remarkable.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.710
Because the Amazon
today-- we all

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.900
forget that they went through
a period of having to shrink

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.340
and actually lay people off.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.000
What's happening now, in terms
of its lack of profitability,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.700
is much different.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.790
So in about 2008,
2009, the Amazon model

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.170
starts to really work.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.920
In fact, this whole time eBay
has been valued more highly

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.340
than Amazon. eBay was supposedly
the perfect store, and none

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.660
of the gritty details
of distribution.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.690
But Amazon's model,
particularly Prime,

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.057
the loyalty that
inspired with customers,

00:09:04.057 --> 00:09:06.640
and all the work they had done
to figure out their fulfillment

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.450
centers-- the mechanics of
just getting all these products

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.180
from point A, in the warehouses,
to point B, to people's doors.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.810
And they figured out
they've mastered chaos.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.170
And they actually show
pretty good profits

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.930
for a couple of years.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.330
And that's when all the
institutional shareholders come

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.580
in and the stock price goes
way up at the same time,

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.920
as a matter of fact, that
eBay is kind of engulfed

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.760
by its chaos.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.270
It has never figured out
the complexity of shipping.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.860
And the experience on
eBay, at the same time,

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.510
is getting worse, while
Amazon's is getting better.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.380
And, in fact, not to really
get off the topic, but eBay

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.630
was, at that time, looking
for growth elsewhere.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.390
It went and bought Skype and
Paypal, which worked out,

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.210
and lots of Craigslist-type
classified ads.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.140
And so they switch places.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.070
And Amazon starts
to become uttered

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:58.460
in the same breath as
Google, and even now Apple.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.310
So to get back to the
profitability question,

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.970
I mean, they just
had inspired a lot

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.339
of faith in their
long-term shareholders

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:07.630
and then the analysts that
covered them on Wall Street.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.800
And, for a few years, they
just called their shots

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.200
very predictably.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.570
And then, about a year ago,
they started to telegraph

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.290
that they were going into
another investment phase,

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.540
and building fulfillment
centers all over the country.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:24.080
They're building one
right down the 580,

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.200
and getting into new kinds of
hardware, like the Kindle Fire

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.290
tablets, and expanding
internationally,

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.250
and expanding
Amazon Web Services.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.420
And so they're losing money.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.500
But they've projected that
they would lose money.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.940
And so nobody's surprised by it.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.620
And they're so happy to
see that Amazon's grown

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.500
so quickly-- much faster
than the rest of e-commerce--

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.930
and extremely faster
than retail, which

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.670
means they're taking customers
away from their competitors,

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.280
and locking people up.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.914
And those customers
are doing a lot

00:10:52.914 --> 00:10:54.080
of their shopping on Amazon.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.090
And that's why we see the
optimism, particularly

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.310
on days like today.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.370
PRESENTER: You
start the prologue

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.870
of the book talking
about how Amazon loves

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.230
to delight its customers
when something arrives early.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.770
And that actually happened
to me last night, which was--

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.100
BRAD STONE: OK, now you have
to tell us what you got.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.850
PRESENTER: It was
just a hard drive.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.004
I just needed-- I think
my computer hard drive was

00:11:18.004 --> 00:11:19.670
failing, so I just
needed to back it up,

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.111
and I was getting worried.

00:11:21.111 --> 00:11:22.610
And it was supposed
to arrive today.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:23.660
It arrived last night.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.550
Now all my data's
safe and sound.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.990
I'm pretty happy.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.730
Shifting gears a little bit,
because the book is-- just

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.570
like in real life, it's
just as much Amazon

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.170
as it is Jeff Bezos.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.860
And the book is in the same way.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.290
And you open the book
talking about this childhood,

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:44.750
his education, and so on.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.750
I was just left wondering,
during his years

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.390
at D. E. Shaw, when
he first had the idea

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.620
to start Amazon, when
he saw this tsunami that

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:58.410
was the internet coming-- you
wisely, I think, in the book,

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.936
never said whether you
thought he saw something

00:12:01.936 --> 00:12:03.560
that nobody else did,
or if he was just

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.101
at the right place
at the right time.

00:12:05.101 --> 00:12:06.440
How much was this circumstance?

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.970
And how much was it him?

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.950
And these are
intertwined, but I just

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.610
wanted to ask you
your thoughts--

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:12.850
BRAD STONE: Absolutely--

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:13.286
PRESENTER: --and your
opinions on that.

00:12:13.286 --> 00:12:14.369
BRAD STONE: Good question.

00:12:14.369 --> 00:12:15.990
I think it was both.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.470
The reason that chapter one--
So the prologue of the book

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:23.540
starts with an
account of his-- he's

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.772
in sixth grade at a school.

00:12:24.772 --> 00:12:26.230
And there was
actually a woman that

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.260
wrote a book about that school.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.450
And he's referred to with
a pseudonym named Tim.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.240
And so it's just this
incredible account

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.630
of this visionary
figure as a 12th-grader.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.670
But chapter one is D. E. Shaw.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.580
And the reason I
started there is

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.590
because it is an
extraordinary hedge fund.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.070
It is one of the first
quantitative hedge funds,

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.930
so using computers
and algorithms

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.590
to trade stocks and bonds.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.210
But David Shaw, who's a
former computer science

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.240
professor at Columbia,
sees the internet

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.490
coming far sooner than anyone.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.670
And he also has a very different
vision of D. E. Shaw, not as

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.450
a hedge fund, but as
a technology company,

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.890
whose first business is
financial instruments.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.580
And it's because he has
that vision that he's

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.810
hiring not just Wall
Street guys like Bezos,

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:20.040
who had been at Bankers Trust
and a few other Wall Street

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.370
institutions, but
lots of generalists.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.180
In fact, Jeff's wife
worked at D. E. Shaw,

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.780
and she was an English major.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.530
And he really had this vision
that they would expand.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:37.560
And so, in 1993, they've
got these very early reports

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.240
about how the
internet is expanding,

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.950
and how web protocol
is jumping up,

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.320
vis-a-vis other internet
tools of the time.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.800
And he starts
meeting with Bezos.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.990
Shaw and Bezos
were meeting weekly

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:52.940
to talk-- to brainstorm-- the
next business for D. E. Shaw.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.950
And they're brainstorming
a lot of internet ideas.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.700
And one of the ideas
discussed at the time

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.290
is Juno, which is one of the
first free email services,

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.660
and a predecessor to Gmail.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.970
And Farsight Financial Services
comes out of D. E. Shaw.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.580
That's kind of an
E*TRADE of the mid-'90s.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.940
It was acquired, I
think, by Merrill Lynch.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.470
And then they are roughly
speaking about this idea

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.160
called "the everything
store," which

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.410
is actually why I
titled the book that.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.620
And it's this just vague
notion that maybe the internet

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.640
can be an intermediary to
sell any kind of product.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.310
And I don't think they
went any further than that.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.061
But Jeff then went off on his
own, and decided, you know,

00:14:30.061 --> 00:14:31.810
you probably can't do
anything right away.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:35.960
But you should focus on one
thing, and be great at that.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.100
And, as we discussed
before, he selected books.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.480
So I think it was,
in large part,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.072
the culture there
and the environment.

00:14:44.072 --> 00:14:46.280
And he's gone and tried to
recreate something similar

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.440
at Amazon.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.690
But it was also, obviously--
without him, there's

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:52.320
no company.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.150
Because it's then his
relentless and focus,

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.540
and complete
unwillingness to blink

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.180
in moments of the
company's history,

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.460
when all his senior execs--
almost all of them-- leave.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.500
And the world thinks
that he's an idiot.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.160
And the company's
stock is in the tank.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.690
All these idea stories
end up being complicated.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:16.050
But the success of the
company, in large part,

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.347
can be easily credited to
his drive and intellect.

00:15:19.347 --> 00:15:21.680
PRESENTER: To me personally,
one of the most interesting

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.310
little details
about the book-- I'm

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.990
not sure how many of--
everyone here is aware of,

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:33.610
but Jeff personally invested
in Google back in 1998

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:34.717
around Series A, right?

00:15:34.717 --> 00:15:35.425
Right before or--

00:15:35.425 --> 00:15:35.820
BRAD STONE: That's right.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.986
PRESENTER: --right after it.

00:15:36.986 --> 00:15:43.970
And is this, do you think-- So
continuing with that question,

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:47.730
did he just have the foresight
that few other people did?

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.235
And he saw this
great opportunity,

00:15:49.235 --> 00:15:50.590
and he invested into it?

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.820
Or was it just more
it was coming anyways,

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.600
and he just happened
to be there?

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.070
BRAD STONE: I think
it was fortuitous.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:02.100
He had acquired a
company called Junglee.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.630
It was like the first
comparative shopping engine.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.670
And the COO of Junglee
was Ram Shriram,

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.030
one of your board members.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:13.460
And he, on a trip
to the Bay Area,

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.700
introduced Jeff to
Larry and Sergey.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.205
I think it was at Ram's house.

00:16:21.205 --> 00:16:22.370
It was on a weekend.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:26.170
And he was-- actually
Round A had closed.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:31.390
But Jeff was so impressed by
Larry and Sergey's-- what he

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.250
described as their stubbornness
about not putting ads

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.920
on the main page, that he
was immediately intrigued.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.370
And also, it's what
he's always done,

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.144
which is bet on the internet.

00:16:43.144 --> 00:16:44.560
I mean, that's
simplifying things,

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.230
but he's the guy that bet
the biggest on the internet.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.350
He pushed the most
chips on the table.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.680
He raised the most money
of any internet company--

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.450
I mean, over $2 billion in debt.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.034
It almost sank the company.

00:16:55.034 --> 00:16:56.450
I mean, he was
just-- and he talks

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.670
about long-term
orientation, and optimism.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.940
But you can kind of
reduce it to balls, right?

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.380
He just bet.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:10.000
And with the Google
prototype, he probably

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.589
saw this is a better
way to search.

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:15.300
And the way Ram describes
it, is the Round was closed.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.020
And Jeff said, I want in.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.290
I didn't get too deep into
the mechanics of that,

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:25.202
but Ram's working for
Jeff at the time, and now

00:17:25.202 --> 00:17:26.660
subsequently, and
reflecting on it,

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:31.830
is amazed at how Jeff kind of
knew just how far to push it.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.530
And in fact, the
Round was reopened.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.210
And Jeff was able to invest.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.600
And he won't say,
and likely nobody

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.070
knows, if he owns
any Google stock.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.600
I would imagine that he
probably sold it after the IPO.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.470
But it's one of those
quirks of history.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.090
And I think it's interesting
that you bring it up,

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.400
because I think it's
insightful about his character.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.775
PRESENTER: It's
fairly well known

00:17:52.775 --> 00:17:57.820
that Amazon doesn't
necessarily provide

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.244
too many perks to
their employees.

00:18:01.244 --> 00:18:02.660
Employees have to
pay for parking.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:09.640
They have to pay
for a lot of things,

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.460
compared to Google, which is
on the other end of spectrum

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:18.272
to that, where, because of our
philosophy around all of that,

00:18:18.272 --> 00:18:20.230
employees have a lot that
is provided for them.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:23.480
And obviously each one
of these strategies

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.350
works well for the company.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.170
But from your perspective,
having covered these companies

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.670
for so many years,
how do you see these?

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:34.040
How do you understand these
two wildly different--

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.700
BRAD STONE: Yeah,
that lavish cafeteria

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.949
that you guys have over there?

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.870
That does not exist at
Amazon's offices in Seattle.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.530
They have a cafeteria, but you
have to pay for everything.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:47.990
So very early on, Jeff read
Sam Walton's autobiography.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.650
And he, right away,
understood what

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:53.580
it takes to be a
discount retailer.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.587
Discount retailers-- which is
essentially what Amazon is.

00:18:56.587 --> 00:18:58.170
I mean, it has these
other businesses,

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.070
but they want to sell you a
product at the lowest price.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:05.330
And discount retailers are
built on low cost structures.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.320
You save pennies
in your operations

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.100
so you can charge less
than your competitor.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.630
And that's why scale matters.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:18.810
And that's why
other retailers are

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:20.820
tend to have those same
values of frugality.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.410
Jeff just extracted that
DNA outside of Walmart

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.620
and implanted it in Amazon.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:32.680
And so it is very frugal.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.780
They've taken it almost
to comical extremes.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.470
The prototypical example
are the door desks,

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.560
where they just spend the
minimum amount of money

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.615
to build a desk kit.

00:19:42.615 --> 00:19:46.930
And employees often assemble
their desks on their first day.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:53.220
And salaries aren't
above industry average.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:57.690
When they take a job
candidate out to lunch,

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.420
they can't expense that.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.400
When I would dine with
Amazon executives,

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.840
they would all-- in researching
the book-- they would all,

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.130
very theatrically, make
a point of tearing up

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.594
the receipt
afterwards, and saying,

00:20:09.594 --> 00:20:11.010
the company isn't
paying for this.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.110
I am.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.720
And they're actually,
in some ways,

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.140
modeling Jeff's own behavior.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.200
Because he does that.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.140
And it's tempting
to kind of think

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.370
of it as some kind of
character flaw of the company,

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.730
or a disadvantage, but it's a
value that they're proud of.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.340
It's posted on the website
in their corporate values.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.340
And it's because it
translates, in their business,

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.200
directly into the lower prices
and their customer focus.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.130
So without it, they
wouldn't be able to compete

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:42.332
as they do with the Walmarts
and the Targets of the world.

00:20:42.332 --> 00:20:44.290
PRESENTER: In your odyssey
in writing the book,

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:49.160
you went to search for
Jeff's biological father.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.202
And do you just want
to share whatever

00:20:52.202 --> 00:20:53.660
you're comfortable
with about this?

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.035
BRAD STONE: Oh,
yeah, absolutely.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.980
I, in telling the
Amazon story, of course,

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.100
I need to tell the
story of Jeff Bezos.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:08.770
And in reflecting on what
was known of his story,

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:14.490
it jumped out at me that, like
so many other iconic business

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.030
leaders, political
leaders, cultural leaders,

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.100
there are some sort of
interesting dynamics

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:24.740
to his early childhood, like
Steve Jobs, or Barack Obama,

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.350
or Bill Clinton.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:30.260
It's sort of
inexplicable, but he never

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.460
knew his biological father.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.620
His parents had him when
they were teenagers.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.650
And they were married,
but his biological father

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.472
left his wife when he was three.

00:21:40.472 --> 00:21:41.430
And he's admitted this.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:42.450
It was never a secret.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:43.960
And the name was known.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.180
And I thought that this
is sort of a missing

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.880
piece about the Amazon story.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.880
Who was this guy?

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:55.010
And did he-- in some way,
did the circumstances

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.560
of his childhood
lead him to be such

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.680
a unique and relentless figure?

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.622
He's an unusual person.

00:22:02.622 --> 00:22:03.830
So where does that come from?

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:08.510
So long story short, I decided
to try to find this guy.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:12.650
And the first thing I did
was, I was searching newspaper

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.620
archives in the
1960s in Albuquerque,

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.640
New Mexico, which is
where he was born.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.590
And I found, to my
utter astonishment,

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:23.770
that this guy was part
of a unicycle troupe

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:25.480
that traveled the country.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.900
And they were in
circuses, which,

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.420
if you remember the years
when Jeff was inseparable

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.830
with his Segway, was a
really bizarre coincidence.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.520
Like, was there some sort
of genetic predisposition

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.720
to wheeled vehicles?

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.650
I didn't know.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:46.020
So I found him running a bike
store outside of Phoenix.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.680
And I went to visit him.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.590
And it turned out,
to my surprise,

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:53.500
that he hadn't known
what happened to his son.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.580
He lost track of the family.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.760
Jeff's mom remarried.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.680
And they changed
their name to Bezos.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.930
And he had lost track, and
had spent his whole life

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.080
wondering what
happened to the kid

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.760
that he had when he
was 18 years old.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.790
And it was a remarkable story.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.850
It was extremely unexpected.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:15.620
And it is what it is.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.170
I never really was able
to draw any conclusions

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:22.530
about whether that really
had an impact on the leader

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:23.780
that he became.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:27.560
But I think if you're
someone like Jeff Bezos,

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.209
you've changed the
world in numerous ways.

00:23:30.209 --> 00:23:32.750
You've changed the way the world
shops, and the way the world

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.650
reads, and increasingly
the way startups are run.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.880
It's like people want to
know where you came from.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:42.230
And in a way, I felt like this
was a necessary story to tell.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:43.740
AUDIENCE: So I'm
curious to know.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.230
You've covered Jeff all
throughout his life,

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:49.080
or about every
period of his life.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.690
We hear stories
about Bill Gates,

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.890
and how he was the
first one in high school

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:53.956
to have a computer club.

00:23:53.956 --> 00:23:55.580
And that's how he
triggered his passion

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:01.020
for technology, and Steve Jobs,
and his search for perfection.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:05.950
What is it that drives Jeff
to be the character that he

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:09.900
is today-- very frugal,
very driven, very focused.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.930
Mentioned in a similar vein
as the biological father.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:14.355
But what--

00:24:14.355 --> 00:24:16.960
BRAD STONE: What
ultimately drives him?

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.760
AUDIENCE: And maybe what
historical event or what

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.340
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.210
BRAD STONE: Well, I think
there are a number of things.

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:24.770
I'll pick out a couple.

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:28.770
One is he was a huge
fan of "Star Trek," paid

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:31.600
a lot of attention to the
Apollo moon missions growing up,

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.560
and developed an extreme
passion for space.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.250
And in fact, when
he was valedictorian

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.970
of his high school
in Miami, his speech

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.320
was about creating
human colonies in space.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.680
And some of his friends
from high school

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.920
said that he always
wanted to be wealthy.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.170
He was always very driven.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.630
And the end goal
was always is to be

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.894
able to finance some kind of
space exploration, which sounds

00:24:56.894 --> 00:24:58.310
wacky, but he's
actually doing it.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:00.930
He's got another company
called Blue Origin, based

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:05.030
in the Seattle area, and
they're building rockets.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.300
Another technological
kind of inspiration

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.170
is-- so in the
prologue, when I'm

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:13.730
describing this old account
of his life in middle school,

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:16.640
he's a sixth grader, they have--
very much like Bill Gates.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.080
They've got a computer, like
a teletype computer, donated

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.400
by a local company.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.470
And he is leading the
group of sixth graders

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.060
in playing with this
computer, like clearly,

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.360
for so many of that generation,
a very formative experience.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.030
But in terms of what
drives him today--

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.910
I think what he would say
is building an enduring

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:39.580
company, an enduring
customer-focused company.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.540
And maybe what his
critics would say

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.020
is it's being the last man
standing, and the smartest

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.156
guy in the room, and
out-witting rivals.

00:25:48.156 --> 00:25:49.530
And look, he's
competitive, also,

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:53.007
so I think it's a combination
of those two things.

00:25:53.007 --> 00:25:54.590
AUDIENCE: If someone
walked up to you,

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:57.280
and wasn't familiar with the
company, and they said, hey,

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.150
Brad.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:00.170
Amazon-- what do they do?

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:03.180
What is your response to that?

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.330
BRAD STONE: Amazon is in the
business of value of selling

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:10.470
everything, from physical
goods-- all the way from books,

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:18.360
to furniture, lawn chairs,
and huge two-ton safes--

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:23.290
to digital products, from
digital music, and eBooks,

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:26.600
to streaming video, to
things that we don't even

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.120
think of as products to be
sold-- enterprise services,

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.960
storage and compute cycles.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.020
So it's really, in
some ways, like this

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.210
the extreme distributor
on steroids, or retailer

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.850
that's in the business
of selling its customers

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.090
everything and
anything, and doing so

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:49.000
at extremely
competitive low prices.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.842
And using the momentum
of its business,

00:26:51.842 --> 00:26:53.300
and all the cash
that it generates,

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.540
to just relentlessly expand.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.460
I think that's another
key point that I

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.350
would try to get into
that explanation.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.440
This is a company
on the move, that it

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.890
is going blob-like in almost
every conceivable direction.

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.730
It's pretty amazing--
international expansion,

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:10.820
product categories.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.770
They just started selling art.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.710
They're selling apparel.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:19.320
The devices-- obviously, as you
guys know, not just the Kindle

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:24.050
and Kindle Fire tablets, but
maybe soon the set-top box,

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:28.150
maybe soon a phone-- all, of
course, with the help of Google

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:31.080
and it's open-source
Android operating system.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.230
So a restless
company, and one that,

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.120
even though it might
take on new forms,

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:41.880
will still ultimately be in
the business of selling things.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.960
AUDIENCE: How do you compare him
to other past American business

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.556
leaders, like Henry
Ford and others?

00:27:48.556 --> 00:27:50.347
What are some of the
similar-- I'm not sure

00:27:50.347 --> 00:27:51.830
if you've looked
at similarities.

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.450
And obviously the
world is different,

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:56.360
so you have to kind of-- but
what things are similar today?

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.810
And what are very different?

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.330
BRAD STONE: I think the
points of comparison

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:04.614
that I would be most qualified
to make-- because I haven't

00:28:04.614 --> 00:28:06.030
done a lot of
historical research,

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:09.220
but I've covered
technology for 15 years.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.210
He's just cut from
the same cloth,

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:15.800
I think, as Steve Jobs,
Bill Gates, Andy Grove,

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.500
maybe occasionally
Larry and Sergey,

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:23.910
in having not just this
relentless drive, but extremely

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:27.520
high standards, occasional
impatience with the people

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.870
around them who are not
meeting their high standards,

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.290
and creative ways of
expressing that impatience.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:36.740
And a willingness
to just think big.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.770
And that's obviously what's
happening here at Google.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:43.360
And although I would
say it's interesting,

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.950
Amazon's moon shots
are sort of all

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:51.460
in the purview of kind of Jeff's
own independent activities--

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.890
and so, of course, Blue Origin,
and the Clock of the Long Now.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:58.550
And he recently went and bought
the Washington Post company--

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:05.100
so very much like that small
handful of technology leaders,

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.640
in a lot of similarities.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.410
It can be uncomfortable to
work with him, to work for him.

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.800
But it's probably why
Amazon is so successful.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.290
Because he's never allowed
anyone to rest on their laurels

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:19.920
or to treat Amazon
like a country club.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.710
You don't coast at Amazon.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.347
They're working
pretty hard up there.

00:29:25.347 --> 00:29:27.680
AUDIENCE: So you've used the
word relentless many times.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.980
And I've heard that
word used before.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.770
But you also used a
phrase that really

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:33.360
caught my attention,
which is a refusal

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.105
to blink in the face of
naysayers, basically.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.600
Have you found any point at
which that began to emerge?

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.330
Was that when he
was a sixth-grader?

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.095
Or was it earlier or later?

00:29:48.095 --> 00:29:49.870
It's a very admirable
trait to me.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:52.355
BRAD STONE: I think it really
took a while to emerge.

00:29:52.355 --> 00:29:54.820
I think, in the very
early years of Amazon,

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.520
he was much more receptive
to input from the outside,

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.730
a lot less sure on his feet.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.300
In fact, in 1999,
he sort of allows

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.870
his board to appoint a COO.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:10.590
It's this one ten-month
experiment in Amazon's history

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.250
that does not work out.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.550
And I tell that story
in the book, too.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.490
And maybe as a result of that
experience, and the result

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:21.490
of this moment-- when the world
does not believe in Amazon,

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.000
and a lot of his
senior teams leave--

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.960
he refuses to give any ground.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.300
And he says we're
still on this mission.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.830
And he still is thinking
aggressively about expansion.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.890
In the midst of the
decline, the crash

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:41.290
in Amazon stock, the second
or third Harry Potter book

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:42.310
comes out.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:44.740
And he-- which is
sort of interesting.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.140
In a weird way, Harry Potter
might have saved Amazon.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.970
It was very fortuitous.

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:52.150
Because there was such
unusual demand for that book.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.127
But Amazon's
finances are a mess.

00:30:54.127 --> 00:30:55.710
They're driving
towards profitability.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.820
And he basically
says we're going

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:02.782
to deliver this book on the
Saturday that it comes out.

00:31:02.782 --> 00:31:04.240
And we're not going
to charge any--

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.730
we're going to give everyone
free two-day shipping.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.070
And we're not going to
charge extra for it.

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:13.570
And his CFO at the time,
Warren Jenson, who I spoke to,

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:16.400
doesn't admit to
losing hair over that.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.260
But he's bald.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.920
So I'll just say that.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.620
But it's crazy.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:21.210
It's crazy.

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:26.030
But he is extremely
customer-focused-- realizes

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.790
that it'll engender
a lot a loyalty

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.840
and some kind of
magical experiences

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.890
for the Harry Potter fans.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:34.270
And that it's-- even
more kind of strategic--

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:36.100
that it's incredible
branding opportunity.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.266
And the thing I did is, as
I was writing about that,

00:31:38.266 --> 00:31:42.060
is I used LexisNexis to go find
out how many clips Amazon got,

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.990
how many media mentions.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:45.292
And it was like hundreds.

00:31:45.292 --> 00:31:46.250
Maybe it was thousands.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:49.290
I can't remember
what the number is.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.120
And in fact, his
colleagues at the time--

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.230
there is a quote in the
book along the lines of,

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.980
he has ice water running
through his veins.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:01.630
And maybe I'm sounding
overly sycophantic right now.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:04.330
And there are plenty
of reasons to criticize

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:08.780
Amazon, particularly for its
behavior toward smaller rivals

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.050
and sometimes partners.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:13.410
But it's an incredible moment
in Amazon's history, where

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.310
he just stands his
ground, and says,

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:19.470
we're going to delight
our customers right now.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.440
And we'll make the
finances work later.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.560
And he did.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.080
AUDIENCE: So you've
said a few times

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:30.202
how he's very relentless,
but also very focused,

00:32:30.202 --> 00:32:32.410
and doesn't really have fear
in his eyes or anything.

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:36.060
But I did want to ask
you, if you look ahead

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:40.110
towards the future a little
bit, where would Jeff be afraid?

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:41.310
Who would he be afraid of?

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:44.240
Because in the retail space,
there's a giant like Walmart.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.430
In the internet space,
there's a giant like Google.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:49.250
In the device space,
there's a giant like Apple.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.660
Or is it the thing that is yet
to come that he's afraid of?

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:56.792
So what would Jeff be
worried about or afraid of?

00:32:56.792 --> 00:32:58.875
Even though he has ice in
his veins, like you say,

00:32:58.875 --> 00:33:00.370
he's still human.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:02.560
So what do you
think it would be?

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.660
And why?

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.325
Why would he be afraid of that?

00:33:06.325 --> 00:33:09.150
BRAD STONE: Well, of course I
can't-- and I wouldn't presume

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:10.400
to-- speak for him.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.550
And I know what he would
say, if we asked him

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:15.800
that, which is that he would say
that Amazon is customer-focused

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.100
and not competitor-focused.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.980
So they pay attention
to what customers do,

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.580
but it's not where they
put their attention.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.801
And frankly, I'm not sure
I completely buy that.

00:33:24.801 --> 00:33:26.800
Because there are plenty
of examples in Amazon's

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.840
history where they
clearly fear an upstart.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.020
And the Zappos story,
which I told in the book

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.250
is a great example.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:36.450
And the diapers.com story
is another good example,

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:41.250
where these e-commerce companies
achieve breakaway velocity.

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:44.590
In the case of Zappos,
with a very flexible brand

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:46.890
and a great customer experience.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:51.280
So in those cases, I think they
started to really pay attention

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.000
to companies that were kind
that out-Amazoning Amazon

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.120
in other product categories--
in shoes for Zappos,

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.410
in diapers and other household
goods where Amazon wasn't

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:02.890
so strong at the time.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:06.450
So I think the general
point is he's probably

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.550
most scared of other
business operators who

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:14.670
think like he does, who
want to inspire loyalty,

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:17.940
and are kind of, in some ways,
willing to spend recklessly.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.460
Zappos was a
billion-dollar company,

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.000
but it wasn't all
that profitable.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.219
Because customers were
buying 10 pairs of shoes

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:24.639
and sending back nine.

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:28.070
Tony Hsieh was as
nuts as Jeff is.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:32.340
And then, more recently,
I think-- clearly they

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.800
are very-- I'm not
going to say worried.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:41.010
But Apple and Google loom
very large on their radar.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:43.730
And we're seeing a lot
of that manifest itself

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:46.300
in the new Kindle Fire
tablets and their strategy

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.409
with Android.

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:50.429
I have a quote in the book
that Tim O'Reilly relayed

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:52.820
to me, which is
Jeff saying to him,

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.630
we don't have many
big advantages.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:58.260
So we have to weave together
a rope of smaller advantages.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.890
And he was saying
that in the context

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:02.040
of the one-click
patent, and why Amazon

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.560
was asserting this patent--
even though I think

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.570
Jeff will probably readily
agree that the patent

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:08.800
system is broken.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.820
But I think that's
what he's doing today

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.840
with all of Amazon's digital
services and hardware,

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.710
where you see them take IMDB,
this asset that they've owned

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:21.410
for so long, and draw some of
the metadata about TV shows

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:24.300
and movies into the
Kindle Fire tablet.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.620
And you just see
him-- and Prime is

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.600
kind of the linchpin of
this strategy-- of bringing

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.500
in elements from all corners of
the organization-- advertising

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.710
is another one-- to kind
of subsidize these devices,

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:39.330
lower their price, make them
more appealing competitors

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:43.510
to the Nexus tablets
or the iPads.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:48.130
And I think he clearly
realizes that a big large part

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:52.110
of this battle,
particularly around media,

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:56.510
is going to be fought and
won between Apple, Google,

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:59.520
Amazon, or perhaps other members
of the Android ecosystem.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.880
So I would say that's
probably the biggest

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.232
competitive challenge
to Amazon right now.

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:09.205
AUDIENCE: So how do you think
this book has been received

00:36:09.205 --> 00:36:12.880
at Amazon by the folks you
spoke to and by folks maybe you

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.937
didn't?

00:36:13.937 --> 00:36:15.520
And were there any
issues that came up

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.012
as you were compiling
drafts of this,

00:36:18.012 --> 00:36:19.270
if you can speak about them?

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:20.240
BRAD STONE: Sure.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.920
I don't have a lot of insight
into how it's been received.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.880
And I didn't expect a lot of
feedback, at least right away.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.240
I think it's, as I said
at the very beginning,

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.070
it's a company that doesn't
invite this kind of scrutiny.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.590
And I think they
participated, to an extent,

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:37.210
to ensure that their
viewpoint was known.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:42.500
But the first thing you're
going to hear from any Amazon

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.770
spokesperson is "no comment."

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:49.880
And sometimes it's almost a
joke among the press corps.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:54.500
And because, again, they're
primarily in retail.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.210
And it's an area
where margins are low.

00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:59.500
And insight is your
competitive weapon.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.220
And you can be copied
quickly by rivals.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.910
So they genetically
keep to themselves.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:08.690
And I've heard some stuff.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:11.210
I've heard from some Amazon
folks, current and former,

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:13.790
that said, you got
the story right.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:16.520
And to be honest,
I've heard some folks

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:20.030
who felt like there were
corners of the account that

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.380
were overly tough.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:25.320
And, from my perspective, that's
kind of what you want to hear.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.037
Of course I'm curious to
know what, ultimately, Jeff

00:37:29.037 --> 00:37:29.620
thought of it.

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:33.112
And I'm not sure
I'll ever find out

00:37:33.112 --> 00:37:35.570
AUDIENCE: So you spoke to, I
guess, a few people at Amazon,

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:36.819
and you have been researching.

00:37:36.819 --> 00:37:42.170
So how much do you think
Amazon is Bezos-dependent?

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:46.640
And if, let's say, he were
to focus on another venture,

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.620
and appoint someone
else in his place,

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:54.160
how do you think Amazon would
change or not change at all?

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.460
How much of his
philosophy has he

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:59.910
ingrained in people there now?

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.890
BRAD STONE: Very good question.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:05.490
I think, particularly if
you're an Amazon shareholder,

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:07.290
that's probably
your biggest worry.

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.130
And it's not a short-term worry.

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:12.170
But Jeff's about to
turn 50 in January.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:14.220
But it's a long-term worry.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.090
The company is
now so diversified

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:20.980
that I'm not sure there's
anyone as versatile

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.220
as he is to run it.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.250
But to your second
point, there are

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.490
executives at Amazon that
have been by his side

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:31.620
for many years, that think like
he does, that exhibit a lot

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:35.370
of his mannerisms, that are
very familiar with the business.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:39.300
And that's Jeff Wilke, who runs
the North American consumer

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.580
businesses; and Andy
Jassy; who runs Amazon Web

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:47.220
Services; and Diego Piacentini,
who came from Apple,

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.520
and runs the international
businesses at Amazon.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.720
I mean even though there
is a lot of turnover

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.580
in the lower and
middle ranks of Amazon,

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:58.280
the upper ranks have
remained relatively stable

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.890
since the period I referred
to during the dot-com bust,

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:05.050
when there was major churn.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.160
But Jeff's a
singular individual.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.920
And in a lot of
ways, the company

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.710
is tailored to how he thinks.

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:14.230
So you guys probably know that
meetings are started at Amazon

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.760
by reading six-page
documents called narratives.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.310
And that's because
that is how he

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:21.980
prefers to digest information.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:24.830
He's kind of trained everyone
around him, the entire company,

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:26.580
to do that as well.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.500
But it really is
tailored toward him.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.370
And I describe it,
in the last chapter

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:34.630
of the book, the company as
a series of chess boards,

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.490
all perfectly
aligned, so that he

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:40.720
can play as many games
as possible at once.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.380
So when you lose
your chess master,

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.490
your grandmaster
has to be replaced.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:46.830
And as we've seen at
Apple, another company that

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:50.350
was kind of tailored towards one
individual and how he thinks,

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:53.570
the transition is never easy.

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:55.380
AUDIENCE: The question
around the future

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.880
you mentioned, after
a couple decades,

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.530
Jeff said it's too
early to tell the story.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:04.010
Is there any way you can
project out in the future

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:06.800
and paint a picture about what
that second half of the story

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.540
might look like?

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.373
Where they're going?

00:40:08.373 --> 00:40:10.582
What his biggest Moonshot
ambitions are, for example?

00:40:10.582 --> 00:40:11.956
BRAD STONE: Well,
first all, I'll

00:40:11.956 --> 00:40:13.820
say that I don't
think it is too early.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:19.210
I just think that's what he says
to kind of keep authors at bay.

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:24.090
It's a convenient sort
of trope, and sort

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.920
of like a stiff arm
to anybody that's

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.390
trying to get too
close to the company.

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:31.480
But what does the future hold?

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:35.867
I mean, I think the
goal is Walmart scale,

00:40:35.867 --> 00:40:37.200
in terms of the retail business.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.270
So, actually, I'm
not even sure what

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.250
Walmart's revenues
were last year.

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:44.120
But let's say it's $300
billion, and Amazon's on track

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.050
to make $75 billion this year.

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:47.820
So they still have
a long way to go.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:49.460
There's a lot of
international markets

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.670
where Amazon has
very little presence.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:55.110
And in some regions
of the world,

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:58.620
it's because the shipping
infrastructure is immature.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.580
And credit card
processing is immature.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.496
And the Amazon model
doesn't scale there.

00:41:03.496 --> 00:41:05.340
And then there are other
parts of the world,

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:09.060
I think Mexico and
India, and maybe Brazil,

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:12.790
where they've chosen to use
the Kindle business as a Trojan

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:15.810
horse, and start their eBook--
and maybe, in some cases,

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.360
their digital
businesses-- there.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.690
So they're expanding.

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:21.170
So I think, at one point,
the answer to your question

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:26.680
is Amazon is a global business
with a Walmart-like footprint.

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.620
And as to other parts
of the business,

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.230
like digital, I
just think there's

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.390
no limit to the ambition.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:33.660
So it'll be phones.

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:34.540
It'll be tablets.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.320
It'll be set-top boxes.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.910
It might be Amazon
Glass, at some point.

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:41.630
They'll probably call
it something else.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:44.990
But when you think
about it, for Jeff,

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:48.030
customers walking into a
store with their glasses,

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:51.600
and seeing the Amazon price
on every product-- that's

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.010
pretty scary, now
that I think about it.

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:58.270
But he's expansive
in his vision,

00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:59.470
and loves the technology.

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:02.960
And so I'm sure he sees
a lot of opportunity

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.770
probably almost everywhere, but
particularly in the hardware

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:09.620
business and in Amazon's Lab126
operations here in Silicon

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:10.499
Valley.

00:42:10.499 --> 00:42:11.290
PRESENTER: Awesome.

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:12.880
Thank you, guys.
