00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.180
&gt;&gt;So the question is, how can I help?
That's a great question.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.300
And what we've done with the Young Global
Leaders, Global Resign

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:14.040
Initiative Task Force is that we have 32 initiatives
that we're trying

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.680
to gain momentum here at Davos.
And you go to our website and look at it,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.119
a redesignourworld.com,
redesignourworld.com.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.470
And there are so many different great ideas
that the Y-GELS have come

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.600
up with, within values, within health, sustainable
economies,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.980
strengthening economies, governance.
So please check out the website.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.570
I think there's many things that you can do
on the local level

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.570
depending on your skills, your interests,
your passion.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.629
The most important thing I think is your passion,
what you really want

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.429
to see getting done in the world.
So good luck and thank you for your contribution.
