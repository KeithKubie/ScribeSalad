00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.830
China wants to mine the moon for a rare element
to use in nuclear fusion but doing so may

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.649
violate international law.

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:14.930
Somehow everything I just said is real and
not the backstory of Fallout 4.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.340
Hello again space cadets, Julian here for
DNews.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.260
To reiterate, because I cannot stress enough
that this is real, China is seriously considering

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.509
mining the moon.

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.099
But not for anything so worthless as gold
or platinum.

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.089
No no, for a rare isotope of helium called
helium 3.

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:35.390
Helium 3 is different than 99.999% of helium
on Earth, helium 4.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.290
Helium 3’s nucleus consists of 2 protons
and one neutron, and it’s theorized that

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.510
it can be used for clean nuclear fusion.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.790
However helium 3 hasn’t been given much
attention because it’s extremely rare and

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.790
expensive.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.970
Currently Helium 3 is sold for about $1,000
per gram, or a billion dollars per metric

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.970
ton.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.650
By comparison at today’s prices platinum
sells for a piddling 39.7 million dollars

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.870
per metric ton.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.850
Helium 3 may be rare here on earth, but it’s
not on the moon.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.360
Or at least it’s much less so.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.460
Helium 3 is in the solar wind that gets deflected
away by our magnetosphere, but the moon has

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.310
no magnetic field and so Helium 3 has slowly
been deposited on its surface over billions

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.310
of years.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.010
While it’s estimated the Earth only has
15 tons of the stuff total, the moon may have

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.500
between 1 and 5 million tons.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.370
That still means that hundreds of millions
of tons of lunar soil will have to be processed

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.740
just to get one ton of helium 3.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.640
So is all this just lunacy?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.730
Well right now, pretty much, yeah.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.040
But China isn’t planning on doing it right
this second.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.330
It’s all the dream of Ouyang Ziyuan of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, and he’s shooting

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.440
for the moon in the next 50 years.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.260
Which is probably a good time frame, because
as of right now, even if we could mine and

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.530
ship Helium 3 from the moon on a large scale,
we wouldn’t be able to use it.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.780
Fusing helium 3 would require much more initial
energy than fusing hydrogen isotopes, so while

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.939
it may produce power without a radioactive
byproduct, it’s still expected to be used

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.110
in the second generation of fusion reactors.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.270
And we still haven’t gotten to the first.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.950
But if Helium 3 can be used it will yield
hundreds of times more energy than it costs

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.759
to mine and ship; only 40 tons of it can meet
the US’s energy demands for a year.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.530
There’s also the question of who owns the
moon.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.190
Personally I think if your flag is on it,
you have dibs, but apparently that’s not

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.240
how it works.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.560
There’s actually a treaty from 1967, called
the “Treaty on Principles Governing the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.790
Activities of States in the Exploration and
Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.190
Other Celestial Bodies” but all it’s friends
call it the Outer Space treaty.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.390
It’s been ratified by 102 countries, including
China, and in it, it states “the exploration

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.230
and use of outer space shall be carried out
for the benefit of all countries and shall

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.470
be the province of all mankind.”

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.110
Whether this means no one owns the moon or
that everyone owns the moon is debated by

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.880
space lawyers, and yes, apparently that is
an actual profession.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.820
But China is starting to put feelers out,
with the Chang’e 5 planned to land on the

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.410
moon and return with samples by 2017.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.099
If Helium 3 can be used for nuclear fusion,
and if sending missions to the moon and extracting

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.660
it is economically viable, and if the international
community agrees to it, then maybe one day

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.870
mining the earth for coal will sound as ridiculous
as mining the moon does now.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.350
Space is one of my favorite topics but there’s
a lot of junk information floating around

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.350
out there.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.459
Our own Amy Shira Teitel debunks 5 space myths
in Life Noggin’s video over here.

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.520
Do you have a favorite idea that sounds totally
sci-fi but could actually become reality?

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.349
Let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
