00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.100
I expect that no one of you found every one of these defects.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.650
But that, the class as a whole noticed most or all of these problems.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.570
I also expect that some of you have noticed problems that are not on the list.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.110
The point is that groups do better than individuals.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.309
This is sometimes called the many eyes phenomenon.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.940
There's a cost, however.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.190
If 200 people each look at 13 lines of code for

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.360
15 minutes, this amounts to more than one week of staff time.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.180
At current loaded salary rates, this might cost a company thousands of dollars.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.050
Is it worth it to a company to spend that much money to find these problems?

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.730
Would a smaller group size have worked just as well?

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.140
Would more time per person have worked better?

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.960
Notice also that there were all kinds of defects.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.400
I intentionally didn't tell you in advance what the word defect meant,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.740
but here there were bugs.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.870
There were documentation issues.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.860
There were inefficiencies, and there were even violations of coding standards.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.370
Software engineers have studied defect detection and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.700
concluded that team review efforts can be cost effective way to find defects.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.500
However, the reviews must be done in a systematic fashion.
