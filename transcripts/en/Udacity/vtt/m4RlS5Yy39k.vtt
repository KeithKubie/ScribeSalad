00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.510
Alright, I'm slightly less overwhelmed now.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:03.690
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.200
&gt;&gt; Let's fill the app. I'm guessing I do that

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.840
by, is it the big green button that says Add App?

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.970
&gt;&gt; You're so smart Andy.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:10.790
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Sam.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.680
&gt;&gt; Kay, so, what's the name of our app? What should we call it?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.820
&gt;&gt; What are we trying to track?

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.550
&gt;&gt; Festivals?

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.340
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.380
&gt;&gt; Check out Festival App. Okay?

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.240
&gt;&gt; That works. What's the main type

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.444
of data you need to track? That's festival

00:00:22.444 --> 00:00:23.367
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:25.930
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And you can see this little preview down there

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.120
of what it's actually going to look like once it creates it.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, has me do the plurals. Doesn't figure

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.800
out the S by itself, but I guess that's acceptable.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.860
&gt;&gt; Language is complicated.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.030
&gt;&gt; Right, right. Create.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.560
&gt;&gt; And so what this is going to do is

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.720
create a couple other things for us. It's created that

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.230
festival object, which we'll go a little bit into

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.540
what that is, to be able to store festival data.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.230
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.740
&gt;&gt; Then, it creates a permission set.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.820
So if this were say a private thing that we

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.690
were trying to create, we could add some security around it.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.010
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.380
&gt;&gt; And it also adds a few other tabs into our application

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.680
so that we can do some other useful things besides just track festivals.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.710
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.610
&gt;&gt; So, why don't you click into, go into the app.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.170
&gt;&gt; Okay. Alright.
