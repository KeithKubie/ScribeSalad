00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It turns out that standard deviation of distribution is not dependent on the sample,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so whether you throw a coin 100 times or a 1000 times when you graph the outcomes

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the standard deviation is not affected by the sample size but the confidence interval is.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That's a really important difference.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If there's one thing you want to take home from this class that is that as you get more data as a statistician,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
your confidence increases--so your confidence interval shrinks,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
whereas of course more data doesn't change the standard deviation.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In fact, if the standard deviation is σ, then the confidence interval is effectively 1/√Nσ.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This is proportional, depends on number of other factors. There could be a constant in front of it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But there is an interesting relationship.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
As you get more data, the standard deviation will become more accurate,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but it's not going to change that much.

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Your confidence will shrink, and we're going to look into this a more detail.
