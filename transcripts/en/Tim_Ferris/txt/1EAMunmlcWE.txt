Speaker 1:          00:08          Oh, hi, I didn't see you there. Sorry. I brought the Burt Reynolds play real close up. Tim Ferriss, we're going to show you an exercise that is called cathedral and it is very useful for handstand practice or any type of inversion practice and engaging the musculature. That will be very important for anything more advanced. There are different ways to practice handstands and of course one of the limiting factors for a lot of people is the risks. The risks will get really grumpy, the forums will get a really lit up, the elbows would get really lit up. So how do you practice more? How do you add volume without destroying these joints? Uh, especially as a novice, there are few ways you can go about doing it. Some people will do, they'll do posts like this where they'll actually post on their forearms. Other people will use something called a feed up or a shoulder stand up, basically looks like a padded toilet seat and they stick their head through so that they can place the weight on their shoulders and then perform exercises.

Speaker 1:          01:01          But what if you don't have any of this equipment? Well, it turns out you can use a partner for a very simple exercise, relatively simple and there's a progression. So Kipling, my good friend here, uh, at Kipling, Kip, l I n n on Instagram and everywhere else is going to demonstrate what this looks like and in effect I'm just supporting her in a shoulder stand and I'll give some commentary as we go through. All right, so like, so now as I place my hands on basically taking the, the palms and putting them to the point where they feel like they're going to slip, but just before my hands are very widely open, like so. And you'll elicit that Kipling's given me a little bit of weight so that I can make sure they're not going to totally slip. I do have a little bit of chocolate, my hands too.

Speaker 1:          01:49          Okay. From here? Yeah, she's putting her hands on my thighs stepping up, my arms are straight. I'm pushing a bit with the fingertips and then she's going to do a progression straddle and then you can do any number of different things. Okay. So that would be from pipe position. If she did a Tuck, that'd be a little bit easier. And then you can also do straddle work. So there are many different ways to work in this position to get more mileage without totally destroying your joints. If you're putting all of your weight. And then you can do things like this, which I can't do, but sometimes flexi flyers can get it done. Okay. All right. And the way this translates that position that we just did is you want to do bird to shoulder, stand to helicopter. So the way that translates as a base, you're developing the skill to do stuff like this.

Speaker 1:          03:10          Okay? So this is the beginner's version. Uh, and then if we wanted to do the free standing version, looks like that. And then you can do all sorts of cool things. Like we'd come up and rotate helicopter and we can even go through it the second time. Like so there you have it. If you enjoyed that video, let's talk about a list. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Foxx, undisputed King of Big Wave Surfing. Laird Hamilton. The list goes on and on. What do they have in common?
